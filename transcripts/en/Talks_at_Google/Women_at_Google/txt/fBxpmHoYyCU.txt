Speaker 1:          00:10          Thank you so much. It's funny that like nobody sat in the front row but then you guys just became the front row because your one back we had isn't it? I mean, no, I really white weird room. I feel like I'm a unlike lights. I wouldn't say cozy, but I would say thank you so much for giving up your time and coming to hear us chatting. We would do well to have like a little fireplace here or yes, a comedically oversized fish tank and maybe drinks. Yeah, well yeah that happened. Um, okay. Great. Thanks so much for joining us today. Of course your book is amazing. Everybody should read it. It's fantastic. Yeah. But I want to talk with you a little bit about your home life and where you came from, I'm sure. So you've made the rounds from a comedian to an actress to a writer and you write a lot.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Like if something doesn't work out then I just, you write a lot in your book about your home life and cove and how that's, so can you tell the audience a little bit about where you come from and what your family's like? Yeah. So I'm from a place in Ireland called cove. I, is there any other Irish people here today? Oh you. Oh my God, that's cool. So you Nicole. So it's like down, uh, down south and it's um, it's actually big emigration town, which I've been thinking about recently cause it like relates to my work here because I grew up from where ane where everybody left from like a million people left from cove. This is a long time ago. It's like during the famine, which is now over. Obviously we're fine. Um, I'm actually really full. Um, but I grew up there. I'm one of eight children, which is maybe a little bit more than the norm.

Speaker 1:          01:57          I would say. Like, we still have big families in Ireland, but age is the last and very happy childhood. And uh, but I do think that's where like my obsession with immigration started because we learned about it as in school all the time, even to like inappropriate levels where like I remember learning about like maritime tragedies of like the boats leaving cove and crashing. And then there's the one local historian came into us and said, um, the people will be clinging onto the side of the boats and the other people we'll be chopping their hands off. And I was like, maybe seven and I don't know that that's ever been verified. Like anyway, so always in my mind it was like, oh, I'm from this place where people leave from. Um, and so I write a bit about that and the raised bed, Annie Moore, who has been thinking about these days so much because she's the first immigrants through the gates of Ellis Island.

Speaker 1:          02:51          She left from my hometown of cove in like 1890. It was like the hundred and 50th anniversary. I can't really do the, it was like 18 eight or something. I think is that right? 150 and I don't know. Anyway, it was like 150 years ago and she was an unaccompanied minor. She was 17 years old. She left with her two baby brothers. So three unaccompanied kids coming across, no documents, no passport, no visa, nothing. And they were welcomed in and they were reunited with their parents who have come here years earlier to like make, you know, get an apartment and like start to make a living. They lived on the lower east side's for the rest of their lives. And like I just think how different it was for them compared to what's happening to kids today and just all the various, you know, issues of race and stuff around that. Yeah. You also lived in Zimbabwe as a child. I did live in Zimbabwe. Yeah. So Annie Zimbabweans here? No. What are you nodding your head?

Speaker 2:          03:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:52          Like you're, you are. Oh, you're like as if there'd be Zimbabweans here. Right. True. Very true. So much easier for white immigrants from me or I have to get here than it is from black immigrants from Zimbabwe. In fact, I, uh, yeah, I have a friend at the moment who's trying to get the old one visa, which is the one I'm on, which is the alien of extraordinary ability. He, he's like a one, this big film festival in Zimbabwe. Two years ago I was on a hidden camera show in Ireland. Like, so anyway, he technically is probably more extraordinary than I am. I'm bullish. It's proving a lot more difficult. And uh, so anyway, we lived in [inaudible] bad way. The whole family went and lived there for two years. My Dad was in construction, he was building a hotel over there and, and I think that was a really valuable experience for me just from, if any of you have kids. I don't have any kids, but I know of, it's like a terrible dope. Um, she's shaking her head. You're like a Google executive would never say it that you, Kelly and I were talking earlier and she normally has to interview Google executive or not Google executives, executives center lane. Um, none of who am I hope watch this. No. But I mean, they're great, but I mean, they wouldn't make terrible jokes. They're better. It's better. They wouldn't be like, oh no, I'm a good speller. Nor in like that dumb voice. I think that's lovely.

Speaker 1:          05:28          But anyway, what I was going to say, it's like if you do have kids, I really think it's cool too, like if you can at all. And it's a hugely privileged thing to be able to do, to move country, have them live somewhere else when they're small so that they can understand they're not the center of the world's them and everyone who looks like them. Because in Ireland everyone is very, um, I mean like, look, you can make a few sisters. And so it's really, it was a great thing for me to go away and see like, oh, here's this, all these other ways of living basically.

Speaker 3:          06:01          Yeah. And you write about growing up in a family where humor was prized above all else. Um, so how did that affect you as a child? Can you tell the audience about your family and,

Speaker 1:          06:10          yeah, I mean I think, I don't know if it's like a big family thing if it's an Irish thing, but certainly being funny in my family was, you know, Norman carriage if you're athletic or clever or being funny was like the thing that that was, you know, um, and it wasn't just like Nice, funny, you know, often there's like an edge to humor and that's definitely the way my family is where you kind of sit around the table and you're going a little bit scared and then it like starts and um, it's tough, but it's like you show your affection for people by like bullying them.

Speaker 3:          06:49          I grew up in the same kind of family and I'm curious if that's the experience of a lot of other Irish people in the audience.

Speaker 1:          06:55          I mean, everyone's too nervous to put their hands up because they've been bullied.

Speaker 3:          07:01          Amazing.

Speaker 1:          07:03          How many are in your family? Oh, it's small just to, but I've got loads of cousins, like, yes. Yeah, I would definitely kind of cousins and even our ads and my aunts still gives me a really hard time and yeah, it's just never ending. But I mean I think that's good if you end up working as the comedian the way I did, but also I would say at least two of my six sisters are funnier than I am. Like Rosie, my sister who still lives in [inaudible] four, we grew up and she's a beautician and Kohl's and she is like festivals, who knows all the 10 secrets because she does all their waxing and you know, and then and eyebrows and everything. And then she's really good. Impressiveness and she's just like so sharp and funny, but she doesn't have like a compulsion to show off about us like some of us do.

Speaker 1:          07:51          When did you realize that being funny was your superpower? Oh, well, I'm not being self deprecating when I say I'm not good at anything else. Like I'm good at racing and I'm good at being funny and doing those two things together. But I didn't realize the writing thing until about like five years ago. Um, and I still need a lot of outsides. Um, you know what, like proof of that. Like, no, I'm like I write for the New York Times that has to be mean something, you know, validation. But with being funny, I was always like, I'm funny, even though in school and everything I was quiet, but like I was like the kind of a judgmental outside everyone. And also I think being female it's harder to be overtly, like I'm the funniest one in the room. You're more sly about us. Um, so that's, that's kind of what I always have known.

Speaker 1:          08:47          Yeah, well it's used to great effect. So, um, thank your writing has been compared to if David Sedaris and Tina Fey had a daughter, which I think is, I mean that's what's on the cover of the book. You know, it's not beautiful, but it's also don't you think it's kind of grotesque because Tina Fey and David Sedaris wouldn't have a daughter also. Like obviously David Sedaris is a gay man and wouldn't have, you know, a change with a straight woman and she is not that much older than me. If you could update it to the fan fiction who you would like to have a daughter? No, I'd love them to be my parents or, but I just think in, in, in the natural order of things, it would be highly unusual to have a 13 year old mother and a kind of an older gay man be my be my parents, I guess. I see where you're coming from. Do you know what I mean? But it's, you know, Glamour magazine said it and then we were all really happy because it's like hard to get good quotes. So we were like, yeah, put it up there. So who do you look to for writing inspiration for writing inspiration? I mean, I definitely, I tend to read lots of nonfiction books about war. Um, so, but for funny writing,

Speaker 4:          10:01          mmm.

Speaker 1:          10:03          I do love David Sedaris, actually daddy and um, uh, God, well, I'm interested in hearing about the war bucks as well. Do they influence? Yeah, I don't know that they did it. They influence my writing. I mean, like I certainly, I write here about what they went to Iraq and I did a workshop in Iraq and I definitely didn't want to be one of those people who come from the west and like land there and spend a few weeks there and you know, go on about like, oh, the sound of the mosque, you know, in the early morning or you know, the usual crap that like, I feel like white western people right when they go anywhere there, you know, or they're like, actually the people were friendly, you know, this is kind of, I hate that. Yeah. So maybe it was helpful to me that I do read it, you know? Um, there's a really, I think like my favorite book of the last year, it's called like, uh, no, what's it called again? I told you I'm so doorsy today. It's a book about Afghanistan and it's like an American who went to live in Afghanistan and uh, and Nan's got pal is the writer's name. It's called like, no country for like no good country for the living or something. Can you Google it? Can, can you Google it? It's like everybody makes that joke. Uh, no good place for the no good country for living or something like that.

Speaker 4:          11:40          Sorry. No reception. Um,

Speaker 1:          11:45          anyway, it's a really cool book because basically he was, he's a, I think he was like a neuroscientist, young, you know, just studying neuroscience. And then he was downtown when the World Trade Center attacks happened and he was like stuck under a car all day. And like that made him think suddenly a bit like America's place in the world and the by geopolitics and the way that he hadn't before. And then he just decided to move to Afghanistan and he lived there and you know, and he learned the language and he like got a motorbike and traveled around and had access to like even one member of the Taliban. And so he just learned so much and then he wrote about it in a way that was, um, so informative, but like what really happened there and what the American, you know, why it's such a mess. And he also has these really great human stories.

Speaker 1:          12:32          He traces like three people want to, Taliban commander, one is a widow who ended up in parliament and then he just the, the combination of, um, you know, a new story, deeply researched and like on the ground and also the human, um, both the human costs and human opportunity because both of those things happen in war obviously. Um, so I loved his rating and I would say then when I am writing about Iraq or I also went to Iran, then I try and think there's only so much you can, you know, be aware of your own biases or whatever. But I'm always trying to think like, what if I didn't grow up in Ireland and didn't live in America? Like, what would I really be thinking? Or like what's really happening. That's helpful. I certainly see a lot of ties to that in your journalism.

Speaker 1:          13:18          So your podcast and the articles that you write for the New York Times. That makes total sense. Where do you find you're reading recommendations around those issues? Um, I mean, I, I definitely have a lot of like immigrant journalists that I follow and that they're, you know, it's not hard to find, you know, it's not hard to find good, interesting work written by like, if I'm going to read about the Mexican American border, I want to read it from a Mexican point of view too. Like very simple. There's very simple ways to, I think, inform yourself, unlike, it is kind of amazing. It is kind of amazing when you realize like, oh, the different, the points of view that I'm getting there. You know, you just need to scratch the surface a bit and look a bit deeper. Um, I bet a lot of the audience hasn't had a chance to read the book yet and I'd love to give them an insight into what you did in Iraq, if you could tell them.

Speaker 1:          14:14          Oh, sure. So I did a comedy workshop. I'm talking all about warrants. What I use it a comedy works off. And, uh, I went there in 2016 and there was an herbal, which is, you know, um, up in Kurdistan and, uh, it's like a very safe place. But I did tell my parents that I was going to Kurdistan, I didn't specify like Iraq. And then I, you know, I got two other comics to come with me. We're, one is, he's a TV writer, um, Joe Randazzo whose name is, and uh, he used to race for the onion and that, and then he wrote for at midnight and a few different and then more Amur who's, um, uh, techs and comedians who tour as a Dave Chappelle, but he's texting by way of like, his family are Palestinian and he's Arabic speaking. So the three of us went it there and we did a workshop with 40 of our Iraqi peers and they, um, you know, I was obviously like a bit hesitant about like coming from America to like teach, like the history of American involvement interact has never been good.

Speaker 1:          15:18          And then also to be like, hey, we're good. Like, don't you think jokes are so important, you know? Um, and to teach like comedy or whatever. But, uh, I did my research. I also like coming from Ireland as you know, we, you know, we were a conflict ridden country for a long time and I was definitely, I'm definitely too young to clean that story is my own boss. Certainly when I used to do gigs in Belfast, I remember the, um, owner of the empire, that comedy club up there, he said that whenever there was a very bad atrocity, that that's Sunday night for the comedy show. There will be like lions around the block and the people really used comedy as a way to come together and as kind of a form of relief and an a way to like connect with each other. And, um, I always found that really interesting.

Speaker 1:          16:09          Plus like in Northern Ireland, I think it's fair to say they have like a slightly darker hue to their humor. Um, and so going into Iraq, I kind of thought in my mind too, they also wanted to talk about, you know, the, the, um, power of creativity when you're in, in, you know, going through dark stuff, whether that's just yourself or it's your family or it could be your community or country. Um, but that's all very lofty. I was really nervous. And then I got there and of course it was like doing a comedy workshop anywhere. Like there was, you know, for women and 36 men and like, um, there was, you know, like Goofy, loud guys who were just wanting to do comedy to meet women. And then there was, uh, like older, like earnest men who kind of were, had always wanted to express the site to themselves, but they were, you know, working or looking after family.

Speaker 1:          17:11          It was just like, I could have named people's equivalence like that. I had met in New Zealand in Edinburgh and Dublin do not domain. It was cool. And like, um, there was cartoonists there and people who made short videos and, um, standup comedy is like a younger kind of a craft, uh, in Iraq. And it was a lot of, there was a sketch group there and stuff and we just had this workshop. But it was, it was, it was really good. Like it was really, um, helpful I think for, it was certainly helpful for me. Now. I hope it was helpful for them too. And I'm still in touch with a few people. Took the workshop and what was extraordinary was no, we were just like Farsi miles from Mosul, which was still Andres isis control at the time. And um, they making like funny videos about Isis and like that was kind of the, you know, isis are still goods at a social media and that, that, you know, making videos that travel.

Speaker 1:          18:13          And I think that for the people at the workshop, some of whose family they were IDPs as their family, we're still stuck on most of the, um, I think it was useful for them to have a comeback and to use to, you know, use their creativity to oppose this kind of destruction, that and this narrative of destruction. Um, so that's what they said and I think, and I do believe them actually, and I also, I also was like, God, I was so stupid coming out here thinking, oh, what's the point of this? Cause I was like, well, if I, he just happened to grow up here, I'd be the one in the workshop. Like, you know, I'd be one of those kind of like girls being like, is this going to be good? You know,

Speaker 3:          18:53          you mentioned the impulse for self expression. So if you were a cable of menu would be the one who is writing on the walls.

Speaker 1:          18:59          Totally. I'm constantly, as you could see like trying to say like trying to figure out what, what I'm thinking and feeling and how I understand things and trying to share that. And it's just a, I think it's very human. Maybe it's like a bit stronger in some of us than others, but I think it's a very human impulse to try and say, like to just express yourself and then to get heard is amazing.

Speaker 3:          19:23          Yeah. Well we all reap the benefits of you expressing yourself. So thank you for that outcome. The teaching, this comedy workshop opened up a lot of questions about the shared space between comedy and tragedy. And I'm going to read a little excerpt of a question that you pose, which is, Oh God, if comedy and creativity, these nebulous things I've devoted all these years too, are in fact in the grand scheme of things unhelpful or even pointless. So how did your experience help to clarify those questions and do you still have our struggle with them?

Speaker 1:          19:54          Um, I think, you know, a lot of times comedy, like I think that we pat ourselves on the back too much. Like, I think, you know, if you're on the kind of left side of things, you like watch John Oliver and you're like, yeah, like get him like you said it or Jon Stewart or whatever. And ultimately I don't think it's really, I don't think if your goal is to change things, I don't think that's changing. It's like you get a laugh and you feel good, but, and you'd definitely get that sense like we're a tribe, but like that's, I don't know how helpful that is. Um, so, but for when I went and spent that time in Iraq, I do think that I could see the value of it from a kind of a, just to, it's an part of being human. And I think often when people are serious all the time, even if it's because they're sad or because something bad is happening, I think that's a disservice to their own like humanity.

Speaker 1:          21:01          Because I think in all of us there's like light and dark and there's levity and there's depth and like, unless you allow both of them to come out, then it's like you're not being fair. It's like if you were like giddy and uh, upbeat all the time, that's not a true representation of what, you know, really being a human. Yeah. So that's why I think, you know, a lot of narratives around, you know, of course like around war and of course around immigration, like forced immigration, like what's happening to Syrians are so tragic and so sad. But within those stories, which I found in my podcast when I interviewed Syrian asylum seekers, like there's, there's jokes, there's love, there's humor, you know, there's all those things that like people who aren't in a war and people who don't, um, feel a great sadness, like they still get to have, they still get to have that levity.

Speaker 1:          22:02          Yeah. But I think it gets lost in the telling sometimes. What made you choose to do a podcast on immigration? What I think it was, because, you know, like I was saying, where I came from was, you know, I'd under such a country that just pushes people. I always all the time and we ended up all over the world and then I became an immigrant myself, like moved here five years ago. And I could definitely see the contrast between my immigration experience and so many other people's. And it was definitely a question of like, hmm, like why me? And like why not them and why not, you know, because America is such a fortress. Really. Um, so and also so there was that, there was just that central question of like, what's really going on here, but also immigration stories as you know, if you're an immigrant yourself or if you're knowing immigrants, like there's always a story there because it, it literally means you've left one life behind and you've come and stash it a new life.

Speaker 1:          23:00          And that is like from a storytelling point of view, there's has to be something there. Even like the most boring immigration story. There's a story, there's a, there's the beginning of the middle and then what's happened now. Yeah, the podcast is no longer in production, but the back issues are amazing. And if you haven't listened to it, you really should. It hits all the right notes. Oh, thanks. To change hearts and minds. Yeah, absolutely. Well, I mean you say that it changed hearts and minds, but like it's interesting cause I really thought like, so basically the, the podcast is quite simple. It's like me interviewing different immigrants about their own stories. It was like immigration stories told by the people who've lived them. And I really thought like, you know, we went into production and you know, 2015 when I started the idea working on too.

Speaker 1:          23:45          That's 15 that, but the way the timing worked, well, you know, the show only started airing like right after Trump got elected. And then I think he was inaugurated while I was still taping and the west coast anyway. And so obviously the, you know, the immigration is always a huge topic here in America, but it had really heated up. Um, and I think I did naively probably think, oh, but if anybody hears this, like if they hear, you know, as Azad, the Syrian asylum seeker, if they talk, if they hear him talking about like how he read, he needs to quit smoking because he has this one year old now and his wife is giving him a hard time and yeah, he wants to quit smoking, but he's afraid he's gonna put weights on cause he's like a comfort Eser, you know, like he, he reminded me of my uncle and I was like, when they hear him, they're not going to be scared of Syrians and like, they're not going to even consider a Muslim ban or whatever Bush, you know, I don't know that a hearing stories from immigrants directly does

Speaker 3:          24:55          change hearts and minds. I like to hope that it does. I hope that it does too, but I, I, it's hard to get that qualitative, like does it actually, yeah. I don't know. I, it's a really, I'm still trying to figure out, yeah, I think reaching the correct audience is probably the hardest part of the battle. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so there's an innate tension, um, in the whole book about the hope you have for humanity, a society and, um, the insecurity of the self that everybody faces. Um, so can you, uh, give us any words of wisdom for people in the audience who might want to make a difference in the world and contribute to change, but I need the courage to start.

Speaker 1:          25:36          Well, I mean, I could say what I am doing like at the moment, which is like kind of a small thing, but it's actually like having me. But so like, um, I started this other podcast this year and it's about a climate justice, which is something I never I knew about, but I wasn't really like paying attention anyway. I, uh, we did this issue, we did this episode about divestments, you know, like big, big countries or corporations or universities or whatever divesting their money from, say like fossil fuels, funding of fossil fuel operations to putting it into something else like clean energy or something that's kind of a, you know, whatever cleaner and better for the environment and on better from a human rights point of view. And stuff. And so then we did this whole episode and I was kind of like, okay, cool. Like you can petition your, your government to divest which interests.

Speaker 1:          26:34          The great news is I at the Irish government has recently divested all of their money, which is amazing. Um, but then I was looked at chase bank, which is just like where I bank for no reason except that that's where I opened up the bank account. And um, and then I was like, well, I'm going to move my money at the, this is like last week I was on the phone to them and it, I owed them four grand. Like I had like zero on my current count and minus a minus four grand in my credit card. So I was like taking a high morals to, I was, I phoned them and I was like, I think I'm gonna leave the bank because I've been reading all this stuff and like you use, you've been funding this huge tar sands project and you know, and the lady was like, you can't leave like you owe us.

Speaker 1:          27:28          And I was like, no, I know. But you know, I'm telling you like, um, anyway then cause the day your book gets published, published, you get your check or whatever. So I got my check on Tuesday was a sure. Yeah. And then I was like, you know, duty or Roberts kind of, you know that moment where she goes back into the shop and she's like, big mistake, but still the woman and chase is like, fine, you can leave. Like they were just like, what is your problem? Anyway, so, uh, and then like this other lady, cause I was like, I should record this. Like it's really funny. And this other lady, first of all I call chase and I was like, now I have money and I'm paying off my credit card and you're not getting the rest of my money or whatever. And then it's like a lady who works in a call center in the Philippines, you know, and I wasn't about to like go off on her, you know, do you know what you're doing?

Speaker 1:          28:21          Like climate change is real problem. She's in Philippines. Like I think she knows. And, uh, we had a really nice chat actually and she was like, look, I'm going to do my homework after this. And it was like, Hey, sorry to keep you on the phone. And um, then I got put through to media relations cause I was requiring or whatever and she hung up on me, this lady and like the Manhattan branch hung up on me. So anyway, this is, I'm sorry, this is really long winded way of saying I'm personally taking responsibility for like, this is like the best small thing right? Where my money goes. I also, um, you know, when it comes to immigration, I try and really look at my own status, which like I said is I have this o one visa, which is a very privileged one to get.

Speaker 1:          29:07          And I try and help other people get it and I just try and speak to and understand other points of view. It's very basic. Like that's like I said, when I started the podcast I was like my responsibility as a storyteller. It's changed the ash shoot towards immigration in this country. And it's like, no, I can to that. Like, what I can do personally really do is like these small things. I can, you know, another thing which is more again, climate justice related is like check where my food comes from. That's just like order seamless all the time. Yeah. Which is like a lot of packaging and a lot of, you know, very. So I'm doing very small things. Yeah. That's like my latest approach.

Speaker 3:          29:51          Yes. I'm hearing start small and speak to your talents because you've leveraged your talents and incredible ways to effect change. Um, I want to leave space for audience questions. Please don't be shy. If you want to, uh, ask them thing and we've got microphones and you could ask me for a loan. That was a good time. Um, but also, um, this book was a completed about a year ago. Is that right?

Speaker 1:          30:15          Yeah. I basically finished it last September and that it's quite a long process with publishing there. Takes away what's changed in your life since then. And I got a dog, I got a dog. I, God made a columnist at the times and at the garden and also at the progressive, another magazine. So suddenly now we have a lot of writing work to do, um, which is fine. Um, and I think that's kind of it.

Speaker 3:          30:49          Yeah, that's big. You have a really cute passage about so many cute passages about dogs. Fuck, what do you see? Cause I

Speaker 1:          30:56          always walk, um, dogs from Shawn Casey. It's like Eh, rescue place and you can walk dogs from there. Like you don't have to, I mean really, you just go in and give your email address. I think they kind of want you just to take them. Um, and then you can take the dog to the park or whatever. And I used to always do that and I was like, I kind of get a dog, you know, like with money and like looking at the time and everything, but then I just kind of go, you know, I don't know if you have a dog, but like what happens is you act like you're just going to foster it for a while. Anyway, I ended up getting this dog full time now for almost and uh, and it's great. Like, actually when I got her, I was like, she's, I guess she's like half border collie.

Speaker 1:          31:43          So I was like, she's going to be real busy and energetic and she's gonna make me start running. I said, I used to run, I don't run anymore. And then, um, I was like, it's going to be so good for me and my mental health and I go to like lose weight and everything. She's also half period anyway. She's like the laziest, not lazy, but like she's a puppy and she's just like, let's news. So she, yeah. So that's what's happened to me for a puppy. She's a big puppy. Yeah. She's 60 pounds now cause she just sleeps all the time. I'll do it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          32:13          Um, so we covered your, a trip to Iraq and mentoring Iraqi comics and all the issues that come up.

Speaker 1:          32:20          My Dog, oh, we hit all the big ones

Speaker 3:          32:24          around the Berlin utility of comedy and its relationship to tragedy. There's this really interesting juxtaposition in the book about your hope for all of these comics and how they can affect change and um, being very, uh, positive and optimistic about the role of comedy in politics in Iraq, but 80 saw a lot of, um, insecurity bubbling up around the podcast and it's, uh, it's ability to affect change in the same way. I'm an imposter syndrome is something that we talk about a lot at Google. It's a big discussion point. Um, so do you have any words of wisdom about kind of closing that gap between how you perceive other people and how you can bring your own self perception to the same place?

Speaker 1:          33:06          Yeah, I mean I this, this newest product podcasts and I'm working on is with Mary Robinson, who's the former president of Ireland. She's a first female president and she's 73 years old now. And so you can imagine what it was like for her coming off as if she was a human rights lawyer first. And like this thick, I guess the, I guess the 70s in Ireland, which was a tough time for like women and she was like human rights lawyers. So anyway, I asked her about that cause I think it's like a

Speaker 1:          33:38          real phenomenon with younger women. Maybe men feel it to imposter syndrome. I hear most from women, but maybe men feeder too. Um, and I asked her about it and she was like, I never had us, she was so unhelpful. Like I really thought that she should have some kind of like w why is, and she was just like, no, I don't know. Um, and someone else did, I talked to about this, she's a black woman and she was like, I don't have time for like, she's like, everyone does doubt me. Everyone in her, I guess she's means not, not black people, does doubt her and she does have to prove yourself all of the time. So if she also dives herself. So that made me think this is just one black woman. I don't know if that's, you know, but that made me think like, hmm. Like, I wonder if it's a bit of a

Speaker 1:          34:37          making a problem where there isn't one. Um, but I feel it, it's a real, you know, and I know like feelings aren't facts, but whatever. I do still feel it a bit myself and I feel like what, you know what too, I think I'm doing here or if I'm doing like a high status thing or whatever, I'm like, um, I think it's helpful to, uh, remind yourself of past like using logic helps me, like I can say to myself, but you did this other thing like two weeks ago and that was on the same level and you did fine. So like using, using logic to say like, I wasn't cut out then nobody kicked me out then. So like I can do this again. And then I used that for a lot of things to trick my brain. Like I often think, oh, I'm not going to be able to write this piece.

Speaker 1:          35:29          Like it's too hard or it's too long or it's whatever I don't sign. But then I think, but you thought that before, but you did it.
