Speaker 1:          00:05          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06          Hi everyone. Thank you so much for being here. On behalf of all a Lex Google talks at and Latino Heritage La, I'd like to welcome everyone to our first Hispanic heritage month event or we're going to have a panel discussion where we celebrate the vibrancy of Latini that or an on many different aspects that make us Latino today. We will hear it firsthand from three very talented local Latino artists, each one of them providing their own take on what it means to be an artist in the u s I will start with [inaudible] in the middle son's I coordinate who is the first generation Salvadorian American artists born in Houston, Texas. Historical collective memory of post civil war Salvadorian culture is an important influence and inspiration for her work. She recently implemented a portfolio preparation course at blessedly La Rasa for students aspiring to continue their education and profession in the arts center.

Speaker 2:          00:54          Received a VFA from Vcu with a concentration in painting and printmaking, recipient of the Ellen Battelle stoeckle fellowship. She attended the Yale Norfolk summer program. Thanks for being here and then we have your land all the way to the left or to your right was born into a family who is artistic heritage dates back to 1877 Gonzales's travels in different countries. The bonds forge the individuals in those places and the resulting transformative experiences are reflected in her art and her life. She has done for her strong, bold brushstrokes of color and texture intent and evoke in imagination and emotion. She was an artist in residence in Ginza, Japan followed by a similar stint in Assisi, Italy. Throughout the years, Gonzalez has started various community organizations. You can see some of her work on the gold line trains as well as buses throughout La. In a collaboration with a Arp, you'll end the study that the Pasadena Art Center College of design after winning a painting competition that are awarded her a scholarship to the prestigious school.

Speaker 2:          01:54          Thanks again of course, and now we have Roselli Lopez Elo's Angeles based artists whose work involved combining cultural iconography with references of our everyday surroundings. At a young age, she was heavily impacted with the realities of loss, addictions and violence. Within our immediate family, which continue to shape our perspectives and society and culture. She primarily uses printmaking but been picado installation and the altar offering to really experiences of survival loss in pride was a earned a master of fine arts in printmaking from Indiana University and do a bachelor of fine arts degrees in graphic design and print making from California State University. Long Beach. All three women have had their artwork exhibited in many museums around the country and internationally. So let's give him a warm welcome.

Speaker 1:          02:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:42          welcome to the Google fund maybe. Yeah, this is very exciting. Super exciting to do it. You know, Spanish heritage month first event and we have you. Yeah. So I'm super, super excited to not only have you here but also your artwork if you haven't seen the fabulous display of art that have here in the collection in the boardwalk. Some people were like, what is the boardwalk? We have a in front of the Barista outside of big Lebowski. That is our boardwalk. That's where we have um, six different artists displayed and three of them are right here. So I love to know. So there was probably a thought process which artwork bring to Google. Was that hard? Like we have like six for one side of you specifically chose one Jolanda like six Roselli four. I'm very interested like the behind the scenes look at why these pieces and what the selection process was. So just so everybody knows if we go to one slide, this is your land does work. Yolanda, tell us about this. Why did you choose these very particular pieces to have here with us today? Well, they wanted to

Speaker 4:          03:43          um, exhibit something contemporary, something that was representational of my work. Um, that was more recent, that had, um, all of the texture that I usually use a color that is known for the Chicano Art. Um, and I wanted to send some of the works that I'm most excited about. Oh, very nice. Which are some still lives and some portraits. And these are portraits of people that I know that are dear to me, uh, that represent strength, power, positive energy and love.

Speaker 3:          04:18          Thank you. And now the way the subject, I noticed that two of the paintings are called Deanna something. Who is this DNR person?

Speaker 4:          04:24          Well, the Ana Elise has a very dear friend of mine and her husband is a, an incredible, um, jewelry. My Sro, so this is Diana's husband. This is all of the work that he creates. And um, we've known each other for about 25 years and she's just a brilliant woman. Brilliant, powerful woman. Great. That's so nice. Do they have this artwork in their homes? Uh, they do. They have some, they have a house in the loom and they've taken some portraits that I've created of them to their home.

Speaker 3:          04:56          Oh, that's wonderful. Thank you. Thank you. And then in the next page, um, we have Roselli's work. Roselli, you have four different pieces here with poppin picado and different things. Tell us why these specific pieces,

Speaker 5:          05:10          uh, kind of going off what Yolanda was saying, I wanted to pick work that exemplified, uh, when I'm creating right now, um, as a printmaker and someone who combines that with [inaudible]. I wanted to choose works that talk about the, a friend that and offering and, um, a very contemporary way in an untraditional somewhat ways. So, um, I have a puppet picado piece of an La scene, um, a family portrait that I combined with led lights and, um, a couple other, uh, offering that pieces that are all puppet Ricardo. So I felt like together they make a group being that really talks about, um, the things that I feel embody the content that I work with.

Speaker 3:          05:52          That's great. Thank you. Yeah. So you do a lot. So you do these also tons of other like, cause you, yeah.

Speaker 5:          05:58          Combine you installation art. Um, sometimes it's just pure printmaking mixed together sometimes with Buckin picado so I really enjoy creating, transforming spaces to give people an experience. So, um, sometimes that means breaking out of the frame and, and uh, inhabiting a space. So. Nice.

Speaker 3:          06:17          Thank you. That's great. And now we're going to see standards work and Sandra is very specific. You have like this big huge artworks. One P one. I'm very curious why one

Speaker 2:          06:28          one piece? Well, it's, it's a group of work that I'm currently working on. I tend to work in series, um, set the moment. I'm exploring notions of childhood, um, memory and nostalgia. Like, what drives that nostalgic power, um, in this image is, you know, is it something that's been romanticized, something that's been skewed? Like why, why, like what does, like why does it have that power? So I love kind of like asking these questions as I'm making the work. So as you see this piece, it's representational yet has very abstract elements to it. So kind of like a push and pool, like an inquiry of my past, like where I come from. Um, so it's a very tender, loving memory. Um, you know, that's a bit like this combobulated and may make sense and it might ring truth to some, some of my viewers. I hope so.

Speaker 3:          07:25          No, I loved it. So all the work is beautiful and I thought it was very powerful that you just chose one. Yeah. Like this is, I need to know more. Um, so I like to know also, um, so you were talking about themes and how right now you're working on this theme of like childhood. Yeah. What drives a theme? Like when, for all three of you, when you work on a theme, what is that driver or that influence to go on that theme? How do you choose the theme that is next?

Speaker 2:          07:51          Well, there tends to be themes that I've been working with for a really long time. So whether it's commemorating a, a figure, like in a monolithic space, like one figure in a space. Like why, like telling a story, like always very narrative. Like I'm so childhood social justice where I'm from El Salvador, like it's history, so it's very historically based and I'm always seeking out a narrative and whatever that narrative may be, that's the image that surfaces so great. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          08:26          Um, how, how does it work for both of you?

Speaker 4:          08:28          I think for myself it's something that's very personal and um, I try to cover narratives that are, um, what people are going through along with myself and that reality and how that reality is portrayed on canvas, uh, in a beautiful manner. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          08:50          In my case, I feel like I'm very much, I'm inspired by, um, my community, my neighborhood. And um, in the beginning a lot of my work was definitely influenced by those worth those alters and how women would use these alters as a platform to discuss social issues in the community as a way to have a voice and gathering assemblage work. And so, um, from that and using my own experiences, I, I use it as a way to talk about people who I want to praise or I want to commemorate and how we can take pride in our communal histories and stories and display them as something to be very proud about. Nice.

Speaker 3:          09:30          Do you feel that, so of course, I mean artwork is, is your emotion. There's a lot of, there's a voice behind it. And do you feel there's a voice or an emotion that you tap into and when you do better work comes out, what does that, so people are like, I need to be depressed, or Oh, I'm not an artist. Like this is magical. Do little things for my children, but not, but, or certainly like in school, but now tell me, how does that work for you? That process?

Speaker 4:          09:59          No, definitely like for me, like in my works, the struggle, like a struggle, any struggle. Um, uh, perseverance, overcoming, um, beauty, like all of these, like very strong, like elements that just run through all of my work is what drives it. Like, absolutely.

Speaker 5:          10:23          Um, I definitely feel like I'm in, in my case the, the materials that I use and uh, the person that I'm dedicating it to are things that I harness and I want that energy to transmute and infuse into the artwork. Um, so I pull on a lot of those emotions a lot. Most of the people I use are people that I'm connected to in some way. So I have a relationship with them and I'm, if I'm commemorating a past memory or igniting a thoughts from other viewers in it, I want them to, to cherish those things and to have value, um, so that they don't forget. I know.

Speaker 4:          11:00          Okay. I think my inspiration is people, the relationships that we have. And then we'll watch shows that they evoke in my soul and in my heart. So when there's somebody that I'm passionate about that I'm creating a portrait of, you definitely see it on the canvas course. Absolutely. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          11:16          So, so, so it's that emotion that we're discussing, right? So it's, yeah. So when you're doing people, I mean it's people you're passionate about it, very excited to evoke. Um, is it just all pure happiness or do you have like inner emotions that are coming out in this painting too that you're trying to get? I mean, like there's always like subliminal messages. Yeah. That too.

Speaker 4:          11:35          There's all kinds of emotions that, that transpire in the creative process. And it's that relationship between your canvas. Um, and since I've been painting for 30 years, it's, it's a love relationship and it's this medium that feeds my soul and um, and then this other person. So it's a dialogue between the three of us, between the creative process, the canvas, myself and the sitter, the portrait I'm creating of. Um, and so definitely there's different emotions that come out and, and it's lovely to allow yourself to convey that with the brush strokes. Sure. Definitely. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          12:14          So tell me, tell me,

Speaker 5:          12:16          I was just going to say it's like a form of communicate. Instead of using words, you can say it basket with images and yeah. And textures. And as those things layer, it creates the emotion that you're not quite able to put into the same, same sort of wording. So it, um, you hope that people get that when they see it or it allows them to see something in a different way because that's how you find your mode of communication happening best. Sure. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          12:40          That's like for the next Google talk, we'll just have easels. Absolutely. Great idea that's doing it. Um, so I'm very proud to be a amongst, you know, all these Latinas. Right? It's wonderful. And I'm thinking, how hard is it? I mean, I Latina a woman, basically you're an entrepreneur, right? How hard is it in the art world to be a Latina and a woman, you know, in, in, in a business that's, there's a lot of men in it to tell me, I want to know. Um,

Speaker 4:          13:10          there are obstacles. I tend to not focus on them. I just continued to forge forward and to continue to be focused on what I'm doing in business and my creativity. So there'd Yolanda Gonzales who is the artist, the creative, um, and there is your land. They go on sale as the business person that was taught to me by my dad, the Apollo one, Silas who was a great businessman. Um, so I think if you can separate yourself from the creative and then to the business of this, this beautiful painting, um, that you're going to hand over, their soul is going to hang in somebody's home. I think it's important to focus on that. So there are obstacles, but I think like in any, in any other line of work, um, I just focus on a clear, straight and narrow road. That's to my goal.

Speaker 5:          14:01          It's that Latino backbone. And we have parents and family who teaches how to work hard, show us what it's like to have dedication into something. And, um, I, I feel like I definitely pull from that to like my mom, single parent mom and what she did to make things work. And you use that transmute that into what goals you want to accomplish. And it, it sets, it comes through. You can tell people's drive and you could see it because they, they learned from people before and them not even in the same field or a different thing, but they see it being applied and then it trickles down into your own personality and the way that you, that way that you meet that you work. Sure. So, um, uh, I think that there is definitely a struggle. Being an artist is not easy. And I, I want to do a lot of answers first because she's, she's got a lot more experienced than a, Sandra and I were, were newer in this starting game.

Speaker 5:          14:51          So I feel like, uh, I learned from women like her that, that their strength and their, um, passageways. Then pioneering these these paths for us. Yeah. Make it a different world for us than it was, I think even in their timeframe. So I acknowledged that. I really feel like they are people that I like to look up to and I learned from, um, I'm a teacher too. So I feel like as an instructor, as a teacher, sometimes a student has don't think like, Oh, where's the teacher? Oh, that's me. You know what is right here. I'm not as a, I appreciate her boldness and her strength. And I think that's something that I really admire about Yolanda. It comes through in her work and, um, I feel like, uh, I'm just, I'm coming to my own in that, um, I'm finding that voice and I'm figuring how that communicates with my surroundings and my neighborhood.

Speaker 5:          15:40          Um, I feel like I can be a, uh, a venue for communicating these things. Um, how, how I am impacted by them and how other people see this happening in our communities. So we play an important role in showing people that it's not the same route to understanding what's happening in our culture, in our neighborhood. And, um, I, I feel thankful to be a part of events like this because, um, it's not a voice that's commonly heard. It's not a voice where we often get a platform to be such a strong voice. So I appreciate, um, being involved with it

Speaker 2:          16:17          then being involved with artists like, like these. So of course. Are you kidding? You're always welcome. Yeah. I'd like to say thank you for saying that. I appreciate it and I've, um, I've worked hard to, to keep it, um, my reputation and my persona kind of a, a certain way for, for you.

Speaker 5:          16:37          The aura comes through. I never had, I never had the kids, you know, I never had a kid. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          16:43          But I felt when I would go places, I always tell my friends we're representing, we are representing, we're responsible wherever we are, you know, we are responsible to hold up who we are and our, our whole culture where there were the only Chicana in the room at its function in a very astute place. And we're representing, of course, it doesn't matter if you're in the restroom or if you're in the dining room. People Watch and you have to represent who you are, who your culture is. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And Los Angeles, just in general, like I've moved around a bit and I've experienced different, um, like art communities. But having, having arrived here three years ago, I found a lot like an art community here that was just very inviting, very giving, like, you know, finding these strongholds. Like he's beautiful, powerful women, like Chicana artists that, you know, that'll give you a chance. Like, you know, I'm, I'm Salvadorian, but I met this, uh, amazing artists, Margaret Garcia when I first moved here and she's like, oh honey, we're all the same here. Like within like a week of me having meeting her, like she already had me kind of like meeting different people and into exhibitions and it's just like everyone here is like down to help each other out, which is something that you don't really find in a lot of places. So it's a lot of power here within the art community and Chicanas Latinas in general.

Speaker 3:          18:12          So you're paying it forward. You were saying you, you know, you're, you always have a voice. You always, people are always watching. Do you mentor, tell us a little bit about that. Like what do you do to like pip? So to give to the next generation?

Speaker 5:          18:26          Cause I know your team right now. I, I I love teaching. I teach right now at two cal state universities at cal State Long Beach and cal state North Ridge and also at Cerritos College. So, um, teaching art. I feel like some of my biggest mentors that I have, a lot of them were professors and some of them were working artists outside of the institution. So I really try to bring, I try to think about how I can bring that communal experience and, and working with artists outside of the institution and think about how you could bring that into the institution and work with students and get them to clarify their own voices, how you're teaching them, how to use a medium, and then also how to speak through that medium. So, um, it's an interesting thing. I think like that helps to pay it back. I think. Uh, I'm really happy to also work at the community level with places like [inaudible] where I get to work with youth and those young kids that just love, you know, working with art.

Speaker 5:          19:22          It's not even always about the end product. It's about the process of working and having fun and you know, those experiences coming together or what makes it a lot of fun. So yeah, of course. Anything over there I have more questions. You know, I think, I think it's important to, um, mentor. Um, I've taught several places throughout the 30 years that I've been creating art. I worked for blessing for plastic Rasa teaching, um, and for better Los Ninos, uh, for inner city yards for 14 years. Um, and it was amazing to work with the youth and, um, just to teach them art, but to also teach them acceptance of who they are. Right now I work with ultimate, uh, teaching senior citizens, teaching senior citizens a watercolor and a ceramics, hence your arp. Yes. And they're absolutely, and they're absolutely lovely. Absolutely lovely.

Speaker 3:          20:20          And so you were here recently, you're saying three years ago, right? Yeah. So how, how, so they've embraced you and now it's too early to move to give back or what are you, what are you thinking about in terms of like the next generation? How, um, Oh man,

Speaker 2:          20:34          I'm, I'm excited to be working with Walesa La Raza. I was, um, I noticed that while I was working for Margaret Garcia and I also worked for Frank Romero and other artists in the community, um, I would assist them within their classes at Plaza La Raza and realize that there was really nothing being offered for the next generation that's trying to move forward and kind of like hone in on their skills, what they're really trying to say and express and just like start developing their own style, their own voice through art. Um, so I proposed a portfolio preparation course at blessed and we're entering the fourth semester now. So I'm pretty excited about it. I, we have many beautiful, very talented artists and just giving them a space to really think about the work that they're making and have them develop their style. Um, that was something that was very important for me as a kid in high school. Like having that teacher that, you know, we'll just kind of give you the space and room to do what you need to do. Um, and you know, and just like beginning dialogue, like having conversations about your work. Like there's more to it than just the beautiful image, you know, or, um, so that's, I already feel like I'm, I'm giving into that and feeding it and, and it's feeding me as well. It's definitely like a reciprocal relationship.

Speaker 3:          21:58          I love it. So I mean, as an artist, I mean your surrounding shape, you and, and you know and influence you and the people you meet and all the travels that you do. I mean, you've moved around, you've traveled, you've been to, you know, even done work in a CC. Um, you've had a ton of things also in the community had happened. You know, if there's a lot that goes on, um, in my mind, can you think of an anecdote or a story or like one example that's really shows they wanted piece of art really made an impact. Is there like a, like the one or is it like, no all the time or everything? I don't know. I mean, when and why, what is, what made that impact?

Speaker 2:          22:37          Aw, I guess during, yeah, you got a story. I love it.

Speaker 5:          22:41          Uh, I, I've had this idea of why I would make a lot of altars and a lot of, uh, offerings. So it, I've had this idea for a long time and I was happy to be able to do it finally, like I think three years into having it was in my sketchbook and I finally get to do it and that's the grant money to do it. Um, but I've always wanted to do this popup alter installation. I'm dedicated to my mom. My mom, when she passed away, we inherited all of her plants. And so my sister and I started taking care of her plants and learning how to have this green thumb because we wanted to preserve her through these plants. And so I've been sprouting them and my sister and I were living together and then we were going to part ways. She was going to get a job somewhere else.

Speaker 5:          23:23          And the thought of not having her plants was like, oh, don't worry, I'm going to clone them. I'm going to, we can each have, you know. So I cloned all the plants and I started getting into cloning and I decided to make, I wanted to make a pop up alter where people shared stories of their mother's with me and an exchange. I would give them a sprouting Platt from one of my mom's plants. So I wanted to gather and archive all these and post them up on social media and on my website so that people can listen to these great stories that they told and they share it about women in their lives. So, um, this past mother's Day, the day before mother's Day, um, I was able to set up a little popup on the La River bed and I asked, I got a chance to do it, sit at this huge altar, beautiful green plants and you know, just seeing them sort of perky and happy there.

Speaker 5:          24:08          The plants that is, I always like, like this is for you mom. And then also hearing everyone's stories of how women in their lives brought like so much strength and um, the amazing things that people remember and also their connection to this living thing, a plant, what that meant to a lot of people. And those stories that I heard, it was like a constant, I felt like that was giving back because those memories stay with people for the rest of the day. They, they remember that memory about grandma or about anti and, and it stays with them and they thought, man, I almost forgot about that. And is because of that moment, that event that they got to remember. And that's what was really important for me. I felt like that was, that was my anecdote. That was beautiful. Thank you. Wow. Yeah. Are you going to do it again? Oh, I'd love to. I've always wanted to do this, like in a flea market or swap meet and have a different sort of crowd, you know, uh, and then grow that archive and just continue adding stories and adding stories to it. So now you can, not all of us. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          25:08          Sunday you had a story as well. All you can tell, Huh? Yes. Um,

Speaker 2:          25:14          so when I recently moved here, this is why I think it's just like when I moved here, all the stars were just like telling me like, you're at the right place at the right time. Uh, when I had just moved here, um, I, I was, I remember I was in Home Depot and I was like walking around. I was like, well, I need a plant from my new home, you know, like looking around and then I get an unknown phone call. Um, and when I pick up, I Maria, what Datto is on the other line at the other end of the line, and I'm not sure if you guys are familiar with her, but she was very prominent. Um, social justice figure here in Los Angeles, um, had survived through many, many things. I'm in El Salvador and resettled in the United States, um, during the 80s. So since the 80s, she's been organizing with so many different groups.

Speaker 2:          26:06          Um, she heard about the type of work that I was doing, a, which is all based on historical collective memory, um, like stories from the Salvadoran civil war. And she said to me like, I'd love to meet you and you know, I'd love to talk to you. I'd love, I'd love to have you paint me like have a sitting, right? So we talked about getting that together and I worked with her for about a year and walked away from the experience with two really beautiful paintings. But throughout that, that timespan, like she shared her stories with me. Uh, we would go out for pool, we would, you know, it's just a lot of beautiful experiences. But, um, she also sat me down to watch a documentary that was done for her. So we like sat in a room held hands sometimes because it was just like the story.

Speaker 2:          26:59          It was just really intense. Um, but she explained to me maybe midway of having spent time with her that she had cancer, like you had come back and she had a certain amount of time to live. So just having the opportunity to sit with her and paint her and share her story, um, and exhibited in different spaces, like brought so many people together from different parts of her life, um, that would recognize that person in the painting. Like people were, you know, I, I walked up to one person, I'm a patron of mine actually. Uh, and she was crying when she was seeing the, the painting and she shared with me like once Maria had already passed, she had shared the stories that they shared together, like through goddess. And so, um, I feel like it was just a very organic and natural thing that just happened.

Speaker 2:          27:55          And I feel fortunate to have been able to document that. And so just produce something that keeps her memory like living. So it was pretty magical. Yeah. I'd love to show you guys the images now, but um, you know, but her story was, was definitely about survival. There's a beauty to it, but there was also a lot of darkness to it. Um, so I think, yeah, it was just very powerful, like for sharing of course. Delanda all your experience. Tell me one maybe, I don't know, then you can you reduce it? I don't know. Yeah, I could, I can

Speaker 4:          28:32          reduce it. I think, I think one that is very recent. Dom, I was recently commissioned, um, by ultimate to create a, um, a sculpture for one of their facilities. Um, and um, I have been creating ceramics for about 20 years. Um, and um, there are these women that I make that are called the [inaudible] and they have these Jong Ethos and they're very colorful and very strong, uh, women. Um, so they asked me to create this piece, which was going to end up being about six feet tall and ceramics. So I started to created, um, we had the heads that are large orbs about this big. Um, we created the heads, the torso and the skirt. Uh, and it's during a time where, uh, I was going through a very, um, difficult a transition in my life. And, uh, so we created the skirt, which is about this tall am and it's going into the, uh, Kim and it breaks, uh, and it was very symbolic of what I was going through.

Speaker 4:          29:34          We created another one and went into the kiln. When it came out, it was cracked. Um, then we created a third and when it came out and, and some form, I was in a stronger place and kind of more comfortable where I was and wasn't struggling so much with the transition. She came out fine. And how long was that process between the first one? It's been six months. It was six months. Um, and then also creating the orbs in the heads for me, uh, was very organic and feeling these orbs and creating the portrait. Um, I felt it was like, this is what it would be like to give birth this or I felt it and it was cool. And the clay was, the smell of the clay was just so beautiful and magical. Um, so I created her, it took four men to install, or cause she's about 600 pounds. Uh, she was installed. Um, and so once she was installed and I turned around and I looked at her, I cried because I thought we have both a completed this process together. And that's what that piece was for me. It was, it was building myself up again to continue what I had to continue. Universal, very symbolic and wow. And so is there anything that I know like transitioning from that, it's like

Speaker 7:          30:55          cry. It's an artist. Artist's life. Welcome to the artist's life. So in this roller coaster of emotions, is there anything you were

Speaker 4:          31:04          Gret then? Nothing. Not One. Is there a some type of artwork or, um, John Ra that you would never do?

Speaker 1:          31:15          Oh Wow.

Speaker 4:          31:17          Can't say that, but I dunno. I Dunno. I'm asking you to say never. We have so much that you wouldn't want to wear that you're like have fear of, is there like a, like a thing that you're like, ah, I try to avoid it?

Speaker 1:          31:27          Mm.

Speaker 4:          31:29          I think if there's different mediums because people will come to you. Um, I was sent to Japan to do printmaking and I had done some printmaking it self help graphics, but not that much. But what you do is you essentially, um, interpret it, that style, that medium in your process. Okay. So you make it your own. Yes. And then therefore it's accepting to you, but is there anything else that you were like, I don't know. I don't want to go there. It's not something that's my style. I don't want to, you know, maybe I,

Speaker 1:          32:05          yeah,

Speaker 5:          32:06          that's an interesting question. Um, it's hard, I think, um, when I think about moments in my life where I wondered if I had gone this way versus that way, I definitely thought about, um, there,

Speaker 5:          32:19          there was a time in my life when I had just graduated and I got my on my BFA degree and I was going to be going into Grad school. Um, and there was a time in between then when I, uh, I lost my brother unexpectedly at a very young age. Um, and he, um, yeah, he, he died of an overdose and I was like really distraught and my family was out of state and I was in California. I stayed here in California. They had moved away and I really felt like I wanted to be with them and it was so difficult. But here I am in a part of my life where I'm supposed to decide where out of state I'm going to school. And it was a horrible feeling that should have been like much different. And so I, my heart wanted to go to New Mexico where my family was.

Speaker 5:          33:04          And uh, I had gotten a opportunity to go to Grad school on a full ride scholarship in Indiana University and the thought of going across the country, leaving Los Angeles and going to a place where you know, where you really are different. Sure. Um, and it was, uh, it was heart wrenching. It was my mom's advice that sort of pushed me into continuing to go into that route because it was like, that's, that's what he would wanted you to do. But it wasn't what I wanted to do. I wanted to go and meet with them. So I wonder what my life would be like if I had continued and lived out, I dunno, maybe applied to school out there and decided to go a different route with my life. Um, but while I was in Indiana, I totally got immersed in like an in using Altrisk as a way to, to remember to heal and, um, to, to learn to have my own voice. So, and having living in that place where I there, there's not as much social diversity is we have in Los Angeles. It really forced me to have to talk about my work to people who didn't understand it. So it was great. Yeah. That experience was very difficult, but also like, I think that, um, yeah, it just was a point in my life where I thought, I wonder how it would have ended up if I had gone somewhere else versus here. Course. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          34:26          Speechless a bit. Um, very strong women. Wow. I love all these stories and thank you. They were very personal. Yeah. Very thankful that you're sharing that with us. So it feels like I'm part of like, I'm in your homes and you're like, I need to give you some coffee, see doors. And I'm like, this is like really getting in touch with this beautiful stories and like, wow. Thank you. Wow. Um, okay. So, so I want to touch a little bit more on the whole, the whole aspect that you, you were just, you were just touching on, have you had to explain your art? People really didn't get it or didn't understand it. How was that process like, have you had that experience too?

Speaker 5:          35:08          It was, I'm going to speak as a, you know, acknowledging the fact that I'm very young in this environment. Um, but that I looked, it made me realize how much more I had to study and learn, um, the artists who are working in this form before me and understand their conversations and where it was coming because it helped me build up my strength to even be able to communicate these things. I want to, I want to talk about a person's life and celebrate it without feeling the drabness of death and like leaving this life and I want to celebrate them and the lessons that they taught me and how do I do that? And, and those Muertos and alters and [inaudible] gave me that venue to be able to talk about it. So I, I studied, I researched, I, um, I definitely wanted to investigate a lot of Chicanos who were using alters as a, as another way, not just to commemorate their, aren't the silos, but as a way to talk about the social dynamics of where they're coming from and, and how they can communicate that in a public atmosphere.

Speaker 5:          36:10          It doesn't have to be in a, a white wall gallery. It can be in, in a public space. So, um, growing up in, in La and having places like self help graphics that are pioneering, you know, a contemporary that was worth as a Chicano wise version of it goes mirth though. So it was like a setting the pathway for me to, to discuss all of these things and to, to be who I wanted to be and talk about my family and also my situation and related to everyone else around me. And uh, the, even though I was all the way in Indiana, I had the access to resources to do this homework to, to, to look at books and to read and research. So when I came back home I felt like a lot more empowered to understand it when you kind of take it for granted a little bit growing up in it. So yeah,

Speaker 3:          36:57          that's great. And your power at a ton of other people and now they're more educated, empowered everyone here.

Speaker 5:          37:03          Yeah. Like it's more than just like a lack as a makeup and you know, it's not, forget this like,

Speaker 3:          37:09          yeah, of course. Thank you. Sunday we were going to say anything. No, maybe, but I do have a question. So we were discussing, you know, this voice that you have as artists. How has social media or digital or technology helped your careers

Speaker 2:          37:28          or not? I mean maybe not. Well, I mean it helps in the sense of like having you connected with so many of your peers and your colleagues. And I mean, being able to research and especially like the way that I gather like source material. Um, it's very, you know, I very much needed the Internet and social media to be able to do that. Um, but in particular maybe, I don't know, maybe not.

Speaker 3:          38:00          Yeah, I'm very intrigued by the, um, the, the fact that, you know, art is now accessible to all right. So the minute you do something, it is seen by millions and millions of ball eyeballs all over the world instantly. And so when you're making this now, cause it's different like maybe even 30 years ago, right?

Speaker 7:          38:18          Oh yeah. I mean, when you're creating [inaudible] excited about beepers, well your [inaudible] turn it around eight, three, eight, three. It's love. It's one, four, three, one, four, three. I was there too. I remember the phones, the long cords.

Speaker 5:          38:37          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          38:39          I have a question for you then. So in the 30 year span you've, you've gone from, you didn't have digital really to now having people see or artwork if they want it to around the world. Does it change now your perspective when you're painting a, in the sense that before people would go and you know, wherever you had the exhibition people would see it, you know, it was that specific people maybe you toward whatever it is you, those are the people who saw it. Right? We Seeked it out, but now anybody can see it and share it. Does that change how you paint now and the voice or the message you want to give?

Speaker 4:          39:13          Um, I think it changes a lot of things except for the way I paint. Okay. Because the painting process and my relationship with the creative process, um, is very pure to me. It's very sacred. And so that is very strong. One of the strongest relationships I have. Um, and, but it's very exciting to me to, um, to share. And I, what I like to do is put a piece, when I first start the sketch, the rough, when it's almost done and then when it's completed so people can kind of see the process of what's happening of creation. So be it. Um, so you know, when people put their kids pictures every month

Speaker 5:          39:54          on Facebook and I put my paintings every month, you know, both of my babies. But that's what's exciting about it. It's like we get to see like the studio practice unfurled in front of us on Instagram and Facebook. So it's like that they, we, and it's also hard to get used to it, to opening people up to that process. You know, how much do you want to show? Like how much is exposed, you know, like you want to keep some of those things,

Speaker 4:          40:17          right? Yeah. Right. Yeah. It's whatever you're comfortable with. You know what I mean? It's whatever you're comfortable really sharing because it's out there and once it's out there, it's out there. But it is amazing and I've utilized it to the fullest where, um, you know, you send out your message, you know, and you send out your images and then you represent messages that need to be represented as well. Um, but I think it's, it's, it's a fascinating, fascinating process. You know, the Internet, it's just fascinating to me and I'm, I'm such a gadget person. I love, I loved that. So anything I can get my little hands on and, and, um, expose people to what's going on or in my world, my little utopian, strange world that's there,

Speaker 5:          41:04          right? It's a, uh, it's exciting. I feel like we're living in a world where there's all kinds of new technology happening all the time. And, uh, as artists we get to figure out how to interpret that and use that. And um, so like a print maker and it's one of those like classic dying forms that people don't like to use any more because it's very cumbersome. But there's always this like conversation on how we're pulling from new technology to influence our work. So how do we keep it relevant in this of like constant technology of grades, you know? So, um, I like to see how it impacts the, the conversation I want to have or the way I envisioned a piece happening. Um, there's some of the ways that I've used is I'm a graphic designer, so a lot of the work also starts off on the computer using digital programs are digitizing the work somehow.

Speaker 5:          41:54          And then I'm like, it's seeing how the work can transmute. I've had a chance to use CNC router machines to create like custom furniture pieces that are reminiscent of my purple Picabo patterns. And that was amazing experience. Or like laser cutting machines. I take puppet and Ricardo and a whole other world. What happens when the machine cuts it out and he had these little burned edges and you know, how those things start to impact the, the message. And I just, I'd be excited to be able to, to play with it even more. Um, I think what becomes a biggest attorneys accessibility. It's expensive. It's hard to get access to. So, um, especially once you're outside and you don't have access to like a university or anything like that. How do you, how do you use this equipment, um, in your work? So, um, yeah, I'd be excited to, to try to learn to use it more and uh, it's, it provides another way for you to have that communication.

Speaker 5:          42:48          So any other way that I can try to use a technology and I've used it for sharing the stories and I'm collecting to have this online archive for an online alter. Um, so I, I try to use it as much as possible, but I think that, um, there's also some deterrent because of the accessibility of it too. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. The big machines are talking about too. I mean, just in how they collide though, how you can take the old school in the classic with like the new technology. So, and there's like three d printers now too. Yeah, yeah. Three d printing. I'd love to, to mess around with that kind of machinery. Yeah. Nice. Well, so now I'm going to open it up to the audience as well. You have any questions at all please. This is your time to, um, there's the, uh, microphone, neither one. We were talking about the one you can throw around cube. Anybody have questions?

Speaker 1:          43:39          Yeah.

Speaker 8:          43:47          Hi everyone. My name is Eric. So first of all, thank you guys for spending an afternoon with us. I thought this was really interesting and really awesome and I'm really happy that you guys came by. Uh, so now my question is, uh, a few months ago there was like a, um, a case in Canada where a rider was criticized for saying that other writers and artists should take and write from the point of view of different ethnicities, cultures, genders, and backgrounds. And so I was kind of curious to hear what you guys thought. If you would encourage others to sort of take the point of view of people that come from different backgrounds that they do.

Speaker 5:          44:24          I think that's a big responsibility. It is. Yeah. I only have my own view and I can't expect everybody to, to respect,

Speaker 2:          44:32          um, or accept my point of view on a whole of a culture. I don't know at this need. I don't think that's, I mean, it's right. I think any artist out there that's making work, I mean, they're true aspiration should be to convey a truly honest perspective of their own. So I feel like being able to share that, I mean, that's how other people are able to learn about it. Right? But to put yourself in a different place, it's, it's, it gets tricky. Of course, you don't want to be put in a position where you're the spokesperson for everyone and that just doesn't seem fair. It's important to be inclusive, to be aware, um, but to, to be put in the position of, you know, I'm the spokesperson for Latinos and I would never want that. You know, that responsibility is too many, too many voices out there to be heard. So yeah, that's, that's a pretty tough criticism. Yeah. So that's what a lot of hard work. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

Speaker 8:          45:32          definitely. And I mean, I completely agree. Like it's, I mean, there's the variety of opinions about it, I guess. Um, and you know, like on one side, you know, you should say like, oh, you know, if by encouraging people to talk about cultures that are different than their own, you encourage them to, uh, find commonalities to find ways to, to, to empathize. And then from the other point of view, kind of like you said, it's, well, there are many people that could talk about this particular experience. So why is somebody that may not have as much experience or knowledge in that background take it upon themselves to, to talk about it. Um, so I was kinda curious to hear what you guys thought. So thank you.

Speaker 2:          46:08          Thank you. Thank you for the question.

Speaker 1:          46:13          So

Speaker 2:          46:14          cool ladies, thank you so much for being here and I want to take it to the business perspective. Um, women traditionally make 72 cents of the dollar of males. Um, black women make 62 cents and Latinos even less. So I'm wondering, in terms of your male counterparts as artists, when you're comparing art to art, um, do you find yourself having to or not making as much as men do in the industry? Why did we choose to price it less than that? What know are people wanting you to charge you less because you're women or Latinas?

Speaker 1:          46:54          That's interesting.

Speaker 2:          46:59          I've seen that on both ends of the different artists I've worked with since being in Los Angeles. Like the more, you know, like the more recognize like male figure and you know, a woman that's been like struggling and really putting in the work like since she began like decades ago, you know, and uh, just realizing like that there's, that like women tend to kind of like underprice their work or like, like I don't, it's, it is, it's difficult I think, uh,

Speaker 4:          47:36          as a woman artist, it's, um, it's important not to under price my work, um, to value my work for the years that I've been creating art and it's been 30 long years. Um, and I think it's a huge responsibility for the artists, the young artists who are following me to open the door for them, not only through my art, but through my business sense. So you educate people to pay. If they want a piece of your art, they want piece of your soul, they're paying for it.

Speaker 2:          48:11          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          48:12          Properly. And if they don't buy it at that price and they don't deserve it, they don't buy at that price, somebody else will, you know, and I have little little pieces you can get a little piece about this big, we could take pat home. That'll be fine. Nice.

Speaker 5:          48:26          I got it. Yeah. You just got know your yeah.

Speaker 4:          48:28          Worth it. Like, you know, stick to it. And it's hard because a lot of artists are not business people. I see here it's difficult to separate because you're emotionally involved to this, this piece of art. But then what you do is you find somebody who you trust to represent your art

Speaker 2:          48:47          and, and to market it that way. Yeah. Yeah. I,

Speaker 5:          48:52          I struggle with that a lot as well because I,

Speaker 2:          48:56          okay.

Speaker 5:          48:56          I worry about accessibility and I think that when like all those things are true, uh, pricing and the time, that's an end, what you've invested, where your career is at, all of those things that factor into pricing. And then some of the things I worry about is like, who can buy that? Who is going to be able to buy that? Who am I making it for? And, um, even though I know it's not going to make me very much money, I want my artwork to be accessible, I want it, I don't want it to be unreasonable and attainable for people to be able to purchase. So I, I need to hire a business person. I feel like I want to, I want a little of both. I think that creating tiers of work that you could sell for different prices helps to, to make things that are accessible and um, you know, there you have bigger ideas that a lot of my work is installation artwork too.

Speaker 5:          49:48          So there's never like really, I don't really intend on, it's a, it's a temporary installation and exist for that point in time. So sales a lot of times aren't really, the driving force is more like, how can I complete this idea? Um, I, I just moved back to Los Angeles after living away for six years. And, um, this past year that I've been back, I've really been like forced to think the people in the friends that I've met are really made me think a lot about pricing. And I was sort of a living in, I feel like my own little dream world of I just want to do the idea, man. I'm just trying to get this idea out there. The cash wasn't even about it. It wasn't an in, that's the kind of the struggling part. So that's why I teach

Speaker 7:          50:27          for Leo. That's one of the reasons why I teach it.

Speaker 5:          50:32          I know that. So I can have that, that freeness to be able to like create what I want to create and not be driven by the price, but it's a, it's a struggling game of back and forth. And you know, Yolanda is very established and, and has a lot of years and I think that, I hope one day to kind of get to a level where I can be a lot more demanding with it too. Um, but I also think, uh, it, there's a line too about where you want to be open and have people find you and get to know you and, and create that relationship through being a little more accessible. Um, yeah, it's difficult. It's very difficult.

Speaker 4:          51:10          I think as far as accessibility. If somebody comes into the studio and they really want a piece instead of lowering the price, you know, it's a small piece or something, I'll just give it to them.

Speaker 1:          51:22          Okay.

Speaker 7:          51:23          You're like, I got payment plans. No, no. [inaudible] I just say take it, take it. If you want it, take it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          51:32          But, but, um, and then there's also like, I have a watercolor series. It's really, really reasonable for my work and, but some of the paintings now, you know, when I was your guys's age, I would paint five, six, seven, 10 paintings in a week. It was

Speaker 7:          51:47          now been on [inaudible] shoulder, but now, you know,

Speaker 4:          51:55          once a month, it's just, it's, you know, it's closed down, but it, but that's just where I'm at. You know, that's his, that's this with 30 years of, of the process is taking me and I have to be accepting of that. I'm not 25 anymore, you know, but, um, anytime you need you, you want to come over and talk, you know, we'll talk. I'm there. I'm open to that. Any other questions?

Speaker 1:          52:23          Okay.

Speaker 3:          52:24          So I'm going to end with one last one since. Any other questions? Um, so we have 'em back to the next generation. I'd love, there's a ton of people who not only are digital natives, right, they don't know anything else but the online world, but also are really intrigued or really want to explore art as part of who they are. Maybe it's their career as part of their, what advice can you give them for this next generation of artists? You know, I always believe that can just have technology, can just have art. I think the combination works really nicely now, especially now with steam, right? Where you can do both. Um, what, what advice can you give the next generation of people or kids who want to pursue art?

Speaker 1:          53:14          Okay.

Speaker 4:          53:15          I think just, just, it's just the old classic, you know, follow your dream. But now the dream is very large and vast with, with the Internet. Um, and I think it's amazing for them to have that accessibility to the Internet. But I also think that the classic way of learning art is very important. So I think if there's a way to have the classic way of learning art, which is pencil, charcoal still life, you know, um, and then transfer that into the internet, you know, and combine it and incorporate it and collaborate with it. I think that's the fascinating part of the new art we're going to be seeing, um,

Speaker 5:          53:57          in the future. You know, know where you come from. Continue to be curious, explore and just continue to ask questions like within your own work. Definitely. Nice. Um, I dunno, I, I, I've thought about this question a few different ways. There's a lot of artists now who solely exist on social media, like their main venues are on social media and they have a really hard time doing the classic stuff. You know, the nap again, like I'm already got this many followers and they're all, you know what I mean? Like it's, it's a different way of thinking, but I think that's the challenge of how the classic and the traditional still engage that newer age because they found ways to bypass a lot of the traditional stuff. Why do I need to learn how to draw the figure if I'm doing, you know, um, specific performances and random spots in la and I'm getting, uh, you know, commissions and they're getting paid for doing it.

Speaker 5:          54:59          So it's, it's the challenge that I think that the institution hasn't quite yet led up to learning how to teach those students how to keep up with it all because they're struggling with keeping up with that new technology. Um, I, I think too, that I remember being a student and that this the, the mode of thinking being like concept, concept, concept and those things are really amazing. Um, you need, if you're, if you're wanting to be an artist, there's different types of artists. Some people just paint in their basements and never expose it to the public. It's about that moment that they're creating. And it's not really about sharing it with everybody. Some other people have the yearning to want to share it out in the public. And it's about that communication, the way that people perceive it in a public space. And that's what drives that force.

Speaker 5:          55:45          So I don't know that would have like one piece of advice for artists. It would be like, you know, what's your, what's your main goal for this? You know? Um, yeah, it's like stem is huge right now in schools and you hear like, I'm looking for jobs all the time and they want to know how you can incorporate stem into your curriculum. And a, I think that accelerating lead, it's more important because the schools have stripped away like a lot of those artists and creatives out of the school, but they want to bring it on on again as an educational component to teach them, to teach them science, to teach them all these other things. But where can art exist just for art? Like white, when you're a kid, you think you're thinking about concept. No, you're remembering that fun part of why you want to make art of what it is to create. And it's important not to lose that were so strained, I think, to have this greater, bigger social message. And those things are very important, but there should also still live a space where you can just be free to create just because, and you may not know why, but it, it, it, you need to have that happen at the same time that other people are more driven by that message. So to have both existing simultaneously, I think, and not knock people down for having a different way of thinking about it or working with it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          56:59          That's great. I agree completely. I think there's a space for both also separately. Yeah. And together. Why not? Yeah. Again, thank you so, so much. You've been wonderful. Thank you for sharing such beautiful personal stories for allowing us to have and share your beautiful work right here in our halls. Um, and just for being here today. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies.
