Speaker 1:          00:06          All right. Welcome Google New York. Thank you so much for joining us today. I'm Jessie Haynes. I'm the director of product for the Google good theme, which is a team that makes tech accessories for Google hardware and I am third build it to be joined here today by Randy Zuckerberg. Thanks guys. I am thrilled to be here and even I'm wearing polka dots and honor of, uh, my, my new show. It's just like, oh man, I can't wait to talk all about it. A brief introduction. Randy is an entrepreneur, investor, bestselling author and media personality. I'm an early employee at Facebook. She led major marketing initiatives in the company his formative years and has gone on against my, you guys. I'm so, I was like, am I allowed in the building when I signed him? That's good. Thank you. But yes, those, not that she's gone on to launch Zuckerberg media with the mission of creating media content that's puts intelligent tech savvy, entrepreneurial women and girls at the forefront.

Speaker 1:          01:07          She has published two books. Dot. Complicated and New York Times bestseller and dot. A Children's book about a tech savvy little girl, which we're going to talk about today and which you are able to purchase after this session back. Um, in addition to books, Randy is an executive producer on three television shows, all the holds a business talk radio show on Sirius Xm and has performed on Broadway, which I think is just the coolest thing ever. Um, she is the mother of two boys and a proud resident of our fair city, New York. So once again, welcome to Google radio. Thanks. Um, so as we were talking about before, I was thrilled to read the piece that you wrote in vogue a couple of months back where you talked about leaving Silicon Valley and coming here to New York. So why don't we start there. Tell us a little bit about what motivated that move, um, and what's making you happiest here in the baker or, well, gosh, it was a, it's a really tough time.

Speaker 1:          02:11          I grew up here in New York. I grew up in Westchester and, uh, so I guess a little bridge and tunnel, but that's okay. Um, and, uh, I, I always just, I was one of those New York snobs where I thought like, wow, people can be happy outside of New York, like p, like people live outside of New York and not just ironically. Um, and uh, so then of course I wound up spending a decade in California. It wasn't supposed to be a decade. I thought I'm going to go out and I'm going to work in silicon valley for a few months. And then a few months turned into a decade, a public company to children. And, um, I, I never really put down my roots in California because I always just assumed I was going back to New York. And finally I looked at my husband and I was like, we've been here a decade.

Speaker 2:          03:00          Like we haven't picked a school for our kids. We don't have friends. Like we keep talking like, we're going to move to New York any second. Like we're at a point where you need to actually pick a path and do it. And, um, I started having kids really made me take a step back and, and look a little more at the world that we lived in. I love Silicon Valley. It's an increase. I mean, I'm sure all of us have spent a lot of time out at, at headquarters and out there and it's just this heady place of innovation and excitement and everyone, like, like, what are we disrupting today? Whose lunch are reheating? Yeah. Like it's so fun. But um, but it's a one industry town. And what I loved about New York is I love that you can walk down the street and see people from every country speaking every language.

Speaker 2:          03:47          Like I love that kids can learn about Picasso in school and then walk to a museum and see your Picasso and, and there's so many amazing things you can hit in one day in the city. And, um, I, at the end of the day, juggling between the two, I just, that's what I wanted for my family. That's what I wanted for myself. I wanted, um, that, that big city, uh, not single industry town. So I'm thrilled to be back. We've been here about a year and I'm still in the New York honeymoon phase. So even, you know, like stepping over the cockroaches on the street and everything. I'm like, it's a beautiful car garage. So I know we'll talk about it again in a year. It's great. Well you're, you know, it's, it's, it's great to hear your enthusiasm and passion for this city. And I think a lot of us here at Google, um, love being New Yorkers and working at Google New York, but you know, but the headquarters is in mountain view and there is always sort of that pullback since in your year here, what have been your observations about the tech scene here in New York and how that differs from, one of the things that I love is that I feel like the city itself here is part of the tech scene in silicon valley.

Speaker 2:          05:02          It's very separate. You get on your luxury shuttle bus and you get busted and then you kind of stay at headquarters all day and you have all your meals, they redo everything and then you go home. Um, but here we all, we ride the subway, we were pool, you know, we like you, the city itself is as much a part of the tech culture as the sites that we're working on and building, like we come into contact with the people we are building for every day, which is not something that always happens out there in silicon valley. A lot of times I found that we had to guess like we, you know, and often a bunch of times it's early adopters inside a company that you end up building things that are just for yourself because you're not spending that time with people. So that was, that was what I thought.

Speaker 2:          05:47          It was really exciting. I think also because a lot of the investors and the VC's out here come from a more traditional finance background. Like they, they want to fund, I'm not sure how to say this 100% nicely. The livestream. They want to fund real businesses and real businesses that will grow over the long term. Um, so there, I've found that investors here, they're, they're okay with companies that take a decade to build because they're in it for the long haul. That's what they've seen. That's what they've known or is in Silicon Valley because a lot of the investors used to be founders, entrepreneurs themselves. There's that mindset of like, turnaround a company quickly, create something, sell it, do this. They're not in it for the long term as much out here as I see

Speaker 1:          06:34          in New York. So in that vogue piece, you talked about how being in New York has allowed you to bring together tech, performing arts, entrepreneurial women, and even just sort of seeing your bio again today, I just am dazzled by all of the fascinating sort of things that you've got going in your on in your life, TV show, on oxygen, a radio show, your books, and now your children's book. Dot is being turned into a kids show. Um, which one of these projects is your favorite? Or is that just, oh my gosh, it's really hard to,

Speaker 2:          07:14          but I think, um, it all kind of stems from the same place. And after again, uh, being in Silicon Valley with amazing. But one thing I love about being here in New York, like I look out at the same room at all of these incredible women that are here. And uh, it was, it got lonely at times in Silicon Valley. Uh, I remember in the early days of working there I would send emails to people for meetings and I guess they thought Randy was a guy and I'd show up and people would be visibly disappointed for a young woman to walk into the room. And, uh, after I left Facebook and I took some time to think about what my next step was, I thought I was going to go right into building my own social media company. I think everyone thought I was going to do that too. And I took some time to realize, okay, how do we actually get more women in the room?

Speaker 2:          08:04          Um, a lot of people have a lot of ideas on this and the hypothesis I kept coming back to was that maybe it comes from pop culture. Maybe it comes from media, maybe it comes from young girls seeing role models to look up to on screen that are tech savvy and entrepreneurial and smart. And so instead of diving right into doing my own social media company, I created Zuckerberg media. I'm thinking, how could I put more smart, intelligent tech savvy women and girls into pop culture? Um, and that's why I have my hand in so many things because as we all know, our audiences everywhere, they're not just watching one TV channel, they're not just on one website. So, um, I felt I needed to be on the radio. I needed to have my hand in TV shows on different channels. I needed to be creating content for online.

Speaker 2:          08:51          And uh, but every morning I wake up and I think about how infuse more, uh, women and girls into pop culture. Tell us a little bit more about the book. What was obviously that I came from the same place, but how, why a children's book and then how did the TV show happened? I was actually, I was writing a business book at the time. I didn't even mean to write a children's book. I was writing a business book called Dot complicated because I think what we all understand is that tech has changed every aspect of our lives. You, this room is responsible for that. Um, in so many wonderful ways. It's created so much opportunity in our lives, in our businesses. Um, but tech also sometimes makes us want to rip her hair out of our head and frustration. And, uh, it's changed the way we parent.

Speaker 2:          09:41          I feel like here I was, I was writing a book it from the perspective of a tech expert. And yet I was a purely a, a mature mom when it came to raising kids in the digital age. And I looked at my son and how he was engaging with tech and I thought, oh my gosh, if I wait until people can read dot complicated, it's too late. I need to start with a children's book. So I created dot, which is about a super techie little girl, but she learns to find balance. So in the beginning of the book, it's like dot. Knows how to swipe and tap and search. Um, and then she goes outside and when she's Swiping, she's finger painting. And when she's tapping, she's dancing and searching, just playing hide and go seek. So, um, it's really important for that was a really wonderful project for me.

Speaker 2:          10:27          And, uh, when I got the opportunity to collaborate with the Jim Henson Company and NBC to actually turn the show from a book, uh, turn, turn it from a book into a show 52 episodes, which is really exciting. So, um, I, I jumped at the opportunity, I have crazy respect for like Pixar and everyone in animation now after seeing how much work it takes to create one 10 minute episode of this show and seeing, uh, the beautiful animation that happens in films, but it's, um, it's just been the coolest experience that's so exciting. And this, and it premieres at the 22nd of all, it does this Saturday. Um, but it's like, imagine walking into a startup like with the giant screens and everything, but dot. It's on every screen. Like that's what I felt when I walked into the animation house. Like I had, it felt very emotional. She's the daughter I never had.

Speaker 2:          11:22          And of course here I am doing all this like feminist content and I have two sons, but it's great. I know me too. But our boys will like. Dot. Right. Exactly. Oh yeah, man. I mean my son was two when the book came out. Now he's five. And so he's basically grown up with dot. He feels real ownership for this character is, uh, it's pretty exciting. But so just to give you a sense of the show, like dot and her friends, they don't do anything the way normal kids do tech pluses up, everything. So all the other kids on the block might be having a lemonade stand buttoned dots and delivers via drone because why would she forced the customer to come to the lemonade when the, she could scale by the lemonade going to the customer. Um, so every episode you see dot. And her group of friends using technology in a really funny way. And uh, and it's, it's great. We even have like a Pokemon go inspired episode, which is fine.

Speaker 1:          12:18          Love that. Um, so you do have a lot going on. Um, and I think a lot of us here have a lot going on. Um, how do you, and you know sometimes how do you balance it, balance it all or, or, or do you, and I think I was found a tweet from, from uh, a while back where you said the entrepreneur's dilemma, maintaining friendships, building a great company, spending time with family, staying fit, getting sleep, pick three. Um, and I love that because I actually think that sometimes this focus on balance sort of sets up unrealistic expectations.

Speaker 2:          13:04          Wait, and I don't think this is not just a thing for entrepreneurs or for moms or for women. I mean this is for everyone in life. Like I talked to my son, I'm like, sorry, you can't play in the sandbox and eat cake at the same time. Like you have to find balance and picks. So, but yeah, so that's kind of my mantra. Every day I wake up and I'm like, family, friends, fitness, sleep, work, pick three. And each day you can only pick three of those. You can pick a different three each day. So as long as it balances out over the long run, it's a, it's okay, but you really, you can't do all five of those things well in one day. And so I think the key is just, um, you know, knowing that it's okay to be well lopsided in the short term as long as you, you know, are well lopsided the other direction, the longterm.

Speaker 1:          13:52          And what about technology? Um, and how an end, you know, you've, you've written a lot about trying to figure out the right balance of technology in our lives and the importance of unplugging, which is so easy to say, but so hard to do

Speaker 2:          14:08          is, and it's so funny how many of us, like we have these rules for our children that we think about. And then if we kind of looked into mirrored or own behavior, like what poor role models we are of those exact roles. So it's always funny because I feel like people always ask, okay, Randy, what are your rules for your children? What are your rules in your house? But so few people ask me, Randy, what are your rules for yourself? And where would they be? Like, you know, where do they think my children are learning their behaviors from? So, uh, I, I remember when Asher, my oldest son was six months old, he started picking up a remote, a TV remote and making texting thumbs with it. And I was like, oh gosh, I think I to adjust my own behavior a little bit in front of him.

Speaker 2:          14:53          So, um, we definitely have PR, prolonged periods of unplugging, which is difficult. I don't recommend going cold Turkey on unplugging for anyone that's starting out. Like the first time I did, I hold my phone in my hand still for most of the day, even though I, but sometimes now I'll even like, I'll go so crazy. It's like sometimes put my phone on airplane mode. Whoa. Um, and uh, but I, and I've also had to train myself and the people around me and how I respond to email because I know, especially in tech culture, like there's a lot of pressure to be always on, to be answering emails. Someone sends you an email, you need to respond, whether it's the middle of the night. And, and a few minutes later, um, and I, I, I felt like, okay, no one else is going to create boundaries for you, but if you create them yourself, you will start to train the people around you how to treat you.

Speaker 2:          15:44          So I, you know, just slowly started to say like, okay, I'm, you know, don't respond to emails as quickly on weekends or to my team. Uh, you might get an email from me at midnight and that is not because I expect you to respond. That is because like, that is the first time I've gotten to myself after I've been able to put my kids down to bed and do everything else and that's when I work. So, um, I think definitely creating those boundaries back to kids though, I think there are so many amazing ways to introduce children to tech that doesn't require screens all the time. Uh, there's so many great toys out there that have encouraged and still love of building engineering, coding. We just bought for our sons the Coda Pillar, the Fisher price code, a pillar. It's this caterpillar and it comes with all of these interchangeable parts.

Speaker 2:          16:34          Like you code it, you know, go, go left, go right, make a noise dance and you, you make a start, a green start and a red finish. And uh, the kid has to decide, okay, how do I program the parts of the Caterpillar to get it to start here and end here and you can root around. And so there's like a little robots. We have all kinds of fun things. So we definitely do a lot to encourage a love of programming logic, uh, engineering in our household while trying to limit screen time for our kids. Um, it did not know about the Coda. Yeah. Lot of felons available on Amazon.

Speaker 1:          17:11          Um, I hope so. Um, so we talked a little bit about, um, women in tech and at Google. We've done a lot of investigating here on time. How can we, can we, you know, address this issue and people have pointed to the lack of women studying stem in school as a reason. There are fewer women in tech. And, and you've talked about this role model, um, sort of lack of role models. What, um, what do you think in your observation is, is working, um, and you know, since you've taken this sort of media, are

Speaker 2:          17:50          there some, you know, how's it been encouraging signs that you've seen of sort of impact and the tide changing? Well, first of all, I think New York is really a place silicon valley can take a real lesson from New York and this perspective. I mean, we can still do much better with women and enrolls in tech, but, um, it's incredible the amount of women in higher positions in tech female founders that we're seeing here in New York. Um, I also think it's because there's so many other industries, like I said, it's not a single industry town. So we're used to seeing women at the top of media companies at the top of publishing houses at the top of ad agencies. Like, that's not such a weird thing here as a as it is. Um, I think it starts a, I think there's, this is almost like a multipronged problem, right?

Speaker 2:          18:35          It starts obviously in the house. Um, it starts in the schools. It's really, it's around age seven or eight that all the studies show that girls suddenly wake up to the fact that society is telling them that they shouldn't be good at math and engineering and science. And, uh, so I think it, it's pop culture. It's our schools is what they're learning at homes. But then, I mean, it's definitely also has to come from, from effort in, uh, in our companies. Um, there were, you know, I recently was talking to a team of investors out in silicon valley and they were like, Randy, we really want you to invest in our fund. And I was like, cool, you have no female partners. So like, come back to me when you do. And they're like, but we tried so hard, we just like, couldn't find anyone. I'm like, well, yes, diversity takes effort. It takes effort, like try harder and then come back to me. It's my money. I have a right to, uh, to decide how I'm going to spend it and how I'm going to invest it. So I think it takes people standing up and saying things like that and that, you know, takes reminding people that yes, diversity does take that little bigger step of effort, but it's worth it. Definitely.

Speaker 2:          19:49          Um, you've led a lot of teams through your career and, um, have been regaled as a strong manager and a mentor. Tell us about some of the mentors that you've had in your life. Oh my gosh. I've been so lucky to have so many great mentors. Um, Kathleen Kennedy of Lucas Film. Um, I mean, it's incredible to think that the president of Lucasfilm is a woman. Um, so she's clearly spent a lot of time in a man's world, um, but she has been an incredible ally and an asset to me. Um, I recently spent some time to Susie Orman who just like what, first of all, I was like, everything that they portray on SNL is totally accurate and fun. But, um, she, you know, she created such an incredible empire from nothing on empowering women with their finances. And so that was really amazing to learn from her and get some advice from her in world.

Speaker 2:          20:47          And, um, I've just, I've also been so lucky, I've been learning from a lot of the women, uh, who are at the head of dot. Like Lisa Henson, who runs Henson, um, has been an incredible mentor to me. Navigating La, um, the head of sprout at NBC as a woman. So like.is a, is a real girl power show. And also like, I love guys too. Like I see a lot of guys in this audience. That's awesome. Thanks for supporting. Amazing. So I've had a lot of incredible, uh, male mentors in my life too. And, um, I, I do think that there's a lot of pressure on all of us and especially in the tech world to kind of figure it out ourselves, do what ourselves do it fast. But what partnering on projects like Dot has shown me is that there are a lot of instances where one plus one equals four. When you trust people, when you put your faith and, and, uh, you accept mentorship from other people. And, um, I took this asset as far as I could and it never would have, it would have stopped there without including folks like Jim Henson and sprout.

Speaker 1:          21:52          Yeah. Yeah. So it seems only appropriate since you've been such a proponent of women to take a little moment to talk about our election since women have then it's front and center in so many ways. In the recent months. Um, there was a editorial that in the, in the Times that commented on Michelle Obama's recent speech in November where she reflected on the recent happenings. Um, and I think the exact was oh, really beautiful was it wasn't quite in a remarkable speech. Um, that misogyny is the midwife of history, which I thought was a really interesting way to sort of sum it up. Um, what are some of your reflections on what's been happening in this crazy election and do you think that come November, we will have elected the first woman president.

Speaker 2:          22:53          All right. Well, I, it's interesting. So my, um, my kind of emotional connections with elections started back in the 2008 election. That was my first election that I really worked on at Facebook. And actually we worked hand in hand with Google on, on that election. And I remember we would big candidates to get onto social media and most of the candidates like hung up on us or we're like, sorry, we're not interested in the social media generation. Um, and things like that. Like I went with the team from Google and we sat at the Republican National Convention and no one met with us for the entire time because like, no one cared about the internet and you know, whatever. Um, and uh, so it was amazing to me to even fast forward just a few years to midterm election and to see that I actually knew who was running for every office and before the media or the public did because the first thing they would do is like set up their Facebook page behind the scenes so they could press click when they, when they launched their campaign.

Speaker 2:          24:01          Um, so that was really amazing to me to see in just that short period of time and now to look at this election, which is complete. Everything is playing out online, on social media. Every single aspect of it is about like what's going viral and, um, how were we sharing content? And it's, it's just been incredible for me to see an eight years how the game has shifted so completely to people saying we don't care about the Internet and social media to an entire election decided on, on, and by the Internet. So first of all, as crazy as it is, like the Internet has won this election, so Yay. Um, but that being said, it is, uh, it is really crazy. I don't think any of us could have believed this and to be totally honest, I think all of the incredible tools that all of us have created, um, have both empowered a world where anyone could have a voice, but also created a world where anyone can have a voice.

Speaker 2:          25:06          And A, we are sort of seeing, like I said, everything is dot complicated. Like my book, we've created tools that have empowered Arab spring that have given voices to the voiceless. But like Donald Trump has a huge voice, thanks to all the tools that we've done. Um, and uh, I so I think that's why it's going to be really interesting for, I think all of us to take a step back after this election plays out and really think, okay, you know, what are the positive sides of technology? What are the downsides? How should tech be used to build brands and empower elections? And, uh, I really, I really do hope we see a woman in the White House and two and a half weeks. Great. So audience, um, please come to the microphones and we're going to open this up for questions. And while that's happening, I just have a quick speed round for you, right?

Speaker 2:          25:59          You Ready? Awesome. IPHONE or android? It's okay. Phone, but my husband has an android so that we're both okay. Okay. We'll forgive you. That's like a new, you know, modern family uptown or downtown. Uptown upper west. Google or bing. Come on. But funny story though, I did accidentally get being locked into my iPhone once for a few weeks and I was like, I had to like physically go to google.com to search for things and I was like, no. Okay. Hamlet or Hamilton. Oh my gosh. Okay. Right now Hamilton. But I am, you know, a classical girl by heart, so I am going to have to tie that one. Okay. Okay. Croissant or Bagel, what about the mixture? Don't they have the leg? Like the breath sounds like? I'm sure like some bakery is making that somewhere I want. I want. Okay. Uber or taxi. Subway. Got, I'm do like the real New York getting ready. I only rarely say whatever's faster. Totally good answer. Perfect. All right, great. We've got some folks at the mix and let's open it up.

Speaker 3:          27:15          So I have a question about the women and um, young girls growing up with this idea that they're not good at math or science. Um, I think the first time I heard that was when I was like out of college. And frankly, it really surprised me because growing up my math class, my advanced math classes, advanced science classes, girls probably out numbered boys and like two to one. And so I truthfully to always thought girls who are smarter than boys. Um, and I wonder, I wonder if sometimes if by repeating that we actually do ourselves a disservice. Yeah. Rather than just focusing our energy on things like dot. And promoting more women in, um, women in sciences, in the media, rather than even just acknowledging that. Because sometimes I get frustrated when I hear women talking about it more because I feel like it perpetuates the myth.

Speaker 2:          28:02          I think you're totally right on that. And it was interesting when we were coming up with all the episodes for dot people, uh, some of the people in the writing team kept pitching episodes that were like, dot. Overcomes this bias. And finally, a few of us were like, wait. Dot doesn't think she's worse than the boy is. Like, what bias does she have to overcome? She doesn't even know that, that everyone thinks she's not supposed to measure up. So, um, we were like kids today, they don't, that's not even, why should we put that idea into their head if that's not in their head already? So I think you're absolutely right. I would love to, to live in a world where that's not even an issue when I think we are seeing that more and more with kids that um, there's not like girl shows and boys show is or this. But I think as long as we continue to walk into toy stores and see like that pink aisle and that blue while and um, and Halloween costumes and different things like that, like that, that is perpetuating it without us even thinking we're perpetuating it. Um,

Speaker 4:          29:03          okay.

Speaker 2:          29:03          But I agree. I think less talking about it is probably the way to go.

Speaker 4:          29:09          What we're doing.

Speaker 2:          29:13          You guys both continents. Hi. Um, hi. Thank you for coming in. Um, I'm a mom. I also have two kids. I have a nine year old son and a five year old daughter. Um, and I'm curious if with all of the initiatives that you're doing around women and creating a show about girls, if your sons ever ask you why you're focused on girls. My son has started calling me a sexist, which I think he's picking up from the Trump stuff. I'm like, okay, it's not about better than it's equal. And then my

Speaker 3:          29:42          daughter's there and I don't want her to hear that we're not equal yet and get like this weird insecurities. So I'm curious if your boys have picked up on your female initial interesting. My oldest is five,

Speaker 2:          29:52          so maybe he hasn't quite picked up. He's never mentioned anything or send anything. He did ask me. So I went to a high school in New York called Horace Mann. And uh, he did ask me when I told him why it's not called Horace woman.

Speaker 3:          30:06          Um, and I was like, well, that's like someone's name. Okay, good. That's great. I was like, Yay. Raising boys. Um, but so I don't, it hasn't been an issue yet.

Speaker 2:          30:19          I mean that being said, she wanted to come and go as my little pony for Halloween. So I know he's definitely not seeing gender differences in content, but um, that is a good question and I will definitely have to think about how to respond to that one when it comes around. Yes.

Speaker 3:          30:36          Yeah. If you find anything, let us know. Maybe make another story about, yeah, I think, I think it's a, it's a

Speaker 2:          30:42          great idea and um, uh, but it's, it's been funny to see, we lined up to see the motorcade because President Obama came to the apartment building next to us a few minutes ago to do a fundraising event and he was like all excited and we were talking about how well like next it's going to be a woman's turned to me and the White House and he's like, maybe we'll men have a turn.

Speaker 3:          31:05          No, again, one day.

Speaker 2:          31:06          And I was like, probably once the country sees how awesome women, they weren't running the problem.

Speaker 5:          31:16          Hey, thanks for being as quite top. Yeah. My question is around this, we've kind of moved into this world of post fact politics or whatever you want to call it. And I'm from the UK as you can probably hear and we just had the Brexit a few months ago. Um, and all of us as we scroll through our Facebook feeds, that's where it feeds youtube, wherever it might be. The algorithmic nature of those feeds means we end up seeing stuff that we want to see you, right? Yeah. Which is a good user experience. One extent, but that also means we're kind of being insulated and we're not seeing a diverse range of opinions and that sort of stuff. So I was curious to see if you had an opinion on as creators of those products by Facebook and Google, um, and you know, entrepreneurs that you're working with, how can we strike that balance to make sure that we're inclusive of different opinions, but no, actually, you know, making sure I don't see Donald Trump every day. Ava.

Speaker 2:          32:09          No, it's such a great question because you're right, we do wind up in these, these echo chambers of, uh, of people who think like us. And uh, on one hand it's so great that millennials are getting a lot of their news from social media. I think millennials, young people are more informed than ever before because of how quickly and easily they can access news. But, um, I think it's also part of our responsibility to keep reminding people that if you're actually going to get your news from social media, makes sure you are following a diverse group of people. Um, make sure that you are taking the time to add people on Instagram and Twitter and all of these sites that don't agree with you and that, um, represent different opinions because you're right, it's so easy to fall into that. I think another kind of sort of point you brought up, like the post fact checking era is, um, it's also a really interesting world because the nature of getting content out fast has made it such that media companies value getting things out quickly rather than getting things out. Right. So I also think it's important, it's more and more important for all of us as consumers to start demanding that quality content. Because if we are positively reinforcing this culture where media is just, okay, let's get things out for the clicks and the click bait and the headlines and fast like it on. I mean in the long run they're doing what we want, what we click on, what we like. So if we start demanding that, that fact checking that better quality content, then that's what we're going to get.

Speaker 4:          33:42          Great. Thanks. Thanks. Hi.

Speaker 2:          33:49          Has Your work brought you to anything with the digital divide and how that's affected education? Yes. We're actually doing a lot of that with dod and had been thinking a lot about that because here we are portraying this adorable girl on the screen with her iPad and everything. But we live in a world where most kids, they don't, you know, can't just pick up an iPad at home. Uh, they can't afford it. They don't have access to it. They don't have parents that are encouraging the tech. So, um, we really went back to the drawing board and tried to introduce a whole range of characters that have different exposures and different levels to tech. Some of the kids that are going to libraries to look things up, um, on shared computers, some have different access in their homes. Um, we also tried to deal a lot with kind of the generational divide in terms of comfort levels because I also feel like a lot of times when you talk to adults about tech, they immediately go to a place of fear.

Speaker 2:          34:45          They're overwhelmed, they're anxious, like a parent's. We immediately think screentime bad, I feel guilty. But kids don't live in that world. They don't feel fear and anxiety about tech. Like the future is fun for kids. And, uh, so I also really had to come to the show from that divide of like trying to overcome my own anxieties and guilt as an adult in this world and to try to think from the perspective of kids. So, um, yes, and every, all the projects that we're working on, we definitely try to address the digital divide and the generational divide. But I, I really appreciate you bringing that up.

Speaker 4:          35:23          Okay.

Speaker 2:          35:25          Other question.

Speaker 4:          35:29          I know there's a few ads there.

Speaker 2:          35:32          Can we talk about, I have odd way that's super fun. Um, so my dream in life was with never really to like work in tech, although I blended my dream in life was to sing on Broadway and then I got to college and I got rejected from the music major, flat out rejected and they were like, don't feel bad. Yo Yo ma also got rejected.

Speaker 3:          35:53          I was like, cause I don't know, it doesn't make me feel any better. Like I feel just as bad.

Speaker 2:          35:57          Um, and uh, I thought I had given up on my dream. I was like, okay, by dream singing on Broadway. And then I moved out to California and um, I know you guys are familiar with the hackathon. So at one hackathon at Facebook I created an eighties rock band called feed bomb. And our motto was we play for free and you get what you pay for pretty mediocre. But about two years ago, I got a call in my living room from the producers rock of ages on Broadway 80. It's rock musical. And they were like, we saw your feed bomb videos and we're looking for a new kind of guest star for our musical who can kind of bring in a social media audience. Do you want to come star on Broadway? So after um, all of that, uh, my, sometimes you give up on your dreams and they come back and find you. But now it's fun because I owe, people always come up to, you're like, Randy, how do you get to Broadway? And I'm like,

Speaker 3:          36:53          can you learn to code? You got some Broadway. Sorry.

Speaker 6:          37:00          I was wondering if you're worried about the increasing prevalence of consumption only devices. Like as an example, when I was very young growing up, like it was, uh, easier to write a hello world program in basic on like an old Ms dos computer. Like that was easier than trying to figure out how to make the CD rom drive. We can load in windows suite I want for instance. But nowadays, like I'll be on the subway and there's all these kids playing with iPads and phones and whatever, but you can't really program them on the device. And I have the feeling that they don't have access to like a real computer at home either. Yeah. So was it like his program and becoming less accessible for young kids? He stays.

Speaker 2:          37:35          That's a great question cause I think, um, on one hand that question sort of goes back to the question we just had about the digital divide because we have to look at the rest of the world beyond just us. And I mean there are many parts of the world that are skipping computers entirely because mobile phones are all that people have access to. I mean, there's more mobile phones than toilets in the world. Um, and but many countries like when you look at India and Africa are just skipping the computer entirely. So on one hand we need to, uh, I think you are right that we are missing some part of that, but I think we also need to adapt to the world and to the changing environment that people are, um, program that they are using mobile devices and that is where they're getting their content and using everything. And so, um, I think you've just hit on a big opportunity for, uh, for entrepreneurs who are creating the next, uh, coding platforms. Thank you. Well, we have great, hi, my

Speaker 7:          38:36          name is yen and I am a recent graduate. I want to ask you like how do you, um, face failures and how do you, what kind of power do you use to lift yourself up in the moments of, you know, insecurities, um, maybe a job rejections or some kind of failure?

Speaker 2:          38:55          Well, first of all, congratulations. I'm being recent Grad. Um, it's everything that I've done. I have entered a new industry, so like I have no business being in the children's television industry. Like I'd never hosted a radio show. Everything that I'm doing, I'm doing for the first time. So I feel like I'm, the one certainty is that people are going to say no to you and you're going to fail. And so like, Yay, we got that out of the way. Like we can move on and we know it. Um, what I've also learned is that sometimes things that look like failures years later you realize they weren't. And that, so for example, right after I started Zuckerberg media, I created a show on bravo called startups silicon valley. It was a terrible show. Like it was really bad. It lasted one season. It did not get renewed.

Speaker 2:          39:43          Um, and I was like, I failed. My first television show I made was a bomb. Like, how am I going to pick my head up and go back into this industry? And I realized down the line like a, about a year or two later that first of all, um, people in Hollywood, they didn't see that as a failure. They were like, you got a show to series as a first time. He pee. Like, that's awesome. And, uh, it created a relationship for me with NBC who now today is producing sprout. I mean, and, and dot many years later. Um, and so it took me awhile to like scrape myself off the floor, but without doing that show, there's no way that I would be doing any of the things that I'm doing today in media or half those relationships or be taken as seriously. So, um, it's a, I think the, the, the real thing is to be able to endure when you're in that scrape that floor moment to try to see what lies 10 chest moves beyond

Speaker 1:          40:49          king of what lies beyond, Oh, as do we have another question? Great. We'll take one more and then we'll take that year. Um, so I sometimes feel that networking and mentorship can be a little forced. Um, I think Sheryl Sandberg said it best. You don't go up to someone and say, will you be my mentor? You kind of bring that relationship forms over time. Um, I'm in the process of starting working on an idea and I've found myself googling last night, like women organization, entrepreneurial programs and like random things were popping up. I was wondering if you had any recommendations of networks in the city that bring women together for entrepreneur programs? I just would love outside perspective of Google. While I love I'd my colleagues here,

Speaker 2:          41:34          I think it's good to get outside perspective. Okay, great question. And one that I'm sort of still digging my feet into as a newcomer. But one thing I think you brought up that's so important is that I think we're told in the beginning of our careers like, look for that Pie in the sky mentor that's going to like fall of all of your career problems for you and guide you on this path. I'm sorry, but every time I've ever found a person like that, they haven't disappointed the hell out of me. Like they don't, first of all, careers are changing all the time. Like the careers that will exist in 10 years from now don't exist today. So how would that person even know to guide you on that path? Um, and uh, those people also, they're busy. They don't have the time. I have found that the best mentors I've ever had and been my peers, and it's been in creating groups of peers that work in similar industries that you can bounce things out of. And, and over the years, those people rise together. Suddenly they're the leaders in the company. They're the people that people want to network with. And I have just had so much more success in my own career building peer networks rather than searching for that like mentor 18 levels up for me. So, um, I'm going to look into some, some groups for you because I should know this. That's something I should know, but I definitely encourage you also to maybe like start your own even peer circles.

Speaker 2:          42:51          Great. So we're gonna wrap up, but TV shows, radio shows and the books, more TV shows. What is next? Broadway to Broadway. I am producing my first Broadway show, uh, this fall. It's called Dear Evan Hansen. It's actually a musical about cyberbullying that doesn't sound like a really fun thing to have a musical about, but it's a beautiful show. Um, and, uh, one of the stars this from pitch perfect, which we love and, uh, it's so I'm really excited to be actually on the producing side of, of a show on Broadway. Um, I have a project coming out soon that is around the election and women and girls, um, which I'm excited about. And then I'm really excited to see where dot goes from here. Um, hopefully it will inspire a lot of other great content because the change isn't going to happen just from one show there. It needs to be 500 shows like dot everywhere. So, but I'm thrilled. I'm especially in just really thrilled to be here chatting with likeminded folks like you guys who are really thinking about this and who have the power to make a difference in the space. It's really an honor and it's exciting to be here, so thank you. Well, thank you again so

Speaker 4:          44:06          much for spending your afternoon.
