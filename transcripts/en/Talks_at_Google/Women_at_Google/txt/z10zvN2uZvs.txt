Speaker 2:          08:28          [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          08:33          I want to thank you so much. Thank you for the beautiful performance and thank you for taking the time to come and visit with us here in New York. I know you have a lifelong history in here in New York, but having relocated, you've been spending a lot of time back up here. Uh, you were up here a few months ago to receive a lifetime achievement award. Is that correct?

Speaker 1:          08:53          Right, yes. One of those. That's always good.

Speaker 8:          08:57          Now I can die

Speaker 7:          08:59          of a lifetime is what I'm understanding.

Speaker 8:          09:03          Yeah, no, that's cool. I love coming back to New York. I do. I do. I, um, I used to miss it like a person after I left. Um, and now I just like to visit, like we were talking about, we were talking all morning off Mike, so now we get to talk into Mike's. But yeah, now the whole pace of New York and the, just the circus of it, I'm like, wow, cool. Got to go.

Speaker 7:          09:26          Well, and you're here now for kind of a wild event supporting Cindy Lopper and the true colors foundation.

Speaker 8:          09:34          Yeah. Yeah. The benefit to help an organization that tries to get a homeless queer youth, a place to be and people to support them. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          09:47          It brings me to the first topic that I wanted to discuss with you, which is, um, th this, all of these things speak to a career of proactivity. I'm looking back through the, you know, through the years you, you have always been at the, the pointed end of the proactive stick. And I find that interesting and the fact that a lot of artists are very reactive and event would take place and there's a response to it or attribute to some tragedy or, uh, some sort of reaction based. And I'm curious if you can speak about what it's been like to always be in that proactive space instead of just a simple reactive space.

Speaker 8:          10:25          Wow. I dig it. I dig this, the whole, the whole pointed end of the stick. I mean, what's, yeah, Jeez. I mean, I guess like anybody, I've just been trying to speak my truth, my experience, my, my thoughts, my dreams, my perception in my songs, in my writing. And um, I guess personally, I'm always compelled by art that is takes risks, you know? So, um, uh, I've always kind of pushed myself. I used to be really hard to be that in the beginning. You know, I used to, she's who's going to be at this show tonight and on my mom or you know, we'll high. Okay. And what will happen when I say this or, you know what? And a lot happens, you know, when you're like jabbing at stuff and, um, but I would say that the most important thing that happened over the years was that people came out and nowhere and said, me too, or thank you, I'm a guy. And all of that, like hearing people repeatedly say, I can't believe you just said that. Thank you. Just meant so much more than all the rest. So it's kind of encouraged me to just let it go. Those ideas of what's private or personal or inappropriate or this or that or the other. It's like it's all universal. It's none of it's unique.

Speaker 7:          12:03          It's curious that you said it used to be more difficult for you because I would almost think that now is a time period of difficulty for anyone being proactive. There's so much tension and so much pushback to any push that is there. Um, does that weigh in at all when you're, when you're about to step up and make a bold statement of, like you said before, it was the, you know, the idea of all my moms in the audience, I don't want to run a foul of that, but now how, you know, some fraction of the world,

Speaker 8:          12:36          the audience that are even more dangerous than mothers. Yeah. I mean I feel like the was really good to just come out of the box with my mouth and spirit open and just start. I mean, when I was a teenager and I started making my own songs, I, I started pushing against that wall of acceptibility and what you can and cannot say and Ken and cannot be. And really early on I just was like, you know, f it just, just, what's going to happen to me? Let's find out, you know, and 25 whatever it's been, you know, 30 years later, I'm in a great position now. People know, I mean, I weeded out the riff raff a long time ago. You know, people, I think it's much more difficult if you have a secret to let it go. If you've never had secrets, it's easier.

Speaker 8:          13:40          It's better, you know, uh, you know, people used to ask me about coming out or this or then psych. I never was, I was not in anywhere. So, and I think that that from my experience it's better. It's easier to do it that way to just, I had a, a young lady opening up my shows recently who's had some success with a, a song online and she's a lovely, lovely young gal and she's sort of just embarking on a career in music. And she was saying, Oh, you know, I'm weird talking after one night. And she said, I'm pro choice, but I'm so afraid, you know, I Duh Duh, Duh. I come from a traditional family, I this and I that. And I said, just say it, just say it. The sooner you say it, the better. Say who you are, what you believe, what you think. Cause from there it gets easier. Every day,

Speaker 7:          14:38          I'm going to change my plan now that they brought this up because this, this idea of just saying it. Um, I wanted to speak later in the conversation about the idea of directness and metaphor. Um, but we sort of skipped ahead to that in, in your music, there's use of metaphor, but where you really get masterful is with just direct statements or like you said, just taking it head on and tackling it that way. And I'm curious if you can talk about the choices of when you want to say something in a very direct fashion or when you reach a little deeper for metaphor to try and mask and idea or, or, or Bo and ideas. Yeah,

Speaker 8:          15:16          yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. Um, I guess I use, always had maybe just such a burning, every time I see a eastern medicine practitioner and they say, Ooh, your spleen, whoa with the spleen. I'm like, yeah, I know you should see my 20 records, spleen music. And it's just, you know, it's just, I have such an urgent need to, I don't know, beat back lies and silences, um, that often it drives me to just say it. Um, I think that's just, you know, where my music is coming from. Sometimes I'm interested in how could you say it without saying it or how could you say, you know, um, but oftentimes I've, I, the direct route is what is most appealing to me. I used to get a lot of flack for it. Like we were talking about, um, a lot of resistance, a lot of pushback.

Speaker 8:          16:24          I, when you were forming your question, I was remembering the first time I went to Italy to play, we were talking earlier about touring in Europe and um, this was, you know, first time I went to Italy was probably 20 years ago and it was in an age of flack, you know, that I was living in. And I remember the first interview I did an elite and the dude was like, so many artists, you know, they, they, they say, they say it, but they don't say it. They say they laid in bed for the hint that you just did. And I was like, that's good. You're saying that it's good. You know, I'd never heard a positive response to that before. I just remember that. So clearly that moment of maybe somebody thinks that's good.

Speaker 7:          17:14          Well, it's curious with the things that you've chosen to talk about, and we spoke with a little bit about this before as you said, but I was immediately in preparing for this conversation. Just went through the entire catalog again of flashing back.

Speaker 8:          17:30          Can I bless your heart live to tell the tale, the fan.

Speaker 7:          17:37          A couple of things that caught with me where this directness and uh, you know, I mentioned before the song like gratitude. Uh, and recently of course me too has found a life online and this sort of understanding of, of women not being alone in these situations and men as well. In fact, um, but I immediately went back to, was it early nineties when gratitude spoke exactly to that topic. And you know, another example would be like to the teeth. This is something that is decades old at this point, but it's still modern day prescient. Um, when something happens in the world that you have spoken or have tackled directly on that flashes you back 10 years, 20 years into your career, how does that land for you? How does, how do you process something like me too, in light of the fact that 20 years ago you were standing up shouting exactly these words.

Speaker 8:          18:33          Yeah. Sometimes it's a little hard sickening. Um, you know, to the teeth that you mentioned is a song about gun violence. A Song I wrote, I dunno, pushing 20 years ago when I thought it was completely out of hand. Um, so to pull that song out now and play it is, you know, kind of devastating. It's just, and, but things do change and often you think he thinks this is just the way it is. We just have to accept this is the way it is. And then overnight it's not, you know, and this me too moment that we're in, you know, I think it, it really speaks to how much the dominant culture

Speaker 5:          19:27          yeah.

Speaker 8:          19:28          Is sees women now compared to when I was writing that song, even, you know, um, the fact that we're hearing women give voice to their experience as though it matters, you know, um, because they're becoming human in the dominant culture and now we have to accommodate that experience and those people and those voices and those stories. You know, it's one more voice in the, in the chorus, one more person with a seat at the table, you know, and that's incredible. I've seen a lot change, uh, in, you know, I've seen the work of feminism take hold around me. Uh, you know, um, from when I was first stomping around saying stuff in my songs, uh, I've never, and I've actually on that tip, you know, I've never felt a more receptive world around me for a lot of my feminist ideas, you know, so I actually am very hopeful right now. You know, I know it's a time of great peril. Uh, and I mean to underplay that in a time of great pain for a lot of people. But I think that the possibilities, I think there's a, it's a transformative moment we're in, especially around gender politics.

Speaker 7:          21:02          And there's, there's more of that on the new album binary, which by the way, in, in addition to this incredibly proactive career, it's also an incredibly prolific career. And the fact that is, I read somewhere that it's the 20th studio album and I read somewhere else that it was more than 20, uh, 20 albums.

Speaker 8:          21:22          Yeah, I know. What the hell. That's amazing. It's at least 20. There's 20 of those suckers. Um, yeah, I don't know a lot of songs. Kids change the game now. I've slowed right down,

Speaker 7:          21:37          but, but, but not for lack of just still creating amazing artwork. There's the great, great album here and more stuff. Speaking to what we were talking about, uh, immediately play, God jumps to mind. Maybe you could talk about that song and how, uh, the nexus and genesis.

Speaker 8:          21:54          Absolutely. Thanks. Um, yeah, I mean, I started writing that song as kind of a bragging, I was like, what if I, what if I was like, you know, frost between Howlin Wolf and missy Elliott, what would I, right, right now, you know, and I started, you know, talking about my life as an emancipated teenager, you know, I was on my own at 15, and, um, you know, never got nothing from nobody, kind of, you know, and then the spleen took over and something inside me just felt as I was writing this bragging verse about how I'm not a child and even when I was a child, I didn't get a chance to be a child. And I was, um, not, I was contributing in society. I was a part of society really early on. And then, you know, my brain just sort of flicked the that too.

Speaker 8:          23:01          And so you cannot treat me like a child, you know, you tell me what I can and cannot do with my body when I should reproduce. Uh, when I, uh, you know, if I must reproduce or, you know, this is the kind of way that women still, you know, are treated in society is as though they are inferior as though they are children. You know, so I I think of reproductive freedom, um, as a civil right. You know, I think that we need to talk about it that way, address it that way. I think we could use another constitutional amendment to guarantee women civil rights. Um,

Speaker 2:          23:48          yeah,

Speaker 8:          23:49          and I, so the song just sort of mutated into a, uh, a women's civil rights anthem.

Speaker 7:          23:59          There's a lot of, um, any, it speaks to the, the title of the album binary. There's a lot of dual meaning and I find that interesting and that that story started in one place and ended another, um, to talk about the concept of the entirety of the album and being binary and what that means, where that's where that's coming from.

Speaker 8:          24:19          Yeah, sure. Here at Google, I mean, binary to me, um, first of all is not, I'm not really talking about either or I'm talking about both always. You know, I, um, I had a run in with the Internet a few years ago. It came and found me in my house and bit my head off and chewed on it for awhile. And, um, uh, that was sort of the beginning of a lot of meditations on consciousness for me. Uh, oddly, you know, these ones and Zeros came and changed my life and hurt, hurt me bad. And, um, I, I started to look at the whole world is made of relationship basically that every, anything that looks to be a singularity is really a relationship. Everything is two things spinning, you know, from our atomic structure, you know, to the planets and the stars. There is this fundamental design I think that is made of relationship, you know, and I'm kind of us, I'm fascinated by quantum physics. I don't understand it of course, but I like to read about it and you know, the quantum physicists I think through,

Speaker 2:          25:56          okay,

Speaker 8:          25:56          a long trajectory of masculine science have come back around to sort of the reality of the mother that nothing exists on its own. Only in relationship do we, you know, I mean, we are just, there's an infinite field of possibilities until something is observed and they will go on to tell you that observing something affects it, that observing is interacting. So with interaction comes existence, you know, I guess that's basically men of course it's, you know, it's not disconnected with my feminism. And, um, I think that that kind of the ways that my brain has been spinning for the past few years kind weaves through this record. So that's why I took that song title to title the whole record.

Speaker 7:          26:49          Well, and it goes even further than that. Uh, because this is a very interactive record for you, I think in the creation. Right? There's a lot of collaboration on this record and it even on the technical side, more collaboration than I think you've done in the past. How was the process of making binary a different or familiar or unfamiliar or taking a risk?

Speaker 8:          27:10          Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, often I make records by myself. I crawl into a hole depending on what's happening in my life and make a little record or a, you know, I, I track the songs with my band, but then I phots on my own and finish it or something. Solitary the record right before this, I did a lot in the wee hours, you know, when the kids were sleeping and headphones. And this time, you know, my youngest is four, four and a, you know, uh, uh, I just, I needed to re enter the world and interact with adults and creative beings and people who would bring ideas to the table other than me. So I, I tracked the tunes with not just my core band rhythm section, but a few other musicians, uh, that I love. Ivan Neville in New Orleans where I live and Jenny Scheinman a beautiful violinist from out west.

Speaker 8:          28:08          Um, and then I just started calling up a lot of other brilliant friends that I have. I just don't, didn't want to be alone. I wanted community back in my life. Um, so there's a lot of beautiful players and I had this kind of experience of like the best Christmas ever again and again, where, you know, I sent Justin Vernon a track and then my present comes in the mail being, you know, and I get to open it up and see this beautiful chorus that he sang on my song, or it's just the most wonderful presence came back to me from my friends. And, and then I even went one step further than I've ever gone, which is to have somebody else mix the damn thing. I've always just do, I can do this. Okay, that sounds good. Right. You know, Eh, you know, so my records, so over the years are unique, you know, and expressive, you know, and suit.

Speaker 8:          29:07          But, you know, having brought, uh, a creative mind like Chad Blake to into this project to mix it remotely, once again, I just sent him raw tracks and I got back mixes was breathtaking for me. I was like, oh wow. What if you're not crazy? And you didn't just write the songs? And so, you know, and, and you came in with an objectivity and a, and a skill that I could, we'll never achieve and mixing and perspective different what, what a gift. Wow. You can really do things in the mixing as it turns out, you know, so, um, I don't think I'll ever go back to, I haven't been, you know, I mean I've been thinking about it lately, you know, the emancipated minor thing when you're just, I got this, you know, and you're just taking care of everything, you know, now I'm 47 and I'm like, ah, I don't have to do that anymore. It took me a while to let go.

Speaker 7:          30:13          It is. It also, um, I found that in listening to the record, it's, it's super broad in style and approach and there's some stuff on here that is a very classic Ani Difranco style. Um, there are other tracks on here that are nearly hip hop songs. Um, uh, and then, uh, like spider is kind of this other end of that spectrum and very indie rock kind of way. Um, where did, where did the diversity come from from this album? Was it out of this collaboration or, or where their trigger moments that were like, Hey, I'm going to go in this direction for a reason.

Speaker 8:          30:53          Speak to that. Yeah. I mean, I like, and I've been hearing it from others that this, yeah, the, the sort of diversity of the sounds on this record and the, and I think that has to do with Chad and with, uh, you know, the people that I worked with, the musicians helping me translate my songs and fully have helping me manifest them fully. I think that I've always written really in a diverse way, you know, um, I never kind of want to write the same song twice. So I'm always let me write a song, standing on my head, you know, with the, you know, a bucket on each foot and see what that turns out like. And so I've done that all, but then, you know, I think then I just play it like I always do on whatever's sitting around. And then I just sort of mix it so you can hear everything. And, but I think when other people come in and enhance the creativity that exists in the, you know, in the seed of a song and they say, well this sounds to me like we should go over here and look, I have a, I have an arc, we can go over there, you know? And so I think that these songs were more fully realized in their differences then then maybe on other records.

Speaker 7:          32:16          Well, I'm happy to hear it because it does take a lot of the music in a new place. Um, and speaking of the new place, you spoke of a little bit of the Internet coming to bite you a few years ago. I'm skipping past that. I know that for binary, there are some videos and we were speaking about it before. These were things that you had sort of independently done. I'm wondering if you could talk about what it's like to be, as we said before, sort of an old artists, uh, approaching that way and being thrust into the situation to where maybe now just an album's not enough.

Speaker 8:          32:46          Yeah, I, yeah, that seems to be true. I think I've just a focusing or you know, I'm a working musician and playing live for people, just being gathering with people. I've, I think the sort of fundamental, uh, reality of music as a social act is really how I feel it and that's what inspires me. And so I think I'm most inspired on stage, um, you know, spending an hour and a half, two hours with people and the kind of connections that you make and the kind of less alone that we all feel when we walk out of there. And the kind of, that is what I live for. Um, and the rest of it, I don't know, it's all changed around me and I'd be the last to really know, you know, I think at one point in the 90s people were like, Ani, how do you do it? You know, show us how it's done. And I'm so far from being that guy anymore. I'm an old lady and I have no idea how you utilize the technology and the media and you know, to have a career in music in the 21st century. I just know that I like to play for people live and if I can just do that and pay my rent, tell I'm dead. I'll be okay.

Speaker 7:          34:17          When you were saying before that you felt very flattered by your audiences enjoying that moment with you in participating in that moment with you. I think it's very common for people to go to shows and the first thing that happens is the phone comes out. Right?

Speaker 8:          34:29          Yeah. Right. We were talking earlier this morning, um, and I was telling Matthew, I've have noticed this last couple of months being on the road, um, less, no phones, no phones in the audience, almost no phones, which is noticeable. I feel like my audience where sort of the last of the to bring to live, you know, the show through the phone and uh, and when it came into this, the space of my show is I just like, ah, I guess this is the world now. This is, there's nowhere to go that this is not the world. So, all right. And then these last few months people just, I got the feeling like people are, haven't had enough. They've had enough. It's like I want an hour and a half of being in a place and a time with the people that I'm with. And it just, it was like, look at you guys. There hasn't been one glowing blue face tonight. Congratulate fucking

Speaker 7:          35:38          lesions. We're all here. Maybe the um, the escapism that the phone initially served, uh, is found again and putting the phone away and, and actually being a part of,

Speaker 8:          35:49          yeah. Well we got deep. We got, did you guys miss the whole conversation? That meant anything cause we, what's going on in new music and who are the groundbreaking young artists of today? And I of course Peta will teach me everything I need to know eventually about that. But we were wondering together if this absorption into the Gizmos, this endless distraction and entertainment you know is has prevented a generation or two of groundbreaking music. You know, you are not bored, you are not desperate for connection so you don't have to go into your garage and invent some convoluted way to connect users. But, but we were, we concluded this morning or at least we left off with, well maybe, maybe we're moving past the end list days of absorption. Maybe that in itself is becoming boring for young people. So maybe that next awesome band or artist or what a is is right around the corner now. Hmm.

Speaker 7:          37:06          Well the, the speaking of next is a good stepping off point. So I will say that those of you who have questions in the audience, if you guys want to make your way to a microphone, I encourage you to do that. Oh, spotlight right by the mic there. Nice. Before we get into that, I would like to talk a little bit about next. I know that next year has a lot of interesting things. Cute up. Um, specifically I think babe fest is coming to New York.

Speaker 8:          37:29          Yeah, possibly. That's the big idea babe fest in Central Park. Oh, that would be no, I hope. I hope. I hope.

Speaker 7:          37:35          Yeah. Anybody who has any contacts with the summer stage, people start pulling your strings now a book, but what else is coming up for for 2018

Speaker 8:          37:44          a book, a book, a book, what kind of book? Complete sentences. Spelling spelled all correctly. Like I'm writing a book, I'm trying to write a book and um,

Speaker 7:          38:00          are we, are we talking to Ne Narrative?

Speaker 8:          38:03          We're talking memoir. Oh. But of course it's all made up, right? We all, you know, we're all just making up the story, but I'm, I'm, yeah, I is an idea that I floated for years, you know, uh, back when I was, you know, the groundbreaking indie girl, the concept was more like part manual, part memoir. This is what happened. This is, here's some tips on how course that moment is past. Um, and I'm just, I'm just writing stories, uh, in a different format. It's totally different from songs and poems. I, it's crazy to me and it's all called writing cause it's just feels so different and it's processed. But I just, I dunno, I just looking for challenges I guess as a writer. So that's what I'm up to.

Speaker 9:          39:00          Well, when you finish you'll have to come back and we'll do this all again and talk about it. Okay, cool. Let's take a question from the audience. Uh, hi. I had a bunch of questions, but when I saw you sing with Pr, uh, I flashed back to 20 years ago in my home tone seeing a delayed Craig, Chris Whitley, perform with his daughter Trixie on stage, uh, probably around the same age as Peter. And so I'm kind of curious if you could talk a little bit more about the dynamics of a family and music, uh, who's nudging who to perform together on stage. How does that decision get made? Um, how would you draw a line balancing, exposing her to the public on a stage two photos versus I'm helping her find her own voice and her art and their craft for about your music future.

Speaker 8:          39:42          Yeah. Cool. Cool. Um, well I guess first of all, I start with Shi. I started with her what she wants, you know, she's been touring with me a lot, you know, when she was a kid, she was a road baby til three and a half. And so she's pro at the touring business and at some point more recently she started saying, mommy, I want us to come sing on that song or that. Okay. All right. You know, don't push them onstage, but say yes, if, if that's what they choose and it's, sorry, Peter, that we're talking about. Yeah. Um, but it made all the difference for me as a working musician mom, because music was my first baby, you know, and the subsequent babies that have arms and legs did day in and day, not well for the guitar. I mean, they could be playing happily for if I pick up the guitar and try to do my thing, they shut me down, shut me down.

Speaker 8:          40:49          No drifting off, mommy into your world. Me. It's about me now. And so that was hard as an artist, you know, uh, the little guy, I have a four year old son and he's the same way now, but as soon as peta decided I want to be a part of that, then it became our thing. It was not my thing anymore. And it changed everything. It changed the whole atmosphere around music, which is just thrilling to me. I mean, I love to sing, but I love to sing with my daughter even more, you know? So yeah. Now that we can make it something we do together, it's opened up a new whole new era for us.

Speaker 10:         41:35          Paper question stick one from the side. Excellent. Hello. Hi. Hi. First off, thank you so much for coming. Um, I truly believe you are one of the greatest poets of our time and don't actually have a question. This is a statement I'm going to embarrass myself. I apologize. Um, I was one of those kids. I grew up in rural Michigan. I was the g and LGBT. I didn't have anyone to talk to and your music got me through and I would not be here today without you. So I just wanted to say thank you. Thanks. We had on but I get off cause I'm probably gonna.

Speaker 8:          42:03          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          42:04          I'm going to cry with you.

Speaker 8:          42:10          Yes. Yay. Yay To realness and being your whole authentic self. Thank you for that moment of vulnerability. Yeah, I hear that a lot and it keeps, it keeps me going through the hard moments. That means the world to me.

Speaker 1:          42:28          I got the question for me to you, thank you as well, but I want to kind of know about your, how you feel about your brand from an external standpoint. I kind of see you have this personal brand as I've been in this side of you all of these years. You now have a business brand, you have this cultural brand as well. And you also, now I'm hearing you have this other thing that's mommy hood that might prevent either the evolution of, or the building or separation of another brand. What does your brand mean to you? And can you share your thoughts of that over time?

Speaker 8:          43:04          Yeah, sure. Um, let me see. I think what I tend to do is not think about it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          43:14          Okay.

Speaker 8:          43:17          I, um, when, when you were talking about the elements in your question, um, I was thinking about a story. I hear so many wonderful stories from people who have intersected my music or my brand to even, um, I heard a story, you know, and I get these letters and, and uh, the judge just like food for me, you know, that, that nourish me back. And, uh, I got a letter a little while ago from a mom who, uh, is a fan of my work and she had a righteous babe sweatshirt, you know, with the logo. Um, and her young daughter said to her, mommy, is that a girl or a boy? You know, striking this muscle man pose, but with a skirt, you know, the little logo that started off as a picture of me hamming it up, you know, I hate cameras, so I'm going to do something ridiculous. And then that became the logo and that became the brand, you know, righteous babe. And um, so here's a little girl who I don't know, talking to her mom who's found something in my music. Mommy, is that a girl or a boy? That's a girl, sweetie. And then she took, the little girl said is, she's so, so, so, so strong. And her mom said, yeah, she's so, so, so, so strong. And she, you know, and this is all in the letter. And then she said there was a pause and her five year old said, I want to be like that. And I thought, Whoa, a logo.

Speaker 11:         44:58          Hmm.

Speaker 8:          45:00          I, and I don't think that that's going to inspire me to think about it or how can I tweak the logo or how can we work the brand to make more value for, I just try to do what I do and be who I am. And write the best song I can be and give it in the most honest way I can in whatever moment and hope that these peripheral things like, you know, the idea of righteous babe records and the look of that logo and we'll do their own work around that. You know, if I just stay focused on what I know and what I'm good at, that, you know, those, those peripheral things like the righteous bay brand. I mean we are trying to put a festival together and, and maybe I have been inspired by my new team to contemplate it more, um, to try to reinvent righteous babe. And what does it mean to stand at the intersection of, of art and politics and who else can we help or invite in or what other communities can we help, uh, to bring closer together to make stronger through a festivals, through a brand did festival, you know, so I try to work with people who do understand such things and can, you know, build momentum around them. But for me, I just try to, you know, focus on being an artist

Speaker 11:         46:26          and a mom. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          46:28          A, it's curious, I'm going to follow up on her question if I can, cause the label came out of it as a function of need, right? Uh, you, you created it not to hate, we're going to make a ton of money by releasing albums, but because you needed a way to get your music out. And I think what I have noticed is even with other artists on the label, it's not out of, hey, we're going to put this out and make a ton of money off of it, but it seems to come from this music deserves it. And I wonder if that functionality speaks to, to what you were saying as far as not having to worry about developing the brand, just doing what needs to get done.

Speaker 8:          47:03          Yeah. Yeah. It's one of the great ironies of my existence if you're me, is this label entrepreneur that has followed my name for 30 years and it's so not the point. It's like so far from the point that it's, it used to really bug me, you know what I mean? Of all the things that, you know, songwriter, activists, some, some entrepreneur, you know. Okay. Right. I guess I started a record company, but the whole point was really to avoid the music business. You know, the whole point was can you just make music your job without having to,

Speaker 2:          47:50          you know,

Speaker 8:          47:52          get in bed with business people, prof, you know, bottom line oriented people. Not that the music industry is full of bad people, they're good people. Uh, it just, I think I was such an idealistic kid that it's sort of, I looked at, you know, the intersection of sort of business and corporate culture and an art. And I see commodification, I see everything beautiful and vital come out of the underground, get commodified and die, you know? And I thought, yeah, I don't want to be a part of that process, even if it serves me, you know, I just, I find that to be such a bummer. Um, what, uh, what, how else could it be done? You know? So the point was really just

Speaker 8:          48:42          to never too, I mean for me to just follow my teachers, you know, the people that really made my world bigger and less about myself instead of, you know, you should wear this and play this song and make this happen and do, here's how to, you know, it's just like, I don't want to think about that. I want to think about something meaningful. You know? So yeah, I guess it was just like a, it was a problem solving process. It was never about running a record company, but about how can I dedicate it as, as little energy in that direction as possible.

Speaker 2:          49:21          Yeah.

Speaker 12:         49:22          We are running close to time, so if you guys have a couple more questions with taken please. Hello? Hello. All right, so that actually dovetails perfectly with my question because I'm curious, you said you set up the record label, not out of the joy of wanting to run and be a business owner, but just to, you know, improve your direct connection with the audience and be able to get your music to more people. And I'm curious if like now speaking of the ones and Zeros, do you feel like that's still working or do you feel like you're sort of inevitably in an embrace with Spotify, Pandora, apple music, Google play music, whoever, uh, and if you were a young artist starting out right now, would you try to leverage those or would you still try and do the whole thing yourself?

Speaker 8:          50:01          I mean, there's so much to know and navigate now, you know, to have a career in music. And I certainly don't think I'm a voice of authority or knowing necessarily, um, my basic approach is to just let go, you know, to just let go too, you know, as the music business and the world of, you know, changed around me, like let go of the old and there's music free now. And can musicians have a job of music if it's just free and you can't commodify it at all, or how do you, and the little guy is struggling so much and, and you know, people have asked me what I make about these streaming, you know, and these, and for me, I think, uh, you know, I just have this sort of really basic, you know, primal approach, which is acceptance. I can't control how people get their music.

Speaker 8:          51:12          I, I just let it all happen. And I hope that the, and I have found through this just sort of ignorant but, but faithful approach of I'm going to apply as much consciousness as I can, dig through my work and hope that that comes back at me from the universe. You know, hope that the universe has a place for me in my art. Um, it, it has found a place for me. So I'm one of the lucky ones. I mean, maybe it's easy for me to speak in such trite terms because the, the universe has held me and I'm, I'm very lucky. Um, but I think that when you are in the groove, when you're in the flow of yourself, you know, whoever you are and whatever you have to offer, there is a place in the universe for it, you know, so to calculate, you know, what obstacles, you know, change the flow or guided or, or, you know, I don't worry about that. I just worry am I being true to myself? Am I giving what I have to give? Am I listening to, you know, the voices that guide me. Um, and uh, so far it's, it's worked out. Yeah. I don't know if that's ever the answer, but thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 7:          52:44          Well, and I want to thank you. I want to thank you for your time to come here and be with us today. I want to thank you for your thoughtfulness in this conversation. It's really been a pleasure and I hope that everyone else would join me in thanking you as well.

Speaker 2:          53:03          We are running close to time, but I'm wondering if you would do us,

Speaker 8:          53:06          your honor, would you mind performing another song? Yeah, we'll play one more. Excellent. All right. Thank you so much.
