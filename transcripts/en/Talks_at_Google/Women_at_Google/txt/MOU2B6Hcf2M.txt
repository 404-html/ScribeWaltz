Speaker 1:          00:02          Uh, thanks to everyone who's joining us on the livestream and who was able to come in person. I'm Joelle Common Office. I am the host and I'm looking up at the camera there. Uh, I'm a Googler, I'm a product manager and I'm an aspiring parent. Uh, that means that maybe sometime next year if everything goes well, I'd like to have kids and I start early when I prepare for anything. So my wife and I went to this talk that she found, uh, by these characters and fat to introduce. And uh, they did this talk at whisper and high school and it was all about parenting. What she knows is not surprising, it's the whole point. But it was also about psychology and it was also about technology. Three of my favorite things, um, and I find one thing that they usually have in common is that to the either uninitiated, uninformed or just to the aspiring, they can all be kind of scary.

Speaker 1:          00:47          But what I really liked was that this is not a fear based message. This is all about hope and prevention and looking forward as to how can we not only avoid the pitfalls but in fact raise our kids higher in the future. So a quick introduction then. These are the cofounders of my digital tattoo. They have some pretty awesome chops already. They've talked to a lot of different people here. I even have to take notes on these numbers. It's been over 14,000 students, 5,000 parents, 400 educators and a hundred schools in the bay area as well as 800 healthcare providers all in the last four years alone. So they provide education and training in four key sectors from all of those schools, families, corporations and healthcare. They also just presented at the annual Rsa Conference where captains of industry, we're asking questions about how to deal with their kids privacy and security worries online. Kind of interesting. So without too much further ado, Gloria Moskovitz squeak sweet, who's been a social worker educator, program developer and university lecturer since 81 and Erica Plevin who's been a family psychologist for over 20 years, please welcome them and I'm going to pass it over to them. Thank you baby.

Speaker 2:          01:54          Uh, Joel, thank you for inviting us here and thank you for coming and we recognize you and felt you in the audience because your hand was up an awful lot and there was a tremendous amount of interest. So we're delighted to be here. Um, we have had the privilege now of working with 14,000 plus students all over California and it's their story we want to share with you. It's their voices. There are no textbooks. Anything that anybody writes is dated immediately. It's their voices that have continued to school, us. And as we have kind of taken this journey with them over the past five years, we have learned so much. And our goal today is to teach you and take you into what we've learned. So we, as Joelle said, we are not fear based. We really believe in the power of technology. We see it being used incredibly beautifully and strongly in empowering ways. So we understand the power, we watch kids learn, we watched kids collaborate with each other, we watched them feel empowered in this incredible world. And we have watched them do amazing things around creating a kinder world. They actually call it the kinder net, but we also recognize

Speaker 3:          03:00          the challenges and the challenges are big. And we're going to talk about both and we're going to talk about them without judgment because it really is, is the tool is here to stay is what we do with it and how we choose to support our kids and using it ethically and kindly. So Erica is going to do the first half and I'm going to do the second half and we'll have talked for questions

Speaker 4:          03:24          standing

Speaker 3:          03:24          in the right place. Hi everybody. I'm Erica and I'm the mom of two boys, one in high school and one in college. They are huge gamers. So I've started learning about this way long ago when they started entering the world of gaming. But what I've learned from being a mom the last 20 years of their life is that all the skills that I have offline, being a good parent and thinking about things really translate into their online world, and that oftentimes we get fearful and frozen about what they're doing online. And if we step back and actually just think about how we parent or how we liked what our parents did to us, there's some beautiful translation. So we're going to talk a lot about that today. I thought I'd start with a story that can help ground us in the importance of what it is to parent in the age of social media or parents in the age of technology.

Speaker 3:          04:18          When my son was in the fifth grade, I decided to have a pool party. I was really excited. It was back in the time when I felt like I was the manager. I got to pick all the friends that could came. Oh, sorry. I got to pick all the friends that came to the party. I got to decide what the theme was. Um, but parents, I wanted to be around and I hired a lifeguard and I hired a lifeguard particularly to stay in the deep end of the pool because my fifth grader is a risk taker and I thought, okay, something's going to happen in that deep end of the pool. So I hired a risk, a lifeguard right in that spot in the deep end, in the middle of the party. I walked in and there was a child drowning in the shallow end of the pool, right in that space.

Speaker 3:          05:01          I think we've all been where we can't feel our feet anymore and all of a sudden we get that panicked feeling and he slipped under and I had to jump in and save him and take him out. He was okay. The kids were really upset about watching, but when the mom came, I think I had a real attitude. I'm sure I did. I'm like, uh, excuse me. Does your kid know how to swim? You left them here with no supervision? And she said, no, but my kid is so good. He never leaves the step. He never goes anywhere. He just stays in that shallow area. So, um, when when she left, Gloria and I started to talk about it processes and we realize that it's similar to life in the digital age, that most of the time our kids are in that shallow and doing beautiful things and making safe and good choices once in a while.

Speaker 3:          05:50          And I think it's sort of their job, um, to get curious and to go a little deep or, or to get pulled into what's happening in that deep end of the pool. And that's sometimes the slip under without even knowing it. And really what we need is to be their guides, to be their teachers and to get in the pool with them. Now I know that I never liked getting in a bathing suit or getting into the pool, but I knew that it was really important that I got in there because you can't just throw your kid out there without learning how to swim. We're going to have to hold on to them, teach them the rules of the road when they actually don't mind having US help them when they're interested in being with us. And then in my opinion now with high schoolers and kids in college is to move away and become that consultant.

Speaker 3:          06:33          Help them self regulate an advocate for themselves. So when they go out in the world, they can do that without our assistance. But if we freak them out so much in the beginning we've seen that kids are less likely to come to their parents when they feel like they've made a mistake. And I think Gloria and I are real believers that we want our kids to make mistakes on our watch because then we can help them. We don't want to have everything so perfect for them. Snow plow the way for them that they don't make any mistakes, it's their job. So I just want to put that out there, that it's a good metaphor to think about that we want you there in the pool with them no matter what age they are. The kids we've talked to tell us that they want their parents to hear what they're saying and to supervise them, but we're going to talk a lot about strategies we've heard over the last couple of years.

Speaker 3:          07:22          Some of them may stick with you, others might not be. Things that work with your kids. Kind of want you to think of it like a big colander and I'm going to, we're going to throw a lot at you and some things will stick and you'll say, yeah, I'm going to try that or that might work with my kid and other things may not have anything to do with your kid. But I think what's important for Gloria and I to convey to you is that you are the expert of your kid. I always kind of say find the book that says what you wanted to say and follow it because you know your kid, you are the expert. If you see that things are going poorly, you step in offline and what we want to remind you is that the same is true online so kids don't really see an on and an offline life.

Speaker 3:          08:04          They just see it as an is there rarely leaving their phones behind. They're usually attached to them. And so what we find is that if your kid is experiencing trouble offline, gender identity, depression, friendships, sitting alone at school, any of those things that are happening offline, you can be pretty sure that it's going to follow them into their online life. Now, that's not necessarily terrible cause sometimes they're going into their online life to look for support or to help diagnose themselves or to find something that's gonna make them feel better. But for us to keep in mind that if we're worried about our kids offline to check out what that looks like in their, in their digital space, the same is true for their passions and interests. I've watched my kids just expand in things that they're interested in. They become world experts. Alex had figured out a way to apply to all the schools that had a scholarship for east sport gaming.

Speaker 3:          09:00          That's certainly didn't come to me. He went out there and he found it himself. So our kids are really taking what they're good at and getting better on it online. So I think that's important to remember. Gloria and I often get asked our kids addicted to technology. And I think kind of, I'm trying to answer that question for myself. Am I addicted to technology? I'm finding it harder and harder to leave my device behind because we're here for an hour. I'm going to give you our general guiding principle about whether we're your kid is addicted to technology and for us it's a simple question of is it opening up their world or is it shutting it down? So I have one very shy kid and it opened up his world. He tried on behaviors that he would never have tried offline and then was able to practice leadership roles and take it offline.

Speaker 3:          09:53          Uh, he met friends with similar interests and he has virtual play dates where he feels loved and respected. Um, but we've also seen it where it can close down people's worlds, where they get so invested in finding the next slide or feeling relevant that it can close down their world and make things uncomfortable. So pay attention to that. Pay attention to how you're seeing them use it. Because not all screen time is the same for us. It really depends on what they're doing and how they're using it, balancing it. But I do want to remind us, I think this is so important and it seems so simple, but every time I come back to this, it's a good reminder when we talk with the kids we work with, but also with my own kids, that kids are kids that really nothing's changed in terms of team development, that they're actually doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing to be these incredible curious beings when, when they start to grow up.

Speaker 3:          10:52          So I want to remind you that the teens are using social media to do all the things that they're supposed to do. They're socializing with their peers like we did. My mom used to ask me like, how come you come back from school and you're immediately on the phone? You know, I was, I had a cord back then, but I immediately went to the phone and they're doing exactly what they should be doing. Most of the kids we work with actually tell us that the reason their socializing online so much is because there's so overscheduled that they need these little bits of time to connect with their friends. And I find that so fascinating because they're telling us we need our community, we need to stay connected and we're finding ways to do that. So they're also trying on incredible identities. And Gloria, Mia and I just got this Bitmoji APP.

Speaker 3:          11:43          Anybody familiar with it where you can make an Avatar of yourself? One of the kids suggested it to us and you put all these outfits on, have you seen it? And, and it, it can be really silly and fun. I think our kids are doing that kind of like how I used to play dress up or try out a new ideas when I went out to parties. So our kids are really trying on new identities as well. But most of all what our kids are doing is trying to establish independence. And part of what I think happens in this new paradigm where we don't know exactly what the roadmap is, is to parent, is we start pulling back and trying to hover over them and their job is to keep moving away from us. So if we can do that in a way where we can stay curious and they can start to take those risks and gain independence and we're not hovering over them, I think we're really giving them the greatest gift, which is to start being critical thinkers.

Speaker 3:          12:37          And I will tell you that when we're in the classroom, our kids from ages fifth grade up are going to be the ones to come up with the solutions. When we ask them for solutions about how to manage group texts or how to manage, uh, their sleep, they come up with incredible ideas. So we really need to use them and harness their power. But for the most part, I want to say they're really using them in incredible ways. They're using them to connect to support. We've even seen kids doing causes for other kids in their school. They're using it for schoolwork. They're collaborating, they're creating youtube videos. I mean, I can't tell you how excited a group of fifth graders gets when we come in to talk to them and are curious about what they're doing because they're doing such amazing things. But at some times our kids are slipping under like in my pool, um, scenario and making those mistakes.

Speaker 3:          13:35          And sometimes as a parent, and I'm sure this was true for our parents to, they, we keep saying, well, we told you that already, or Oh, come on, I have to say that again. We already talked about this and they're slipping under. And I'm wondering if anybody knows why they're slipping on onion, why are kids slipping under? Why do we have to tell them so many times they're actually missing something in this area that makes it really hard. We've given them this incredible tool with incredible power, both to take care of themselves and their reputation, but also to hurt and harm other people's reputations and feelings. And they're kind of missing something, which is that their frontal lobe, which helps them with that long term planning and consequences isn't fully developed. And for me that's a huge takeaway that we're asking them to do something without literally having what they need to do it.

Speaker 3:          14:30          So for us, sometimes we need to talk with the kids. We're talking about what's this going to affect you like tomorrow? Or how is this going to affect you this afternoon? Because telling a kid, oh, you know, if you put that out there in 10 years from now, when you have an employer looking at it, they're not going to like it. It's really kind of hard for someone who's lobe isn't developed. Um, and of course with our teenagers are middle schoolers and our high schoolers, their emotions are so high. And those of you that have kids will know or go back to when you were that age that you can be happy and sad and silly and Matt and anxious and left out in, in a whole day. And so when you have a powerful tool and a bunch of feelings, we have to really be lending them our frontal lobe about how to deal with it.

Speaker 3:          15:17          And that all those feelings are normal and they make sense and they're easy for us to look at and say like, Oh, come on, get over it. There's no problem. But to them, they feel really real. They change rapidly, and I always say, if we can name it, we containment, so instead of just shutting off the device, if we can start helping our kids to say, I felt left out, or I'm, I don't feel like I measure up or my body doesn't look right, then we're giving them this huge service to talk about what they're experiencing.

Speaker 3:          15:49          I want to talk a little bit about this evolving landscape and Gloria and I used to just call it the digital landscape and we realize that working with kids every day that really it evolves as soon as we know about it, something new is coming up and I think that's probably like, we like this work so much because it's constantly changing and areas of interests keep moving, but I wanted to tell you a little bit about what we're seeing in the last six months or so about what's happening on this digital landscape. For tweens and teens. I think this actually even relates to us as I think about how I'm starting to use media more and more. The first thing we're seeing is that kids are stuck trying to stay relevant. And many of our kids will tell us that they're trying to curate their life to make it look a certain way to their friends and the people around them.

Speaker 3:          16:37          And I just want to take a minute to think about how exhausting that is to have to lead a curated life. To have to think that there's strategic times that you need to post in order to stay relevant, are not forgotten. And that that news feed happens so quickly. Are those texts come so frequently that if you miss that opportunity, you're not going to be noticed in, you're going to be left behind. Now, this is not true for all of our kids, but many of our kids will tell us that they will put a post up and if it doesn't get enough likes, they'll take it down. Uh, they will tell us that they know their prime posting time that uh, I get my most likes at eight o'clock or that they feel upset that they spent the whole weekend trying to make it look like a life they had a life and no one noticed.

Speaker 3:          17:23          So just really sinking into that idea that our, that our kids aren't having to search to stay relevant and how that must be so perfect conversation with our nieces or nephews, our kids, our friends is to talk about how we don't want to define ourselves based on the number of likes that we get and really kind of going to do what our parents did, which is searching underneath to see what's important and what we like about our self without people needing to give us the praise for that. Uh, the one on the top is my son and I put it up there because he is a virtual gamer and he spends lots of his time in his room, in multiplayer environments with people all over the world. He's joined teams all over the world. He has friends all over the world and I don't know if any of you have had this experience, but if you're on what's called a virtual hangout, you can't say play date once they leave elementary school, but when you're on this virtual hangout, it's pretty incredible.

Speaker 3:          18:21          It feels like everybody's in the room. I think when I started, I used to think they're just in parallel play. How can this be any kind of interaction? They're just on their devices now I'm seeing that they're interacting as a team and they're doing what I see is engaging in some pro social games where they're learning some pretty incredible skills about community guidelines, about friendships, about how to stick up for somebody about how it feels when someone trolls are being mean to you. And that they're actually doing a lot of this pre-learning as early as fourth grade in games like Minecraft. But most of all, and that corner, right is our advisory board, which we go to a lot to look for, uh, advice and to run things by them. They are socializing with their friends. And I think most people would look at that and they would say they're not socializing, they're all on their devices and they will tell us they looked at it, but they're all talking to each other or sharing or having fun.

Speaker 3:          19:19          So a reminder that our experience might not be how they're experiencing and to talk about, does anybody remember this? A whack a mole game. So the thing that I can't believe I kept going back to whack a mole is if I was going to figure it out and I always wanted to get a higher score and the thing would come up and go down and we would get frustrated. And Gloria and I just thought this was a perfect image to talk about how it feels to stay up to date in our kids' lives with what they're doing online. And I think as soon as we figure it out, they've gone somewhere else. I mean, that's sort of what they're supposed to be doing, right? If, if we're at the party, they're going to leave. I mean, that's embarrassing. So I don't think our job is really to have to know exactly what they're doing at all times, but our job is to be curious about it, to see trends that are going on and and to ask them about what goes on in each of these sites.

Speaker 3:          20:14          And I put the word down code switching there because for those of you, you might even be doing it yourself cause I certainly do, but most of our kids will tell us that they actually have a whole circle of ways that they go and check their media. Like they have their Instagram open, then they'll check their snapchat and they'll look at reddit. Then they might do a little Pinterest for it or which phone game and that they do this kind of an order and that each one of those platforms has their own way of being and so that they have an amazing ability to code switch between of those. I just want to talk about the importance of opening up the dialogue and for me I always say be curious. Not Furious because I think it's so easy for me to say to my husband, to my kids, like, what are you doing?

Speaker 3:          20:59          You're wasting your time. We should be out and going and doing something. Well that doesn't really set the tone for somebody wanting to tell you about what they're doing. It's sets the tone for you, telling them to go outside and then they take the device and go with their device outside. So I'm curious to, to encourage you to ask your kids, what are the apps that people are using? What do you like about them to try it on yourself today I tried on a new APP. It was called, uh, musically, no, it wasn't musically, but musically is another good example where we can get on and we can do Karaoke and we can be playful and fun and really feel what it feels like to want to do 10 videos instead of just one and to have a hard time not wanting to fix it and make it better.

Speaker 3:          21:43          So the more we enter their world, the more I think we get a sense of what they're doing rather than being mad. So let's take a look at the apps that we're paying attention to. Now. Our kids have moved away from Facebook. Any idea why they moved away from Facebook? We're on it, right? Or grandmas or taking selfies are, kids will tell us though that because you're on it, they'd like to ask you a favor, which is to stop posting pictures of them without their permission. And I think that's important because it becomes part of their digital tattoo. But we're also asking them to do that with their friends so that the digital drama decreases. So kids will tell us like, I really don't want that picture of me in the Bathtub Nudie when I'm 12 and says like, where have the year's gone that they really want you to model and ask them for permission.

Speaker 3:          22:32          I'm just thinking that all of these apps for me have good intention. I don't think any apps are created to be mean or bad. What we know is when teens go anywhere in a large number that things get sexual and that they push the envelope. And so I guess I wanted to talk just briefly about each of these. Maybe just not all of them but about what kids are finding amazing about them, but also some of the things you might want to start talking about or thinking about when you're talking about these apps. So they are moving away from Facebook. Like we said, they checked birthdays there, they made check maybe communication with relatives, but it's not the space that they're hanging out in. I wondered if anybody knew. Let's just pick one of these up here. Anybody know kick? Yeah. So what do you know about Kik?

Speaker 3:          23:25          So, so we love it that it's a messaging APP. We love it, that it's free and that kids can get to use it. And what we also know is that when you take your kids phone away and you think that they're not going to be texting anymore, that they're getting the free kick. Gac. Yeah. And then they're able to use that. I'm also going to point, I got the five minutes sign that the right is called followers. Plus. What I think is interesting about that is that it takes analytics of how you're doing with your postings and want you to think about that with your kids to see did someone unfriend you, did they not? What's my top posts really to talk about? That's really important. Ooh, is that group chat where our kids get to be together in a group formation. Anytime we're in a big group, we run the risk of mean behavior happening.

Speaker 3:          24:12          Uh, periscope and some of the other live apps are a place where we're seeing a lot of problems because kids aren't really thinking with their frontal lobe. And so they're exposing things quickly in the moment and not pulling back to think about it. And the only thing I wanted to say about Instagram and snapchat is that Instagram, um, your, your kids have two Instagram accounts. We're pretty sure of it now that one is, they're curated one for their family and one is their real one that they share with your friends. So talk about it. Same thing about snapchat is fun, exciting, really playful. They don't have to be picture perfect, but there's lots of room for people to feel left out of situations to feel like things are happening in live time and they're not included. We've also had this amazing shift from real name to anonymous culture and it's like our kids are listening to us.

Speaker 3:          25:05          We asked them to be careful when you put your name out there so they went underground. So the three that have come into play love you to ask your kids or nephews or nieces if they know them and how you see them being affected is the afterschool APP ASK FM and the burn book. So really talking about the power of anonymous APPS, how we can be a little meaner behind a screen, how much more we have to focus on stepping in someone else's shoes to be able to really feel that when we don't see them. On the other side of the screen, I want to tell you about this incredible thing that we keep hearing about with kids, which is how much these gurus and viners are their friends, how much they look up to them, how much they wait for the next video to be released, and how much information they can give us to, how are kids doing to kind of get a psychological pulse on how they're doing in the world, what they're gravitating to, what they're interested in.

Speaker 3:          25:59          So I love just asking kids who are your favorite youtubers or viners and why? And you get incredible answers. The middle one is Pewdie Pie. The top is, um, I call him the, the Mr. Rogers of Minecraft. His name is stampy long nose. Uh, there's Jenna marbles at the bottom. Um, so, and Miranda Miranda sings at the bottom and Jenna marbles in the middle. But I want you to think the same way you did about asking your kids about their friends in elementary school. I want you to ask them about the people they're watching. How'd you meet, how did you get introduced to them? What's interesting about them, hey, let me take a look at it. Instead of saying, oh, I don't like them, or they're no good, we actually just talk about what they're interested, why and sit down and we can learn so much about them.

Speaker 3:          26:48          Our kids tell us that they want us to supervise them, not supervised them. That they don't want you to take their phone away at night and look at what they're doing. They want you to go through it with them because they're creates a feeling of anxiety. If they know that you're always kind of overlooking them. We want to tell you that we rarely see predators and we know parents worry a lot about predators. Um, and if your kid is struggling with issues, then you may see that. But for the most part, the dramas happening with their friends. Ask your kids, what's the digital drama happening right now in your squad of friends? Um, we want to look for openings for connection and discussion. So in my life, I send my kid, I used to send him a note to his lunchbox. I love you. Now I send a note to his inbox or quit, so and give them an out of hard situations.

Speaker 3:          27:36          So I'm going to end with this one and then hand it over to Gloria. But I think this feels like my most important slide, which is, and I think Gloria started with this, which is I think that the tool is here to stay and has incredible power, but just taking it away without having a conversation leaves them just wanting to go underground. So for example, if we don't like in my house, I don't like to single person shooter games and I can say I don't like it cause I think it desensitizes you to violence. Uh, or you can say, I'm worried about your sleep. Or you can say, I feel like in those musically videos you're sexualizing yourself to get attention. And, and so instead of taking away the APP or taking away the device, I'm going to encourage you to have the conversation, to be curious, to enter their world, to hear what they have to say.

Speaker 3:          28:23          Uh, and to kind of think back on our parents and when they were open to knowing what we were doing without shutting us down. It was the time we made the best connections and then we can send our kids up being self advocates. All right. It is um, been such an incredible gift for me to work with Erica and uh, to really look at what triggers us so much as a psychologist, as a clinical social worker. We were really intrigued by the psychology of technology and we want to take you into this, into this place that we have been in for the past five years. But to do that, I'm going to ask you all to go back to middle school and I'm just curious how many of you would go back to middle school if you could? Not a single hand is going up here. Very rarely do we see hands go up here. Can anyone tell me why they wouldn't go back? Like why would you not go back to middle school? Puberty. Yeah. Selfconsciousness just the, I mean like the light is on you and everybody's watching. Absolutely. So let's go into this right now. Actually, I want you to, as you go back, I want you to remember when and in doing that, even if you're not a parent yet, I mean, Joel, when you talked about it, you were thinking about what it would mean to be a parent. So the best way to do this is to think back at this time. So

Speaker 2:          29:42          let's remember one, how many of you remember doing and note that looks something like this? You know, so we all had a version of something like this and this was very important to us as we were defining ourselves. And the most important thing was to be liked. We all want it to be liked, we wanted everyone to approve of us. And it's really no different is it? It is still. Do you like me? And as Erica mentioned, our kids are, well not completely off Facebook, but getting off of Facebook, it's about insta likes and it's about evaluating yourself worth by the number of likes and by the number of comments. And we've had so many conversations with kids about this and it's been really an eye opener for us to have them talk about what it means to really get social collateral, a social currency by the number of likes they get and the number of comments and how strategic they are about that and how careful they are about that.

Speaker 2:          30:32          And what we say to parents is that this is such an incredibly important conversation. If you see your child completely defining themselves by those likes. And by the way, I'm going to talk about my own kids around this. You know, in one of my oldest son would say to me, in spite of my best self at the age of 29, I cannot stop looking at how many likes I'm getting on Instagram. So we all know that pool. And I want you to imagine that pool on steroids because for kids to be liked in middle school is what they are all about. And to us that is the discussion that we want to have. And we also want to look at it for ourselves too. Um, but definitely look at it with our kids that appreciate that this is a time when it's really, really huge for them.

Speaker 2:          31:15          What to talk about the impact of social media on the adolescent brain and as we talk about this, we're, we're going to be looking at generalities and we're going to be looking at what we know about the brain and we're also going to be talking about what we have learned and what kids have shared with us as well. So we know that our brains are hardwired to seek new information that is no different. We literally get a shot shot of dopamine, the happy chemical with an in today's world with a, with a text, with a tweet, with the, like with the buzz. We get this search, and again, imagine this in middle school because it's far bigger. It's a much more intense search. What our kids are saying to us is that their texts and tweets are highly perishable and they lose that social value if they're not responded to instantly. This has been an interesting transition for us in this field because what was five years ago? An acceptable amount of time. Can anyone guess what an acceptable amount of time might've been about three years ago to respond to a text?

Speaker 4:          32:17          Good

Speaker 2:          32:18          a day. What do you think it is now?

Speaker 2:          32:23          Not even, it's for many of our kids, they talk about wanting an immediate response and if they don't get an immediate response, they will think that something has happened like dreadful to their part, to that person. They've even said to us, maybe they're dead. We've, we've heard kids say that. Or they think that something, they've done something terribly wrong and therefore that person's not responding. So that that response time has shifted enormously. And I think it's a shifted for every adult I now as well. I mean, there's no question about that. They also let us know that, that, that the fact that it's highly perishable makes this device so incredibly important. 24, seven because they're out of there. They're not in the know. If they don't have it, they often will say to us, um, if I don't respond to a friend right away, she's gonna think I'm a really bad friend and that means my call is to be 24 seven and always there.

Speaker 2:          33:17          And that imperative is incredibly important to look at because that's a really tough way to live. And we see a lot of our kids, I would say, well it's not just our girls, it's girls and boys really struggling with this issue of being always on. Let's continue thinking about what this biology is and like let's look at some of the chemicals that are going on in the brain. Dopamine is one of these key chemicals that we know about scientifically, but we're also hearing about it a lot for our kids. Of course they're not talking about it in terms of dopamine, but they are saying it feels really good to connect it. It makes them feel like they are really in the know and they, and they are really loving that constant connection. And we're talking about brain chemistry because it's dopamine that gets stimulated by tiny bits of new information, which is exactly what social media is.

Speaker 2:          34:07          So we can see the pool for this. And there were also talking about oxytocin, which is what's called the cuddle chemical, and it releases a feeling of goodwill and connection. And that's what the comments are about. That's what the likes are about. And that's what's really getting highlighted in the eye and the brain of an adolescent and not just the brand of an adolescent, the brain, all of our brains. So between dopamine and between oxytocin, it's really hard to stop wanting more and we can really see that pool that our kids are experiencing. And by the way, that we're all experiencing, I don't know anybody that is completely honest that wouldn't say I'm feeling the tug of this as well. But we know that for our kids, because of their brain chemistry, it's more so than it is for adults. So that's her advisory group again. And with that in mind with sort of the brain, very brief look at brain chemistry, would you say that kids are addicted to devices? And I'm just curious about a show of hands. How many of you would say kids are addicted to devices? Okay, so some hands are going up. How many of you would say your addicted to devices?

Speaker 2:          35:20          I think I am. You're on the fence? Not quite sure. So we're going to look at two ways of looking at this. And I want to say to you, this is without judgement at all. As a mom, I didn't mention earlier, I'm the mom of three young adults and it's, they have led me through this world and the work. All of our kids have really taught us so much about this. And this is what we're seeing and hearing. Our kids are saying to us, we're not addicted to our phones. We just like each other. And it had overscheduled intense world where there's so much expected of them and they have to move so quickly. Those times that I know, are you a member of just space where I could ride my bike and no one was watching me and I didn't have to text my mom.

Speaker 2:          36:01          I can't even imagine that as an adolescent those days are over. So what it means to be tethered to their parent is huge and and they are missing that and they really don't have that time to play the way they used to. So they're using a device to connect into play because that need to connect as no different than what any of us had. What we also have seen very clearly is face to face conversation begins. We're digital ones and and vice versa that there is no honor off. It's exactly the same. It's one world and that both really contribute to that formative development of identity. They're both incredibly important. So that's sort of one perspective and looking at this and then we're also seeing another, we talked about the power and we talked about the challenges and so I'm going to look at the challenges right now.

Speaker 2:          36:50          This is a quote from one of our 12th grade students. You're not alone. When you're on your phone and we're seeing that ability to be alone really shifting. And I know when I take a walk, I very rarely see someone alone anymore. I mean there is a device going on, there's a full conversation happening. So we are struggling with what it means to be alone. And that's an interesting issue when you think about invention and new, um, new energy often comes out of that alone time and we're seeing less of that now. And that's an interesting thing to ponder on. So again, this is our advisory group and if we look at them, we see sort of, this is a very typical discussion with our kids and you see them kind of on there. There's a phone there, there's conversation and you see a head down.

Speaker 2:          37:37          And that's not uncommon at all. And what we are hearing and what we're seeing from our kids and for most people, and here's the conversation we had with one of our kids. That quote, if a phone is on the table, I will keep my conversation light knowing I don't have full attention. Then in that at any minute some will be distracted and I think that is a very, very true issue and that has shifted. That is something very different. We didn't hear that five years ago. We are seeing that now. If the phone is on the table, I will keep that conversation light and I'm not going to go deep because I know at any minute I'm going to lose attention. That was an 11th grade student. Our kids are learning this new social norm in middle school. They're learning it when they are learning how to look like they're paying attention to a lecture and they're texting underneath their desk.

Speaker 2:          38:28          They're learning that they can pull this off and pull it off really, really well. So we're watching our kids feel that this is something they can absolutely do. But the question that I think we have to address is are we losing the complexity of what it means to be in a conversation? Because conversations are complex and we have to know and we have to be able to tolerate that awkward silence when you're not sure, is it my turn to talk or is it their turn to talk? We have to figure out where to stand in space and am I too close? Am I too far? When do I make eye contact? When do I look down? This doesn't happen if a child is looking at a device. And this personally gives us concern because what we know is that those skills are still needed. It doesn't matter.

Speaker 2:          39:13          You know, our world is here to stay. Our World of media is here to stay. But those skills are human skills. And I think it's important for us to all pay attention to the fact that we are saying our kids now struggling with us in a really, really big way. Many of them are telling us that they would much rather text, um, than they would talk because they can control the conversation. And if they're talking, they've lost control of the conversation. And I think that's an interesting thing to pay attention to. Has anyone seen this photograph? I would imagine some of you have, it was a photograph sent to us by one of our advisors. Uh, it was taken about a year ago and Redondo beach. And we are convinced that this man is googling where to find whales and we're sure we're sure that he missed exactly what he needed to see.

Speaker 2:          40:03          And we know that there was a guy in front of him taking this picture and I had this fantasy of him screaming, look up. I mean just look up and the guy who never did. So we are tethered and you all, most of you raised your hands in terms of your own tethering and our kids are very honest about that. We're tethered to our devices. Our kids are tethered to their friends. Our kids are tethered and romantic relationships. The amount of texts that go back and forth, it can be overwhelming and almost suffocating to many of them in late middle school and high school. And I want to talk a little bit about the tethering. We're saying for parents because that's a really interesting level of tethering that has shifted quite a bit. Um, we are hearing from colleges now that there's an expectation not well, they're seeing that they're his parents and kids are texting sometimes seven to eight times a day.

Speaker 2:          40:52          And um, and the techs can take these very interesting tourance they can be things like, and kids are sharing this with people at school and college. Um, can you geo locate the library for me and you can you geo locate the bookstore and while you're at it we'd like, I'd like you to get my books and get them immediately because I expect things to happen immediately. So there's a language and there's a term for this. Right now our colleges are calling it drone parenting and it's kind of fascinating and it's a little scary when we think about this. It's helicopter parenting with tech enhanced surveillance capacity and expanded reach. So they've given, they move from hover parenting hovering to drone parenting at college. What it looks like is arguing with props on behalf of grilled growing children for grades. Um, and they also look like correcting their paper and turning it in.

Speaker 2:          41:42          And a profit is very clear that this is not coming from a student but coming from a parent and then let's look at what it looks like in the world of work. And I can certainly speak to this as a parent of kids that are in the world of work, going to job fairs and bosses, offices in place have grown children. And I know for myself, I see some heads nodding here for myself. When my oldest son got his first job, it was amazing for that job to court my husband and I equally as they courted my husband with an assumption that if they wanted him they had, we had to talk him into it too. So I'm seeing a shift happening culturally that's looking like it's normal and we may not want this to want to be normal. You guys, I mean this one, this one gives us big pots. So drone parenting. Now I also want to talk about a shift that we have seen in our five years of working with kids. And I'm going to throw this question out to you. When we ask kids, we show a short video and it's very old school about someone being digitally tethered and, and losing the losing conversation. And when we showed them this video, we asked them who they see, who do you imagine they see when we showed this? Any guesses?

Speaker 2:          42:58          You nailed it. Now that's a shift. They didn't see their parents before. They used to see themselves. And um, we're now in fourth grade. Primarily we're an elementary school, high school, Middle School and high school. And the shift, I'd say in the last year and a half, our kids are now saying, that's my mom. That's my dad. That's my family. And I'm going to take you into some of the quotes that we've been hearing from kids on this one.

Speaker 2:          43:25          This is a ninth grade student. If parents stopped for a second to look behind their iPad and put down the scream, they would realize they're kids are right in front of them and they are trying. And that's really pretty intense quote. Um, we often present this in many ways in fourth and fifth grade and it's amazing. Kids are shooting up their hands and they're sharing strategies with each other on how they can bring their parents back. And here are some of the strategies. Well one child said, I see my dad two days a week and he's always on his iPad. The bottom are the strategies kids are sharing with each other about how they pull their parents back. I shake them, poke them, pinch them, bribe them, yell at them, weigh the piece of paper in front of their face, grab their phone away. Our newest one that we heard is called them by their full name, which you thought was hysterical.

Speaker 2:          44:14          Uh, put my face in their face until they see me. But the one that really concerns us is that I give up and then they say, and then I give up and I go in my room and I got on my device. And what concerns us is kids in school still think parents are incredibly cool and there are looking for connection and they're looking for a time to have that icon. I contacted conversation, but if they're learning early at this point that nobody's home, they are going to just drift away and they're going to just go to Google to look up things and not go to their parents. So this is definitely an issue that we're seeing and paying attention to. I also want to talk about tech not perfection and when we ask our kids to define Tecta perfection, they are really clear that it's about a curated image.

Speaker 2:          45:03          It's about trying to be perfect and expecting that perfection is something they have to have 24 seven I was amazed when we do our advisory groups that we asked in this question, they could have talked about it forever and we asked them what are the acceptable body types and they told us that it's super skinny or Kim Kardashians. And if you look at the new Barbie dolls that have come out, it's interesting. Some people, has anyone been aware of the new barbies that have come out, go check them out. They're fascinating to me. Some of them are looking just like Kim Kardashians and some of them are looking just like super skinny and so in a way, and they thought this was really good news because it was defining real bodies, but are they real bodies? So look at what's going on there. Our feeling is that this subliminal message is beauty is unachievable and we're hearing our girls talk about this quite a bit and what we're also very aware of is that it's not just a girl issue, that it is a boy issue as well.

Speaker 2:          46:02          So what I want to talk with you about right now or the kinds of things that our kids have said to us and our advisory group about what they want their parents to do to help. How do we change this? How do we start this conversation? And the first thing they said to us is we want our parents to help us combat those myths. Because to us it's real. We see a billboard or we're assuming that it's real. Help us understand that being thin will not bring you happiness. I love this one. Helping not seek external validation. And find my own voice. Start this conversation early and people are often very afraid to start the conversation because they think it's too young. There is no too young and shift the conversation. What are they trying to sell you? There is no middle schooler that wants to be manipulated and once they realize that someone's trying to sell them something, especially in adult, they're going to be able to push back and as I mentioned earlier, this one gets them screaming when we show them.

Speaker 2:          46:58          Justin Bieber can't even really explain what's going on there. But what I love about showing us images that they're not supposed to see the one over in this corner, they're supposed to see the really buff to find one. And what we want them to get is the manipulation. We are seeing that because it's a female issue, it's seen as a female issue. There are often not able to discuss it the way that girls do and we want them to because that conversation is important and we really love this quote because we think that pushing back as we really want our kids to be able to do. I'm looking at our time and I want to talk a bit about sleep because sleep is an enormous issue that's impacting kids and at first to on this ladder used to have what our teens are saying about sleep but we had to change us because of our kids.

Speaker 2:          47:44          It's what our children and our teens are saying about sleep and it's been significant. I closed my eyes and go to sleep and feel like my brain is on coffee and this just happened last week. That was a fifth grade quote and I'm curious if anybody ever feels like the brains on coffee in here when you go to sleep it's like what is going on? This is emerging science and we're starting to get more information on this and I'll share with you in brief what we're saying and what we're learning, but we are seeing that our kids are coming to school with digital hangovers and I can certainly see that adults are going to work with digital hangovers as well. What we are finding out is the kids between the ages of nine and 15 are especially sensitive to light exposure in the evening. Light comes at them from any way and they're sensitive to all light, but we're also wondering, and we're learning that the blue light emitted from digital devices may be particularly impactful and we know it's impactful to us as well.

Speaker 2:          48:43          The more evening light exposure, the lower that level of Melatonin. It's true for all of us and incredibly true for this age group, so it suppresses their bodies time clock and makes them fall asleep later and therefore wake up with those digital hangovers. So what do we do about this? And I want to say what do we do about this? Because this impacts all of us and these are just a few things to look at. Um, is anyone using flux? It's a great one. And the new iPhone, um, has niche, it is at night night shift, which is going to be also mirroring. We know that blue light tricks our brain into staying awake. So flux does this amazing thing which is so important. It mirrors our bodies time clock. It mirrors what our body needs when it's nighttime, it turns that reddish glow of the sun setting.

Speaker 2:          49:34          When it's daytime it turns blue. And there are also really good apps that we recommend. Self control is one of them that blocks access to distracting websites. Um, stay focused is another that sets a timer where you can block your own access to those websites. And re readability is one that really helps with online clutter. It's amazing we're having to develop these tools to help us not get distracted, but we have to and we have to really support our kids are doing this as well. And then finally, when Eric and I are in schools and we're really challenged and parents were encouraging them to change the norms around 24, seven conductivity, because we're all feeling it. So what are the skills our kids are going to need in the future? We know that it's the ability to work cooperatively and collaboratively through network communication. I mean we, we see it, we're living it right here.

Speaker 2:          50:26          Collective intelligence, crowdsourcing. And it's that very sharing, tweeting, constant updating that's preparing them to do that work. I mean, it's that thing that worries us, that is so incredibly important. But here's the paradox that here's the piece that we have to look at with the world at their fingertips. It's the ability to tune out the noise because there's an awful lot of noise out there and engage in technology with awareness and balance that's going to cause us to be able to succeed this world. So that's the piece that's so incredibly important. And I want to share with you that, that um, we are really at a place right now after working with 14,000 kids and we're moving very, very quickly and expanding. We're looking for partners and we were looking to expand our reach to organizations and to schools particularly where kids can't afford this and we feel that everybody needs it and we want to introduce our executive director, Mia Walker, who is a former Googler and a, we will be here for conversation and really look forward to talking with you if any strategies and ideas about this. Thank you so very much for coming. Thank you for inviting US Joelle. One thanks guys.

Speaker 1:          51:38          How do you define acceptable usage of a phone? And the question came in two parts and I love it. So I'll read them out. That datum. Uh, one is, is it okay to take away phones, have bad grades and as a follow on, is it different when they, or we use the phone just to research things like, oh, let me Google that to pick up the phone and check it out. That kind of thing. I say something

Speaker 2:          51:58          about taking the phone away for, for bad grades, I, the danger of doing that is creating the forbidden fruit. I mean if, if we take it away as a punishment, if you really want to make someone fall in love with something and make it the forbidden fruit and I think that that technique is, is just, is doomed for failure. Personally as a parent, I don't think that that works very well, that sad. There's absolute need for limits and our kids desperately need our limits. Um, do you have any other thoughts on that? Yeah. Thinking the same thing and that sometimes being part of a conversation ahead of time, some preventative work, talking about a contract or pointing out what you're noticing that their grades are slipping or that they're acting inappropriately in their conversation is a better way to talk about it than just grabbing the device away.

Speaker 2:          52:47          Because we will often hear kids say, oh, I just get a free counting and used my friend's phone to text or I have a dummy phone that I give my parents and they don't remember. So I also like kids to really understand that our bodies are not meant to multitask, that we don't do it very well, that our bodies are in desperate need of sleep. And none of us do this. Well. I think that parents have to model this. I think that if we just direct kids, but we're also hearing from kids is parents will say to them, you know, get rid of that device and as they're saying that they're on their device and so that it's not going to, that will not bode well. Um, they're really watching our behavior far more than they're listening to us. So we have to really be willing to model it and may be, that may mean in some families are doing this, it's 10 o'clock. All devices are down, including ours. Not Easy, but that is effective

Speaker 3:          53:35          in my house. We have forced family fun. We're all the devices have to stay at home and we all leave. Um, just really carving out those digital free spaces where kids feel like where there are families are feeling like we're being heard and that they're important.

Speaker 1:          53:52          Yes, it's a great idea for everyone to put their phones down at 10:00 PM but how do you reconcile that with the needs of the kids to stay in touch instantly with our friends who don't put their phones down at 10:00 PM

Speaker 2:          54:01          you know, we're, we're in an interesting time right now. I mean, we, we, I mean, I think his parents, we have to come together and work as communities. I mean, that is, that is not easy to do. And yet it's so important to do. I mean, I think we have to model it. I also think it would be so great to have a community conversation and have other parents doing it too. But I remember as a parent being told, you're the only mom doing this and I'm so angry at you for doing that. And it's okay to have that anger because we're really helping them out of a jam. What kids say to us privately. They don't want us to share it with parents, but I am exhausted and I want off that group tax, but I can't tell them. But I'm going to let you know. Um, and I'm not going to tell my parents, but you're, you're helping them out of a jam. So I'm encouraging parents to set limits. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          54:45          I'm kind of agreeing with glory. I've been called the meanest mom Mna in North America because I wouldn't let a phones come to a sleepover cause I kind of feel as my parents did that nothing good happens after 11 o'clock when you're in a group, uh, that it just kind of goes south. But, uh, my experience has been that we do a super good job finding out the best tutors, the best schools, the best camps, talking to parents all the time to gather information. And that if we could use that same curiosity and connectedness to say, hey, you guys, do you remember when our parents wouldn't let us call after nine o'clock because it was rude or answer the phone during dinner? And it was just an is right. And so I think the more we talked to other parents in our kids' friends groups or to help them do what Gloria said and realize like, we're not doing it to be mean, we're doing it because these devices are tricking your brain into believing it's daytime and you don't feel good. And getting it though.

Speaker 1:          55:43          How many kids actually want to fight distractions from this question? Uh, when I was a teen, I didn't really notice when I was tired or distracted and I didn't think getting A's instead of bees was worth the extra work anyway. No

Speaker 2:          55:57          Kid wants to fight distraction. I mean they're, they're not even feeling distracted. I hope I'm hearing this correctly. No child would say to you, they would all say to you, I am amazing at multitasking. I could do 20 things at once. I can do whatever. I mean, but we all said that too, right? I mean, I said I could do whatever at any time because that ability to recognize that they can't isn't there yet. So we have to be the ones to say, you know what, I'm going to help you with this. It's really not about getting a six. We're about staying healthy and sane. I mean, we can't survive on three hours of sleep. And I know some kids that are trying, um, we've heard teachers say that papers are coming in at 1130, 1230 for fifth graders because they're getting so distracted that's not working for anybody.

Speaker 2:          56:41          I have to get their pain point. And right now what we're noticing in the classroom is group texts are a pain point that they go on to several group texts and then hundreds of k what's happening, you know, uh, just flooded their inbox and the beings and make it hard to go to sleep. So I put it back on them like, what can we do about this? What do you guys think you can do? And they come up with amazing strategies. So putting it back into their hands, uh, to help is and hitting their pain point really works.

Speaker 1:          57:11          That's a great segue to the question I had for you guys, which is do you know of or, or anything, um, groups or meetups for discussions among parents or between parents and kids or even among kids with your advisory panel or anything where people can go in and share and develop their solutions?

Speaker 2:          57:27          I love that question. Uh, we're, we're, we're seeing that popping up all over. So we're seeing schools when we go to a community and we present to schools, we're seeing parents afterwards going, we're going to start something and we need to start it now. And they come together as parents did no differently than we came together around other issues as an opportunity to discuss some of our most effective work has been working with parents separately and kids separately and then bringing everybody together to share strategies with each other, really powerful. So often it starts small. It's often parents going on lost and then coming together with other parents who equally feel that way. And then just starting that community conversation. I love what you're talking about because we spend most of our time talking about problems, about facilitating conversations. About how it feels. And I love the idea as we start to expand our program bigger to talk about what can we do about it?

Speaker 2:          58:20          How do we work as a collective community to create a kinder Internet where we have incredible power and we can do great things. And I, I, I would just love people to come to us with ideas and to help these kids facilitate their own. So to, I wanted to say something about our conversation after we met you. Um, I'm fired up about parents before they have children saying we want to do something now because we're concerned. And some of the current research, the new research is coming out around attachment just a little scary. So we are encouraging parents to talk even before they have kids about how they want to deal with this world. So, uh, this conversation is incredibly important.

Speaker 1:          59:03          Okay. Well thank you both very much. We're just about out of time. Really appreciate you guys coming down to Google to give us all talk. Thank you. Yeah.
