Speaker 1:          00:07          Hey, so today, welcome to this talk at Google with just late. So I'm Dan Carey and joining me as Jess. Hi. She is a partner at sequoia capital. Previously she was at Google as a product manager and then Pauline bear Polyvore which you joined as a product manager. You were then VP of product honorary cofounder and ultimately Ceo, uh, led the company through the acquisition with Yahoo in 2015. You were fortunate. It's 40 under 40 list clamorous top 3,535 women in tech and a whole bunch of other things. So welcome. Thanks for, uh, thanks for coming. Thanks for having me. So, uh, so what's it like to be back at Google? Oh, totally.

Speaker 2:          00:47          Yeah, it's trippy. It's very surreal. I used to sit in this building and like 2000 and a 2005, I think when it first opened. Um, yeah, it's just, it's kind of cool to be back. I learned a lot of things, uh, on this campus. I was an APM, uh, and I worked on frugal, which was product search back in the day. And then I asked for after shorts did there I stayed at, I moved to Google maps, but this was when Google maps was a desktop product and we did not have smartphones. So, um, it's a pretty long time ago.

Speaker 1:          01:14          So you joining Polyvore right from Google. Right. And it was kind of a weird journey, right? Like it wasn't normal circumstances for leaving Google and joining a company.

Speaker 2:          01:22          Yeah. Yeah. I would say it was a little bit of an unusual path. Um, so I remember I was sitting at Google in my, uh, in my office with another Google maps pm and he was like, hey, you should check out this site called Polyvore that my friend is working on. And I was like, okay. I checked it out and I was like, oh my God, this is amazing. Um, what Polyvore does is it lets you mix and match and create outfits out of real products and you can create those outfits and share them with your friends. It's kind of like a fashion magazine created by community of women all over the world, but everything is shockable. Um, so I fell in love. I started using it two or three hours a night and just couldn't get it out of my brain. And then, uh, because that was a pm I wrote, I had a lot of complaints about the product, so I wrote them all down and I sent an email to the cofounder and I, one of the founders and I was like, Hey, I love this product. I think there's going to be huge, but can you fix this, this, this, this, this, and here are some suggestions for how to fix them. Um, and then he wrote back and said, hey, these are all great suggestions. Why don't you just come work here yourself and fix, fix all this stuff yourself. Um, and so that's what ended up happening and that's how I ended up at, at Polyvore.

Speaker 1:          02:26          So you filed a bug report and got them assigned to you?

Speaker 2:          02:28          Yeah, I do.

Speaker 1:          02:30          It's Polyvore is fantastic and awful. My, my wife used to work at Polyvore, uh, enjoying Polyvore for the same reason, uh, because she needed to pay for all this stuff she was buying on Polyvore. So it's a very good site. So what was it about [inaudible] that caught your interest when you're using it? What clicked? What made you so passionate about it?

Speaker 2:          02:49          So, uh, before getting into computer science and Google and all that, my original goal in life was to be a comic book artist. And because I love to draw a that just up not working out because my parents won't let me go to art school because they're Asian and they thought it wasn't like a legitimate career. Um, but what drew me into Polyvore was, um, the ability to self express. I mean it's, it's, uh, it was a creative tool ultimately, and it was kind of at the intersection of art and fashion and technology. So I thought, wow. How often does something like that happen where you pulls together a lot of your passions? Uh, it's something that's at the very earliest stage. Uh, so if I went there, even though there's not a lot there, I would get the opportunity to learn a ton, which is actually reminded me of the APM program.

Speaker 2:          03:35          Um, I got into the APM program thinking like, okay, I don't know how to do, I don't even know what a pm is, but at least if I come here to Google I'll grow and I'll learn. Um, and you know, maybe maybe it'll work, maybe it won't. But at least I would challenge myself and grow. And that's exactly how I felt about polygraphs. Like there's nothing here. Uh, maybe I can volunteer and step up and do some of those things and I'll, I'll grow a lot. And that's what ended up happening. I actually kept volunteering to do various different things at the company. You know, I was like, Oh let me write the blogs since we don't have a marketing person or let me answer the phone when the advertisers call, cause we don't have a sales team. And then what ended up happening is I would try that job, learn just enough to be a little bit dangerous, like just enough and then figure out it was a very good at it and then hire someone else to do it.

Speaker 2:          04:23          But having done it myself, I was a little bit better at finding the right person to hire. And then, uh, that person would inevitably end up reporting to me because I was the only sort of business person at the time. And then we just kept growing and eventually a, all the departments were reporting into me except for engineering and my title was still VP of product. And uh, at that point we decided to make the switch where I became CEO. So very unusual path to sort of running a company. But that, that, that was my, yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:53          that's really interesting. And in that time, was there anything that you came across it were like, no way could never do this huge mistake. Way Too dangerous at this?

Speaker 2:          05:03          Yeah. That was like everyday, I mean, start ups are incredibly hard, right? It's um, every day is a new obstacle and I definitely felt like, especially since I was growing quickly and the company was growing every time I felt like, okay, I've got it now. I figured out how to do my job. I think I might've figured it out. Finally, that feeling would like inevitably only lasts for a brief moment because then the company would get bigger and then everything would change all over again. You people, you know, the process that was the perfect for communicating with 20 people broke at 50 people. And then as we got that right, it broke again at 75 and then at 125 and then, you know, it's just things when you're growing, things just keep changing. You just kind of have to get used to the feeling of constantly, um, not knowing what you're doing or not, not knowing how to do something, which is essentially the same thing as learning. Yeah. I'm CICI kind of see, I've always felt like you should seek out that feeling and you should try to find that really nauseous, horrible feeling of I don't know what I'm doing. Cause that's how, you know, you're getting career growth.

Speaker 1:          06:04          And then was there anything ball, you were a kind of the CEO of Polyvore that kept you up at night. I mean, what was your biggest worry about it? Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          06:11          Yeah. So specifically, um, I mean there were so many things, uh,

Speaker 2:          06:17          you know, product market fit, you know, did, where we was our product serving the users while we were very, very community driven and then figuring out like, is the market that we're in big enough? Do we have to evolve the product? Uh, lots of hiring, lots of the, especially later, all the issues became very much related to like people. Um, so did I have the right VP of sales that I have the right VP of engineering or these people clicking? I mean there were so many moments at number strangely they all felt very existential cause I think when you're the, when you're running the company, even your identity becomes intertwined with the company's identity and every bump in the road feels very, very personal. Um, which is part of what makes a startups so hard. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:59          So I was kind of stalking you on your sequoia page before this and you talk about grit a little bit. You talked about being able to create delight and overcome obstacles. Um, just kind of sticking with it. I'm sure everything wasn't always like on the up and up and it's a startup. So there's tons of times where you feel like you're dying. Yeah. So any advice for people in terms of developing grit? Is it something that's an eight and you just kind of have to express it or is it something that you prefer?

Speaker 2:          07:23          Yeah, I definitely think, you know, some people start out, there's this concept of distance travel. Like when you're looking at say an interview candidate and you look at their resume. I think if you look at the distance traveled, like where did they come from and how far have they gone? That's actually a good metric. That's how I really think about grit. Like if you started at an easier place in life, um, like more privileged, maybe your distance, you know that your distance traveled might actually be less than someone who had none of the, the privilege. So I think sometimes your, your upbringing and where you came from, that original distance travel to get to where you are actually increases your grid sort of naturally like could be your family circumstances, could be your socioeconomic classes. But on top of that, I think grit is something you actually develop over time.

Speaker 2:          08:08          And the way you do that is you push yourself to travel further. Um, you get used to just forcing yourself to do things that are hard, that feel bad, that that nauseous feeling of learning that I was talking about. Um, and that's actually what increases your grit because grid is really, it's really pain tolerance. So if you can put yourself into those painful situations and the challenges rather than kind of taking the easy route or coasting, um, that's, I think how you develop grit. And I think grit is one of the most important ingredients in startup founders because it's just so hard. You don't control so many of your circumstances. You don't control what happens with the market. You can't control the fundraising climate. You can't control what all the people on your team, you know, decide to do, or if there's a competitor that comes along. So you really have to have grit. You have to practice at getting it, getting stronger and stronger to put up with all the ups and downs.

Speaker 1:          08:59          So is that something you look for now that you're on the other side of that funding table now that you're at sequoia?

Speaker 2:          09:03          Yeah, absolutely. Um, you know, I think a combination of Grit and passion, right? Like to get through the pain of just the basics of starting a company. Um, you either have to really care about the problem and be mission oriented or you have to have that natural grip, but there's has to be something driving you right. Because on average it takes I think eight or nine years to build a company from ground zero to a successful outcome, like an exit or large Mna. And so, you know, to imagining that amount of time, like it has to be something you probably care about. One of the other great to, to power through all the problems.

Speaker 1:          09:38          Yeah. One of the other things that you mentioned on your sequoia profiling and a few other interviews that I've seen with you, cause you talk about focusing on one thing and doing it really, really well. Yeah. That was one of the core values that Polyvore yeah. Do one thing. So how has that one thing kind of change? I'm sure being a want to be comic book artist being a PM at Google, being at Polyvore and all those different roles, it's changed a lot. How do you kind of pick that one thing?

Speaker 2:          10:01          Yeah. You know, I, I think when I was a a pm one of my strengths with was I was actually empathy was being able to think, you know, what does the user want in this situation? Like as they're printing out their driving directions before Google back we used to print driving directions cause remember this is a desktop. What are they thinking, what do they want? And that empathy helps guide a lot of, you know, product decisions. Right. But then as you become, you know, then I became, you know, uh, I transitioned and at Polyvore I started answering the phones for, for sales calls. Then the empathy was applied to, you know, what does the advertiser won? And like trying to research and understand enough about the advertising industry to imagine, okay, it's not just this is an advertiser. The person that I'm talking to is an account manager.

Speaker 2:          10:48          At a large agency who was trying to advance their career and wants to do good for this client. The client probably thinks this way and be able to take all of that and figure out what the right ad product was. Then as the company got large and I started managing people, it was, you know, what am I, what does my team care about? Like where is this person in their career? How do they feel about the current state of the company, their team, their career goals? And now that I'm on the investor side, again that applies to, you know, try and understand the founder and the trying to understand the market that they're in, the users that they're serving, what do they care about? Right. So I would say that, you know, first I thought, oh my, my one skill is actually product design and product mention that I looked a little bit deeper and I realized it was probably something to do with empathy. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:33          Do you think that's just the key for consumer businesses? Is it empathy kind of across the board? Is that the thing to nail?

Speaker 2:          11:38          Not necessarily because I think, you know, with the help of amazing user researchers who can tell you like these are your three personas of, you know, the three types of users that you're, you're solving for. Like you can actually, if you're an analytical, smart person, if you have that data given to you, rather than having to imagine it, you can still be a fantastic product designer. I think the key with great consumer design is product design is creating like a, a kernel of, of delight, right? Like it's not enough to have a product that like does, solves a problem and sort of does what people ask you for. You have to go way above and beyond and there has to be this moment of like, Whoa, I didn't expect that. Or that was amazing or unexpected to the point where you would bother to tell a friend, right?

Speaker 2:          12:28          Like you're like, a good example is actually snapchat. When you take your, when you do the filters and you do one that's uh, the face swap, right? That's really clever because you didn't expect that inside some sort of chat app. And then it's inherently viral. Like I'll, I'll, I will sit there and show it to my friend, like we'll do it together. And that's a moment of word of mouth delight. So I think the secret to great consumer products is you have to, you have to grow, right? And you, you're growing. If you're growing organically, it's because people are talking about you. And the way to get people to talk about your product is to be, do something, something above and beyond. That's really, really delightful. So, so that's how I think about it. So what do you think the most important thing was that you worked at while you're at Polyvore?

Speaker 2:          13:13          And I'm wondering if you knew how important it was at the time. Yeah, I don't think I did. Um, but it turned out to be culture. Uh, in the beginning when you're starting, you, the product you build as a, as a CEO, as a founder, is the product, the service that is delivered to your users. But then as the company grows, you know your attention actually you get further and further away from the product because you know, you're, you're not the one writing the code anymore. You're not the one making the day to day decisions. You're a managing through a team and the product actually starts to become the company and the organization. And the same way that you instrument your product and measure, you know, is this feature working or not your ab test or you carefully, you know, you put Google analytics on everything.

Speaker 2:          14:01          You actually have to do the same thing with your company and your team to make sure it's healthy. Like are you measuring your employee engagement scores? Are People happy and thriving? Like his code being checked in? Like you actually have to pay a lot of attention to how people work together. And most importantly, the culture is basically the operating system. So it's, it's, it's about building the operating system for the company, which is the culture. And then all those, those metrics and things that you monitor, uh, and the larger, larger you'd get, the more and more important it becomes because you need people to be aligned on how to behave. And that's something I've always thought was really great about Google. I always felt like, um, there was a clear culture when I was here and it was measured and defined and um, really cared about and thrived and everyone knew what the googly men, and I think that's part of why Google has always been successful. So did you just for Google culture, bring it over to

Speaker 1:          14:51          Polly?

Speaker 2:          14:53          No, actually I'd made them. There are a lot of, is the same, right? Like the empowering engineers to make decisions, um, and powering product people and trying to try to be a little bit more bottoms up or at least that's how it felt when I was here. I copied a lot of that. But the one thing I did not copy was the, um, and I think you can't at a startup is you have to be very cognizant that you're on a clock and you're running out of money all the time. Google has one of the best business models in the world, right? And is basically adwords and adsense are printing money in the basement to power all kinds of amazing project. Now that's you know, evolve to android or many other business lines. But that luxury of um, oh we need to just purely focused on, you know, building the right product and not have to worry too much about revenue, which was the case. It's probably changed since then. But that was certainly the case when I was here. I could not copy that over to a startup or you had 24 months of runway and it's not even just the runway of money, you're funding. It's also the runway of people's time and patients, right. If you're underpaying your team and see, cause you know, they're not a Google or Facebook, then you have to make sure they see like a path to success. So I think being much more conscious about, uh, spend as well as urgency

Speaker 1:          16:15          and people's time was, was more, it was a big part of our culture that I would say it was different than the Google. So a couple of things I, I keep hearing is, is learning people caring or these are the things that motivated you, has kind of your motivation been the same across being an APM, being a CEO, being at Yahoo, being at sequoia,

Speaker 2:          16:34          uh, personal motivation. Um, I think I care about two things. One is impact. Like what kind of impact are you leaving, what sort of debt are you making the universe. And the second is just personal growth and learning, right? I found that if, again, if you optimize for learning, then you think about success and failure in a different way because sometimes you learn the most in the toughest situations where you are most likely to fail. So if you reframe that conversation into my learning or not learning and learning is success, then it kind of, you stopped thinking about whether you were getting the a or the sea or whether, you know, you sold for, you know, $1 billion or you know, 100 million. Like you just, you just stop thinking purely about the outcome, which makes you afraid sometimes cause you don't want to risk what you already have.

Speaker 2:          17:17          Um, and the other is impact. Uh, you know, one of the things that I really loved about Polyvore was it was as it very democratizing effect on fashion, it was about letting a community of women all around the world say, no, this is what I think is stylish and I don't want to listen to, I don't know, the fashion magazines telling me this is what you're supposed to look like. And for the women who used it, it was very empowering. And that allowed them to, you know, when you feel like you look a little better than you might feel a little more confident. And we had so many girls from school age to call, you know, girls applying to college, told women just talking about how it helped their confidence. So for me that was always part of the mission. Um, and then part of the mission for me at sequoia is, you know, venture is probably 7% women, uh, and that I think has downstream impacts on the percent of women who start companies and uh, the percent of innovation that happens in fields targeted at women.

Speaker 2:          18:09          Uh, and then that affects exacts and you know, all the way down the chain. So I thought, you know, maybe if I could move into venture and change the ratio just a little bit and help backs, you know, amazing founders, both men and women, but I might be a little bit more inclined to understand some of the female founders who are working on products targeted at women, which I was at 1.2. So those are, that's the, on the impact side. How are you approaching your role as a partner at sequoia? Now? I know it's still relatively new, but anything where you're like, this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to be focused on this, I'm going to provide this value to people. So I think my, you know, the, the investors that do the best are probably the ones that are actually helpful to their founders.

Speaker 2:          18:51          So I've tried to focus on like where can I be really helpful. Um, and some of those areas are in consumer, right? Because that's, that was what I did that my whole career has been mostly in consumer. Um, I'm also starting to look at some spaces like a ar and VR and robotics. Um, I spent a lot of time meeting female founders as well. Um, I've been looking at direct to consumer brands, which is fairly new for venture and for sequoia. Uh, yeah, those are, those are, those are some of the areas that I tend to focus on in any kind of niche fields that you're kind of geeking out about, excited about. I'm pretty excited about. Um, robotics. I think now that computer, you know, computer vision is of age, computers can see, uh, you're seeing a lot more tech moving out of like the phone.

Speaker 2:          19:36          Like instead of it being in a little screen or on your desktop, it's like moving out into the physical world. Um, and maybe the first, basically it's sort of the intersection of, it's all the tech that, that we know from the Internet and moving from pure bits into the world of, of atoms, right? So maybe the earliest version of this might be something like door dash or instacart where a or Google shopping express, right? Where it's not just software and you know, the, on my bugs, okay, it's like software and then, oh my God, all the problems of the real world, like the driver was drunk or miss the delivery or the food's cold. Like these are not things that software can catch. Right. Which is why I think a lot of these companies are run by a hardcore operational people who just know how to grind it out and have a lot of grit because it's not beautiful, elegant software anymore. And I think you're going to see more and more of that as we move to fields like robotics and more automation in the real world. You realize that, you know, you have to combine fashion and robotics and I guess Google maps. I have not seen that pitch yet, but that'd be pretty cool. I'm sure we'll come up. So before I ask you about the most important

Speaker 1:          20:48          thing that you're working on at poly fort, but what's the most important thing that you're working on today, if you're aware of it?

Speaker 2:          20:53          The most important thing, um, I think at the end of the day, like Sequoia Sequoia's mission is to, you know, help daring founders build really legendary companies. So the most important thing is to find those people and help them. Um, I've done two investments. I spent a lot of time with those founders and you know, one is a seed, one is a series B because I'm on the early stage team, we do everything from a c to two, basically series B, um, is every day is just trying to figure out how to help them. Um, and then the other pieces, you know, I've been working on various initiatives to try to figure out how to help female founders more. So there'll be more than that probably in a few weeks.

Speaker 1:          21:36          Okay. Yeah. I know you've been doing a lot of talks lately, um, conference couple weeks ago for women in tech.

Speaker 2:          21:42          Yeah. Yeah. I love going to those events. It's so amazing to see all the, um, all the activity and the excitement.

Speaker 1:          21:50          So when you were running a startup, when you're talking about product market fit, how did you know when you nailed it? I mean, delight won't give you product market fit, it'll give you vitality. How do you know what you're actually providing that value early on?

Speaker 2:          22:00          Um, so I actually do think that when you found, when you found delight and you found product market fit, that you do start to see organic growth. Um, you do start to see that that word of mouth, you're right. There are moments where you're seeing that word of mouth for, uh, other reasons. Like maybe you had a really viral piece of content on your platforms. You have to be able to figure out how to distinguish that. But generally I think organic growth means that you've found product market fit. Um, the question though is how large of a market is it that you're working on and how, you know, you can have product market fit for some very tiny sliver of a market a or for a particular user and you have to be able to distinguish like is that enough? Is this enough for a sustainable company or not mean? I think that's the biggest lesson that I've learned on the venture side is you know, I can assess the match between maybe your user an product, but thinking through the market structure like is this a good market to be in? Are there tons and tons of competitors that are, are the platform companies most likely going to dominate the space in the long run and therefore your tech will be commoditized. Thinking through those kinds of issues and market size and market structure has had sort of been one of the biggest lessons.

Speaker 1:          23:13          Any tips for learning that stuff other than joining a VC firm and thinking about 40 or 80 hours a week?

Speaker 2:          23:18          Yeah. You know, I think this is maybe something I didn't do enough of as a PM is competitive analysis, right? Like look through what other people are like, you know, you should always see, figure out what's great about your product, but you also have to think like, when I say delight, when you're going above and beyond what people expect, what people expect is set by what's available in the market, right? So just because you solve their problem doesn't mean you're going to win if there's another product that also solves their problem but has much better distribution than you do, right? So you really have to think about that line of what people expect being set partly by competitors, right? I'm a good example of this is when all the smartphones came out right before that, like blackberry was the best phone, right? It had a keyboard, you could do your email, and then when the iPhone came out, I mean, that was just, I don't need a keyboard.

Speaker 2:          24:11          Like, I can browse the entire web with us. It just reset everyone's expectations. And it took, you know, a lot of companies died during that because they didn't catch up and they were just focused on what they were doing. Right. That you have to think about who else is innovating out there, what are they doing? So I would say spending a lot of time on competitive analysis and then also thinking through, here's where we are now, where will we be in five years? Where will my competitors be in five years? And then skate towards that, you know, skate to where the puck is going, not to where it is right now. So just getting really good at thinking about that, um, is, is, uh, is I think the most important thing

Speaker 1:          24:45          and I'm guessing that advice holds true for CEOs for basically everybody.

Speaker 2:          24:48          Yes. I think that matters a lot for founders and CEOs as well. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:53          The stage matter. They're like, shit early stage startup founders be worrying about their competitors or should they just be focused on delight and value like you said.

Speaker 2:          25:02          Um, I think you still have to think about it. It's nothing that you spend like everyday obsessing about. Like I don't think you can be constantly looking behind you in the, you know, looking in the rear mirror, but you have to know what the baseline is and you have to have a sense and that's part of it, part of how you set your strategy and then you just focus on getting to that point. But you have to make sure you do those checks periodically. You know, maybe it could be once a year if you're smaller, it could be every quarter of your larger, but it is really important to have that to, to check the expectations of the market, uh, on a regular basis. But focus most of your time on actual execution.

Speaker 1:          25:39          Really curious what you think about, um, you know, the early stages of community. Obviously Polyvore had a really good community. Um, I had a good company culture. Um, do you see differences between how you seed culture internally a company and how you see that in a product?

Speaker 2:          25:52          Hmm. You know, I think it, I think it's best if they're somewhat aligned because if they are, then I think it comes across more authentically. Um, for the community. What we did is we, the same way that we cared about our individual employees, we cared about our community. When we would have a community event, we would apply to do a few things well rather than having a massive conference where we couldn't really spend time with people and we'd also just have the money for that. We chose to have smaller meetups, right? So we sent like got 20 people that come to New York fashion week with us. Then we through a beautiful breakfast for them, we took a couple of them to some shows. You tried to give them the tickets instead of us going, um, we owe our community manager and went through all their Polyvore profiles and picked out items at products that they had used regular like regularly and then bought them.

Speaker 2:          26:49          We got our advertisers to just give us swag, like free stuff and coupons and shoes or whatever. We pack them into these bags and the, I remember we had these breakfasts and like some of these women would open it and just start crying because they were so happy and it was just the immense delight was amazing and it was just such a bonding moment for those teams. And then they went on to talk, you know, to the other committee members about it. So it was great for us. You know, it's hard to measure whether that was really like an Roi positive investment. We just sometimes how people think about can you, but I think that's just not the right way to think about it. Like think about Zappos, right? Zappos has an amazing reputation and that's because of, you know, good customer service, but also like those stories of like the woman who wrote in or was on a call with a Zappos person for an hour talking about how, you know, she had like a whole series of life events and therefore needed to return the shoes and they'd let her return it and then they cut counsel her for like an hour and then gave her something for, I don't know, I don't even remember the Lord anymore, but that's the point.

Speaker 2:          27:46          All I remember is there was a story and it was amazing and that's part of what cemented, I think the, uh, the brand for Zappos.

Speaker 1:          27:54          Do you think people are focusing founders as much as they should on culture today? Do you see a lot of these really big scalable networks that don't really have an identity to them?

Speaker 2:          28:04          Yeah. Um, I think, I think some, sometimes it's easy to just be obsessed with winning and not think about culture. And that's fine if you're always winning. Like people love to work at companies that are winning. That's a huge part of it. I can't just have an amazing culture and then like, you know, driver company into the ground, you have to have both. But I think some companies have prioritize the winning over over that treating people well and that works as long as you're on that upward trajectory. But as soon as the going gets tough, um, I think people start to look around and question and they're like, why am I like the, I mean treated horribly and then they start to, to bail. So part of culture and creating that right operating system is it smooths out the bumps in the road, right? Because you, you, when the going gets tough, which it almost always does at a startup, right?

Speaker 2:          29:00          There's always going to be something that goes wrong. Um, you get to keep your team together for just a little bit long and they have a little bit more loyalty, a little bit more patience. And that extends that runway that I was talking about because it's not just a runway of money and not being able to pay people. It's a runway is a runway of people's patients, right? Like, as an employee, you have a million things to choose, uh, as a job, right? Like, if you're great, you can, you can come work at Google, you can come work at Facebook and then you get paid more or to, but they choose to work at your startup and you have to figure out like, how do you, how do you get that little bit of extra loyalty when the going gets tough? So I think culture is very, very important. And I think in general a silicon valley does focused on culture. Um, and every kind of culture there's, you know, they're co essentially the culture is, it can be extreme. That's fine. Right? Um, you know, yeah. But I think you treating, treating employees right, it's really, really important. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          29:55          So if you weren't in Tuck your, I'll say your daughter Sequoia, let's say you're banned from the tech industry forever. Are you gonna go become a comic book artist? Like what would you do?

Speaker 2:          30:06          That's a good question. Uh, I don't think I would make it as a comic book artist. I don't think I'm talented enough, but I might give it a try anyway. Yeah. Or professional costs player. Oh really? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          30:21          Can we touch on that? Because that's, that's divergent. Ah,

Speaker 2:          30:25          yeah. Well I, I I love anime and I cos play now like rarely. But yeah, that was pretty fun. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          30:35          So you were at Yahoo for a bit of time. You were at Polyvore for a very long time. You were at Google for a bit of time. Um, those are three companies and relatively similar spaces, at least parts of them.

Speaker 3:          30:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:48          What was it like working across them over time? Did you have to adapt yourself to provide the most value, provide the most impact? Or was it more of this is what you bring to the table, here's how you can influence through group around you?

Speaker 2:          30:58          Oh, it changed a lot. Um, so Google, I was, you know, an APM fresh out of Stanford computer science. I had never led a team before. I had no idea what I was doing. I never had a real job. And you come into that situation with a bunch of experienced engineers and, and you're like, how do I get these people to listen to me at all? Like I have no credibility. Um, so there, you know, I remember I was like, how do I get them to respect me? I know I'll fix a bug. So I just checked in code and the, and tried to prove that I was useful and that was willing to work hard and slowly built that relationship with that team. But it was all about rolling up your sleeves and like getting stuff done. Um,

Speaker 2:          31:40          when that, then when I had the credibility, I was able to lay out more of like the product roadmap, but everything was very, very in the weeds and you know, uh, working, working with the team, making decisions myself. Um, at Polyvore it was, uh, early days, very similar, right? Like, I mean, I, they hired me and I didn't have to work so hard to earn the respect, but um, it was a lot of in the weeds of making decisions, writing code, all of that stuff. Then when you switched to becoming a manager or VP or getting moving up in the org, you're no longer focused on the solution. You are focused on the problem. Right, and the art. I think the reason why no one likes Mike, like no one really likes micromanager and what's annoying is that the micro manager is a person who's trying to tell you, here's how you, here's the solution.

Speaker 2:          32:33          Let me tell you like do it this way, do it my way. And what you really want is an of like, no, this is the problem we're trying to solve. The reason I don't like your solution is because you didn't think about this part of the problem. So if you just articulate the problem clearly and the guard rails of like, you know what's acceptable and not, then people start to come up with the solutions that are a little bit closer to what maybe you think is ideal and inner. They don't. You have to sell except it sometimes, but because it could be totally right. I've been proven wrong many, many times, right? As I'm sure we all have if we're managers, but that just keeps changing as you grow in the org. So you start with a solution creator, then you become a problem creator.

Speaker 2:          33:12          And then at some point no one tells you anything. There's no problem given to you and you don't have to articulate, you're just here you are a VP at Yahoo, create value for our company and then no one tells you, you know, so we had, we invented products. Right. So that's, that's, that's a very different way of thinking. Um, but I, I would say that that was the difference between all the different roles in stages. So did you approach that by trying to find problems for people or did you just try to find a teams and then say, bring me problems are important. Yeah, so I sat up very, we, you know, I was, I was the VP of the lifestyle group and we know, we knew that to create value, we wanted to build a bigger mobile user base for Yahoo Cause it was still quite a homepage, desktop centric.

Speaker 2:          33:58          Um, I actually had a lot of young, younger, whether it's amazing, but still more mobile growth. And we wanted lifestyle, which to me meant, you know, younger, a younger audience, um, and a lot of women. So then what we did is we started outlining like what are the verticals that we could go into health and wellness, fashion, beauty, uh, social. And so we picked verticals. And, uh, then what we did is we started to build out user personas. What are the different types of people in this space? And then what are the problems? And uh, what I did was I didn't tell them, here are the people I know exactly like what, you know, women 18, 13 to 25 wine. I said, here are the breadwinners of those users. Um, come up with a process to understand these people. And then the team got really good at that.

Speaker 2:          34:47          They got great at creating user personas. They became amazing at running, coming up with, uh, a brainstorm. Um, Eric go is, it was involved in, it's actually your why she's, she's awesome. And they would run a process with the team to brainstorm different products. And then we came up with a process for how to test that very quickly. And then what we ended up doing is creating a process to get apps shipped in eight weeks. So we would brainstorm and then eight weeks later we would push something to android and it would be an MVP, but we'd get enough data. And then we do two or three more iterations. And there we actually shipped I think four or five apps inside of Yahoo under some, you know, umbrella companies. I didn't say Yahoo on it because we didn't want to risk the brand, but it was like a great fun thing for the team to work on.

Speaker 2:          35:30          Um, for various reasons. Well, we didn't ship all of them, you know, some of them actually sucked. Uh, and some them had interesting traction, but we ended up deciding that they weren't strategic. Uh, and the one that eventually launched was Cabana by Tumblr, which is a live streaming, a group watching APP. Um, you know, I think there's a lot more work to be done, but you know, I, I think that that's sort of how we manage that process or how I manage it as, as the, the VP without, while wanting to empower the team, but also making sure we were doing something useful in strategic for Yahoo. It's really interesting. Yeah. And these were teams of five people, so three I think three or four, no, six, three, three or four engineers and then a designer and a pm. So very small team. Eight weeks. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          36:13          So we do have, um, a dory with some questions and we also have a mic in the back. So the dory link for anyone on the live stream is go slash ask Dash Jess Lee. Um, but why don't we bring this up and take a few of these? Okay. So what's the difference between being a PM at Google and being a CEO at a startup and in your case, did you see any challenges during that transition and how did you get over them?

Speaker 2:          36:38          Yeah. Um, so I think I've mentioned some of that. The, the culture and the environment in terms of like having to think through revenue very early on was it was different. Um, you know, at Google the, the responsibility was much more about the product and less about the, the people in the org or the product became, um, the company at, at, at the CEO stage. Um, it, it was a challenging transition. Like I said, I, I've constantly felt like I didn't really know what I was doing and I just kept the job, just kept evolving underneath me and then I figured it out and then it would change again. So, yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1:          37:17          So you've been on both the building and financing side of products and businesses, so which would you pick?

Speaker 2:          37:24          Oh, that's a tough question. Um, there are pros and cons to each write on the building side. As a founder and a CEO, um, that's, there's a lot of, uh, existential stress, right? Because you become, your identity becomes the company you're constantly worried about. Are we going to make it, you know, I've brought 125 people with me on this journey. Like what am I, you know, is this going to work out for all of us? So it's much more existentially stressful than being on the investors side where your, um, the value of your work is spread out across a portfolio of companies versus all your risk tied to one single company that you are responsible for. So existential stress is much higher on the founder side. Um, I do miss getting my hands dirty, right? Like writing code, you know, making product design, they get to do a little bit of it with my earlier stage companies so that, so that scratches that itch. Um, I would say though that the learning is enormous and that's a huge upside. Um, by being an investor. Like too, it's such a privilege to meet so many amazing founders working on so many different markets. Like everyday I learn something about the latest, greatest state of some technology or a market that I wouldn't have known anything about. Uh, and it's just a privilege to meet all those awesome people. And to just constantly be learning. Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:46          So a lot of times people, I mean you always hear, don't identify too much with your work, but you see people do it all the time. Do you think that's actually a useful thing for startup founders to be doing? You said as a startup founder, you sometimes see people's opinions of the startup being a reflection of your work. Is that a good thing to care that much? Like to be that invested?

Speaker 2:          39:04          You know, I think that there's, uh, there's certainly a personal sacrifice that comes with it, but part of me also feels like it's necessary in order to get through it. So yeah, I think it's, it's a, it's a little inevitable. Like if you're too checked out, you don't really care what happens with your company. Like, yeah, I don't, I think it's hard to actually tough it out and, and, and make it work at, and I feel like I've been making startups not really terrible. It just not right. It's, it's just that it's epic highs and epic Lowe's. Right. And the epic has made it all worth it. Like, I had so many moments where I was like, I can't believe this is my job. I found my calling in life. This is amazing. I love my team. Like this is the best feeling in the world. And then also moments of like, oh my God, why did I leave Google? Right. But that's just par for the course. And I think it's like that for, for every, every founder and every CEO. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          39:49          That's why we take a live question in the back.

Speaker 2:          39:51          Thank you. Thanks so much for coming to Google. It's really interesting talk. Um, I have a question. Did you come across in sequoia? Any interesting fashion tech companies? Yeah. Um, I have seen a lot. The problem is I know where all the dead bodies are buried because I did fashion tech. So they actually say that to a lot of times investors are less likely to invest in things that they've kind of, they know too well. Uh, so I feel a little bit like that. Um, something, let's see. What would have I seen? I think there's a lot of interesting computer vision stuff that's happening now that enables fashion, fashion companies. Fashion is one of the hardest, uh, recommendation problems, right? Like, you know, Netflix had the whole Netflix prize for figuring out movie recommendations. But do you think about it, there's not that many movies, like how many movies come out per year, not that many.

Speaker 2:          40:42          And then how much does your movie tastes change versus fashion? It's like not only does your tastes change over the years, like trends change, seasons change, and then you know, the amount of product out there is astonishing and it's very difficult to describe, right? Like little touches like silk or white stripe here. Like it's just so unstructured. It's very difficult and people like very specific things. And so it's, it's one of the most difficult problems. Um, so one of, you know, there's some really interesting computer vision companies that are, you know, classifying products that look similar. And I think that that's a very interesting space. I think he'd do a lot more once you have vision. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:24          Another question in the back. He's just, thanks so much for coming here. I'm going to shun the BM and search. Hi. Uh, one of the things I'm curious to know a little bit more about is how did you having a focus versus writing a blog, being the marketing person, being the salesperson, being the product manager and so on and so forth. Can you touch a little bit more on that?

Speaker 2:          41:43          Yeah, so what I tried to do was I always had my core duties of product management and then I tried to only do one new frontier thing outside of that. So I was not writing code and doing ad sales and the blog at the same time. I did the blog first and I was like, oh, there's a lot of community stuff to do here. Let me hire a community manager. And then she took over that. Then I, um, I think after that I moved to add sales. Uh, I did a little bit and hired a great New York Times salesperson. Um, and so they were more one, you know, it's one extra thing. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          42:19          How many people were at Polyvore when you joined?

Speaker 2:          42:22          Uh, just the founders. So three. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And when you left 125, a little bit bigger. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Another question, the back

Speaker 4:          42:34          adjust. Uh, so, um, do the things that you talked about being very important to you were having a big impact and a kind of doing a lot of learning, like cross cross, cross disciplinary areas. Um, it Kinda seems like at a company like Google scale, it can be hard to, uh, um, have as big of an impact on the thing that you're working on and also to kind of be given those additional responsibilities or even like to be able to seek them out yourself. Did you have any like, advice for a, I guess trying to find those opportunities, um, when you're in like a bigger company?

Speaker 2:          43:05          Yeah. Yeah, that's it. It can be harder. Um, for sure. Uh, what I would recommend and what I think I ended up doing actually inside Polyvore as well. It was just go do them, you know, like if you see something like come up with the solution or do a little bit of that work and then bring it to the person who maybe owns that area by being mad, you'd be like, Hey, you know, could I work? Look, I already did some work here. Can I prove to them that they should have you helping before you ask them, can I help you? Right. Like, just go ahead and do it. Uh, so, so that was a big part of, of my drain, I think, um, that works anywhere. Um, in terms of impact, I, yeah, I mean, Google touches so many, many, many people though that even when you own a small part of something, you might still be as impactful as working on a huge thing inside of a company with much less many fewer users. Um, yeah. But, you know, I think autonomy is maybe one of the key differences between small startup and at large company. So that one's very hard to, I think you just have to pick where you want to be. Yeah. Thanks.

Speaker 1:          44:15          So another question from the dory, it's part of being a CEO and a pm is making hard decisions. Can you share an example of one of these really hard decisions? How you approached it?

Speaker 2:          44:24          Yeah. Um, so let's see. We pivoted our business model twice. Um, and then, uh, that's probably, those are hard decisions. Uh, and then other hard decisions were probably, uh, when people had to leave. Right. I would say one thing that's interesting about startups, I didn't realize until I went through it, is there are people who are just awesome at the early stage, right? They love being one of 10 people. They're so good, they're jacks of all trades and they just love the freedom and the autonomy. And then as the company gets bigger, you know, they, they start to feel really like encumbered and they don't like it anymore. And You keep trying to make it work because you just like love that person. But really the best thing to do is actually let them go free and find the next company. So those were some of the hardest decisions because I was like, why isn't it working?

Speaker 2:          45:16          Let's just make it work. We'll just like rearrange the universe to work and it just doesn't work that way. Some people are just great for different stages, so I think that was a hard one. Um, the other one was like I mentioned just pivoting, sometimes there there's pull, they're like, you know, your business model is not working and you're not making money and you have to do something else. So those are difficult to roll out to a team. Right? Like if a whole group of people work on this particular business model and our low longer needed, right. Like that's very difficult. But you, you have to do the right thing for the company and for the greater good of that, of that group. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          45:52          Now that you are evaluating new companies and potential investments and potential founders that you're looking at, do you consider that when looking at founders, like is this person a great in the beginning but I worry about them the long run or is it too hard to protect?

Speaker 2:          46:05          It's pretty hard to predict. Like honestly, I think if you met me like before Polyvore you might not have assume that I would have been able to get to the larger company stage. I'm on more on the introverted side. I hate public speaking. Like it's, uh, I don't, you know, I, I don't think you would've said that person can definitely scale to run like, you know, have vps and stuff reporting into them. Uh, so I, I try to be very, very open minded about that and they just look for that grit, right? Like it distance traveled. Like, can you keep pushing yourself? You have a history of pushing herself because he might be able to push yourself all the way through because it's not, it's not rocket science, right? It's hard, but it's, it's a lot of trial and error and just learning on the job. So is that, that's more what I look for. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          46:48          Any advice for introverted PM's are founders? Yes.

Speaker 2:          46:52          Yeah. I mean, I think you can be a great leader even if you're very, very introverted, right? Um, you know, you might not be the highlight of a cocktail party or something, but that who cares, right? At the end of the day, you have to be able to convince your team of what the vision is. You have to, uh, be able to rally them. Um, you know, for my all hands, I really hated speaking in front of the whole company a lot. So what I did is I actually had, um, a lot of the other folks on the team speak and explain what they were doing. Right. Which is actually nice because people like be, you know, other people like being in the spot. They like getting credit for what they're doing. Instead of me talking the entire time that, that was, uh, uh, that was something that I did.

Speaker 2:          47:29          And, and, w you know, I was still able to have lots of really meaningful, great one on one conversations or small group conversations. And because I didn't like public speaking, I would always have slides. Right. I'm a, I love to draw. I'm a designer, so I would make sure that whenever I was giving a talk, I had a beautiful set of slides so that everyone would be looking at that instead of it. Um, and that helped me. He made me less nervous. And it also, I think with a guide for what I needed to say. And um, yeah, you know, you just find your, your tips and your tricks. Um, I think he'd be a great leader as an introvert or an extrovert.

Speaker 1:          47:59          Yeah. Can we take out the other questions from the back? Okay. Um, okay. I was wondering if you could share your most recent public investment and I guess like what drove you to actually invest in that team?

Speaker 2:          48:08          Yeah, so it's installed so I can't share it. Um, maybe I can tell you a little bit about what they do. Um, so this company is an, uh, an item demand staffing up platform. So they match, uh, workers, blue collar workers to jobs, uh, or shifts at companies like target or Uniclo or you know, at a warehouse. Um, they're live in like eight different cities, so it's not just a San Francisco problem, but you know, there's a lot of people who, I mean, there's a lot of unemployment in this country. Um, and some of it is actually due to inefficiencies. So they are a marketplace that matches people. Um, really great hardworking, humble team. They continue to do jobs on the weekends themselves just to make sure they don't forget what it's like. Uh, and a lot of distance traveled with these founders. So I really love their, uh, their grit.

Speaker 1:          49:02          Yeah. Well, I guess kind of a follow up, um, do you think that there's a trend of, I guess like a lot of startups that focus more on middle America and like a lot more blue collar things, um, that tend to succeed? Um, and might be harder to find as an investor since like investors tend to be in like the Silicon Valley bubble or like New York, stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          49:23          Yes. I do think that that's true. Um, I, it's something I think about a lot. Like I think, you know, is this thing gap widening, uh, like, or you know, does it help with obviously I, you know, we're not pure impact social investors like sequoia is where it is and has been for 45 years because it produces tremendous returns consistently and his back legendary companies like Google or apple or Nvidia, uh, and airbnb. Uh, and it is so, it is important that it, it does drive performance and drive returns, but I do. Those are, those are things that I think about and I think those are a lot of, there are a lot of untapped opportunities and I think that the company had just mentioned falls perfectly in that realm. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          50:18          So why don't we take it one more Tory question. It's what is something that Google can learn from other companies now that you're back here after like a decade, what lessons you brought back for us?

Speaker 2:          50:28          Huh, wow. I mean it's hard to tell Google like, hey, you're not doing very well because that's clearly not the case. Um, I thought it was very clever to break up Google into multiple companies to give more autonomy and breathing room to, and like leadership for a lot of people. I thought that was a very, very clever thing. So I guess that's more something that other companies can maybe learn from Google. Um, and I, and again, I think that comes from maybe caring about you that growth and investing in people or maybe there's financials. I don't know, but, but that, that's how I thought about it. Let's see. I do think the, the focus, the one thing that I had already mentioned was, um, just knowing that you have a runway and that sense of urgency. Um, I do think that sometimes that can be really helpful, helpful, forcing function. Like when you're in a meeting with someone for the third meeting about the same topic and you can't get everyone to agree and you're trying to get consensus. Um, sometimes it's good to think like we, we have six months to live, right? Like do we, should we be arguing about this right now? Cause I think getting rid of some of those extra meetings would, would make people a lot happier probably. So maybe that's my one thing.

Speaker 5:          51:41          And then why don't we take one last question from the back and then we'll wrap up. Right. Thanks. Thanks Doug. Thanks. Thanks for organizing it. So first let me apologize by saying that I know we're been to Polyvore side and so, um, part of me, um, so I understand that the users were a big component of your, your product design and success of the company, uh, in sometimes, but you just get to two powerful, sometimes there are power users that troll you and the entire user community in the fall. Sometimes there are power users get their power users within the segment of users, the troll, everything. Uh, was this the case in [inaudible] case there you've got blindsided by what users were saying in some certain cases or where you had to take a decisions against. What do you use? We ask asking for thoughts.

Speaker 2:          52:27          Yeah. I think knowing your users and listening to your users does not mean doing everything your users. Cause sometimes they ask for things that just don't make sense. Right? Like if every user was a product, you know, designer, then we'd all be, you know, designing products and we all be reach entrepreneurs. Um, so you have to listen to, you know, when they say I want something, you have to think, okay, you're giving me a solution. What was the problem you were trying to solve? And then you have to remember that for every vocal user there is a ton of silent users out there, which is why for us personas were very important. So we had clear personas for the different types of users. There was a creator who made all the content and was constantly asking us for features and talking. And then there were the more casual shoppers and browsers, and we had personas for them as well. Um, so I think you use user research plus talking to your users, plus personas and all these other tools to get a sense of how much to prioritize across your entire user base. But yeah, I definitely don't just listen directly, do everything that is, let's thank Jeff for coming. It's been great for having me.
