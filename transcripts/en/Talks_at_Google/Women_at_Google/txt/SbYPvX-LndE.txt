Speaker 1:          00:02          All right. I'm very excited for my fourth toxic Google to welcome Kari Byron. Best known of course for the Discovery Channel Show mythbusters. But she's done many, many things since for over a decade. She's been a strong presence in the world of reality based science television. She's hosted thrill factor, head rush, Pumpkin chunking, large and dangerous rocket ships. Ldrs. Super Cool. Uh, so you spent a lifetime occurring odd skills and interests after graduating college as an artist. She traveled the world, decided to settle in San Francisco to pursue a career as a sculptor, which is amazing. Um, but ended up discovering the handling poop, eating bugs, wiring, explosives and scraping chicken guts off the ceiling was a real dream job. Perfect resume for Google. All right. I'm very excited to welcome Carrie to Google.

Speaker 2:          00:51          Oh well thanks for bringing me out here

Speaker 3:          00:58          from the bay area. So for me, I've watched Google grow. I mean, I came here with Jamie for a photo shoot you guys had when it was like an open floor with some cubicles and I was so impressed because you had a candy wall. You have grown a lot. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16          So before talking about everything had been up to since mythbusters, I have to ask, is your job as insanely fun as it appears or are you just some terrific actor?

Speaker 3:          01:26          Well, I'm definitely not a terrific actor and if you look at early mythbusters, you can tell how nervous and awkward and bad I am at talking. It is really, really obvious. My job is actually very, very fun and that is one thing that we always had. His mythbusters was one of the few shows that was on reality. That was actual reality when we were hurt, we were hurt. When we're happy, we're happy and you know, you're doing some really fun, interesting stuff. And when it was boring they would just edit it out. So

Speaker 1:          01:56          no, and even with all the set up, because all the shows you've done, there's a lot of stuff that gets filmed and Diane are not film behind the scenes. Is that stuff's still fun or is there any part of it, this kind of like a drag when you hear actors talking about the hours of waiting in the trail or in the drudgery and making a film? Was it all fun?

Speaker 3:          02:12          Well, you know, we were all friends. Um, and, and we actually had chemistry so we, before we all had angry birds so that everybody would ignore each other. We had these really fun games that we would do when say there was some sort of safety protocol. Like, you know, the bomb squad had a full hour that they had to wait and we were stuck in a bunker. We would come up with old timey games, like throw the rock at the can and we would have so much fun trying to see who could hit the can. Like we, we always had fun. Even when some of the things kind of dragged on, we all had a very similar senses of humor, which slowly got lower and darker because that's what happens when you get familiar with people and we all just kept each other very much in stitches.

Speaker 1:          02:57          Cool. You on to college for Film and sculpture, your most well known for your science or programming. How has your background as an artist influenced how you communicate science?

Speaker 3:          03:07          Well, you know, I come from a long line of, of Sciencey and rd people and I feel like they are in the same vein. It's all about fostering a curiosity. You know, with, with art you're taking an idea and you're trying to explore it in a visual way that um, helps you come to some sort of conclusion or feeling about that question. And Science is the same thing. It's just exploring your curiosity. The difference is, I feel like over time science became very sort of, you know, when I was growing up almost like clinical where it was identifying the parts of a cell. Whereas when it really gets fun is the way we did it on mythbusters is where you'd get really dirty and you get your hands on it and you do it the way you do art. You know, you're, you're throwing a pot, you're getting your hands in the, in the Google.

Speaker 1:          03:56          So that kind of builds into this question is there's a perception among some that science is not a creative in Denver that creative people pursue the arts. What have you learned about science, especially past what you get in high school? Um, about the creativity of scientists and those persons that pursue science?

Speaker 3:          04:13          Well, I think it's pretty obvious in the tech community you guys have figured it out that a great diversity actually comes to a better space in solving any sort of problems. So when you bring an artist into, you know, a scientific field or vice versa, you come up with the most beautiful things, look at kinetic sculptures. When you take science and apply it to art and you make these incredible moving pieces, I think it works the same way. You just have a different approach. And a, over the years I've learned that art and science are pretty much

Speaker 1:          04:45          is there mashed inner and you've also emceed some amazing events showcasing students sign in addition, the White House science fair, uh, to the vex world championships and Disneyworld. A super cool. What have you learned from the students that you've met over the years?

Speaker 3:          04:59          Never under estimate young people because they are so much more sophisticated then I was as a kid and, and when you talk to a 12 year old, you talked to him like there are 35 year old, you know, it's, it's, it's, um, I've learned so much from them and their experiences because everyone at that age is so honest and will tell you exactly what's happening and they're so creative and the world's just so open and it's just such a beautiful way to approach it. And I think sometimes as we get older, we, we lose that need to be fascinated.

Speaker 1:          05:32          Well, I can tell you, we have, we have thousands of interns every summer. If you were probably in the audience right now. And it's amazing what interns can accomplish before they've even finished, uh, have finished their college degree. Very true. So a lot of them has written about how you visited mythbusters and never left, uh, for students that have no idea what they're planning to do with their lives when they grow up. What have you learned about making the most of unexpected opportunities?

Speaker 3:          05:56          Well, I feel like I was almost too young when I went to college to truly appreciate it. I, I mean, that might be pretty universal, but I don't think that I was the kind of person that, uh, took advantage of it the way I probably would now for me when I was traveling, um, that's where I really learned how to say why not and to go for opportunities because I was traveling alone around the world. I hadn't, you know, I had friend to start with, but then we went our separate ways and it was just the sort of thing where you just have to, even if it's scary, you have to try it. And I feel like that is what led me into mythbusters to start with because I, you know, I tried advertising and I was bored and I tried all these different careers and I just couldn't find myself.

Speaker 3:          06:42          And I came to mythbusters in my late twenties, but I was ready to just work for free. I was like, you know, I will be an intern because I want to do sculpture and special effects seems like an easy fit because you guys get paid to do sculptures. How did I know it was a dying art? Uh, the time, the practical effects were just crumbling beneath the crushing computer industry, but I really, really wanted to learn how to have an interesting life. And so I thought if I just do it for free, sooner or later I will prove myself worthy and maybe they'll pay me.

Speaker 4:          07:14          You had a long road with miss busters was never a point where you wavered or it got old or, or did you just manage to have this incredible long run where it was fun the whole time?

Speaker 3:          07:23          I mean it, it, it changed along the way. It was, it, it's peak fund when we had the least amount of cooks in the kitchen where we were just allowed to run with it and kind of do what we wanted. Whenever any buddy tried to mess with the formula and try to figure out what makes it popular and do more of that, you know that that was always a little hard. Like for a while they kept trying to make us fight. They would, they would, you know, like all those chopper shows were so popular. So they would take me aside. This was back when Scotty was there to take me aside and be like, Scotty said about what you did. You know what she said about your field, and then she takes Scotty's. I'd be like, Oh, this is what Carrie just said about you. And they try to get us to fight and be like, oh, you're probably right. Your way is better. And they're like, no, no, never works. We're fallen for it. We liked each other.

Speaker 4:          08:15          So you've already brought up the diversity is so important. Combining sciences and technology and gender, so specifically about getting more women to pursue stem, which is a huge priority of Google and we've got a long way to go. And we've been very public about that. It's persistent challenge. What have you learned about inspiring kids? Especially girls to ignore those stereotypes or look beyond them.

Speaker 3:          08:33          I mean, I feel like we've made a lot of progress. I mean a long, not too distant past. I was, you know, would've been chaining myself to other women trying to get the right to vote. And then my mom's generation was burning their bras, trying to get me to go to college. And now we're here where, you know, when, I don't remember seeing a lot of women in dynamic scientific positions on TV. If they were in a doctor, they were the nurse. They were never the, the scientists. They were never the smart one. And now every TV show you look at, you see actual women represented in smart scientific fields. And you know, maybe by the time my daughter's a grown up superhero, women won't have to fight in high heels. Like I feel like progress is being made. Um, I know that when I, I don't know if I'm an expert in this at all.

Speaker 3:          09:19          I do know that the girls I talked to with the White House science fair seem like they were, they had it down. They, you know, I asked them what got you into it and they all had these great stories of triumph to get to where they were. But mostly supportive parents, especially a supportive dad was really, really important. Um, the having role models they could look at like people like Ellen stolen from NASA. Like you know, seeing women like that succeeding was, was really important. Seeing themselves reflected in the media was very important but also mostly it was being able to find like minds. You may be the only girl in the math club at your small school, but there's another only girl in Minnesota in the math club. And if you guys can get online, which is the beauty of the Internet, you can actually connect, you can feel that support and maybe you can help each other stay because I feel like people get interested in things but fall away when it's hard or when they feel like an outsider.

Speaker 3:          10:19          And if you're the only girl you might feel like an outsider. So you got to network and help each other out. We as women also have a tendency to compete and tear each other down and we've been raised that way. Whereas I think we're trying very hard to start being supportive. Like every time I meet a woman trying to get into my industry, people are always trying to pit me against them. Like, ah, she's trying to be like, you were her shows not as good. I'm like, there's a woman on TV, are you kidding? I'm going to call her and if we can help each other, this will be great. I wouldn't be where I am without people like uh, Debbie Myers from science channels. She's like, let's do a show that inspires girls. Let's do it. She helps me out. I'll help her out anytime she needs it. Cool.

Speaker 1:          11:03          You've always struck me, we were talking about this before about being an accidental celebrity. By that I mean you didn't, you didn't do theater. I tried to Google it and then I asked though theater, no theater background. You weren't designed to be a star, you know, so you were at an accidental. You gain celebrity status waiting until you're past about how different is real world carry from the brand carry and is there any difference in you even think about that?

Speaker 3:          11:26          Um, TV characters, a lot more. Makeup, clothes are generally tied her on TV I think because, well, or maybe that's just because of moving parts for machinery. I don't want to get hurt. I wear a lot less dresses on TV. That's about it.

Speaker 1:          11:40          But other than that, Byron we see on mythbusters and pumpkin shape. That is you feel like you're able to be who you are?

Speaker 3:          11:47          Yeah, I mean, I, I didn't, when we started, uh, mythbusters, it's, it's not like you have audience like this, which would have been incredibly intimidating. You have a camera crew that you're friends with and it's almost like making a home movie. And so it just slowly became part of what I did. And I don't live in the Hollywood structure as well, so I don't do red carpets in that kind of fun stuff, except for maybe once a year I get invited to something special and I'll go down to la. So I think that maybe that would have fed me more of the celebritiness but

Speaker 4:          12:20          no, myth busters, I think you did. You're on the red carpet for the Emmy's. Mythbusters never didn't want to got nominated ton. Did it ever win? Now far if mythbusters won an Emmy, total crime, what would be your acceptance speech? Oh, they would let me get back. The small amount of time I talked. So much music you get the best speech has got the music. Yeah. All right, so the internet does not have a great track record when it comes to the online treatment of women. How has your experience been with the online world?

Speaker 3:          12:50          Um, at first I had to get a thicker skin because we had message boards that we were encouraged to be very interactive with our audience because that was what made mythbusters different is that our audience was part of us. And um, you know, I got my feelings hurt really easily when people would, I remember somebody called me a bubble head and I cry. I mean, it's just, it's just silly insole. But it was just, you know, [inaudible] was, it was a little tough, but I grew a really thick skin and I just don't read that stuff and I kind of laugh at it now. You just don't engage. Um, and you definitely don't Google your name with the words feet or butt or you in any male Costar or

Speaker 4:          13:35          sort of more positive like you've been on David Letterman show. It's a while back. Google it. It was my first nervous. I can tell you, you were amped up. I was playing my dress the whole time. My feet were sweating. You opposed to science for, as I mentioned, the White House medical events. What is the coolest door that's been open because of getting some celebrity?

Speaker 3:          13:57          Oh my God, the White House. I mean, I got it. I got invited to host though White House science fair because they were, there was an emphasis on women and girls and I was so humbled by the experience. It was so incredible. I got to do this panel with some really incredible women and some, some girls that had made it to the science fair and hear all their stories and we just got to sit around and talk. And I walked away from there just in awe. And then the president said my name out loud, my mom and dad could hear, which was amazing. And then they ushered me off to a little secret room with like teen came in and all these fancy people. And then the president comes over and gives me a hug and I'm just like,

Speaker 4:          14:37          oh, this is so crazy.

Speaker 3:          14:41          And then at one point I had to go look for the bathroom. They just let me walk around the White House. Like I would just walking around looking for bathroom, like kind of looking for some like monogrammed m and m's or something to steal. But you didn't. But then like John Kerry just walks past me on his phone.

Speaker 1:          14:59          That's pretty hard to top up degree. Um, so mythbusters head rush, you've had a chance to recreate and test some cool science. What is the most unexpected results that you can choose? Just one surprised you. It was not what you're planning

Speaker 3:          15:15          you. There's so many different ones. And I've talked about him a lot. Like a bull in a China shop. I couldn't believe bowls were graceful complete elephants were actually afraid of mice. I couldn't believe that an ancient Chinese system using drums buried in the ground actually would, uh, trigger, you could hear somebody tunneling from far away from this old ancient system. Um, but the most surprising I had was, I don't think I've ever talked about it, but, uh, on head rush, um, I had a science advisor that had this experiment for me where it was making a heating water in sort of an early Meyer. And then he told me to put a lid on it. I was like, I feel like that's a pressure vessel, but you know, I didn't hear the science guy and my gut kept telling me, this is a bad idea.

Speaker 3:          16:06          This is a really bad idea. He's like, no, no, no, no, no, no. Well, I've done this before. I've done it a million times. So I'm like, okay, he's the scientist. What do I know? So I, I made the, this experiment, I put my head down close because they want to get a shot. And then I stood up and it exploded and it burned across my stomach so that the skin fell off. And I have like a kind of a scar, the shape of a wolf, which is kind of cool. But it was, it was a really important moment for me because it, it shook me because I feel like there's this psychology that you think of, the camera's rolling. You can't get hurt if the camera's rolling. Nothing can go wrong. And I also, I didn't trust my gut and I only got hurt in a, in a really uncomfortable way right before you have to go on vacation to a Hawaiian island because the skin was coming off. But, uh, it was, it was a small price to pay for a new awareness where I could realize, okay, you've got to actually stay safe even if the camera's are rolling. Trust your gut. And just because somebody has the credentials, it doesn't mean they're right.

Speaker 1:          17:16          So I'm gonna ask a couple more questions and open it up to the Googlers. So start thinking, ask good questions. Uh, so on a Pumpkin chunking and Ldrs, you've had the chance to meet some really interesting people that, and if you're not familiar with pumpkin chunk, and that's this event where you hurl a pumpkin really, really far

Speaker 3:          17:35          by any mechanical means possible. So we're talking catapults, Trevor's Jay's air cannons. It just, it, it can't be like rockets. And they, they go almost, they've gone over a mile, a pumpkin

Speaker 1:          17:50          and then a large and dangerous rocket ships. People take pretty much anything and turn it into these ridiculous rocket ships. And also I'm rock tips go super high. So when you've met these both really cool shows, check them out. Um, what have you learned about the people behind these crazy, insane Stein's? Now you've had a chance to talk to them, meet them, like what makes them tick?

Speaker 3:          18:10          I just, I have a great respect for anybody who follows a passion, specially weird passions and the fact that these gorilla engineers are just sitting in their garage and this is their hobby to create a huge trevorshay to Laba pumpkin and their whole years dedicated to that. It's so much fun because they're, they're the good kind of crazy, you know, they're, they're using, they're using a science and engineering in a wild and cool way and they turn it into a family event. Like everybody brings their kids and kids get into the physics of it and it's, it's some of that unintentional learning that I always love where it's, you know, it's, it's the cheese on the Broccoli. It makes it taste good. I learned something.

Speaker 1:          18:55          Okay. And on your most recent project with the travel channel or thrill factor also, very cool. It looks like a blast. How did you convince Tori to vomit and pass out on a stunt plane to show the effects of four?

Speaker 3:          19:07          I didn't really tell him to vomit path. That wasn't right. It's fantastic. And watch it. Oh Tori and I are really good friends and we do a lot of shows together because it's, uh, were, were complete and total opposite. It's like a, it's, it's, it's really fun. And he was the one that brought the stunt planes to us cause he met a rich guy that had stunt planes and he's like, let's, let's go out there to Vegas and do this. And I was a little dubious cause it seems crazy but towards a certain kind of charm where it's, it's sort of like his men friends kind of, you know how men get where they, they love each other but they want to torture each other, you know, all these. So, so we go up in the plains and they, he actually has a really great resistance to g lock and he gets to the point of fighter pilot before he passes out.

Speaker 3:          19:55          And I think that made the pilot sort of challenged. He's like, Oh, you had passed out yet, what we're going to make you pass out. And then after I watched Tori pass out tamable they basically just turn off the engines and let the plane tumbled. And he was insane. And I looked over like, oh my God, that's awful, Huh? How, how do you do that? He's like, Oh, you want to do it now? It's like, no, no, turn off the plane. It tumbled. Mind you, none of this made it to air. I've suffered for nothing. Tumbled into the plane. And then just cute. I like, and then as I'm getting off the plane with my puke bag and you know, the travel channel crews down there, they're like, all right. So I don't let that, we both had to sit in a dark room for an hour before they could do interviews and stuff with us. And we had wanted to the plane part out of the way. So we didn't do any of the preliminary stuff just yet, like walking in. And uh, so I had to get the puke out of my hair and get the Mascara Alec from an Emea. It's like a pretend like it hadn't happened yet.

Speaker 1:          21:02          So one, one final question. I'm my hand it off to the audience. So if you could have a cameo in one of the following, which would you choose? And why Star Wars, Star Trek, game of Thrones or Sharknado,

Speaker 3:          21:18          if it was based entirely on fashion. The dresses and the outfits that they wear in game of Thrones is awesome. But the women don't fare too well. It's a little violent. So I mean I would clearly pick star wars because the like layers let it then I won't spoil news there. They're leaders, they're warriors and they're equals and they get to fly. Cool planes. And

Speaker 1:          21:42          how has that movie, because we were talking about this week, how has that movie affected your daughter? Like how does that, what impact did ray have?

Speaker 3:          21:48          I have a seven year old. So, uh, when we went to see the movie, she had no idea. She, she, she hadn't watched any of the star wars. And we went with my nephew who was five and so excited and we, we win to the theater and she's like, Oh yeah, this will be cool. And then when it turned out that ray appeared and she was the main character, my daughter yelled back, everybody's laughing after that. She went home, she made a wrapping paper, Light Saber. And she just be, you know, she actually threw away all her princesses. Don't tell Disney we threw it. We wait. We didn't throw them away. We took all of our princesses and we gave them to a younger cousin and it was all about star wars. Cool.

Speaker 1:          22:30          That's cool. Sandy Diego to my daughter. So. Very cool. All right, so I have a helper here with a microphone and the Dory. If there are any doors. There are some. All right, I will, I will, uh, just go on the audience first and I will look through the dory. The Dory by the way, is our internal mechanism for people watching our lives and ask questions. So I will look through those for those. The livestream. Okay. All right, so we'll go to an audience question first. Yes, yes, yes.

Speaker 3:          22:53          I'm Erica. Hi. Um, I actually have three daughters, seven, 10 and 12. And um, also very similar to you, engineering, art sort of my whole life. I've kind of been in there, so I understand the desire. Um, I wanted to know if you have heard of what's called she heroes because I think that modeling is a sort of a really key thing for our daughters. Um, and so there's a program called she heroes were people like you and regular people, um, do little video clips and, and give models to young kids, young girls for like being cool and being cool and science. So I was just curious. Yeah, I hadn't heard of it, but I will definitely put that on my look. Lexi's okay, cool. I'll Google it. Google it because it's, I mean, you involved in that I think would be awesome. Is that Shirley use, do I am friends with somebody who does it? So if you the connection, I'm happy to set you up.

Speaker 4:          23:47          Sorry. Already. It is a very cool program for anybody that our first question end plug and going to the dory. Uh, so what's the coolest skill you've learned while mythbusters that you've used outside the show?

Speaker 3:          24:00          I should, I say

Speaker 4:          24:03          no. Like as soon as someone says, should I seen this, the answer, of course we need to hear it.

Speaker 3:          24:07          I, um, well as I love to do artwork, I have, I used to really love the impressions that black powder would make after you exploded. So I do some black powder painting now at an undisclosed location that is completely safe and completely legal. It's, it's, um, it's really, it's a fun medium to work with when you know how to do it safely. And I learned how to do it safely and I learned that you can get anything on the Internet from China for your artistic passion.

Speaker 4:          24:41          So I have to build on that because the explosions in mythbusters in slow mo are phenomenal. And what is your favorite all time explosion?

Speaker 3:          24:50          Oh, that's easy. Because you know, people always ask me about my favorite papered explosions and you know, there's that pushing power of Amoco photo and then c four is sort of like a dirty quick one. But like I love, I can't, oh, like it might actually be an ignition, but when we shot guns at, um, a propane tank, it made this gorgeous, billowing, fiery, probably not great for the environment. Cloud that in slow motion kind of roles. And it was just beautiful that in coffee creamer also an ignition when coffee creamer exploded it into the air and lit it with a flair. Also just like a fuel based kind of Hollywood style explosion, the kind of thing that you actually expect to see as an explosion. Cool audience, I'm sure. Yes. I'm curious what your favorite myth was that either never actually made it to air or never got selected to even be done at all.

Speaker 3:          25:47          Uh, we, we've definitely had, we had a couple that didn't make it to air either cause they were ridiculous or we couldn't do them. Where we tried to do this one called squash weight lifter where, um, the, the idea was that one of those giant Pumpkins from Monterey had the capacity to lift a car if it grew underneath it because it, it had that kind of strength. Um, but turns out all of us at black thumbs and we couldn't grow anything. And we had this like, not from gardens. So we tried it twice, three times. We had this garden set up with the best hydroponics because San Francisco and it's like crazy grow light disco den. We had the seeds from some, you know, champion Pumpkin's and we couldn't get anything bigger than this. We try to try it. I'm like, ah. But it was really fun because we had that crazy garden and I enjoyed the, it was a little zin going out there and trying to garden, but I guess the environment just wasn't supporting it. So recently Google has been doing things like deep and Magenta

Speaker 4:          26:44          with some basic forays into AI, creating art and music. What would be some combinations of science and art that are just completely psi Phi that you would like to see become reality?

Speaker 3:          26:54          Oh hmm. I would like my own slave robot. Android. They could, could light the explosions in my black powder painting closer than I could. That is a very complex question. I like it. Um, have you ever seen, I think they're called wind to beasts. When debase, when base those, those giant kinetic sculptures, they move in the wind. That that's my favorite kinetic application of science to art. I thought that was so beautiful. It's all AI scares me though.

Speaker 4:          27:31          These aren't real people. These are all wouldn't be surprised. Testing the Beta tester on the scary AI. We're going to go back. They don't look like regular people. How we're going to analyze the last and make sure they were laughing. Any appropriate party. All right. Scenes from mythbusters over like, Hey, I'll do that. You really wish what club? Major error. Okay.

Speaker 3:          27:54          Oh, I mean, there's so many, but um, I could tell you a super embarrassing one that was kind of funny. Um, there was, uh, there was a point where we were, we were out in the desert and tensions were high. It was hot. People were fighting. It got really sort of, uh, just, just very tense. And so I walked up into the middle of a tense conversation and just walked up to grant, went pull my finger. They laughed very hard as I think, you know, that means you toot, right? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          28:27          Yeah. Okay. I just felt like, I was like, I couldn't figure out anything to make this better. It was like nothing better than a girl fart. Curl cars are funnier than dog hearts. I'm not sure how to go about that. So I'm not going to pivot off that question. We will get so off the dory. What advice, we'll take a couple more questions. What advice would you give to a young aspiring scientists? But I'm going to modify it a little bit. One of the youngest

Speaker 3:          28:58          firing female scientist. Uh, find a mentor and find an internship. Find someone doing what you want to be doing because likely they will help you out. And ever people love talking about themselves. I've been doing it for like half an hour now. You can usually get in good with somebody and they're, they're likely to help you out. And everybody loves an insurer and they work hard. They're trying to prove themselves and they are cheap or free. So you can get your foot in the door, you can get some experience. Find out if it's what you really want to do. And I mean, that's how I started on mythbusters is just a lot of exploiting free labor.

Speaker 4:          29:36          So he started with sculpture. And now you've mentioned like the black powder stuff, the kinetic art is sculptured still your now, now TV films, Cetera. Uh, it's sculpture is still your favorite or do you have a new favorite?

Speaker 3:          29:48          Heck, no. I love sculpture rights. I think in three d like I am a much better sculptor than a draw. It's someone who draws. I, if I have an idea of something how I want it to look, I can make it in clay better that can, I can draw it. So for me it's very calming and um, I'm a bit of a multitasker, so I will do sculptures. Well, I listened to podcasts or watch TV or try to have meetings when they're on not Skype. Um, because they can see that and I, I still make a lot of them and I use them as a terrifying parental learning tools for my daughter. I make these things called manners, monsters or behavior beasties to break her of habits such as a, for a while she wasn't each to, when she was much smaller, she had a tendency not to flush the toilet.

Speaker 3:          30:33          So we made a monster that looked like it was crawling out of the toilet that I said, if it stays in there too long, it comes to life. Um, we had booger monsters that you know the boogers in your nose and if you go in there and steal their food, they're going to crawl out of your nose and look for food. They might crawl on your ear and eat your brain and you'll never learn to read. So we, we make these little, I have, I have monsters grow almost every bad behavior. So I've got a ton of them now and they're creepy and little kind of timber and you look at things and that they've, they cured her of nail biting real fast.

Speaker 4:          31:07          All right. Who would back a Kickstarter campaign for a boob? Wildstar terrifying your children into good behaviors. We're going to take them, we'll take one more, one more dory and one more live question. And then we have time for a short mean green. So I'm going to modify this a little bit. So what's the most dangerous thing, not that you did on the show, but that you didn't do on the show because you finally here. This would probably be too dangerous to film anything Tori ever suggested it and all right, so that sounds good. We'll bring Tory in for a followup and that will be the leading fashion. All right. We had a one more to the microphone.

Speaker 5:          31:45          Back to the art side. I do follow your black powder work. Uh, tried to dabble a little bit in it myself and caused a little bit more fiery explosions probably, and not a safe manner as you, but for the art side, do you, you've done a lot of advocation for technology, engineering and all of that. How do you feel companies like this? Like we have a makerspace here. Uh, it's called the garage. And do you try to advocate that artistic side towards a lot of those ends to those tech sides? Cause I feel like sometimes that's lost when there's a lot of science and engineering and all of that. You might lose some that ingenuity or the fun of arm that comes with it. Is that something that you often see or is there anything that advocating wise that you do on it?

Speaker 3:          32:28          I love living in the bay area because we are clearly a strange bubble of people who it's, I hear it's not stem, it's steam. We put the art in the stem because I, I mean mathematicians are artists and scientists are artists and I, I think that the maker movement is incredible and I love how DIY and sort of that the whole sort of Etsy generation is kind of bringing it back to an rd form and the maker fairs getting bigger every year. And it's so cool to see people applying all of their different brains into something even. It's ridiculous but beautiful and cool. I love the maker movement. Cool.

Speaker 4:          33:10          Well, I don't want to thank you for an awesome visit to Google. Oh my God. Thank you. This has been fun to see that we fed Kairi Jeanette to pay for the food shocker. Um, and it took it on tour. And I was really excited to have you here today. Thank you very much. And good luck with, I know the things you can't talk about, but they can carry us some cool stuff coming. I'll leave it at that and

Speaker 3:          33:32          we'll be talking about our new show. Uh, this week we make an announcements, so you may Torian grant are back together again. And another nerdy endeavor work.
