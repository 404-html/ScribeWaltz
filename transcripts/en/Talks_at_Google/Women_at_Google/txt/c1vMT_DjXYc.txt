Speaker 1:          00:09          Great. This conversation is going to look like a conversation about public speaking because it's, it's pretty formalized and that I'm standing up here at the front of the room and you are sitting in audience mode, but this is a really, this is really about the image that you project and that can be one on one or around the conference room table or standing up to give a presentation. But this is about inspiring confidence in your abilities. There are some people just in the way that they carry themselves. You immediately have faith that they can get the job done, whatever the job might be. And some people do it with a big bold, dynamic personality and some people do it with a very calm down to earth demeanor, but whatever the style, you just believe in them. The fallacy is that those kinds of positive assessments that we make about other people, that they're all very subjective.

Speaker 1:          01:05          They're based on nuance store or indefinable criteria. And I've spent the last 20 years of my life researching how human beings assess other human beings. And the bottom line is that there are ground rules, there are metrics, certain behaviors lead to very predictable assessments on the part of the listener. So if you can better understand what behaviors lead to what assessments, you can just be more in charge of the image that's coming across on the other side. Are you aware that certain facial expressions are hardwired into us? Not all facial expressions, but certain core facial expressions like fear, joy, anger, grief, and it's why we can read facial expressions across cultures or why babies can read facial expressions at a very early age. Well, the same thing is true for your body language signals. A significant portion of your body language signals are what we call universal, how human beings assess other human beings.

Speaker 1:          02:07          And so I'll give you an example of one, keeping your head level. So literally being levelheaded is a show of confidence across the globe. Wherever you go. Now, whether you should show confidence is a value system and sometimes that changes from culture to culture. Sometimes in some cultures being deferential is a far better way to do business. But being levelheaded as a show of confidence wherever you go. If I raise my chin just a bit, this is a very high status position to be in and if I continue to speak to you with my Chin just a little bit high, you are very likely to find me a little condescending, little arrogant. Can you see that? If I lower my chin just a bit, this is a very low status position to be in and if I continue to speak to you with my Chin Low, you're very likely to find me a little shy or differential.

Speaker 1:          03:00          And especially if I tilt my head now whether or not I personally am aware of the position of my chin, because I could be oblivious to what's happening up here is still having an impact on your side and even on your side, you're not consciously aware of what behavior is sending the message because it just happens so fast in there. So if I had started today with my chin up like this and said, hello everybody, I'm very excited to have this opportunity to talk with you. You would all begin to make an assessment of me really quickly and in your exact adjective would be up to you, but you would all be leaning in the same direction. But it is doubtful that any of you would have identified that it was my chin that was bothering you. I mean you wouldn't leave afterwards and say, you know, Kira was okay but her chin, it was so high you just be stuck with your assessment of me.

Speaker 1:          03:56          So that's why it's my job as the speaker to be very aware of the signals that I'm sending out I because they're having an impact whether I am aware of them or not. And have you heard studies about how long it takes for someone to come up with an assessment of you under 30 seconds seconds? Right. So seconds. I recently read the research from Millenium Body and she was highlighted in the book blink by Malcolm Gladwell, but she is the researcher who coined the term thin slicing, which is our ability to see a pattern and just a very thin slice of information. When one of her research projects, she showed people videotapes of individual strangers. She hadn't them assign adjectives that they would use to describe the person on the screen. And at first she showed the video tapes for two minutes, but then she just cut back and cut it back and she got down to two seconds and she found that the adjectives people would use to describe the stranger on the screen were the same whether they had the opportunity to see the video tape for two minutes or for two seconds.

Speaker 1:          05:07          Now, that's pretty amazing actually. It's amazing on two levels. First of all, it's amazing that it happens so quickly, but more importantly for today's conversation, it's amazing that there's general agreement. When we watch a video tape of a stranger, we will all use about the same adjectives to describe that person. So if that is true, they have got to be ground rules. And so that's really what the credibility code is all about. What are the ground rules? What are these behaviors? How much impact did they have? How much control do you have over them? Now I had the pleasure to have worked with Google over the last few years. So I know a good deal about your, your culture and in a workshop early on in the, one of the things that comes up is a conversation about authenticity because there's a high value here on being authentic.

Speaker 1:          06:06          And I want to acknowledge that. And first of unsupported, I want you to know, I believe that you are first, you're going to be at your best if your first yourself. And that is really great if you have some strong speaking skills on your side. So I want you to think about the ground rules that I'm about to lay out, like the rules of punctuation or grammar. As a writer, we don't feel inauthentic in our writing because we're following the rules of punctuation and grammar. And you wouldn't say as a writer, well of, well, we're all following the exact same rules. How will my unique voice come through so well? The truth is if you aren't following the rules of punctuation or grammar, people aren't like to pay likely to pay attention to you. And there are some really talented people who can break the rules.

Speaker 1:          06:52          So that's acknowledged that too. And it just makes them more interesting. I give you permission to break the rules to too, but break the rule because you know the power of it and you choose to do it differently as opposed to just being oblivious to how that behavior might might come across. All right. I broke the conversation up into three sections. First, what I call the basics. And these are those behaviors that you need to do just to get those, those basic level adjectives where someone might describe you as comfortable, competent, capable, credible. Uh, of course you want that as your baseline. And then we'll talk about those things you shouldn't do. I call those derailers. So those behaviors that are almost always invisible to us, we don't know that they're going on, but they nonetheless undercut our image. And then I'll talk about the perfect balance between being authoritative on the one side to being approachable on the other.

Speaker 1:          07:54          And the best communicators of all know how to do both at the same time. And just to give you a quick preview, I will show you what it's like to lean too heavily in one direction or the other. If you're using a lot of authoritative behaviors and I just kicked into a few more of them right now, you're very likely to come across as capable, competent, and expert. But if you rely too heavily on these behaviors, you could also come across as unreceptive or inflexible, which isn't going to help you create a relationship with the person on the other side. On the other end of the spectrum, if you're using a lot of approachable behaviors and I just kicked into a few more of those right now, well you're very likely to come across as interactive, personable, maybe even dynamic, but if you rely too heavily on these behaviors, you could also come across as a lightweight nice, but in consequential.

Speaker 1:          08:50          So you need to have a balance between both sides and if you personally know that you need to bolster one end of the spectrum or the other, I will give very specific behaviors that tend to send those messages. Okay. Going back up to the top. The very first thing someone notices about you as the visual picture. So your body language has a big impact on your appearance of credibility and confidence. The three pillars that hold up your appearance of leadership, presence of credibility, of personal presence are strong posture, strong voice, strong eye contact. If you're doing those three things, you are going to look good. Strong posture, strong voice, and strong eye contact. Now most people have heard some version of this advice before. It's, it's not like it's brand new concept out there, but most people severely underestimate just how important those behaviors are.

Speaker 1:          09:53          So let me be explicit. Strong posture means that if you're standing up, your weight is balanced equally over both feet and whether you're seated or standing, your spine and your shoulders form a t like a like a metal t bar. And this area right here is rock solid, has literal core strength. So notice how if I allow myself to have just a little more wishy washiness in my spine, I lose a lot of my executive presence. So you have literal core strength through here. Then your head and your shoulders move independently. So your head moves like a camera on a tripod, which means I can look over here and I can look over here and I can look over here. What's not happening is this, again I'm back to wishy washy or being a little kid in trouble. Oh, think about how eagles and owls survey their surroundings.

Speaker 1:          10:50          We call them regal and wise. And then one word, your nose has to point directly toward the person you're speaking to. So if I'm looking at you, my nose points directly toward you. And if I look at you, my nose points directly toward you. Notice what happens in my eyes. Move a little more independently of my nose. I'm very likely to look uncomfortable, but I could also look sneaky or mischievous or judgmental or skeptical. Have you heard the phrase looking out the corner of your eye at someone? What does that mean? Reticent Questioning. So if you want to come across as straight forward, you have to literally be straight on with the person you are speaking to. There's a concept in communication that is called marked and unmarked communication. And ultimately what we're trying to do with our body language signals is unmark the communication so that the power of our words take precedent. Sometimes we're sending some accidental signal that sends a mixed message. And so let me give you an example of how this played out. Recently I was working with a group of teenagers, actually a group of young mothers in a job placement program. And one of the young women said to me, parents and teachers say that I show attitude and I don't get what they mean by that because I really don't feel like I show attitude. But she said it to me like this.

Speaker 2:          12:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:25          Parents and teachers say that I show attitude and I don't get, you need to straighten that out. So if I look at you this way, this is unmarked, straightforward communication. Me just talking to you. And as soon as I start to move my Chin around

Speaker 1:          12:41          in Mark's the communication. So if you want to unmark the communication, so people will really hear what you have to say. You need to be literally straight on direct. So, so here's the takeaway in this particular section. If you want someone to describe you as having a strong spine and a level head, you need to literally have a strong spine and a level head. And if you want someone to describe you as straightforward and direct, you have to literally be straightforward and direct. It is pretty amazing how the language we use is a literal translation of the attribute we are describing. So standing with your weight balanced over both feet, how might you describe me? Grounded, balanced on solid footing, upright, strong spine from backbone, levelheaded, head square on my shoulders, standing on my own, two feet, not easily pushed over. There are so many positive metaphors here.

Speaker 1:          13:41          Fully evolved. So you want to make sure, oh and let's take some negative metaphors being a slouch or shifty or unbalanced or crooked. So you want to physically embody the metaphors you want people to use when describing you. All right. Now if you just learned in this conversation that you should stand stock still, well that would be a problem too because part of leadership, presence of looking perfectly comfortable is fluidity. Owning the space around you. So your core provides the solidity. And your hands and your facial gestures provide the fluidity, the interactivity hand gestures are or they're hardwired into all of us. There are a form of communication that's that's deeper and older than verbal communication. Then I'm even blind people gesture when they speak. It's not something we learn visually. It's hardwired, but what is most interesting about hand gestures is that they are an unconscious process, which means when you are not thinking about it, your hands are very much engaged in the conversation and as soon as you become self conscious, as soon as you begin to think about the hands, you have no idea what to do.

Speaker 1:          15:08          These bandages at the ends of your arms and that that when that happens, we tend to go into some sort of lockdown mode or I call it unmasking masked mode and it it's that apparent self consciousness that gives away the fact that you are intimidated or nervous by the situation. When we are perfectly comfortable, our hands talk when we talk, if you want to exhibit executive presence, personal presence, the second year mouth begins moving. Your body language has to talk to because what intimidation looks like is your mouth is moving, but no other body language signal is online yet. You don't have to learn how to hand gesture. You just your hundreds upon hundreds of times throughout the day. It's not a skill you need to learn. What you need to learn is not to mask. Not Too.
