Speaker 1:          00:07          Um, and now I think we're going to do some Q and. A.

Speaker 2:          00:13          Um, so from a teaching perspective, how come kids who are gamers don't seem to apply? Uh, the sort of, uh, you know, being okay with failure and exploring this as to mine, all of that in the classroom setting. Yeah. And how can I make them do that?

Speaker 1:          00:30          Yeah. I mean there are a couple of reasons. I mean, in, in classroom environments there tend to be more consequences for failure, right? Um, I mean even at the younger levels, um, you know, if you, if you don't do well on something, you will be perceived as not being good at that. That could affect what group you're put in. Um, as you get older and you fail a tastic counts towards your grades, um, you don't get to retake it. I know there are a lot of schools that are experimenting with trying to create, um, structures for failing that more closely resembled games. So schools where you can take a test as many times as you want, the same way you would play a level as many times as you want to focus on mastery rather than, you know, performance anxiety. Um, there's a chapter, chapter four in the book talks about, um, those specifically, why do only some people seem to bring the gameful mindset to everyday life.

Speaker 1:          01:25          Um, and at least 41% of gamers do not bring this to everyday life. Um, and it, it has to do with, um, uh, whether you view games as being escapist, um, or whether you view them as being a part of, of your real life. So we have this bias. We talk about games as being escapist and you think you leave reality. Um, and it helps you forget, you know, everyday life. Um, and when, when people are playing games, we tell them they're wasting time, right? Um, people who feel that way, uh, tend to play games more when their life gets more stressful because they see it as this kind of coping mechanism the same way. Some people drink more when life gets stressful or they eat junk food or they just, um, and so then the problems get bigger and so then they have to play games more cause they're more stressed out now.

Speaker 1:          02:16          Um, and it creates this downward spiral. And that's actually the number one predictor of like who becomes addicted to games are people who see game does escape this. Um, eh, people who benefit and sort of the way out of that seems to be people who focus when they play games on, um, how they're getting better. So I played this game. I'm, I'm getting better at, you know, spacial intelligence or teamwork or coordination or designing or creativity or whatever it is. So the really practical answer that question is to talk to kids about the games they play and say, what do you like? What do you have to be good at to be good at this game? Um, order model back to them. Wow. You like it took you four days to finish that level. Um, that sounds really, but you must be somebody who when you have a goal, you don't give up until you really succeed and start to help kids see that there are real character strengths that are part of who they are, not just when they're playing games, they don't have to escape reality to have those feelings or have those strengths.

Speaker 1:          03:18          Um, so is it a whole chapter about how you do that in, in chapter four? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:26          Oh No, I have the mic. I've been talking about super better a lot with a friend because there was just an article in the less psychology today about it and we thought it was cool and we had this whole discussion about what our power ups and what are bad guys. And that was cool. So my question is actually a question from my friend who says, please ask. I'm curious as to how effectively people use super better to deal with issues. I might be concerned about like procrastination and mild anxiety rather than deeply debilitating depression, et cetera. Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Well Sue, uh, I'm gonna give it to you straight here. This, this method seems to work better and better. The more, uh, difficult your challenges. Um, so when we crunched the numbers and people who signed up to like, I want to lose 10 pounds, I want to run my first five k, um, I dunno, I'm just bored of my life.

Speaker 1:          04:21          I want to change. Um, those people do not register a lot of benefits and we, we, there's, um, there's this other measurement tools inside the system where we look at changes and things like courage and optimism and things like that. Um, those people don't register as many changes. Um, where as people who come with big problems, you know, I, you know, I, I just lost a family member. I've been diagnosed with something. I have always suffered with anxiety. Um, they registered the biggest changes. So that is, I think that's important. Um, and, and there are lots of reasons that would make sense. Why, um, you know, I mentioned the idea of post traumatic growth earlier. This, the, as I explained in the book, the super better method at its heart. What it seems to do is promote posttraumatic growth. In order to have post traumatic growth, you have to have some kind of, you know, serious challenge or trauma.

Speaker 1:          05:15          Now there is a version of posttraumatic growth that does not require trauma. It's called post static growth. But I also talk about that in the book, but it still requires you to do something, but it's extremely difficult. So running a marathon, not if I can't, I'll marathon, um, trying to maybe write your first book, starting a company, um, becoming a parent for the first time. So positive things, but that will really force you to, to kind of dig deep and cultivate that new form of shrine. So the short version is, um, uh, it may, it might, it might help, but it will, it will make a bigger difference in the lives of people who are really struggling with something. So one is, you know, and you just put it on your phone now and hopefully you don't need it, but maybe some, it will help you more.

Speaker 3:          06:05          I've tried to use games as a way of developing particular, uh, cognitive styles. And I've often found, and I'll start playing a game with the intent of who you know, I'm going to be practicing some cognitive skill or other, and then I find kind of an hour has passed and I noticed I slipped totally into complacency and I wasn't practicing that cognitive style. I wasn't, I wasn't trying the new strategy that I had intended to try. How do I maintain the focus required when playing games to make sure that they do that. I actually do use them as that sort of practice rather than kind of idly passing the time.

Speaker 1:          06:58          Well that's really interesting. I mean that's because on one hand, I mean I would think from what I've seen that I believe passing the time is actually totally fine. I mean that, that it will do the same thing. Um, you know, you don't have to adopt a particular style of game play or strategy. What you want to do to make sure, I mean, so we talked about playing a game you've never played before. We'll make that mindset happened faster than playing a game you played a hundred times. So maybe it'd be more a matter of, um, making sure that you're exposing yourself to different games, different genres of games, you know, if you've never played a certain genre to, to, to try that sort of expand your, um, your competency with different kinds of games. I would think that aspect of making sure that you're always requiring yourself to be learning and improving, um, is probably, you know, probably the most important aspect of it. Um, but other than that, there's not a particular, you know, just, just make sure that it's challenging, really challenging for you and challenge yourself to, to learn different games. Is this a really good way to do that? Cool. What else you guys pick?

Speaker 4:          08:20          So you said we should ask this question earlier, so what, what about what can go wrong with violence?

Speaker 1:          08:26          Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Um, so, uh, all of all of the stuff they're putting in the media is hype and not to except for, um, if you spend most of your time playing violent, aggressive themed games, we'll use call of duty as an example, um, against people you don't know online, not in the same space. Um, the one negative side effect of that is that if boost your testosterone in a way that does not in other gameplay context, it doesn't happen if you are playing against people, you know, in real life. It's like we don't have to be in the same room with Bob, but if I know I'm playing, you and I were cool, um, I'm not going to get this sort of testosterone jack. There's a lot of research behind it, um, that I explain in the book. But for now we'll just say you're going to like, you can get basically testosterone poisoning is how one researcher describes it.

Speaker 1:          09:17          Um, where, uh, after you're done playing for hours afterwards can make you, um, just more hostile and your interaction with other people, more aggressive, um, uh, less compassion and empathy because you're really jacked up on testosterone, which just has that effect on people. Um, so you know, uh, that's why some game communities may have a reputation for, uh, it's kind of people get become kind of jerks. Um, so I recommend you know, that you spend less than half your time doing that. If you're going to play a lot of these games, make sure you spending a significant amount of time playing them with people you know, that you have to continue to have relationships with because that's what stops, that's what damp dampens the testosterone. However, I'm very open minded person. I think people should use games to benefit themselves however they want. There may be people who want to Jack up some testosterone, you know, I'm going into have a contract negotiation and I do want to be aggressive or uh, I mean, you may, you may want that. So, um, I am not to judge there. There may be benefits to it as well. But that is, that is the genre. So thanks for coming back to that.

Speaker 3:          10:24          I'm curious if you've a investigating the relationship between York on PTSD and other work like Vanderkolk's the body keeps the score, you know, ideas of trauma being stored somatically. Physically,

Speaker 1:          10:37          no, I'm not familiar with that. But the name is very evocative. Your body keeps the score.

Speaker 3:          10:41          Yeah, that was a new book. The body keeps the score.

Speaker 1:          10:44          I am, I'm going to buy that. That's great. Thank you for that.

Speaker 3:          10:49          So I was kinda curious about the reference to motor neurons, not knowing some of that. It's pretty controversial a and it only applies to sort of where motor activities involved. I'm kind of curious, not knowing anything about the gaming world and people watching these video screens of other people playing. How much of that is like, you know, actual physical activity that they can, their motor neurons can actually relate to versus intellectual? Like if it's scrabble or some boring thing. I can look at golf and I'm always started.

Speaker 1:          11:18          Yeah, I mean I would, I would contest the idea that it's just, I, I know there's a, there, there are discussions now going on about, you know, there's sort of, there was a, it's on the, what is it, the hype cycle. The hype chart went into the, the trough of disillusionment. But um, would you do absolutely still seemed mirror neurons even in things, um, you know, conversation. So if, if I'm having, if we're, we're close friends and you're telling me about your day, we do see that my brain will, as you tell me, your story will start to mirror the as if it happened to me. Um, and I don't know that, that necessarily, I mean you see the same kind of emotional activation. It's not that, uh, I feel like there's a sufficient body of literature that this, um, that this, that there is a sort of general um, processing of experience that can be in York.

Speaker 1:          12:15          That's where I, that's where I come down on all they know is this sort of the people are, people are arguing about it. Um, you know, there is, there is, there is a strong physical component. I mean, in terms of, uh, I mean in, in the same way that speed typing has, you know, a component. I mean you have to be able to uh, input decisions and execute decisions very quickly through the interface. It can be possible. It'd be part of when you think about the, the piano example, I mean that is probably similar playing the piano and sort of the controls of the video game. Um, you, you still have to be mirroring the musicality. I mean, you have to have the understanding of the musicality, um, and not just the execution of, um, of the interface. But, uh, so we have time for one more maybe.

Speaker 3:          13:04          Sure. Yeah. Um, so sometimes when you're achieving a goal and a video game, it feels really frustrating. Yeah. So is there a value, positive or negative in the frustration or is there only a value and achieving them?

Speaker 1:          13:16          Oh, no, no, no, no. Most of the value is in the frustration. I mean, it is, um, the, the value is in staying motivated and optimistic while being frustrated. So, you know, when we were looking at that, that, that what is the mindset of super empowered, hopeful individual. But if somebody who was highly motivated and able and optimistic and able to learn, uh, and try and be flexible and try different strategies so that in the face of frustration, they will continue to engage with the obstacle. Um, Eh, it's why I like to play games, you know, myself that are very challenging. Uh, I love it when I have to, you know, try a level a hundred times before I get past it. Um, that, that's where a lot of the resilience, that seems to be one of the most essential, nope. What do games make us good at? Being resilient in the face of that kind of frustration. So, um, yeah, don't play games that you're good at and always winning. That's, that's just positive emotion. Um, but the actual positive psychology, the, the strengths will come out of playing games that you are bad at, which is why we played a game that you guys would know you went through were surprisingly good at massive and multiple years gravel though it was good. Um, good. Well, good to me.

Speaker 5:          14:36          Thank you.
