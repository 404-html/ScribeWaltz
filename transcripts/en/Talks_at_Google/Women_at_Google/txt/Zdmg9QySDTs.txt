Speaker 1:          00:05          Good afternoon everybody. Today for the toxic Google series we have with us, Lauren May bury the lead singer of the band churches as well as the rest of the band who will be playing a musical set at the end

Speaker 2:          00:17          coming onto the scene,

Speaker 1:          00:23          coming onto the scene two years ago with their song lies. There's subsequent single, the mother we share as well as their debut album, the bones of what you believe helped propel churches to the top five of BBC sine of 2013 and award winning appearance at south by southwest and a worldwide tour. Please join me in welcoming churches.

Speaker 2:          00:44          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:52          Now, most recently, I think a lot of the audience is expecting to see you guys at outside lands. But, uh, I hear there was a little issue. Don't bring it up. No. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:02          No, we're still quite silent about it to be honest.

Speaker 1:          01:05          From what I heard, it was the airport's fault. So

Speaker 3:          01:07          yeah, it was a catalog of disasters within an airport. Um, and then there was quite an upsetting bit where me and Martin got on the plane and could see everybody else at the gate, but they wouldn't let them on the plane even though we could see them in the window. And then we sat on the runway for 45 minutes while they offloaded all their bags, but they weren't allowed in. The Dick is very upset, but it's okay, we're going to try and um, get a show in San Francisco. So at the store it was an extra, but she not have one. We haven't figured out exactly when yet, but,

Speaker 1:          01:37          well, I think we're all looking forward to it then.

Speaker 3:          01:40          Yeah, no, it's okay. We don't know when it might happen. We hope will happen.

Speaker 1:          01:47          All right. So a year ago you wrote an article for the Guardian about the perils of being a front woman in a band in the social media age. Now as a band born on the Internet, I take it that social media and be able to communicate with your fans is incredibly important to you guys. But at the same time, this also opened up some avenues for, you know, abusive comments well beyond just normal musical criticism. Uh, could you talk a little bit about how you guys use social media to interact with fans and the experiences that led you to write the article for The Guardian?

Speaker 3:          02:22          Yeah. Well, I guess for us, we came about, um, getting signed in a kind of reasonably [inaudible]. We didn't go about the traditional kind of a tour to the UK for her many years and then tour of Europe and so on. We came to a lot of people's attention because of online streaming and blogs and, um, people just passing the songs to each other on social networks. So, um, we operated on, signed for quite a long time and it was just important for us to use those things as a medium to communicate with people, give them information. And, um, I kind of grew up in the MSN era of being on like band message boards and street teams and things like that. So from my point of view, social networks for those are kind of like online street teams, I guess. Um, and there's been definitely overwhelmingly positive parts of that for us.

Speaker 3:          03:11          But, um, cause we oversee that ourselves. I suppose when you're logging in to do all the, do all those things, sometimes you get a little a rape threat over your breakfast and that's fine. But um, well it's not fine I guess is the point. So, um, we just kind of posted a screen grab of like an example that we got sent. Um, and it wasn't even some anything terribly, terribly offensive. And I was like, this is just generally the tone of some of this stuff. Please stop. Um, and then the Guardian gives us the opportunity to expand on it a bit. Um, and I think the response was generally positive to us from people in vans or uh, people in the shows. But, um, I don't know if it changed the world in any revolutionary way, but I guess a speaking of it is probably quite helpful. And then figuring out the old people actually it'd be with you on the world isn't actually just full of horrible abusive Internet trolls is good too. It's good to know.

Speaker 1:          04:03          So Youtube just recently changed its policy on allowing anonymous names for a leaving comments. You can now leave in a comment anonymously. I want to know your opinion on why they're, you know, that will affect any, do you think that'll affect anything or is this something that's going to happen regardless of if a people's names are associated with their messages

Speaker 3:          04:24          so they can,

Speaker 1:          04:25          he's not making you leave one's anonymously.

Speaker 3:          04:27          I have never actually left a comment on youtube in my life ever decided like, well, it'd be weird thing to do. Um, but um, yeah I don't know. I guess I was thinking about this earlier and it's, but like I think for me it was like it's a bit personal responsibility and then who's responsible for that? If people are posting abusive things, who, who's the full guy for that? Is that the children networks or is it the person or like should like law enforcement be talking about that? The who is responsible. Um, and I think where people are allowed to be anonymous kind of means that they feel like there's less of a follower or something. And I feel like to an extent when people are on the Internet, no offense, because I know you guys are the Internet. Um, they kind of, there's a certain level of where you are removed from that. So maybe you don't feel as much personal responsibility or something. I'm not sure I'm worried about that. Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:21          Uh, you also talk about one of the, this problem stemming from kind of a lack of empathy on the, uh, on the side of the people who are leaving the comments. Um, you know, here at Google we have a very global reach. Uh, and I was wondering if there's any suggestions you have for either Google or really the industry in general about how to kind of promote a sense of empathy in our, in our applications and you know, we're really changing the way that people interact, bring it online and you know, it'd be great to kind of bring that sense of wellbeing that we have in real life online.

Speaker 3:          05:54          Yeah. I guess anything like that is helpful. I think trying to train the tone of conversations, but I guess in my mind it's more the stuff that we received, it just a more exaggerated version of what happens in real life. So it's a kind of chicken and egg thing for me. Does that reflect society or does a society reflect or it's kind of hard to tell which, but um, I don't think that threatening and abusive content exists only online. People probably wouldn't say as much of that right to your face. But then there's a reason like why people think it's okay to say those things because there's a certain thread throughout society then makes people think that's fine. Like it's not like the only time I've ever had anybody say anything offensive or sexist to me is in this band, on the Internet that happens to people at the time I am what was coming out of a subway in Glasgow and somebody, it was like the last time we at night and someone showed me his penis and said, do you think you're too good for it?

Speaker 3:          06:46          Darlin which is funny now maybe. But at the time I was like, hmm, I was like 21 coming home from work and I was like, it's not funny when you're there on the receiving end of that so to speak. Um, so I don't on what do you say? I was like, I can't, like I have no, I'm like five foot two. It was like 1130 at night. He's a massive guy and had two other inmates with the warm I specifically by that. So, um, yeah, maybe he goes around leaving horrible comments on the Internet. I don't know. Or maybe he's busy doing it in real life. It's hard to say

Speaker 1:          07:18          like, so for obviously you chose to, to speak up a part of the article is that you're not just going to quote unquote deal with it, uh, as a lot of people told you to do when you wrote the article originally, uh, what, what side of the problem do you think stems from, from say, other female celebrities or other women in general? Just kind of dealing with it? Um, cause I feel like people wouldn't tell you to do that if it wasn't the majority of the people who are just kind of dealing with it. Uh, so to speak. And what problems stem from that?

Speaker 3:          07:50          Well, I guess, um, I think it was confusing for me was that like most people were supportive of what we were saying, but there was a definite strain in the conversation where people were saying like, the onus is on, the onus is on us to accept it and deal with and things like that. And that to me is just like a followup from a victim blaming culture where people are like, well it's up to you to deal with it. It's not up to those people to not behave like that. It's up to you to suck up and deal with it. And I guess the thing that I was finding, I was like, it's bad. It's awful if that's happening to you when you're using the internet in a personal capacity. Cause everyone has the right to use the internet to seek out knowledge and you know, do nice stuff on the Internet.

Speaker 3:          08:30          But, um, I was like, this is something we're doing in the course of our employment. So if I want to be in a band and have a social network, then I need to accept that. And I think that's a queen pretty confusing way to look at it. Um, and also, I suppose probably a lot of people don't want to talk about that because I think it paints you in a certain light or something like that. But I guess for me it was like these are things that we think personally anyway and something you we're coming up against in your day to day job and then your day to day life. So I don't really see why you should have to sacrifice doing things that you would normally do in order to appease what I hope is a minority of people.

Speaker 1:          09:09          And so, uh, at least in terms of the Google properties, we can detect and delete comments that would probably be considered abusive pretty easily. But at the same time was that obviously you wouldn't see them then and that would give you some sense of relief. But is there, do you think it's only going to encourage the problem if people feel like they can leave these comments and then they're actually going to be deleted before they show up? So that you know, kind of generates anger on, on and, and you know, mean harboring feelings towards you, you know, on, on the side of the commenters. Do you think the leading these comments would help fix the problem or is it

Speaker 3:          09:43          um, I don't know, like, um, I thought about it a lot when we were trying to figure out how to deal with it. And so it was like, yes, it does make me feel better if I don't see any of these things. But then I was like the option then in order to not see those things as to not partake in that part of the job and not do that. And I guess the always kind of, uh, gets, gets my back up quite a lot when people bring up the freedom of speech thing. I like, well, freedom of hateful speech is that, is that a load? And then I think there is a freedom of speech issue. But I don't, from my point of view, it's not the commenters freedom of speech. It's our freedom of speech to go about doing what we're doing. And in order to do that, then your have to exempt someone talking to you like that.

Speaker 3:          10:25          So I don't, um, yeah, whenever people bring up the Yep, I can see what I want because it's a free world and I'm on the Internet, but you should feel free to say what you want but not be a prick. I don't, I feel like that should be like me. You need to write that into like the European Convention on human rights or something. Freedom of speech brackets. But not if you're, but um, yeah, I don't know. I guess you can't, how do you change it? And I think it's great that, you know, companies like yourselves are trying to make a statement on something like that. But I feel like there's probably quite a long way to go before it trickles down into actual day to day attitudes.

Speaker 1:          11:02          You talked about some of the, uh, like the story you had of experiencing this in real life as well. Would you consider kind of these abusive comments online and evolution of, of catcalling or you know, other kind of street harassment? Uh, or is this kind of its own separate thing?

Speaker 3:          11:18          I think it's probably a volts from the same, the same beginning point that the middle senses, it comes from the same starting point. I think the same kind of attitude, um, that if, uh, if a woman is in a public place, then she's up automatically opening herself up to these things. But I guess the distance, um, created between people on the Internet helps people. Maybe. I've never had anyone see to my face, you think this is where your culture, you will know this until I come run and rape you. But they'd do something Internet. If someone said that to me in real life, I'd would be very alarmed and you would obviously report them to the police. But if it's on the Internet and then people are like, oh, it's, you know, it's just the Internet says harmless, it's fine. You're like, mm. Hmm. Is it,

Speaker 1:          12:01          um, so either kind of before you wrote the article or afterwards, did you have any mentors either in the industry or in your life that had previous experience with something like this and we're able to help walk you through it? Or is that, is that something that you think maybe the music industry or earthy things in general need to have accessible?

Speaker 4:          12:24          MMM,

Speaker 3:          12:25          I guess I didn't really have, um, didn't really speak to anybody about it in that way. I guess there's always people have admired in terms of musicians and how they conduct themselves professionally and things like that. But, um, I guess it would have been good if Lou was like a kind of how to guide. I wrote that you could be like, what was this? Right. I got to Dok, we'll score it at that page and then, oh, right, okay. Just ignore it. Okay. Um, but yeah, I don't know. An atheist, that's probably why it was, um, it was so confusing, I suppose because although ever we're really supportive of each other. I am the only woman in this band and they've always been in bands with very supportive guys, but I've always been the only female in those bounds. Although people can empathize with you, I guess it's not as threatening because it's not directed at them. Um, so I dunno, I guess I'm not sure like women experience that on some level at some point in their lives. Definitely. So I guess maybe you learned from the textbook of life or something, I'm not sure.

Speaker 1:          13:26          Have you found that these problems have stemmed more from any specific social networks in general? Or is it kind of a broad thing that you've experienced everywhere? Like is it harder to be a prick and 140 characters on Twitter?

Speaker 3:          13:40          Sometimes they are quite inventive I suppose, but we generally, um, we've mostly, I would say the worst one is Facebook, I think. Which is strange to me because there's technically more anonymity on Twitter because you don't need to use your real name. If your account gets deleted, you can make another one like I many hours later. Whereas I suppose with Facebook they want you to use your real name if you do. I don't know. Um, um, but yeah, that's definitely where most of the, the comments were coming in. And also because we still had other point, the direct message function on which, um, I think he, that's in another further removal for those people. So they're like, we're contacting you on the Internet and it can't be seen by other people so I can see it directly to you. Whatever I wish to see. Obviously we figured out how to turn that off now, so that's much better.

Speaker 3:          14:26          But um, yeah, even now if you post like I think a reshared an article that was um, on Ma make website and it was about an advert in sound on sound. There was advertising microphones and it was like, um, a naked woman like from the side with her. Like you could see her ass and stuff in it. And I have two meals. Like that's not what's that got to do with advertising microphones. But it was a really interesting article that the guy who used to run drone, his own drop and then underneath it people would just like shut up and go back to doing what you're supposed to be doing. Like I don't want to read this. I want to come here and listen to music. I don't want, why are you talking about this shit? It's not relevant. And I was like that articles about music, I think that is relevant. But just like seeing all kind of unfold again. You're like, oh there they go. That's fine. But it's great. I guess the good thing for us now is that if people know where we stand on it, they kind of self police a little bit more. So rather than us having to go on and be like, look at user won't year and goes through, um, people can have a more of a discussion about it. So I guess that's positive, but I don't really know how much that actually changes people's minds. I buy things.

Speaker 1:          15:28          So do you, do you ever respond directly to these comments? Maybe in the beginning when you were, when you first started receiving them or you generally just try to steer clear basically any advice you'd have for, for people who receive these sort of things?

Speaker 3:          15:42          I think it's a difficult line to tread because my instinct tells me that every time somebody says it, then if you were threatened and you need to go in on the offensive and just call people out on it, but I suppose I've got quite a busy day and most days and they don't have a huge amount of time to troll through and be like, oh great, that's happened. Most upon them would be like, what would your mother say? Things like that. But um, yeah, I don't know. I guess it's just trying to gauge it on a day to day basis. I think it was before we made any comment on it, it was taking quite a bit of a personal tool to constantly be the person that has to be like, no, stop it. No, stop it. Or just, there's a little got to finals. I'm just going to delete the, delete the comments and ban, ban the users. But can't ban people from life. So that's a problem. That sounds really like area and then like get them on, put them in a bin. But I don't mean that

Speaker 1:          16:36          in the article you tread pretty lightly around the word feminist. You, uh, kind of treated as if maybe you know, there some connotations that you don't want to associate with yourself. Um, you make comment that you don't hate men in general, that you're speaking, you know, feminism in terms of equality for the sexes. Um, do you think that the term in general has kind of become unfriendly and

Speaker 3:          17:00          um, well I think the star of the sentence sentences. I am a feminist because I am, and I feel like all the cabinets I put in after that word to counter what people say to you when you see that, they're like, oh, so you hate men then, oh, well, all these other things. And you're like, no, I don't know. It's just a stereotype that has been made to discredit what people are saying about it, I think. Um, so I have no problem identifying is that because to me it means somebody who seeks equality between all people. It's not about making women better than men. It's not about, um, you know, like Oh, white middle class woman's agenda. It shouldn't be about that issue to be about generally society being a bit less shit sometimes I think. Um, and I think there's lots of great examples of people who are making something like that more accessible to people because I guess for me, I learned about it through, through music and then I kind of figured out what those people were reading and who they were influenced by and that's how I got into like feminist literature and stuff.

Speaker 3:          17:57          But if you can feel really the kind of like academic and strange in that regard. So I think the Internet has been really helpful for that. Like things like feminist thing and jazzy bell and stuff, making it more, um, not even necessarily pop culture based, but just more conversation, conversational. And I'm like hopefully more representative of more people because it's about your everyday issues. So it shouldn't just be like in a book, in a library somewhere.

Speaker 4:          18:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:24          And the, uh, kind of what prompted me to reach out to you guys in the first place was a, an article I read in the January issue of Pacific Standard. Uh, it's about a writer, Amanda Hess who kind of covers her experiences with these, uh, sort of comments. Um, she kind of talks about how she, you know, she receives these comments where people are threatening to come to her house, uh, which you know of happened in a real life experience. If you went to the police with that, they would, uh, you know, get a restraining order that it take some sort of action. But because she received these comments, uh, on the Internet, the police kind of brushed it off. Um, they, I acted as if it wasn't important. They told her to get back in touch with them. If someone actually shows up, which seems like there's a lot of room for something bad to happen there. Do you think as we, as we transitioned to more digital interactions that we, that we risk kind of losing some of the standards and etiquette that we've kind of built up over the years and that, you know, some of the safety might disappear as these things go online.

Speaker 3:          19:27          I Dunno. I guess the, as the technology develops in society changes, then laws need to adapt to cater for that. Um, bicycles right now is a pretty big gray area because if they're like, they're like, no physical threat has happened upon you, then what can the police really do about it? But then I just think it adds to the people feeling more alone and more vulnerable and more isolated. Um, and I suppose the thing with, with that is even if like, I guess Amanda has, you can find her own lane. She's pretty well known, but even if it was like a conventional stalking thing, the victim still doesn't have, I think that's what she says in the piece. Like the victim doesn't have the anonymity of the person that's abusing them. Like, because they are the known person, whether they're a well known person. No, we're just, you know, you don't have to be a journalist or in a band or whatever to encounter that kind of stuff. So I guess something, something needs to be done to figure out what to do about that. But who knows what it is. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          20:30          We'll try to figure that out.

Speaker 3:          20:31          Yeah, please. You guys are in charge of the Internet and so go fix.

Speaker 1:          20:35          I like to open the questions up to the audience. Uh, there's a microphone back there.

Speaker 5:          20:47          Hello. Hi. Um, I feel like we spent a lot about policing and things, but even with police, bad things still happen, right? Um, you know, bullying in playgrounds, for example, if it's physical abuse, right? And we can police it as much as we can, but the police don't stop. I'm under the assumption that, you know, not an assumption, but this is emotional abuse, right? You being emotionally abused. Um, this sort of parallel would be a bodyguard or our physical body guard is a celebrity. As a wellness person, you have a body guard who protects you as you move around the physical world. Um, do you think an emotional body card fee on the Internet, is there reasonable response?

Speaker 4:          21:24          MMM,

Speaker 3:          21:25          I think that if they existed that would be nice. But it's pretty abstract. But, um, I don't know. I guess that's the gain of that. You have to kind of do that job yourself. And I think it's like separating the personal anguish sounds really pathetic but anguish, uh, from, um, from the profession professional side. Um, so we'll try not to make a knee jerk emotional response to something and then just do the kind of, okay. Block user, like go through that process. But um, yeah, I suppose it's more difficult to deal with it cause it's not like a tangible physical thing. You, there's no way of going of like just putting somebody bigger in the middle because there really isn't that.

Speaker 4:          22:05          Hmm. Okay. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          22:08          That was a hard question. I wasn't prepared for that.

Speaker 6:          22:12          Hi. So I just want to maybe switch gears a little bit, but I had a question for you guys. You mentioned at the beginning, um, how your band started, like sorta started off with the music blogs and social media kind of spreading your name and even your, the way you spell it, you did it specifically so that you can, you know, kind of stand out on, on the Internet. Um, how do you sort of see the music industry and vans that you see coming up, you know, that are just starting out, you know, utilizing these blogs and social media and the Internet more so now maybe in the past. And do you see that sort of increasing, you know, given, given the rise of how many people are kind of plugged in in the digital age nowadays, but is that something that you guys kind of support and promote or is it more so kind of band by band and, and however they, you know, want to want to spread their name?

Speaker 3:          23:01          Um, I think for me, I guess as a case by case basis and w the blueprint in the works for one person won't work for somebody else. Um, and I think certainly for me when I remember being in bands like pre, pre, I'm having a nice space that was quite interesting when you didn't have to like put your posters on my space when in light with that. Um, and I guess you just promoted it in different ways. Um, bicycles, no, it's kind of unorthodox if a band doesn't have a Facebook page and things like that and you think those things are differently important tools for us to communicate with people. But I've always been the person in the band that runs social networks for bands when I've been in them and I try just as hard at the social networks from my other bands, but they didn't, uh, I guess they didn't connect with people in that same.

Speaker 3:          23:45          So I like to believe it's about the content as well as the way that we pitched it. But I think, um, generally speaking, the music industry is probably having to adapt a lot to incorporate all these new technologies. And I think for a long time people were just drawn to stand like the, like a little dot boy with his finger in the dam being, I don't know if that meant for it makes sense here, but um, yeah. And then just kind of saying no to the progress because it was changing the way the industry worked. But I feel like you can't stop that process. It's just going to happen. So the way that labels and things operate and the way that I even radio and things like that we'll have to change because you can't stop, cannot be internet and her, it's too late. So, um, you know, there's a lot of good things have come out with that.

Speaker 3:          24:29          Like without the Internet, we wouldn't have been able to cover as much ground as quickly as we have and it makes it, I think it makes it a lot more democratic in some ways because if you have a certain amount of technology, you can make things at home in your bedroom and share them online and you don't necessarily have to go through that filter of in getting the guy in the suit to listen to it and sign off on it before you can release it because you can sell for at least on the Internet. And that's pretty powerful.

Speaker 4:          24:54          Okay, thanks.

Speaker 3:          24:58          These are hard. I don't, I looked at the sheet earlier and I was like, man, it's fine. Coming from left field, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          25:05          I have a few questions from some of the people streaming this as well. What are the most effective actions you've seen men take to combat misogyny on mine?

Speaker 3:          25:17          Um, I think that's an interesting one because, um, when men speak to other men about it, I think sometimes I've seen that be a lot more effective because when I talk about it, people could be like, oh, well she's saying that because she's a woman or because she's a feminist and blah, blah, blah, and it's personal to her. And I don't agree with that argument, but it's easier to discredit me that way than it is to a man who's saying that to you. And I think for me, like, um, I've gone to meetings with like feminist groups in Glasgow and then be like, hmm. Not For me because one of the conversations was it was like a feminist book group at University in one of the conversations was whether we could read books that were written about feminism by men. And to me, I was like, that's a complete, it's completely backwards. I don't want to sit here and be a part of that conversation because it's not a conversation to be had in a room full of people who already agree it should be a conversation that everyone's having. So, yeah, I think if everybody can be involved in trying to make society a tiny, tiny bit less rubbish sometimes, then that would be good.

Speaker 1:          26:15          This from Eric, would you use something like a spam filter that automatically labeled aggressive emails and a more generally, what do you think about the role of technology and reducing online massage ne.

Speaker 4:          26:28          Okay.

Speaker 3:          26:28          Um, I guess spam filter is probably useful in Sofar as then you wouldn't see as much of it, but it doesn't necessarily deal with the root problem because then it's, I guess it's a way of you dealing with it rather than going to where it originated and trying to stop it happening in the first place. Um, I guess all right. I Dunno. Like I think for me technology is really has been really useful because we traveled so much and it enables me to keep in touch with people and work on the move. And in the same way it does for everybody, you can, you know, just simple, tiny things that make the day easier and better. And, um, I think that's a really powerful thing and I don't want to send to make it sound like I'm poopooing the internet or anything cause I'm definitely not. But um, yeah I think, I guess I don't know about technology necessarily, but kind what we were talking about, the Internet has definitely opened up a conversation about feminism and misogyny. Yes. It's probably spiked it a little bit as well, but um, if people are talking about it in the same forum, then that's probably a good thing. I feel like you should grade all my answers or something. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          27:38          Uh, we have a music one as well. Uh, where do you stand on subscription music services given that many prominent artists have spoken out against them, what do you think we could do to improve relations with music creators?

Speaker 3:          27:53          I guess that's a pretty, that's a pretty controversial topic. Um, and I think that every artist is completely entitled to have an opinion on it. I guess for us it's more difficult to be very strident about that stuff because without streaming services on the Internet, probably people wouldn't have heard as much about our band. Um, and there was a, a gas the other day where the songs came off Spotify in Mexico and people got very upset and I'm like, Ooh, sorry, I go back and fix it. But, um, I suppose that that's weird in a way because then you're like, oh, well you don't, she don't have my help them, you can't just and listen to it. But then I guess it's just a product of the time to an extent. Like I didn't grow up in an era where music streaming was at prominent. I remember like getting like one one, I think I did, I've only ever illegally downloaded one thing and it was worn during the same period.

Speaker 3:          28:45          We'd have to leave the computer on for like three days. Um, and I remember having to debate to debate with my mom when we were turning the computer off and I was like, it's almost there. It's almost there. Um, and it was just because I couldn't physically get the song. It was like, I think it was like a letters to cleo cover of cheap trick or something that was in a film and I really wanted it but couldn't get it. Um, so I guess I don't, can't relate huge amount to music streaming in that sense, but I guess it's about making, making all that stuff fair on the artist because somebody somewhere is making money out of those things, but it's definitely not the people who make the content that's on it. So I guess if there was a way of making those streams, I dunno, somehow feeding the, the gain back to the people who've paid, paid in time and money to make that cause I guess, you know, at the end of the day someone is trying to make a living off doing that. Um, I don't know. I don't know how to, how to fix it. I don't know what to do. Audience Question.

Speaker 7:          29:47          Um, so I have a question about what you see the role of the rest of the online community is in kind of combating misogyny. Because I know sometimes people say if you comment defending someone, that brings more attention to it. Do you think that there's a role that everyone on the Internet can play and sort of, you know, defending women, defending people in general against these kind of comments? Do you think that brings more attention to it in a positive way? Or do you think that hurts the cause by cycling back the focus to those negative comments?

Speaker 4:          30:18          Okay.

Speaker 3:          30:19          I Dunno, I guess maybe I'm an antagonistic person, but for me it was like the, the ignoring thing. Like when you were a kid and your mom was life, so that's really, and you just ignore them. Um, it doesn't, I guess I don't think that that theory works here because if you ignore it, then people aren't going to be like, oh, they're ignoring me because I've done something really offensive. They're going to think that you're ignoring them in a kind of, oh, well, fair enough, kind of way. Um, and I think if, yeah, if people can be respectful of each other, obviously I'm not saying that you should go in and we a horrible like awful person in return because then that's just an eye for an eye. But I think if people can call each other right on those things, then that's, that's what useful. Um, and also even in the last like year, 18 months or whatever, I've noticed loads more stuff about feminism and mainstream media and that, I dunno, is that a trend of what people are writing about or are the just more willing to talk about it and more people are thinking about it? I'm not sure. I hope so, but um, yeah, hopefully it won't like disappear again, like it kind of feminism is the new black and then it's gone. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          31:30          Hi.

Speaker 7:          31:31          Um, you mentioned that you like feministing and jazz bowel and I see them sort of as a more palatable or relatable form of feminism, especially for like our generation, which I think is changing a lot. What about them do you really like and how do you think people can sort of pull elements of that and to the own their own content that they're creating online?

Speaker 3:          31:54          That's an interesting question. I think, um, for me people like Jessica Valenti are really important voices because she's obviously very intelligent, hadn't has studied the academic side of all this so she knows she knows all the theories and she knows all the kind of the texts that you should check out. But I think the fact that she's taking that and putting it in a real life situation and the, the tone in which you rates and is really relatable and she's talking about things that we've all experienced and I think feminist thing's really interesting because they talk about high court rulings on things, but then they also talk like have opinion pieces on things like things that are happening in pop culture or things are being talked about in the news. And I think just kind of having that kind of dialogue is really helpful and it feels like a nice, quite, quite a useful community rather than somebody telling you things and being like, you think this bid kind of raise questions and accept comment in return.

Speaker 3:          32:48          Um, and I think that's just makes it makes you think about stuff. Um, and I think what, certainly when I was growing up, I didn't really, didn't really have a huge number of friends that would be interested in the same kind of things. Um, and I think only within the last few years really of a fund as many like minded women. Um, we kind of make the joke that I started like a women's collective in Glasgow to make more friends, to make more friends who agreed with me. Um, but I think that has been very important because it's just a thing we have where we run live events and have a radio show and podcast and things. Um, just focusing on women arts and music and things like that. And for me that feels like a positive thing to do because otherwise I feel like I'm constantly thinking about the negative things, the things that are the horrible things are happening and constantly happen on all levels by can I want to try and change the dialogue in my mind and make it something more positive and having people to talk to her about those pretty helpful. So you don't feel like you're the only one and you're like, Oh God, is that, it's not fine. Am I overreacting? Nope. Nope, it's fine. So yeah, community is key.

Speaker 2:          33:59          Do we have any more audience questions?

Speaker 7:          34:07          Hello? Um, so, uh, I remember a while ago, like a comedian once said that there's a strong power and comedy and communication, especially when it comes to tough topics and need something along the lines of like, if I make you laugh, then maybe you won't be as threatened or defensive. So sometimes I think of that with music as well. So I wondered if you'd ever address these kinds of topics, topics and your music or maybe you already have with your lyrics are a bit cryptic. So sorry. Um, I guess

Speaker 3:          34:37          for like, when, I guess when we write music for me, like I just write about, it's like I can have personal perspective, whether that's on personal events that happened to you or a personal perspective on something that's happening externally. Um, but I suppose the lyrics are pretty cryptic, so you probably can't tell from any of that. Um, but yeah, I guess the personal is political to an extent. So the political is personal and vice versa. So, um, there's probably elements of that and the stuff that we're writing about by, I don't think there's necessarily any anthem's in the same way there is on like a Latigo record or something.

Speaker 7:          35:16          All right. Uh, well thank you for coming today. Thank you for having us.
