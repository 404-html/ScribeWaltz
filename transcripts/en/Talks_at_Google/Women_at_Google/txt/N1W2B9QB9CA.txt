Speaker 1:          00:02          All right. Welcome everyone. Thanks for joining during your lunch break and over VC. Um, I'm really excited to introduce my research Rober. She's a Stanford professor and author who is here to share some really great tips on how to juggle your work life and your home life. Um, I'm going to jump right in because we're a few minutes behind and she's going to read an excerpt from one of her books and go over some slides and answer any questions that you may have. So myra is a labor economist and the professor and at the School of Education at Stanford University. She is also the professor of economics at the Graduate School of business at Stanford University. Her research and consulting focus on gender issues at the workplace and work and family. She is the author of numerous articles on occupational segregation, women in the professions and management, the economics of childcare, feminist economics and the teaching of economics. She was the founding director of the Michelle are Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford and she was also the first chair of the National Council for Research on women, a consortium of US Centers for research on women, which today has more than 100 members centers. Um, over the year is Myra has consulted with several corporations on improved that utilization of women in management and unwork family issues. She has also been an expert witness in cases involving the valuation of work in the home, sex discrimination and sexual harassment. So with that I'll have you take it away. Great.

Speaker 2:          01:28          Thank you. Hello everyone. I'm going to start by reading from my memoir, which was published recently by MIT press and it's called sharing the work. So I'm going to read from the very beginning of the memoir. Then I'll talk a little bit about how partners can balance family and careers and then we'll take questions you'll be able to tell in just a minute. When this takes place, it's because you live in Palo Alto. The chairman of Berkeley's Economics Department tells me I can't have a regular job here because I live in Palo Alto. He nods. Chairman break is tall with football players shoulders and although I'm tall to his massive frame towers over me, he's the big shot in one of the most prestigious economics departments in the country. I'm the assistant professor want to be. If this meeting doesn't go well, he could decide not to hire me for next year under my jacket reveal of perspiration, I'm making their way down my dress for success blouse, you have to live in Berkeley to be on your tenure track again.

Speaker 2:          02:42          He nods. I'm baffled. I never knew that. My husband, Sam is a medical resident at Stanford and works incredibly long hours. Often he goes back to his lab late at night to check on his experiments. We have to live in Palo Alto. Okay. I say softly getting up to leave. Thanks very much. When I get to my office, my hands are shaking. I can hardly insert my key into the lock. I feel drained, disoriented. Did I take something out of my freezer for tonight's dinner? Lamb chops, hamburger, I dial home, but Margie, my babysitter doesn't pick up. She's probably taken the kids out somewhere. I leave my office and walk across Sproul Plaza, surprisingly quiet. After all the years of student demonstrations, it's 1970 and the Vietnam war is beginning to wind down. I slide into my full size blue Chevy with a trunk large enough to hold both a stroller and a carriage and review my meeting with break.

Speaker 2:          03:49          I spend a lot of time in big blue these days. It's about an hour between Palo Alto in Berkeley in the morning and longer in the late afternoon and I do the commute three days a week. Gradually crawling and stop and go. Traffic toward the bay bridge. The absurdity of breaks. Answer registers. My first response is to cry. I grew up around in my purse, pull out some tissue and Dab at my eyes, but now the road is blurry. I switched my thoughts to my children. Mommy, mommy, Jason. My three year old will scream with delight when he hears my key in the lock and Liz 11 months will follow his lead. She'll speed across the living room on all fours, tug on my leg and make joyful noises. Suddenly the traffic starts to move. I can never tell why the snarls dissolve, but I'm always grateful as I drive at normal speed, my thoughts turned back to break, but this time instead of tears, I'm aware of growing anger at myself.

Speaker 2:          04:53          What's wrong with you? I scream inside my head. You let him intimidate you. You let him make you mute. You're a smart woman and you let him make you look stupid. Faculty don't have to live in Berkeley to be on the tenure track. He fed you pure bull and you bought it. You want to know why you can't have a tenure track job at Berkeley? Look at what's real. There are no women except Margaret and the whole economics department faculty and although she's been there for more than 20 years, she's still a lecturer. Wake up. The difference between a lecturer and an assistant professor is monumental. Assistant professors have a regular job with an opportunity for promotion and lifetime tenure. Lecturers on the other hand are on a road to nowhere. They are appointed from year to year, generally only a few months before they're teaching is to begin and have no chance of advancing.

Speaker 2:          05:52          I've worked too hard for too many years to be content with second class citizenship. I intend to get the real deal at Berkeley. When I finally get onto the bay bridge, my anger changes. Now I'm furious with break dairy. Tell me I have to live in Berkeley. The radio was tuned to a talk station and I registered Joe Carcione, the popular green grocer instructing the whole bay area about choosing Pumpkin's. Ah, Halloween is coming. Maybe I should revisit breaks, office and costume. Which skeleton? Big Bird. Surely some costume could shake him out of his. We all have to live in Berkeley routine with my sheets, skirt and matching man tailored jacket. I'm wearing stockings and high heels. The stockings feel sticky and the shoes pinch every time I accelerate. How I would love to kick off those shoes. Whoever invented high heels definitely didn't have driving in mind.

Speaker 2:          06:55          I'm getting angry by the second at the traffic, which has snarled again at my gluey stockings and to tide high heels and it my own naive tay. But most of all I'm angry at brake. Slowly I begin to understand what people mean when they say their anger makes them see red because of swelling. Fury, a deep scarlet anger now floods the car, the steel frame and glass windows can't contain it and it bursts onto the road like a flaming oil slick, a torrent sliding over the bridges, girders and thundering across the bay. As the lights of San Francisco began to flicker against the darkening sky, I feel a flicker of light within myself. I become a feminist on the bay bridge. So the followup to that story is the morning afterwards I called breaks office again and asked for another appointment and his secretary told me he was very busy.

Speaker 2:          08:04          It would be several weeks before he could see me. So I had a second meeting several weeks later and I asked him the same question again and he asked me if I wanted him to be frank and I said, yes, I did. And basically he told me that they knew that I had both a three year old and an infant and that they didn't know what was going to happen to me. I said, happened to me, what do you think's going to happen to me if you give me a position in six years I'll come up for tenure and promotion and we'll all see what happens to me. He said, no. He said, I could never sell that to the department. Well, in the meantime, having nothing to do with me, the women faculty at Berkeley filed a complaint with the Labor Department under a new executive order and investigators from the Labor Department came to Berkeley and I thought to myself, you're going to have to sell that to the, to the department.

Speaker 2:          09:12          And I was right because after two years I got an assistant professor offer from Berkeley and if anybody ever tells you that the law doesn't make a difference, argue with them. I also got an assistant professor offer from the Stanford Business School because although Stanford had not had a complaint filed against them, they were nervous that there might be one. And so in 1972, I was hired as the first woman at the business school. The first woman at the law school was hired. The first woman in engineering was hired and on and on. So, um, I, uh, wound up teaching at Stanford and not at Berkeley. And I have had as one of my fields of study all that time how partners can balance family and careers. Because as you see, my experience at Berkeley was that they didn't believe that I could possibly balance a career, uh, at Berkeley or presumably anywhere else. Um, and also have young children. So what I wanna do now is talk about the main issues that I see for people who do want to balance two careers, uh, and, and, uh, a family too, demanding careers and a family. So let's take a look at these slides.

Speaker 2:          10:37          You can't have it all. As an economist, I'm always perplexed when people ask me the question, can you have it all kind of Mr into tradeoffs? Nobody can have it all. Something has to be traded off, so you can have two demanding careers and a family, but something has to give. Maybe it's no longer cooking five gourmet meals a week or playing tennis or exercising regularly or seeing your friends as frequently, but something is going to have to change. However, if two people are committed to two careers and a family, it's possible to achieve all of that if they understand what they have to give up in order to do that, and if they're fully committed to two careers, what does it mean to be fully committed to two careers? It means that each spouse has to, or partner, has to be committed not only to their own career, but to the other career as well. That's not easy and there are challenges all along the way. The most important career decision you're going to make is not really a career decision. It's about who you're going to marry or partner with. And if you're already married and, uh, things are not working out well, make sure you have a conversation about this. Make sure you understand what it's about to be committed to two careers.

Speaker 2:          12:15          The first challenge is where are we going to live and where are we going to work? Um, and the answer to these questions are different for each couple because the specifics are different. So for example, if one partner is much more mobile than the other partner, then that suggests that the couple should locate where the person who needs more mobility is, uh, should we take turns advancing our career? You know, should we move here and the first instance for one career and then five years later move, uh, for another career move? Uh, sometimes that works out well. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes if you keep switching careers and nobody has priority, then you wind up with two careers that aren't working well. So you have to really think about these issues. They're tough. Should we choose only locations where both people can flourish? Usually that works well.

Speaker 2:          13:13          And usually that means a fairly large area. So you know, the bay area, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Atlanta, places where both members of a couple can find jobs and move up. Should we have a commuter marriage? That's tough. Uh, the literature seems to suggest that a commuter marriage works for a while. If it's time limited, if both people know that it's not going to last forever. And of course, if there are children involved, then a commuter marriage is really tough. How about dividing housework and home management? While you may be able to outsource a good deal of housework, but unless you're extremely rich, uh, you and your partner will be managing your home. Um, how will you divide the management work? People often forget about the management function. You know, they decide who's going to cook and who's going to clean up, but they forget, you know, somebody has to be involved in who's going to call the plumber.

Speaker 2:          14:17          But somebody has to know that a plumber has to be called. Okay. Somebody has to know that you have to sign up the kids for camp before all the slots are filled. Those are all management functions. Are you going to be cozy CEOs or are you going to divide up the function? If you're going to be cozy Yos then you have to have a lot of communication. As is always the case when there's more than one, a CEO involved deciding when and if to have a child. Well from people always ask me when is the best time to have a child? The answer is that it's always the best time and it's always the worst time. Now, if you want a child, it's the best time whenever you have a child. But a child is likely to slow your career to some degree. And if you're both members of the couple of sharing childcare, then it may slow both careers.

Speaker 2:          15:13          So again, this is a tough decision. How are you going to care for your children? Well, leaving the workforce one, one member of the couple leaving the workforce, um, is one possibility. Uh, and more and more, uh, dads are leaving the workforce, but that is a very costly decision. The person who leaves the workforce, uh, generally loses a good deal of his or her network unless they make a really conscious effort to maintain that network. Often their skills depreciate unless again, they make a very conscious effort to keep those skills going. And the literature shows that when you come back, when women come back, there's not enough men coming back from childcare to, to study it yet, but when women come back, their earnings are permanently lower by as much as 20%. Now this could be because of the jobs that they choose or because their new bosses don't see them as good material for promotion because they've taken time out.

Speaker 2:          16:17          But in any case, uh, the combination of factors leads to an earnings decrement. Also, people lose insurance in case of divorce because if you have to come back to the workforce in case of divorce and you haven't been in the workforce for a long time, you're going to have a lot of trouble getting back in part time work is another potential solution, but often it's not a very good solution. It can be the worst of all worlds because often employers don't pay per hour. What you would get if you had a fulltime job. Benefits are often lower. Uh, often employers don't see people who work time, part time as good candidates for promotion. And the other problem that people tell me about all the time is that even though they've negotiated a part time schedule, they wind up working full time. So now it is the worst of both worlds because you're working full time but you only have a part time salary.

Speaker 2:          17:20          So we are part time seems to work best is when you've already been a full time person and you negotiate for part time in a limited way. So you say, you know, I'm, I'm coming back from having a child, um, and I want to work part time for the next six months. Can we work that out so that, that seems to be a good solution there. Inform yourselves about childcare options early. Like when you know you're going to have a child, uh, because it's often difficult to find good quality childcare. And we know that good quality childcare has been official to children. Uh, but not all childcare is good quality and inform yourselves about what to look for in terms of the quality of childcare. Now people always talk about balancing work and family, but that could be not the ideal metaphor because if you think of balance as, you know, the scales of justice with equality for most people, work in family is not equal.

Speaker 2:          18:29          You know, for some work is higher, but some families higher. Um, but it doesn't mean that the balance has to be, you know, equal. Um, I think the better notion is the jar of life. So figure out what things in your life are the rocks, what are the things I really should go into that jar and put those things in first. So after the jars filled with rocks, then the pebbles can all pebbles and the sand can all fill in around the rocks. But you know that you fit in the most important stuff. And I think in striving for balance, it's probably fruitless to imagine that you'll work in family life is going to be in balance every day, every week, maybe not even every month. But what's important is that you both continually work to move back into what you decide is the right balance. And I like to think about a band of acceptibility.

Speaker 2:          19:38          Okay, so my work family is in balance within this band. And if I'm out here or my family is out here, then we agree that we got to get back into our band of acceptability. We've got to change some things to get back. So I liked that notion of work, family balance rather than, uh, the scales of equality. And finally, let me just say that, you know, work, family balance is not just about you and your family. Many of you are or will be in a position to help other people, to balance their work and family. And, uh, when you make decisions with your employees, people who report to you about how they're going to be able to balance work and family, think about the power that you have, uh, to make their life more livable. And also think about how we can jointly put more flexibility into the entire system.

Speaker 2:          20:40          As you probably know, the United States is the only industrialized country without a paid leave for maternity let alone paternity. Uh, we need to change that and we have no childcare system. The last time there was a bill in Congress for a childcare system was 1971. Nixon vetoed that bill and no bill has come to Congress in sin. So, uh, Hillary Clinton now has a, a plan for a childcare system, but it's been 45 years since congress took up the notion of a childcare system for the country. So there's work to do obviously in your own family and your workplace and in the society as a whole. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          21:35          I've always put about 30% on as the figure for how much extra are family spends that it wouldn't if one parents stayed home full time. And that's for house cleaning, takeout, guilt gifts for the kids. Um, is that an accurate figure? It had. Do you got any stats on that?

Speaker 2:          22:01          I don't have stats on that, but I think that as families make decisions about whether both parents should work or not. Um, you don't want to make a decision based on short run factors. So, you know, what some people do is they say, you know, this is the salary that the second earner could earn in the workplace and here's what we have to pay for all the factors you talked about childcare, extra cleaning, takeout, often an extra car. Okay, so you know, does it pay? Is My salary or the other person's salary high enough to cover all those costs? So I don't think that's a good way to think about this because this is not a short run issue. This is a longterm issue. And if you take into account the decrease in salary, that's going to take place when the person who left the workforce comes back then over a lifetime of, well now lifetime but a work lifetime. Um, those childcare costs and guilt gifts. And I love that. Guilt gifts and extra cleaning and whatever are going to be minimal. It's really an economic investment to pay for those things in order to keep a person in the workforce, keep those skills current, keep those networks up and, and get the income from the second person.

Speaker 2:          23:41          And also it's not a good idea to think about, you know, will the second person's salary cover these expenses because really these are family expenses and you don't want to think about them as having the second earner needing to cover those expenses. You know, both, both people are responsible.

Speaker 3:          24:01          Oh, I have a question. And uh, around kind of the lean in movement and having women who, uh, you know, going on maternity leave, coming back reporting into me, everyone has different experiences around it. Oh, for me, I read the book of the very powerful time when I had my first child and it kind of inspired me to really come back and come back full force. But I have a lot of women who, when we talk about it, they feel that there's almost double pressure. So I've had a different experience. I actually think the lean in movement and all the research has been helpful in my career on sticking with the workforce. But there are people that report to me that say it's put too much pressure on them as women. I'm curious in your research at Stanford and your engagement, how you address it, and I know it's not one size fits all right, but ultimately how do you respond to women that feel, God, there's so much pressure to be amazing moms to be fully full throttle into our career as well.

Speaker 2:          24:57          So I think the point you make that no one size fits all is the key. And we have very interesting discussions in my classes. I teach a class at the Stanford business school on work and family and 40% of the students are men. And some of them have had a fair amount of work experience because they're back for what used to be known at the business school as the Sloan program. Now it has some other name ms x or something. Um, and so a lot of those men are very proud of the way in which they helped women to handle, uh, coming back to work after pregnancy. And so they talk about what they did. And invariably some woman will raise her hand and say, that's not what I want when I come back. So your point that different women want different things. One woman will say, when I come back, I want to be full force.

Speaker 2:          25:55          I don't want anybody change my travel schedule. I don't want anybody to change my, uh, you know, number of meetings. I want to be there full force. And others will say what some of your reports say, no, I can't handle that right now. I need to move over a little bit. Uh, take away some of my responsibilities. And in a few years I'd like to be able to move back. That's the key. It used to be that the so called Mommy track, you know, tuck away responsibilities, but then you were gone. You were gone from the screen and when you said you wanted to come back, the answer was too bad for you. You've missed the train, uh, you can't get on that track anymore, which is really a foolish way to think about human resources and know you were at for a few years. So now we're never going to use your full force again.

Speaker 2:          26:45          Uh, but the manager really has to have a conversation with the report to find out what's what's desired. And the second thing about that is, you know, people can change their mind. So you have that conversation before the woman or even the man leaves for a family leave and then they come back and they have a different perception. I mean, so many things can happen. They might have a child with special needs. Well, they didn't anticipate that when they told you they wanted to come back full force or they might find that their own health is not as strong as they thought it was going to be for whatever reason. So yes, it's good to have a conversation before the person goes out on leave, see what they're thinking. But then the real key is to having a conversation when they're ready to come back.

Speaker 2:          27:42          And you know, I think lean in is very important because it says, you know, try to do. But I think Sheryl Sandberg's main message is don't leave before you leave. That's critical. You know, keep going full force for as long as you can, assuming your health is good. Uh, but I think that in a leaning in is only part of the story. I think that you need to have employers who meet you halfway. Otherwise, I always tell my students, if you keep leaning in and nobody's there to meet you, you're just going to fall over. So that doesn't do anybody any good. So yes, you need to work hard, but employers need to have policies that meet people halfway. I think that Deloitte has done a really good job of trying to figure out how to have lots of different paths after people leave the workforce or come back part time.

Speaker 2:          28:40          Um, and then you know, as they're ready to resume a full tilt, then they're welcomed to do that. I think that's really ideal is what is a real world example of a band of acceptability agreement a couple could have in place in their relationship? Well, one, one aspect of the band of acceptability might have to do with how many nights a week the family eats dinner together. So, you know, seven is one possibility, but you might say, look, it's fine if, um, you know, one partner Mrs dinner with the family one night a week and a second partner Mrs dinner with the family. So now the family is going to have dinner five nights a week or maybe the couple's going to go out for dinner by themselves one night a week. So now the family eats together four nights a week. When children get older, that may be impossible.

Speaker 2:          29:38          Not because of the parents work scheduled because of the kids' sports schedules. No. So then you might say, okay, every Sunday morning our family is going to have a pancake breakfast together. And that's, you know, nothing can interfere with that. So that would be a band of acceptability. Or You could have, um, acceptibility rules about travel. So how many nights a month is it okay for one or the other partner, uh, to be outside the city in some other city? Okay. Is it fine? Five nights a week, four nights a week, um, 10 days a month, whatever your family decides is right. Then if things begin to move toward more and more nights away, you can sit down and say to one another, wait a minute, look, this is, this isn't what we said we wanted to do. Something has to change here. So that would be an example.

Speaker 1:          30:38          Um, it's common for working mothers to be asked why they have children, if their children will spend most of their waking hours with someone else. How do you think about the role of a working parent and in particular how best to measure your contribution to your children? If you can't win on quote unquote time,

Speaker 2:          30:54          although you may be away for many of the child's waking hours, you as a parent, I'm going to be right there for other of those working of those of the child's hours. Uh, certainly on the weekends, in the evening, in the early morning. Um, and I think parents have a tremendous effect on their children. Uh, even if their children are in childcare or if they are raised by a third parent, like a grandparent or a nanny. Um, one of the interesting ways to think about this is when a child is cared for not only by his or her parents, but also by another person and the other person has a different accent. The child picks up the parents accent. So, you know, over hundreds of years, uh, English royal children were raised by people who didn't necessarily have the upper class English accent and somehow or other those children figure out which accent they're supposed to imitate.

Speaker 2:          32:07          And I think that's true for not just language. I think children know very early who their parents are and, um, the kind of love that they get from those parents hopefully. And there's a bond that isn't a created by a nanny or child care worker or even a grandparent. There's a different kind of love with a grandparent. So I think there's plenty of hours in the week for to interact with their kids, to show them they love them. And, you know, I'm just amazed all the time by my students and former students who talk about ways in which they have created to interact with their children even when they're traveling. So now we have Skype. I mean, that's a phenomenal way to be involved with your kids. Before that we had phone conversations. Um, so I, I just think that children know who their parents are and know the kind of love that they get from those parents.

Speaker 2:          33:14          And you know, also stu students tell me that when they can't be at their child's a ballet recital, they, uh, have somebody there who videotapes it and then they sit with the child and watch the videotape and they say, no, that's even better than having been in the audience because now we can stop the tape. We can talk about what the child was doing and feeling. So I think with technology and with a little bit of thinking about this appearance can have very fruitful relationships with their parents, with their children, even if they're working hard.

Speaker 3:          33:46          My question is about the body of work available on this subject. How much research is available with children being the subjects.

Speaker 2:          33:58          There's a tremendous amount of research available. Um, my daughter in law, Joanna Strober and a coauthor Sharon mirrors have a book called, uh, getting to 50, 50, which was published. Um, I think 2009 maybe. Um, and that has a review of the research up to that time, uh, from BF for beyond that really you can go onto the internet and find a tremendous amount of research if you want to. You know, Google scholar is terrific on this, uh, to find the, the serious journal articles, but also government publications. There's just an enormous amount of stuff out there. Too much. It's hard to sift through it.

Speaker 3:          34:42          It's kind of gray area where men, they're not leaning out, it's not the primary caregiver, but they are put potentially taking a little bit of a valley and their career to support potentially a woman, their partner who's really full force. It could be a new job, it could be a move. And just the way is, as society evolved enough to accepted and, and it comes from a personal example. I've moved from New York for this Google position. It's a very big job. My husband's kind of leaning in and supporting me and he, he, it's interesting, he shares with me, he's still working. He's running his business, but it's not the New York base and a lot of parents in school and just, he does more of the dropoffs kind of always hint to him like, Hey, when are you going to get back in when you, and he's like, I'm in, I'm just not in at 120% like Molina is right now because Google's new, it's intense. It's interesting as gray area that maybe people don't want to talk about. And I'm curious if you see when the men are kind of

Speaker 2:          35:38          supporting their wives, but then society thinks that they've completely leaned out. I Dunno. It's just curious. I think it's really tough for men who are trying to make these changes because they do get those kinds of comments. Um, and they, they have to be not only strong in terms of their career, they have to be strong and facing all these other, usually mothers who have all these, uh, words about what they should and shouldn't be doing. And, you know, I've often thought it'd be fun to have a class for men who are, as you say, uh, leading in a, to support their wives, to give them some comments that they might offer in return for these negative comments about, um, you know, when are you going to get back in and so on. Um, you know, I, I just think that whenever you're a pioneer, you have to face these societal norms, uh, that haven't changed yet.

Speaker 2:          36:42          And in my book, uh, sharing the work, you know, I was a pioneer. I was the first woman at the Stanford Business School and the book is filled with these kinds of discussions about what I had to face. Now the pioneers are people like your husband who are really bucking the trends, um, and are saying, no, my wife has gotten a great job at Google and I'm going to support her. And she's going all the way and I'm still staying in, but I'm doing more childcare than I might've done otherwise. And um, you know, I think you have to, you have to be a pioneer and you have to be strong.

Speaker 1:          37:26          Can you talk about challenges taking care of aging parents and family members and any nuances to what you've covered with regard to partnering balance on this top? Sorry. With regard to partnering slash balance on this topic versus childcare balance?

Speaker 2:          37:40          That's a really important question. Um, I didn't have a section on elder care in my work family course, uh, until maybe seven or eight years ago when one of the men in my class did a paper on elder care. And at the bottom of his paper he said, I think this topic should be in the class. And I thought to myself, yes, it's really should. And so since that time we do have the topic in the class. And in many ways elder care is more challenging than childcare. I mean, even though children may be rebellious, basically the parents are in charge, you know, the parents make the decisions and you know, try to get the children to go along. That's not true with elder care. Adult children are not in charge of their parents, adult children. I have to wait for the appearance, make decisions that they can support.

Speaker 2:          38:37          They can try to influence them. But the parents are in charge. The other thing is that, you know, children grow up. So childcare is only for a few years and then they become teenagers, which is a whole different story. But you know, then they stopped being teenagers and they grew up more with elder care. You don't know how long your parent is going to need care. Um, you don't know whether the situation's going to get better or more likely worse. Um, it's much less predictable. They often don't live in the same city where you live. And the statistics seem to show that more days are lost from work by adults doing elder care. Then childcare because childcare is predictable so you can line up help, but elder cares, particularly if you have to go to another state to take care of your parent is not predictable. And I think elder care is still not talked about much in the workplace.

Speaker 2:          39:41          A lot of people don't want their manager to know that they're involved in elder care because they're spending a lot of time at work doing this. And so I believe this is the topic for the future with regard to work, family balance and you know if there's an emergency with your parents, there is no balance. None at all. You know, 150% of your time and effort is involved in trying to deal with this emergency. And then you have to make all the other arrangements, especially if you're in the cell called sandwich generation where you not only have elder parents but you have young children. So then you're really running from one to the other to try to get the balance that you need. Interestingly, more and more studies show that men are more involved in elder care. So it used to be when wives or at home and not in the workplace that they did the elder care, not only for their parents but also for their husbands parents. But that's not so true anymore. So more and more men are doing the care for their own parents and um, really stepping up to that. So again, that's a, that's a whole new sort of pioneering.

Speaker 1:          40:59          Can you give any guidance on the proper timing and method to start speaking with your manager about your decision to start family planning?

Speaker 2:          41:10          So I think this idea of when you should talk to your manager also, uh, is very specific. Um, they're very, this, this specifics of the situation are really important. If you know that your manager is going to be helpful, um, and isn't going to say to you something like, oh, why you go and do that, you could have had a great career, then you might want to talk to your manager early on. If you think your manager is not going to be supportive, you might want to wait a little bit more before you talk. But you know, pregnancy has a way, particularly for women of showing, so your manager's going to find out at some point or other, and it's probably better if you talk to your manager before he or she can see that you're pregnant. Um, and so I think the best example I know is a former student of mine who was in strategic planning at a tech company.

Speaker 2:          42:15          This was years ago. And she went into her manager early on and said, this is the plan. This is the strategic plan for my pregnancy and, and, uh, childbirth. So here is a flow chart and here's what I'm going to be doing for the next six months. And then I want to take some time off and I'm going to check in at each of these points. And then after, you know, six months, I'm coming back full time. Um, and she said, you can't find anybody to do this job better than I can given the strategic plan I just gave you. And he sort of said, bless you. Uh, so you know, if you say what you want and how are you going to do it? And you're confident and of course everybody has to understand that things might not quite work out that way depending on what happens. But you know, you can say with 90% confidence perhaps that this is what is going to happen. Here's what we're going to do.

Speaker 4:          43:24          I was wondering if you could share some of your suggestions for how to make that dip in a career for, you know, a couple to young professionals with let's say six relatively successful [inaudible] when I took your class, I remember when you talked to about one suggestion which was hiring a night nanny even though it's quite expensive, but there's actually quite a lot of benefit of getting a good night's sleep for both partners and then having a more productive day and the psychological. So I was hoping to get a refresher on things like that.

Speaker 2:          43:56          Well of course, you know, if you have, um, a lot of money, then there are lots of solutions like a night nanny. Um, if you are not in such a great financial situation, then of course you're more limited and you have to be more creative. When I see graduate students at Stanford who by definition do not have a lot of money. Well unless their parents have a tremendous amount of money, but they don't have a lot of money. They use a co op method. So they went when they want to go out to a movie or they want to go out for dinner a date night or something, they probably won't go out for a movie. But you know, for four out for dinner, just the two of them. Um, instead of hiring a babysitter, which can cost you no more than the dinner, um, they will trade off.

Speaker 2:          44:53          So they'll say, you know, tonight we're going to go out for dinner. You Watch both your children and mine and then, you know, tomorrow night you go and I'll watch you. It, I think there's lots of ways of cooperating with other people who also have young children that work out very well. Even, you know, would you take my child, uh, for the afternoon so I can get a nap if your child's not napping anymore, otherwise try to nap when the job maps in it. Good thing. But, um, you know, I think your question is wonderful because it shows you that you have to think creatively about how to do this. You know, it was easier in the old days where you had lots of family living around you and you could just drop your kid off for a few hours with somebody in your family. Now you have to arrange those kinds of, of um, new family arrangements with, with people who are actually no friends by choice rather than family members.

Speaker 2:          45:54          But truly if you, if you have a lot of money, I mean I know people who hire more than one nanny, you know, some nanny comes, you know, from eight to six and another nanny comes from five to nine and, and then if the child is a newborn and not sleeping through the night, they might hire a night nurse. So all of those things are possible for a very few people. So this is sort of adding on to the Koa question, but how important it is, it is it to have a network of women, not your job, but when she come back that are sort of experiencing the same experiences as you are? Well, I don't think it's necessarily, um, necessary to have it at your job. Uh, uh, some women prefer to have a network of women doing the same thing they're doing, but at other companies so that they can be, you know, 100% frank about what's going on and not worry that somebody is at their own workplace.

Speaker 2:          46:56          Other people like to have a network at their workplace, but no matter how you slice it, a network is key. I know when I was raising my kids, there were very few professional women and, uh, my network consisted of my kids' friends' mothers at their nursery school. So they, they weren't professional women at all, but they were so helpful to me, uh, in, in so many ways. Um, no. If my babysitter couldn't come because she had a family emergency, I would call one of them. And they would take my children home with them, you know, at lunchtime. And um, you, you can't do this just by yourself. And of course, the luckiest thing is if you can get your parents to move to near where you are or you move back. I mean, I had a student who she and her husband moved back to Shanghai because that's where their parents were and they could not imagine doing this kind of thing without their parents help. So, you know, the geographic location had nothing to do with their two careers and had to do with where their parents were. Thank you so much. You're welcome.
