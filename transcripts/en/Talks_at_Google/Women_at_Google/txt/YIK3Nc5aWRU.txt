Speaker 1:          00:06          Thank you. Hi everyone. I'm Jeff [inaudible]. I'm the vice president of global resorts at Burton and I've had the pleasure of knowing Kelly Clark for 18 years. She is absolutely incredible, whether it's helping us out with a resort photo shoot or helping us introduce really young kids to snowboarding and physical education in elementary schools. Kelly has always made the time, whether it no matter what community she's living in, she always wants to give back.

Speaker 2:          00:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36          If you take a look at her career, it's absolutely incredible. Spanning 18 years, five Olympics, three Olympic medals, eight u s opened metals and 14 x games medals. Now, if you stack her against the top female athletes, if you look right there, that 47% wind rate is outstanding, so 47% of the time she entered a snowboard competition, she won. So impressive. If you stack it against the top male athletes, once again, you'll see how impressive that win rate is. So I'm very honored and excited to introduce Kelly Clark to you today, but before I do that, I want to share one of her winning moments

Speaker 3:          01:33          also in the history of this event coming out of riding for Burton snowboards. This is Kelly. Hello today, and it was typical Kelly Clark. She drops in for her first run, puts down a score of 86.88 the highest of the day. The other riders, she's not too far ahead of crop cassoulet. What did she do on her second round? She ups it by three points. 89.33 and I would not be surprised, right? Yeah. Can we put down a run in the 90s even though she goes even though victory, can we put an exclamation point on this? When you look at the standings tomorrow, are you doing and she's doing so right here. Look at how high she's leading on that transition right below the big hunting, keeping a hard edge to get flat bottom. Absolutely massive. Carrie did just put it on.

Speaker 1:          02:37          Wow. Ladies and gentlemen, Kelly Clark.

Speaker 1:          02:49          Okay, thanks for the introduction Jeff. I'm thanks everybody for coming and hanging out with us today. Um, it's a, it's a huge honor for me to be here. Um, I'm excited to get the share some of my life, some of my process. Um, sports have such a good way of just illustrating kind of life's principles. Um, I've been with, um, with Burton snowboards for the last 20 years. This marks my 20th year with the brand, which is a pretty incredible relationship I've had with them. I've had a abnormally long snowboard career. Um, I'm technically very old to be a pro snowboarder at 35. Um, so it's, uh, it's been really fun though. I've really learned everything that I've learned to kind of develop into the person that I am through snowboarding. They have kind of a rubber meets the road type of ability to, to show you what you're, what you're capable of and show you what you built.

Speaker 1:          03:47          Um, I always say I trained 30 seconds, uh, high train for years for 32nd half pipe run. So there's a lot that goes into the, behind the scenes that people don't see any snowboarder's in here. Any, any skiers in here? A, okay. You guys can stay. We still like you. I was up in Tahoe last week and um, there's a lot better snow than there has been the last few years, so it should be a really fun winter. Um, I grew up in Vermont. Um, I live in Sacramento currently and I started snowboarding when I was seven. It was the first year was even allowed at my home resort. Um, 1990. I always say that I started snowboarding before it was cool. Um, there was no such thing as the winter x games and it was long before it ever became an Olympic sport. And honestly, I never wanted to compete.

Speaker 1:          04:42          It was really, uh, I actually was a ski racer and I skipped enough ski racing practice to, uh, have my parents stopped paying for that just so I could snowboard all the time. And I never wanted, I never want it to compete because the kind of ski racing vibe was really cutthroat and competitive. And as a young kid I did, it just didn't appeal to me. And I had the opportunity to go to the high school where it was essentially a, a private school where I could go to school half day and snowboard half day. And that sounded like a pretty good gig to me. And I just knew I wanted to spend more days on the hill and to be able to go to this school I had to compete. So I thought, okay, I'll, I'll get in the competition. That was when I was 14 years old and I actually just kind of fell in love with him.

Speaker 1:          05:24          It was, um, I was halfway decent at it, which was great and I really enjoyed it. And then I remember you don't often think you make big decisions when you're 14 years old. It was 1998 and it was the first year that snowboarding became an Olympic sport. And I remember I had recorded it on a VHS tape. Anybody VHS tapes, I probably like recorded over an episode of friends or something. But I, uh, had recorded the Olympics snowboarding's debut and I remember everything about that day. I remember where I was, I remember what I was wearing, I remember what the weather was like and, and I saw snowboarding become an Olympic sport. And I knew right then and there that this was a dream that I wanted to give my life to. And, um, four years later I found myself and my first Olympics in 2002, um, and then followed it up with Italy in Torino, Vancouver, Sochi, Russia.

Speaker 1:          06:24          And then my last Olympics was in Korea. Um, so over 16 years, uh, I've had the privilege of representing my country five different times. And, uh, I have one last draw all that. I've had a wide range of Olympic experiences. Um, and it's been fun to kind of pull on those and, and see the personal growth growth in my life. Um, you know, through snowboarding I've learned to be successful, so to speak. I've learned a great deal about failure, but more so than anything I've learned to enjoy what I do. And that's what I want to talk about today. How do we not only be successful, but how do you actually thrive in the environment that you're in? And you know, I live in a performance culture every weekend in the winter. I go out there and see what I built and see if I have what it takes.

Speaker 1:          07:22          But you don't have to be an Olympian to find yourselves living in a performance culture. Um, you know, we only have to pick up our phones to have a glance at social media and start comparing ourselves to one another. It's, it's where we find ourselves living a lot of the time is in this performance world. Um, but the, the good news is, is just because we live in this culture, it doesn't mean that culture gets to live with inside of us. So there's a few things that I want to touch on today that have really helped me learn to thrive in that environment and that performance world. And I'm just going to hit on those and I'm going to tell a few stories to kind of illustrate that. Does that sound good?

Speaker 1:          08:06          So we talk about performance, culture. Um, but what does that actually mean in the performance world? It says, I wonder if I'm enough. I will sacrifice respect and honor to get ahead. I will work for everything and I will compete to earn what I deserve. And this is the big thing. External success is the only thing that matters and it performance world. So those are the things, that's the place we find ourselves in. It seems pretty extreme when I lifted out like that, but those are the things that's, that's the race we find ourselves in a lot of the time. And I'm just going to touch on thriving here for a minute to, um, how many of you guys have succulence at home? Anybody proud? Succulent owner? Would you say they're thriving or our IP? Succulence maybe rip succulents. Huh? That happens. Um, you know, you can be successful and not be thriving, but it's hard to be thriving and not feel successful.

Speaker 1:          09:08          And it only takes us looking at our house plants to see if something's driving. And usually when something's driving it means that it's growing. And that's honestly what it means to thrive. If something's growing, we say, oh, we put that plan right where it needed to be. We gave it the right amount of water. It's in the right environment. And when it grows, that's, that's what we say. Hey, it's my plants are thriving. I don't know how many green thumbs we have in here, but I know, um, you often think you're thriving when you're winning. You think you're thriving when you're successful. Um, but as I'll kind of dive into this, success just looks like growth and that's what we need to be doing in our lives and that's, that's what we need to be putting in the win column. So the few things that I, I want to bring up that I've really found in my career that have helped me be successful and thrive and enjoy what I do.

Speaker 1:          10:03          Um, honestly, it all starts with our identity. It's so easy to get a sense of self worth and a sense of significance wrapped up in our performance. Um, in sports we see it the most. We see the roughest transitions when people want athletes retire because they get so much of their self worth and their performance. And it's, it's a natural thing to do. That's how we identify each other. When we meet, when we meet people who say, Oh, who are you and what do you do? You know, it's, it's, um, it's very easy to find yourself operating in that place. But I'd like to propose that success isn't what we're looking for. I think we're looking for a deep sense of significance and I think we try to fill that with success and with performance. I know I've done that a ton in my career. When your self worth is a tied to your performance, we can't take risks.

Speaker 1:          10:58          Um, think about it. If I'm in a snowboard contest and, um, I'll actually use an example from, from Russia heading into the 2014 Olympics. I was a heavy gold medal favorite. Um, I was supposed to perform well. That was, uh, I was probably, if I looked back at my career, that was probably kind of the prime time of my snowboard career. And I was 30 years old and it was my fourth Olympics. I had kind of all the, all the bugs out of my system. I was pretty comfortable knowing what I wanted to accomplish that time. And uh, when we showed up for the event, it was a 55 degrees and if anybody knows what snow does, when it's 55 degrees, it becomes very challenging. And, um, I took my first run at a 1:00 PM and three rounds of competition happened before my final run, which was around 9:00 PM.

Speaker 1:          11:55          And if you can imagine in those terms, the pipe deteriorated. I'm in epic fashion. When I showed up for finals, uh, I moved, I remember it took five runs in practice for finals and I moved my 10 83 different times and I couldn't get it to work. I fell five runs in a row in my practice for finals. And now that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to a fall in the contest, but especially at the Olympics like you want, you want your practice to go well, it's going to kind of set the tone for your performance that evening. And I remember I went down and I saw a sea of team USA. People kind of staring at me knowing that the train had completely fallen off the tracks. And I saw my sports psychologist and I looked at her and I said, hey, you know what?

Speaker 1:          12:44          I actually need to go and have a good cry and then I think I'm going to be ready. Um, I think if your significance and your personal view is tied to your performance, you really can't take those risks that you need to. And because everything in life is an opportunity or a threat. And I needed to look at that moment as an opportunity. And in a performance world, we're at our worst when we're afraid we ever seen somebody, uh, hardest store. If someone drowning, you know, when, when somebody goes to save them, they actually tried to drown the person that's trying to save them. We are at our worst when we are, when we're afraid. And I was looking at these next two runs in the Olympics. I had waited, um, for years. I had spent an entire lifetime since I was 14, investing in this dream and it's going as bad as it possibly can go.

Speaker 1:          13:42          Um, after my ugly cry, I went to the top and I said, okay, this is an opportunity to overcome a bad situation. And uh, you know, what happened? My next run I went and um, I landed my 10 for the first time that night, but took off early on my seven and I hit the deck and I like to call it like a reverse Taco. If you can imagine that. I bounced to the flat reverse Taco and I fell an epic fashion. Um, and I was probably more prepared for first run fall than a poor practice. I knew even though I'd fallen six runs in a row, I still had an opportunity if I was so caught up in the expectation of being the gold mental favorite, if I was so caught up in maintaining my reputation and what people thought and what I even demanded of myself, I would not be in an opportunity that would be in a threat.

Speaker 1:          14:35          And in a performance world, we need to be at our best. Um, I went back to the top, I saw my coach and uh, you know, we had been through this scenario a lot of times it was first run falls, it happens. I, this last week I was counting up a bunch of my, um, my competition bibs and I have over 190. And so those first run falls, it's happened a few times and I went back up and um, to be quite honest, it was the, it was the hardest thing that I ever did. But I told my coach, Hey, what an opportunity. Six runs. I've fallen consecutively. I was the last person to go over the entire event cause I'd qualified first for finals. So we run in reverse order and I dropped in and I landed a run and it was good enough to put me on the Olympic podium and I'd fallen six runs in a row, only Atlanta my seventh, when it mattered most. And I was so proud of my performance. It wasn't necessarily my best snowboarding. I've still boarded a lot better than that. But to overcome that personally in that situation, um, I was really able to, to those situations, they reveal where your identity is. When you look to what you're, what you're responding to around you and how you're gonna react in those situations. We need to be our best and that sort of outlook, looking at things as an opportunity is really a big way to do that. Hey guys, doing you off the quiet? Everybody good?

Speaker 1:          16:05          Um, so the next thing I want to touch on, um, is we need to have a healthy idea of success. If you want to thrive in a performance culture, that's something that you're going to have to work out. What does success look like to you? Um, you know, honestly, that's what I, that's what I set out to do with my book. Um, I wanted to help people define success in a healthy way. Um, as you can gather, my idea of success doesn't necessarily isn't confined to just winning. If I were to say what my personal definition of it is, I want to be able to look back at my journey and say I was really faithful with the opportunities that were in front of me and I didn't let one go by. And I also asked myself if I was growing, if those two things are happening in my life, if I made the most of my opportunities and I had some, some measure of growth, honestly that's, that's more successful than you could ever hope to be.

Speaker 1:          17:11          Um, and the last, the last thing on my little mini list here that I want to set you guys up with is, you know, after 20 years of snowboarding, I've come to the conclusion that if your dream only includes you, it's too small of a dream. Um, I found that were, were really thriving in life when other people are involved. Um, you know, whatever culture you live in, whatever dream you're building, if you're the only one in it, it's just too small of a dream. If you build your, if you build yourself, your influence will go away. When you're no longer performing, you yourself. If you only build yourself. We have to figure out how to build things that will outlast our ability to perform. So a few of the just kind of fundamental building blocks, we've got to work out that identity piece. Uh, we have to develop a healthy idea of success and we have to find value and building others.

Speaker 1:          18:12          But the most important thing that I've learned throughout my career has really helped me thrive. Um, I've learned to, to look at the things that no one sees and treat them as more valuable than the things that everyone sees. Um, if it sounds strange and unfamiliar, it's because it is. It's not, it's not natural. It's not our Goto, but the, the world inside of me and the personal victories and the winds that, um, aren't on TV that nobody beyond my friends and family will ever see. Um, those are the things that I value much more than any placement than any metal that I could win. The world inside of you has to be more important than the world around you. If you ever find yourself, um, if you ever feel like life is happening to you, uh, it's a pretty, pretty good indication that you're not living from a value set and making decisions.

Speaker 1:          19:12          You're not living intentionally. You're living reactionary. And, um, we really have to work on this inner world, this idea of success, this identity stuff are our big picture and building others. Um, and we have to learn to treat the things that nobody sees is more important than the ones that are on display. So there's a, um, how many of you guys watched the Olympics is last year? Anybody catch the woman's halfpipe? How's there? Um, you know, this is a, this is the ultimate story of valuing things that no one sees more than what the NBC cameras we'll show you. Um, I set out to do the impossible. Last year. Uh, no woman from the u s had ever made, made five Winter Olympic teams in any sport. And, um, you know, um, I've been the veteran now for, I don't know, 10 years and snowboarding. Uh, uh, the women that I compete with are quite literally half my age.

Speaker 1:          20:20          If I, I remember, I believe it was two summers ago, I was on the podium with two women and if you added up their ages at literally equaled mine and I'm not, I'm 35. It's like I'm not old. I didn't think I was old until I look around and they say the TV shows that I like aren't funny because they have live studio audiences. Um, it's interesting. It happens quick, but you know, I, I knew this would be my last, my last Rodeo. It would be the last time I got the chance to do this. And in January I found myself name until the Olympic team. And um, it was in mammoth, mammoth mountain, California, which was my home resort for a long time. And it was just a sweet when at that final Olympic qualifier, now they, they named the Olympic qualifier or they named the Olympic team. Last qualifier is only two weeks before opening ceremony starts.

Speaker 1:          21:15          So it's not this, you know, you're on the team for a long time. There's literally two weeks and I think the night that you get named to the team, the team manager is calling you to book your plane ticket because they need to pay for it. And um, there's a small contest that falls in between when they named the team and when we go to the Olympics and it's called the x games and a lot of people will, you can look at it two ways and you go look at it as an opportunity or a threat. You could say, hey, this is a great opportunity to go to this big event and get ready for the biggest event. Or I could play it safe and saying, you know, I don't want to get hurt. I should probably protect myself and play it safe, which is something I've never been good at.

Speaker 1:          21:58          And best way to get ready for a big contest is going to a big contest. And so I go to this event and I'm trying to get my snowboarding and where it needs to be. And my first run is pretty good. I think I'm set, it's sitting in second or third place and I'm pushing myself, trying to get my snowboarding to where it needs to be. And in my second run I go down extremely hard. I hit the deck again and bounced to the flat and I actually was, was pretty okay up until that point. But when I hit the flat, um, my left knee was so crumbled, I was so crumbled in my left knee, hit my left shoulder and I heard a loud pop in my left knee. And I remember sitting there with the Mega Moe Follow Cam ski guy in my face with a camera not being able to breathe because I'd knocked the wind out of myself thinking I'm pretty sure I just blew my ACL.

Speaker 1:          22:56          And I'm thinking, I just made the Olympic team and I don't think I'm ever even going to get to go. So I picked myself up. I go down to the bottom of the pipe and a, the u s team, we have all of our doctors and surgeons on hand and I said, Hey, uh, I pretty sure I heard a pop. And I'm pretty sure I just heard my ACL go and my knee and I can feel there's, there's fluid in the back of my, my top of my calf above my boots filling fluid and my joints beginning to stiffen up. And um, so we go there and x Games has their team of orthopedic surgeons and on my own team of Ortho Orthopedic Surgeons and uh, there's a manual test you can do. You guys are familiar to kind of see if you have an end point.

Speaker 1:          23:43          So they, they're doing all the manual tests, multiple high level orthopedic guys are all with testing my knee and they, they think I have an end point. Like we think you have an ACL but we're going to have to wait till Monday and we'll get the MRI and we'll figure out what's going on. Monday comes around and um, the radiologist is looking at the films after my Mri and they can kind of, um, they, they, they know how to read the films and they can kind of get an idea of what's going on in there. So I was asking the guy, I was like, Hey, do you, do you see a, you see my ligaments in there? You know, how's it, how's it look? And he's like, you know, I don't know much about your ligaments, but I do see the tibial plateau fracture that's clear as day.

Speaker 1:          24:23          And I thought, I'm sorry, what? He's like, yeah, the fracture and your Tibia. That's, that's a really clear to see. I don't know if you have ligaments or not, but definitely broke your leg. And uh, I didn't, I didn't see that coming. I, uh, I talked to my surgeon that night and I say, what, what's going on? And he said, you, you have an ACL, um, you have a severe bone bruise and you've cracked your Tibia plateau. Um, the good news is is it's in an area where it's not extremely weight bearing, but you definitely have a fracture. And, uh, so what, what does, what does this name, you know, what are we looking at now? We've got maybe a week and a half until we fly to Korea. So we get my coach on the phone and we look at everything and they say, hey, you know, we think we can get you through this.

Speaker 1:          25:17          And, uh, he said, here's the plan. We brace you up with this giant mechanical leg. We medially load your knee to create a little bit of space in your joint and we load you up on a Wada and Usada approved anti-inflammatories. And, uh, you have to agree not to practice up until send me, uh, qualifiers for the Olympic Games. And I said, hey, I, I think, I think we can do that. Um, but I, I had to ask my coach, I said, hey, if you want to send somebody who perhaps doesn't have a broken leg, I would give up my spot. I understand. I understand that. And he said, no, I would always bet on you, you know, and so I have the most incredible support team. Um, and I put full faith and full trust in them. And I flew to my fifth Olympic Fifth Olympics with a fractured Tibia.

Speaker 1:          26:17          I remember I was late for my plane, actually in San Francisco and I was trying to get to the plane quickly and I couldn't even run, walk. It was excruciating. And I'm thinking, what am I doing? I got to Korea, we gradually got me in the gym. Um, I didn't practice for the entire event. I think I took three runs in the halfpipe before qualifiers, qualifiers came around and I just barely snuck in there cause I mean every half pipes, so different. Um, and I'm honestly learning to ride with the mechanical leg sort of brace was very new and very challenging for me. Um, and I snuck in there, they took 12 people in the finals and I qualified in 11th. You know, it was not my best snowboarding, but I made it. Yeah. And um, I was honestly believe in the dream. Again, at this point I was thinking, Gosh, I've overcome so much.

Speaker 1:          27:13          I totally, I totally want that fairy tale ending. I want that. I want that metal. I want one more, kind of just a fairy tale ending. I wanted to finish well and um, I can honestly say the day of Finals, anti-inflammatory pills, uh, adrenaline, whatever it was, I can honestly say my injury did not affect my performance that day. I, I rode lights out as the kids say out of my mind and I rode, I rode so well. I put down three runs that were perfect in my mind. I could have dealt with less tears and more practice, but my performance said day, um, it was as good as it could have been. I put down some of my best runs at my fifth Olympic Games and, um, I came so far, overcame so much, and I was waiting for my final score to pop up and I didn't see the letter or the number one, two or three, but I saw the number for pop up and I would remain in fourth.

Speaker 1:          28:30          Um, keeping my Olympic streak alive to never worse than fourth, which is pretty good. But a fourth, uh, you only get your participation medal from the Olympics, which is probably controversial in itself, just patient metals. Um, but I didn't get on that podium and I remember standing there and I had a microphone put it in my face and in front of millions and millions of people, I was asked for a reason why this didn't work out, what happened, Kelly, what went wrong. And I had every opportunity to find a reason why I actually had a good reason why I'm I, yeah. Ps, I broke my leg two weeks ago. Um, but you know, what happened? The world inside of being popped to the surface and I was able to respect the people I was competing with. I was able to respect the judging and the formats. I was able to keep my integrity and keep my honor and the world inside of me proved to be much bigger. The world that I was in at that time. Um,

Speaker 1:          29:48          you know, people always ask me what one of my Olympic medals, which I, I brought with me today, I'll, I'll let you guys all check them out at the end. Um, you know, which one of your Olympic medals means the most to you. And I've really found that they're very prestigious, but it's what they represent that gives them value and you value things based off of what they cost you. Um, you know, some of these metals are more expensive then, um, perhaps the one, when I was 18, you know, uh, I won Olympic gold in Salt Lake City when I was 18 years old. And it's a, it's easy being a rookie. No expectation and pressure. Um, Russia I would say is probably my favorite metal because I know what it costs me. It was so expensive. It took everything that I had. You know, my, my idea of a fairy tale ending was one more shot at that Olympic podium, but I think standing upright in the face of loss and the face of, um, disappointment was perhaps the most valuable end than I ever could have had.

Speaker 1:          31:03          And that moment was much more costly. Keeping your integrity costs a lot. Sometimes you don't find it and very fun situations often. Um, but I'm beginning to see that perhaps I should view that experience differently because of the success and the, when that actually happened on the inside of me that people wouldn't say wasn't necessarily successful. No one knew, knew what I overcame that day. Um, you know, at the end of the event I went, I went home and I had hundreds of text messages and voicemails and emails and, um, I kind of just blurry eyed, stared at my phone and there was one message that popped up that caught my attention and I think speaks to the value of what actually happened that day. It's from one of my, uh, my longtime manager who I've been with since I was 15 years old and he had watched, he'd watched the event, um, on TV with his son and he wrote me this email I'm going to read to you.

Speaker 1:          32:17          He said, congratulations on an amazing finals. If you've taught me one thing, it's that we're fools to allow the judgment of others to influence our own appreciation of performance. This seems especially true today, having seen each of your Olympic runs over your long career. I can say this with some of your best work, you started strong. Yes, strategically contained, pushed it further in the second and under the greatest pressure, crushed it in the third and reminds me of Turino where you did more for women's snowboarding than most gold medal performances combined your enjoy listening to Todd Richards commentary about what he thought about your run. I saw your interview after the event with Tina Dixon. I could see and feel your frustration and disappointment, but your maturity and perspective prevailed and you showed class and composure that few athletes could muster. Benny who is a son who is now 14 was watching with me and he asked me, dad, how can she be so calm and nice after that? I smiled when he asked me

Speaker 1:          33:19          when he asked me that through five Olympics. Kelly, you've managed to find so many ways in addition to winning and metals to inspire people and we better than they could have previously imagined. And as much as I know you want it to win and I wanted you to win as a parent would, it's much more precious and opportunity to discover a moment of such magnitude. And as an athlete have such profound talent and historical significance to demonstrate the values you embody. There will be many metals awarded over these Olympics, but I know Benny would have asked me that question, had you not thrown down the runs you did, been dealt, the scores you received and handled that the way you did. And in terms of inspiration, it's moments like that that can make a huge difference in a kid's life and in the world. I'm so proud of you, Kelly, what you've done, who you are and how you've lived your life and I've been a privileged to be part of it. And the effect you have on people transcends results metals and transcends snowboarding. I can't wait to see how you inspire people outside of the halfpipe whenever that may be. And I promise you that I'll support you in those efforts however I can for as long as I can.

Speaker 1:          34:29          So we measure success based off of what color metal we get and we don't always place a value on things like this. That was the message that I needed to hear when I went home. Heartbreak, heartbroken that day. Realizing that there's so much more than just performance. Um, it wasn't something everyone saw, but perhaps it's more valuable than a million gold medals could ever be. We have to build things that outlast our ability. Perform to perform.

Speaker 2:          35:04          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:04          My life is a testament to going after a dream. We're supposed to go after all that's in our hearts with an hit all of our potential. And it's not going to be all rainbows and butterflies all the time. There's going to be a lot of hard days, but it should be enjoyable. I think. We think everything should always be fun. And, um, people are also here what I do for a living and they say, well, I must be really fun. And I'm like, it is really fun. Um, and a lot of people, especially professional athletes are like, why do you do it? And you're like, it's so fun. Like, I'm sorry. It's like, spoiler alert. It's not always going to be fun. What? It should be enjoyable. And if you can work out how to not be defined by what you do, how to build others up, how to define success in a healthy way, and how to value the things that no one sees more than the things that are on display.

Speaker 1:          36:00          Um, you will have a successful career and there's going to be a lot of growth. You're going to be thriving and you're going to be enjoying what you do. Um, you know, for me as a, as a snowboarder, I've had a very long career and I've had more success than anyone could ever dream when I was 14. I've had more success than I ever began to dream about. Um, and I'm so thankful and it's been such a privilege. Um, and if it was about accomplishing things, if it was about winning things, I honestly, I probably should have stopped a long time ago. You have to figure out how to make what you do. More than that, you have to figure out how to develop something inside of you that will sustain you no matter what environment. And you go into, um, you know, burnout doesn't come from too much activity. If anybody should be burned out, it should be me. I've done a million snowboarding contest. It really comes from unmet expectations. And so if you can spend time developing that inner world, you're going to be able to go into any world and hit your potential and be your best and enjoy it and always remember that if your dream only includes you, it's just too small of a dream. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          37:28          I was curious at the beginning, you said you are training Oise for basically 30 seconds of a halfpipe run and I'm curious how you go about sort of maintaining that mindset of training when the actual live performance. It seems like to me it seems like it's always like so far away and such an uplifting time.

Speaker 1:          37:47          You know, I think you need to have an idea of what you want to accomplish regardless of what's going on around you. Um, as I would approach Neil Olympics, I knew where my snowboarding was going to need to be. I think it's easy to get caught up in looking around to what, um, my fellow competitors were doing. Um, but if you can figure out what it is you want to accomplish, um, it's something that you can work on regardless of what's going on around you. So it's, um, you know, it may look like what we do is kind of like, oh my goodness, I just tried this trick today. I think it took me, I think it took me seven years, the first land at 10 80. So it's very much in the scope of what you want to and no matter what you accomplish, and especially in snowboarding, like you're never the best and there isn't a day that goes by that I'm not challenged. And I think that's what kept me motivated is I, I enjoyed the challenge. I enjoyed constantly learning things. And if I wasn't learning new things, I probably would've been in the game for as long as I was.

Speaker 5:          38:55          Hi, I'm so thematic to everything you've been able to discuss today. Did you ever have a situation in your career where you felt disconnected from the things that brought you and kept you in the sport and if so, how did you recognize it? Disconnect? How did you identify that was happening?

Speaker 1:          39:09          I talk about a lot of these concepts and a lot of things that have sustained me. I mean, goodness, I like, I wrote a book about it, but there's, you just never arrive in life and there's so many times where I have to be willing to examine my heart in situations where I maybe didn't find my inner world as well developed as I hoped were. Maybe jealousy popped up. Maybe I want it to be right. Maybe I want to have an excuse and the way that I was able to really, you have to be okay not having it all together. You just, you never master it. You have to be willing to be a work in progress. And when I found myself maybe not operating the way that I wanted to, maybe on a feeling really threatened all of the sudden, and I'm like, wow, I thought I had that figured out.

Speaker 1:          40:01          I thought I looked at everything as an opportunity and I, I was killing it. Um, I actually really pulled on other people. So being in community and allowing people into your process was really, really healthy. Um, I think we have the idea, especially in sports where, I mean in, in all of culture, we, we champion a self made millionaires. We say when you're isolated, when you came from nothing and now you're something, um, I think you can be successful, but it's not very fulfilling doing it that way. Um, and letting people in behind every great athlete is a team of great people. Um, there's no self made millionaires in the athletic world. And every time that I failed, messed up felt like I learned this lesson long ago, but I was relearning it for the hundredth time. Um, it was my coaches and it was people who believed in me. Um, on the days that I didn't believe in myself.

Speaker 5:          40:59          So first of all, thanks for coming in, fixing things or to talk. Um, my question is like, you know, now looking back, you know, after having gone for your career, if you were to look back and talk to the 14 year old you who were, was dreaming at the time and how things have changed since then, what type of advice and recommendation would you give them but you didn't necessarily have back then?

Speaker 1:          41:19          Honestly, the, the most important thing that I've ever learned in my snowboarding careers at identity thing, um, I think not a lot of people get to reach the top of something. Most of the time, life is a journey and all of a sudden I was 18 years old and I won the, I won the x games, the Olympics in the u s open all in the same season. I'd accomplished everything I ever wanted to do. And I just had equated that success meant that I was fulfilled. And at a really young age, I had to figure that out. I was like, wow, this isn't what life's about. My life is not complete because I accomplished a list of to do's. I had to develop a strong sense of self outside of that. And in the sports world you just see it so plainly, there's such a level of insecurity and performance culture that is just unsettling. And so when I look at the young girl says, that's the number one thing that I say young athletes, hey you got to figure this part out before you can navigate this really well. Cause it just, it just makes it, um, it just doesn't make it fun when it, there's so much more freedom and so much more enjoyment when you can sort that identity piece out.

Speaker 6:          42:46          Uh, three mountains to snowboard. What'd you say? Oh, what's your top three months in system board?

Speaker 1:          42:53          Um, I lived in mammoth California forever and I love that resort. They do a great job kind of maintaining their terrain parks and then they get like, um, 300 days of Sun. And when it's not sunny it's just nuking snow. Um, that's a great mountain. Snow mass in Colorado was really fun. If you like the groomers, really top notch groomers there. Um, and then my favorite destination to go snowboarding would be Japan, Hokkaido, north island. Japan is always my number one pick. He ever get the opportunity to go there. I would highly recommend it.

Speaker 6:          43:35          Thanks so much for couple of Kelly. I'm curious just on training routines, training for an Olympics, what did a typical day look like and how did that change over the course of your career?

Speaker 1:          43:45          Yeah, that's a great question. Um, well, like I referenced before, Snow Morning Really wasn't a sport when I started and um, there's so much kind of lifestyle and um, easygoingness attached to it. And I remember in 2010 I had been to three Olympic Games, I had two Olympic metals and the US snowboard team said, hey, would you like to come in for fitness testing? Like it just wasn't even on our radar before then. We're not like real athletes, you know? And so, um, I was like, yeah, sure, that sounds good. I'll, I could, you know, do some high jumps for ya or whatever. And I did it. And I was like, Hey, what, what do I, what am I results mean? And I'm my trainer to this day, still bring this up. Every once in a while she says, wow, you are really mentally, it must be really mentally strong.

Speaker 1:          44:39          And I was like, wait, it's a fitness test. Like that's like telling someone they have a nice personality. You're like, you're, you're beautiful on the inside, you know? And I'm like, seriously? And then she was like, yeah, like it's pretty incredible. We've been able to accomplish. And I'm like, what? And hence all this like inner personal inner world development, you know? Um, but I could have either been really offended or looked at it as an opportunity. And I said, you know what? This is an untapped resource. So in 2010 and I said, hey, let's figure out what it looks like to train a snowboarder. We don't even know. There's no data. We know how to train baseball players and football players and, but we don't know what does it look like for ideal body comps in different things. So we, I could, I was like, I give you four years and in those four years when I was mentioning like kind of my peak of my year of my career, um, I went up to winning 86% of the contest I entered and my consistency and my durability went through the roof.

Speaker 1:          45:37          And, um, I was the only one on the US team and four year span who didn't require surgery and I was older than everybody and I was just like, oh my goodness, this is a incredible resource. And so, um, that was a big part of the second part of my career. And heading into this last Olympics, I think I was logging 22 to 24 hours of dry land training week and it's a lot of, we lightened lien is what we would train for. We'd have two days of cardio. Um, we'd have two days of strength training, three days of core, um, and they would kind of overlap over a six day span with one day off. So lightened lean, a lot of stability stuff, lot of body weight stuff. Um, I can get more into detail after it, but it's, it's kind of a work in progress.

Speaker 1:          46:27          And we would profile my body comps when I would perform really well and we'd start to discover, okay, so I'm performing my best on my body, looks like this. Okay. Let, that's our target like we were starting from scratch. So thanks for coming. Thanks for everything you've done for this board. Um, my question is being a woman snowboarder, um, was there a point where you realize that you are not only a champion for this snowboarding asset sport as a whole but for women borders and then becoming a household name as a woman athlete? Um, yeah, you know, in snowboarding there is not, um, the different size ball that we play with. We are, we're on the same kind of venue as the guys. And, uh, when, when I was growing up, I was one girl kind of in a pack of guys. And um, I got on the u s team and I found kind of a crew of girls to ride with.

Speaker 1:          47:27          And, um, there was people who went before me that really inspired me and that I looked up to a, I remember waiting in line to get people's autographs at the u s open. And then I found myself having little kids waiting in line to get autographs at the u s open when I was 18. And I thought, Gosh, I'm in a position to be able to inspire people. Um, and that's kind of how I looked at it. I thought I have a responsibility and an opportunity to, to impact people in a positive way. And I just looked at it as a privilege and, um, I tried to do my best knowing that, um, I really had a lot of influence and, um, you know, there's not a ton of, I think at Burton we have a woman CEO and she's been an advocate for women and for everything from equal prize money to, um, women in leadership at the company, uh, for a very long time.

Speaker 1:          48:27          And so we didn't see it as a huge kind of contrast between the men and women because I think I was so close to it and our leadership was always empowering to women. It just kind of seemed natural and normal. When I kind of grew up a bit and saw other sports, I realized how unique snowboarding actually was. Um, so I just tried to, to make sure that I was always, uh, I guess the same person too. I think anytime you're in a place of influence, you want, you want to be the same person that you are when you're winning or losing at the top of the hill, at the bottom of the hill when you're home with your friends and when you're with your family. And so I strive to live a life of consistency, um, and authenticity because I think that's a huge attribute and snowboarding that we have a huge value for. And, um, I think it's, it's been a cool journey to see the sport grow, especially with the young women.

Speaker 4:          49:20          Again, sort of like a question about how you deal with challenges and like when you take these massive slams, you touched on this a little bit, but was wondering if you could go to a little bit more detail about what do you really thinking about, like how do you actually get yourself to like come over that hurdle right then and get yourself up and go again?

Speaker 1:          49:44          Um, my coach has a saying, uh, it's, uh, if it was easy everybody would be doing it. And um, I heard that often at the top of the pipe when I was discouraged. Um, you know, I kind of always had an idea that nothing was impossible and I wouldn't let my circumstances decide things for me. So even when I did take those big crashes, when I did take those big falls, it was a mix of, of personal drive and then people believing in me and speaking into me as well. It was those coaches, it was those friends. It was the people being willing to ask for help and not have it together all the time and being willing to be challenged and fail to know that eventually you, uh, what does it, uh, Thomas Edison, you know, we just learned a bunch of ways not to make a light bulb, you know, using all those failures as like, wow though in one way not to do it, I guess I should try again.

Speaker 1:          50:48          And you want to stay, you know, snowboarding especially it's, it's a high impact sport and you want to stay within your ability level when you take this and you want to be realistic. And so, you know, in document my coaches do you think deserves a realistic trick for me to work on and what kind of steps am I going to need to take to get there? And not everything's instant. Um, and I think, you know, getting strong enough to take those risks, especially as I got older in my career was really helpful as well. So I knew if it didn't go well, most likely I would bounce. Hopefully I would bounce. I was kind of, my plan was a good plan or not.

Speaker 1:          51:34          Was there a specific trick or anything else that made you more nervous than usual before run or an event? Um, typically your most difficult run or you're your most difficult trick is the one you think about, but it's kind of a catch 22 because, um, you really can only focus on one thing at a time. I remember we had a sports psychologist come by our team one time and he gave us two tennis balls. One guy was supposed to throw it up and down really quickly and the other one was supposed to be thrown across the room and we were told to keep track of how many times each tennis ball was thrown. After about 20 seconds, he said, would you come up with, and we're like, ah, we all lost count. And I said, that's the point. And you can't focus on two things at the same time.

Speaker 1:          52:20          Um, and my 10 80 was probably my hardest trick. But if I was thinking about doing a 10 80 on my third hit when I dropped in for my first hit guarantee you I would fall first, hit on a straighter. So you know, you want to anticipate those things, but by the time you get to those events, by the time you get to the Olympics, like you should have it figured out. Those are muscle memory things. It's not something that they can be intimidating, but it's not going to be something you're going to have to think your way through. Your body knows what to do by that time. And it was really a battle to, um, really just stay on the task at hand or in the moment. Uh, I remember I was hiking up, one of my friends that I snowboard with, I snowboarded with for a long time.

Speaker 1:          53:13          She had the same coach and she was talking through her run with Ricky and my coach. And it's, it's gonna look like this. I've got to do this, I've got to do this. And then I've got to look here on this, on this. Uh, I've got to be careful to keep my speed and that, and I'm like, listen to her. Like, Whoa, that's a lot. And Rick, he looks at me and he says, Hey, what are you going to do kid? I said, I'm going to do a good drop in. And they just looked at me and they just laughed at like, seriously? That's your plan. I'm like, totally, everything else is, I know how to do it. I just have to make sure I get in there. And so it's a fine line between being prepared and then in the moment, actually letting your body know what it knows how to do. Thanks so much Kelly. Thank you very much guys. Another round of applause. Maybe.
