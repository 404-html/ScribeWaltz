Speaker 1:          00:06          So we're, we're thrilled this afternoon to welcome Dr. Rose Mcdermott to the talks at Google program. Now, it's no question that politics is on the forefront of people's minds these days. Um, Doctor Mcdermott a discusses her latest findings from our research and the effects of biology on political attitudes, preferences and behavior. Please join me in welcoming. I'm rose to Google. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:31          Thank you very much for taking your time out to come and, um, uh, have our chat today about genetics and politics. And, um, I was just mentioning to Margaret Levy, the director of the center that the theatrical piece of the whole election thing has been really dramatic. I really didn't know which part of it to pay attention to yesterday. So, um, uh, we'll leave lots of time to chat about it. But, um, what I want to do is run through a little bit of the work that we've been doing on the genetic foundations of politics and why that's interesting and different and important is that for the last 50 or so years, really since the start of people investigating political ideology from the perspective of political science, the notion has always been that, um, these things are socialized, that you learn them at the feet of your parents, that you are, you know, at the knee of your father and you love your father and your father's a Republican.

Speaker 2:          01:28          And so then you come to love the Republican Party. So it has some kind of affective part and emotional part, but also a part that's really about your education and your family experience, but not something that's instantiated in any kind of biological sense. Um, and in the last decade or so myself and concert with my primary collaborator on this work, Pita Tommy, who's at Penn state and a few other people have been working to start to investigate the extent to which some of these questions of political ideology may actually be instantiated, uh, biologically and genetically. Um, and this work really a dates to a seminal piece that Nick Martin and Linda Neves did in 1986 in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. And Linden is a very interesting guy. He's a, um, he's an ordained minister in the Anglican Church, but he's also the father of behavior genetics and a lot of really important ways. Um, and what happened up until that time is that everybody looking at genetics was really looking at things like disease processes and social attitudes was always the control.

Speaker 2:          02:34          It was the thing that everybody knew. It had nothing to do with genetics and nothing to do with biology. And what they were able to show in this original piece is that it's not the control that actually you see bigger effects on some of the social and political attitudes. Then you even do on disease processes. So how you do these studies with twins, right? So you look at the difference between identical twins and fraternal twins and identical twins are basically same person genetically that just happened to be born in two different bodies. And fraternal twins are like any other sibling set. It's just that they're born at the same time. And because of the mathematical way you can traction that you can analyze the extent to which these attitudes, um, our genetic, I'm not just attitudes, but social behaviors, disease processes, whatever it is, shared family and shared family or things that you share, not just your family, but education and other kinds of social processes and unique environment, which is the thing that only happens to you.

Speaker 2:          03:31          What's important about unique environment though is that some of those processes are also biological. So for example, the in utero bath in which you just state is a unique environment. It's got some biological elements to it, but it only happens to you of course, unless you're a twin. So when you look at this, um, the way that this is measured, and this is what this graph is here is the Wilson Patterson scale and it looks, it's the way that genetics as opposed to political science, people look at attitudes and it just has a bunch of words, different topics, the draft, you know, gun control, things like that. And people just respond, yes, no, or I don't know, which is immediate. Usually there's about a 38 items and you can then traction what percentage of them can be attributable to genetic versus environmental factors. And when they originally did this work in [inaudible] 86, almost half of the contribution to people's attitudes came from these additive genetic factors.

Speaker 2:          04:29          So when later on, some number of years later when Peta, Tommy and I started looking at this, we broke it up not just by overall liberal and conservatism, which is how the original work was done, but to actually look at specific things from political party identification to political knowledge and so on. And in this graph you can see the blue part is the part that's genetic. That green part is the part that's kind of unique environment. Uh, the orange part is the sort of shared environment and you can see it really differs by per particular topic. Um, one of the interesting things about this is what it shows is that political ideology, like, you know, um, liberal to conservative in a world scale. Think about it. Communists versus fascists, not just Democrat and Republican, um, is highly genetic. It's got a very large genetic contribution. Whereas political party identification, Republican, Democrat actually has very low genetic contribution.

Speaker 2:          05:26          And we can talk about um, uh, why and how that works in and how it's different if you're interested, uh, in the Q and. A. So the question becomes, is there a real difference between not just people but politicians on the right and the left. And so I just want to have you take a look at some of these images because I fundamentally believe that some of the differences are embodied that they actually have sort of physical elements. So, um, and you can see some of them in the expressions that typical, these are all the official, uh, photographs that people have. So in the United Kingdom, this is Theresa May on the left, Boris Johnson on the right, you can see in France Marine Le Pen who may or may not win the French elections on the right. Depends I guess on the Russian hacking. Um, and uh, uh, Halon two's has the lowest approval rating ever in the history of the French republic on the left.

Speaker 2:          06:21          And of course our classic last series of elections. You can see how those things work. Um, so there's some, there's different ways in which you can measure physical end genetic contributions. Obviously I've shown you, I described a bit about how that happens genetically in how you look at it at twins, but there's other ways you can look at it as well. Um, this study which was done by Daren Schriber when he was at San Diego, um, was trying to look at the way in which, um, MRI technology and looking at brain activation patterns can help you distinguish people on the right and people on the left. What was interesting about this study is that the gold standard in political science about telling whether somebody is a Democrat or Republican is just to ask them, right? Like are you on the right or are you on the left?

Speaker 2:          07:05          And then they tell you and then you see whether or not they vote consistently. With that, using this MRI technology, he was actually better able to predict how people would vote then, then telling him. And what was particularly interesting is that people on the left had a lot of activation in a part of the brain that you see here, which is the insula that's associated, uh, with uh, feelings of disgust and people on the right had a lot of activation in the Amygdala, which is associated with feelings of fear, um, by and large emotional activation in general, but fear in particular. So another way you can measure them is with skin conductance response. This is actually Matt Hibbings hand. This is from a series of experiments that John Hibbing did in Nebraska using physiological measures. And what you can see with what they do here in these studies is they show reactivity to particular images.

Speaker 2:          07:56          I'll show you what those images look like in a second, but you can show that people who are on the right have much more activation to threatening stimuli. And that's basically what you see here. So what is threatening stimuli look like? Oh, sorry, this, this is what threatening stimuli it looks like, right? So you can see, and there's positive images too. You can see they show images of like bunnies in the fields and you know, little kids, um, and flowers and kittens and things like that, but also quite threatening stimuli. And what you can do using eye tracking technology and we've been doing that is to look at the ways in which people look at different parts of these images. Now the reason that is interesting and important is that a lot of discussion about politics is about how, okay, we have the same experience but we differ in our interpretation of it.

Speaker 2:          08:47          And with the eye tracking technology shows you is that, that's not entirely the case. We may differ in our interpretation, but we also differ in what we experienced perceptually. So what we pay attention to as somebody on the right or as somebody on the left is literally different. And I'd like to show you some examples of that. So what you see here, the red dots are where on average these are um, you know, aggregated findings. What people on the right are paying attention to. And the blue ones are what people on the left are paying attention to. Um, what you see here is that what people on the right are paying attention to is what the spider, they're paying attention to the threat they're paying attention to. You know what the concern is, whereas differentially people on the left are paying attention to eyes. Liberals love eyes.

Speaker 2:          09:32          If you ever do eye tracking technology, what liberals are paying attention to our eyes, they really want to know what people are feeling and the best way to know what, how people are feeling. You think it's the mouth, it's not the mouth, it's the eyes. So that's what's going on here. And you can do it across many domains. It doesn't just have to do with fear and threat domains. You can also do it with sexual domains. So you can see here what I love about this is liberals are all paying attention to the jewelry and the hair, right? Like, oh, I sort of like that necklace and she, how does she do her hair? Right? And what are the people on the right paying attention to the boobs and the lick la lip lock, right? Like, it's all about, um, a particular kind of, um, sexual, um, whether you want to construct it as threat or opportunity, you know, however it is, there's really different ways in which they're paying attention.

Speaker 2:          10:19          So it's not just that people are differing in their interpretation, they're actually experiencing different, um, uh, perceptual realities both visually and auditorily. You can show this with, uh, we've done experiments where we've also had different narrations associated with these stories and you get people responding to different parts of what they hear as well. Um, and there's interesting and important sex differences. Men tend to respond much more to the visual part in women, much more to the auditory part. So, um, there's other differences as well as ideological ones. So, um, this shows you that there can be political, um, uh, associations with this. The darker colors are where people are spending more time looking at the image. So this is a man, he's got a cane, obviously the cops and the gun, right? So what happens is that conservatives tend to pay much more attention to symbols of authority, the badge of the gun, things like that.

Speaker 2:          11:16          Whereas the liberals are, again, not only paying attention to the eyes, but if you look at it, they're also paying much more attention to the cane, right? So they're, they're literally literally experiencing different aspects of these images. When you cross these images with particular kinds of political attitudes and behavior, you can see that the kinds of things people are paying attention to actually affects or is affected by or most likely both, um, their attitudes around certain things. So this image is actually, you can't see the back part of the image, but these are guys around a coffin. So they're looking at a coffin. And as I mentioned, we had these different stories, these different auditory stories and in one story we told them that this person had died in combat and another story we told them that the person had been a looter who had been shot that had been looting a important archaeological treasures.

Speaker 2:          12:10          And you can see that between liberals and conservatives, it doesn't really affect how much time they spend looking at this part of the image of people saluting it, whether or not you know how the story is, but it really does affect the Luder if you tell them that there are Luder, right? So if you tell them they died in combat, both liberals and conservatives respond similarly. If you say it's a looter, the conservatives are going to be spending much more time looking at that part of the image of the solute than the liberals are. You can also cross it the other way with the image I just showed you of the cops with the man on the ground where you can describe it as either a beat down or an arrest. And again, you get different levels of how much time people are spending looking at the cane. Um, depending on what kind of story you tell.

Speaker 3:          12:57          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          12:57          Uh, this also happens as I mentioned with sex differences. You can see male versus female spending time looking at the necklace, uh, in the, in the Madonna and Britney Spears one. But this other image which is a woman actually, um, somebody dressed in combat fatigues holding an injured child and you can see that men and women are spending different times looking at the child's face versus a child's body as well. Um, so you can, you can look at these things both from the perspective of ideology, sex differences. You could do it any way you want. You can do it with religion or any other kind of identity that you want. These things then also predict policy preferences. So when you look, have people look at images of soldiers saluting a flag and then ask questions about did the u s make a mistake about sending troops into Iraq?

Speaker 2:          13:45          You can actually predict their response based on how much time they spend looking at the flag versus how much time they spend looking at other parts of the image. So that those spending much more time looking at the flag are those who are going to say, no, we didn't. We didn't make a mistake going into Iraq. And the other image, you can also look at, ask people about whether or not they think we're gonna this was done a few years ago before I'm the u s pulled out of Iraq, um, candy. Or will they win the war in Iraq? And depending on how much time they spend looking at the tanks as opposed to looking at the sheep, you can actually predict, again, whether or not they think victory is going to be possible. So these are various ways in which you can measure and look at, um, uh, biological and physiological contributions to, um, uh, political ideology. But then the question becomes a web part of it is genetic.

Speaker 3:          14:42          Okay.

Speaker 2:          14:43          So one of the things that drives me crazy when I watched the news is that they're always talking about how, uh, researchers find the liberal gene or the gene or the gene for fear or the gene for blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And what's important to understand is that, um, there is no such thing, right? There's never going to be a gene for these are very, very complex processes. They involve many, many, many genetic factors in interaction with environmental factors and um, they happen across developmental pathways based on like what happened to you as a kid, what happened to you in the moment. And so it's never going to be that there's a gene for it's much more complicated. And if I have one take home message, that's it. But if we have, um, if in fact the story I'm telling you based on the data I have is true and a very large percentage of our political ideology is heritable, then the most important choice you make and your children in determining your children's a political ideology is your choice of mate.

Speaker 2:          15:42          So that brings us back to how mating actually contributes to the development and polarization of politics over time. And that's what I want to spend a little bit of time talking about before having a conversation with you. So this is obviously a very complicated slide, but I just wanted to sh to show that there's many things that contribute to an outcome. It's not right a gene for, but we have developmental issues, we have physiological issues, we have lots of other things going on in development. But what I'm going to have pay attention to right now is this issue of individual DNA. How your individual Dna from your parents meeting and mating determines not only you, but how your individual meeting may affect your children's political ideology and other characteristics. So the classic work on mate selection, which again was done from a, you know, a socialization perspective by David Buss in Seventies.

Speaker 2:          16:35          I'm looked at as people, basically what the characteristics were that, um, and these were done in strait population's, remember this was done in the seventies before. Um, there was quite as much attention to homosexual meeting, but this was really about heterosexual meeting because, um, we were really looking at, at children. So, um, when he looked at them, you can see there's a lot of overlap between what males and females say that they want. Um, the ones in Italics are the ones where it's statistically different in how important those characteristics are to them. Although this was done in the 70s, recent studies are very, very, very similar with one exception, which is that now men really care a lot more about how much money their female counterparts make. So that's becomes a much more important than physical attractiveness and recent studies, uh, in, um, male meeting. So that's the only part in which is really significantly different than it was in the 70s.

Speaker 2:          17:28          So one of the studies we did is we went through an online dating site. I actually did this myself. I can't say what the site was, but I can say it was the single most depressing thing I've ever done in my life. And, um, we took 313 zip codes and we took the first five men in the first five women. And, um, we looked at how their profiles were. So what did they say they care about? Did they say they care about politics? Um, did they say that it mattered and so on. And what we found is that people are much more likely to say that they were fat then, that they had a political preference. Right? So this is the woody Allen line about how you're trying to double your chances for a date on a Saturday night. By not saying I'm only going to date a Republican, or I'm only gonna date, you know, a Democrat or whatever it happens to be.

Speaker 2:          18:11          But the reason that's important is that people are wrong about what matters in their meat choices. So they think that what matters is that they share interests like going to the movies or going to the beach. But if you look at what happens in longterm mating, what holds people together, that's not it. So then the question becomes, is it really about politics? And I want to show you some data about this. People think that what happens is that over time people converge that they're starting to become more similar in politics over time. And in fact, that's not the case. What you get is as sortation not convergence there, they're meeting and meeting and matching up with the people who share their political ideology. They're not becoming more similar over time. And we know this from longterm studies, these look at people before marriage and about 10 years after marriage.

Speaker 2:          18:58          And you can see that the statistical associations don't change very much. What does change is how you look. So people start to look much more like their spouses. So if you have pictures of people when they get married and then 10 years later and you have independent coders, they'll say at the beginning, you know, oh, these people don't look at all alike. And then 10 years later they'll say, these people are brother and sister. They're there physically related. They're not spouses. And it's because you mimic each other's facial expression. It changes the way that the blood flow works in your face. And you start to look alike. So don't marry somebody you don't find attractive because you look like them, uh, over time. Um, so it's not actually the case that you have a sortation, you have this convergence. So the question is if you, if you don't know that you're looking for somebody in the same politics, right?

Speaker 2:          19:50          You think that what you're looking for is somebody who likes movies that you like, but in fact the people that you're actually marrying as opposed to dating, but actually marrying and having kids with are the same than what's happening. It's not actually an issue of selection. It's an issue of d selection. Your d selecting the people who don't share your basic fundamental political values. When you look at the things that people who are in longterm marriages actually correlate with anything more than a random chance, there's only three things. Religion, which we know is actually him off lists on socialization. So what I mean by that is it is a socialized thing where you're basically meeting and marrying people in your same social network of six, share your same religious orientation, whether that's being an atheist or whether it's being a Jewish, whether it's being a Muslim, whatever it is, politics and drinking frequency, whether you're a teetotaler, whether you're an alcoholic, everything else, all the things that you think matter, whether it's you know, your ideal body type, how much people sleep, extroversion, introversion, it's less than would be expected by tossing a coin.

Speaker 2:          20:56          And these are really longterm marriages, right? 30 years or more. There's one exception to this and that has to do with race. This is of course an American sample. And so it's hard to say whether or not this is true outside race, but what you do get is that conservatives are much less likely to be willing to marry outside their race. And what's really driving this is conservative white men. So conservative white men really don't like to marry outside their race. And that's really what's driving this. But that's the one exception to this, uh, earlier. Larger generalization. Now from an evolutionary standpoint, if you think that some of this is genetically instantiated, and I believe that the data suggests that, well it doesn't just suggests that, but really demonstrates that what happens is that over many generations you would expect more political polarization. And by that I mean as liberals, Mary Liberals, as Conservatives and Mary conservatives, they're much more likely to have children have those same dispositions.

Speaker 2:          21:54          Now a hundred years ago, it didn't matter so much because what was happening then is that we're wealthy men were marrying beautiful women on average. So the political ideology of the woman wasn't as important to the meat choice. But now as marriage has become a luxury good, right? Marriage is actually one of those things that's more bifurcated by class now, then, um, money was by race in the 1950s. So there's two sets of people, right? There's people who get married, have kids engage in the intergenerational transfer of wealth, and then there's people who have kids never get married and never have any wealth to pass along to their children. But those who actually get married and have children in this kind of way, in this sort of, um, you know, uh, bifurcated way, you're getting a pulling apart of ideology, right? You're getting a pulling apart where liberals are marrying liberals, conservatives or Marin conservatives, they're having children who are disproportionally that way cause it's not random anymore.

Speaker 2:          22:52          And so you get increasing polarization. It doesn't take as many generations as you might think. And I think that's why we're seeing at least in part, increasing political polarization over what may have happened in Saint 1950. So as I mentioned, if what's going on is that longterm mates actually select each other based on political ideology. But people don't know that they're doing that, right? Because when they write their online profiles, they don't say, I'm unwilling to marry a Democrat on average. Um, then what's happening is d selection. But if you don't know it, it means it's happening unconsciously. So the question is how is that happening and our solution, our suggestion was that it happened through smell, through pheromones. And that was the experimental tests that we ran on this. What made us think about this was actually running genome wide association tests on political and looking at those aspects of the chromosome that appeared to be most related to political ideology.

Speaker 2:          23:54          So when you do these tests, those that are considered suggestive are those that are like two times 10 to the eighth, whereas those that are considered significant are three times 10 to the eighth. And if you look at those factors that cross those, those thresholds of suggestion or significance with regard to political ideology, every single one in the miss somehow related to olfaction to smell in a disproportionate way that explains a lot, right, explains how it is that people know this automatically, how their d selecting and how they're not conscious about that selection. So we ran a study on this. This is actually done at Harvard, um, and we actually did it not just on em, um, smell, but we also did it on voice and on, um, facial similarity and so on. Um, but our notion was that political ideology probably worked on pheromones very similar to the way that the immune system works on pheromones.

Speaker 2:          24:50          So we know there's a lot of data showing that, for example, people actually, um, find those whose immune system functions differently than there's much, much, much more attractive than those whose ideology. I mean, whose immune system is the same that works through pheromones, not conscious, automatic, but definitely matters because if you have children with someone whose immune system is similar to your own, they're not going to be as protected from as many sets of pathogens as people who are different. So we thought that political ideology work the same way, but in a different sense in that you're attracted to those whose ideologies this is the same rather than people whose ideology is different. So, um, we took 190 people, we took a bunch of studies on personality, politics, lifestyle and so on. Um, and then, um, had the, found a bunch of people who had extreme ideology.

Speaker 2:          25:44          They're liberal or conservative. It's hard in Massachusetts to find extreme conservatives, but we shook some trees and found a few of them and they come into the lab and you give them, you know, fragrance free shampoo and fragrance free, um, you know, soap and everything and you ask them to take a shower with all this stuff. And then they were gauze pads under there, under arms for 24 hours. And you ask them, you know, they could exercise and whatever, but not teed certain kinds of foods, not to wear certain kinds of perfume, not to be around scented candles, not to sleep in a bed with another person or an animal. And they do that for 24 hours for $20, which is unbelievable. Um, but they do do it. Um, and then they come in the next day and they give you these samples. And so then what we do is we take these samples and we have about, you know, an additional hundred 90 people smell those samples.

Speaker 2:          26:32          Um, and then ask them questions about how they feel about these samples. You know, do you think this person is, um, you know, trustworthy? Do you think this person is intelligent? Do you think this person is, you know, um, a kind. And then we asked them, can you get this person's political ideology? And then we ask them, do you find this person attractive? And what's amazing about the results where it came out the way I expect it, which was surprising. Um, and what we found was none of the things about intelligence or respect or any of those kinds of things ended up at all significant. What was absolutely significant is how attractive they found people. So they found those who shared their political ideology much more attractive than those who didn't. But they were wrong about guessing their ideology. So when you said, do you know that, let's say you're a liberal, do you know what this person is completely random in their assessment of whether or not that person is liberal or conservative.

Speaker 2:          27:24          But if you look at whether or not they find that person attractive, you can absolutely predict it back. So it was one of these really funny studies where it's so wacky that no one believed it would work. I wasn't even sure it would work. And so the first day we did, um, my, uh, really amazing statistical guy who's at Harvard, it was like, this isn't going to work. And he opens the first vial and he smells it and he gets sick. Like he's like, oh, I can't do this. Like this study isn't going to work. And I picked it up and I smelled it and I didn't smell thing. And I thought, Ooh. And so I called over the lab manager and I said, Sarah, what do you smell? And she said, I don't smell a thing. She was like, let me get my boyfriend.

Speaker 2:          28:05          So she gets her boyfriend from the back and he smells it and he literally threw up. He was like, that's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard of my life. And I was like, this is really gonna work. And what happened was that those, the person we were smelling was a conservative guy and both of them were liberal guys. And so it was a really different reaction. And the last day of the study was really interesting because, um, I was running all the subjects and this guy came in probably the second to the last person and he said, um, one of your samples is rancid, you know, it's really gone bad, you can't, um, use these samples anymore. And I said, oh, that's really interesting. You know, which one is it gave me the number, you know, 190 ever a time. 190. Thank you very much. He leaves in the next one, the next person who comes in as a young woman and she says, what are you going to do with the vials when you're done?

Speaker 2:          28:58          And I said, I'm going to put them in the freezer and then I'm going to do a molecular analysis of the DNA that's contained in the sweat. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm pretty sure why. Well, you have to for each one. And I did, it was like a right arm and a left arm, right? And I said yes. And she's like, you don't need both of them. You can do an analysis on just one. Right. And I said, yeah, I said, why? She said, can I take one of them home with me? And I was like, no, you can't take one of them home with you. And when I asked her which one it was, it was the exact same one that the guy before had just told me it was rancid. It was 190 right. And again, conservative guy, conservative woman, liberal guy who had come in.

Speaker 2:          29:37          Um, so, well you can see here, and this looks a little backwards. This is how it conservative feels smelling a conservative, how conservative feel smelling a liberal, how men feel, smelling women, how men feel, smelling, sorry. Men feel smelling men. Men feel smelling women while you'll see is women hate the smell of each other, right? Men really kind of liked the smell of each other. Um, conservatives, uh, really like the smell of other conservatives. Liberals like the smell of liberals. Conservatives don't mind. The smell of liberal says quite as much when you do it on voice, what you find is the other asymmetry. So liberals hate the sound of conservative voices more than conservatives hate the sound of liberal voices. So you get some differences on the voices as well. So why does it matter? Is is that, um, attitudes aren't just attitudes, right? Um, spouses, a sword on it.

Speaker 2:          30:31          People pass this onto their children. Um, these differences are partly genetic, but partly environmental. Um, and we differ in the way that we experience these things. And it doesn't just matter for politics, it matters for things that are much more important, much more important, but, but important in wider parts of the world rather than just who runs the Horse, who wins the horse race of the election. And so I want to talk for just a minute about one of those applications, which I'm most interested in, which has to do with processes of violence and how attitudes affect processes of violence. So we see them all over the world, right? Right now the big, the big stories are from Syria, but it's kind of, you know, eternal wherever it happens to be. And you see it play out also in domestic politics, especially regarding things like immigration. Right?

Speaker 2:          31:18          There's violence toward people who may not share your particular political views or share a different ethnicity or a different religion or even a different sex or sexual orientation. So it plays out in many ways. So we did one of these studies where we actually looked at people's dispositional level of fear. That is the extent to which their temperament, their genetic temperament, it makes them more likely to react with fear to particular stimuli than others. And this is, this is different across individuals from a baseline level, meaning some people just have higher levels of dispositional fear to begin with. Then other people do. What you find is that those people who are more fearful, um, are more hostile to immigration. Do object to multiculturalism, don't like the notion of foreign trained doctors want segregation and so on. Um, and so what's actually happening is that the reality is that fearful people are conservative.

Speaker 2:          32:12          It's not the conservative people are fearful, but fearful people, um, you know, become conservative. So the other city we did is we actually looked at the relationship between the propensity for physical aggression and the likelihood of supporting interventionist foreign policy. And making different kinds of decisions on complex, um, moral and political tasks. And I just wanted to show you what this, what the scale looks like. People respond one to six from this is what I'm like to, what I'm not really like. Um, and they're basically physical aspects, you know, you'd like to get in physical fights and so on. And people who rank higher on these scores are much more likely to support interventionist, foreign policy, aggressive foreign policy. These are some of the decisions. We have the mic. We also have the mic moral dilemmas about, you know, you're on a ship that's over, you know that Scott, too many people it's about to turn overboard.

Speaker 2:          33:02          One of the people is very sick. Do you toss him overboard or not? And whether or not to give a vaccine that you're not sure it's going to work to a group of people. And what you find is people who are much more likely to respond with physical aggression are more likely to engage and support aggressive and interventions. Foreign policy are much more utilitarian in there. Um, uh, moral decision making. This is also true for men who are physically stronger and women who are more beautiful as assessed by other people, not by themselves. Um, so, uh, this is basically what I said the other point to make is that there are real sex differences in this. Um, men are more likely to endorse these aggressive actions in general. Um, and there's other factors that do influence these outcomes and these assessments, the most important of which is really education and also whether or not people have fathers and whether or not their fathers are involved with them.

Speaker 2:          33:54          To the extent that you have absent fathers, you get much more strong endorsement of aggressive action, much a stronger manifestation of aggression and much more utilitarian moral calculus. So support for, um, processes that allow fathers to stay with their families, uh, has huge downstream effects for their children. And the final thing is just to say that although these genetic factors I believe really matter and account for about half of what we're seeing, these things always exist in a social context in those social context. Like whether or not you have a father, like whether or not you have a good education really affect the operation of these genes and how they, uh, come out in the real world. And if any of you are more interested in looking at this more deeply, um, this is my edited volume on, um, evolution, biology and politics, which has a lot of summaries from various different people, including chapters on like, um, chimps, chimps and how these things are related to evolutionary, um, uh, uh, impetus as well. So, um, I'm gonna stop there and then, oh, I don't have quite as much time as I thought, but, um, uh, have a discussion that I'd really like with you with thoughts, questions, comments, objections, concerns.

Speaker 1:          35:05          I saw that your, your studies, um, worked with different groups, different countries. There's some Australian studies and you know, the definition of liberal and conservative in a, you know, more socialist country might be different. So do these patterns map on, is that another area of research?

Speaker 2:          35:24          Yeah, that's a great question. So, um, the, we have data from lots of different countries. Unfortunately, the countries that we mostly have data from our western industrialized countries, so Australia, Denmark, Sweden, the United States, you know, places like that. But with those studies, what we've been able to show is that, um, these differences between liberals and conservatives show up in every population we've been able to look at across the course of about 50 years that we've had data that we've been able to look at. What's important though is, is part of the caveat of your question, which is that again, it's not Republicans and Democrats in the narrow American sense. From a world perspective, Democrats and Republicans in the American sense are like this far apart, right? They're basically the same thing. They're what we call Lockian liberals. They believe in capitalism. By and large, I mean Bernie, not so much, but, um, you know, really, um, committed to democratic principles, capitalist economic structures, particular kinds of notions of tolerance and equality.

Speaker 2:          36:25          So they're different in some domestic things, but in kind of the world spectrum from fascism to communism, much more similar than they are different. Um, and when we look at these things in other countries and around the world, the ways in which they're stable are really this kind of world political spectrum from fascism, uh, on the right to, um, communism on the, on the left. And I should have said that backwards, but I'm trying to do it this way. Um, so, um, that's what matters is to just think of ideology and a broader political spectrum than just the American political discourse. And then you have real stability. And I think part of what's going on here is that you have a situation where from an evolutionary standpoint, you have some real universal basic principles that appear across every society across time that basically have to do with topics of survival and reproduction. So think about sex and reproduction issues. Um, a resource allocation issues and issues related to in group defense and outgroup discrimination. The topic may change given, you know, the everyday topic may change from year to year and from country to country so that sometimes sex and reproduction looks like fights over prostitution or pornography in 18th century England. But now it looks like a fight over transgender bathrooms. The specific topic may change, but the underlying issue is about regulating topics of sex and reproduction, which are, you know, these universal concerns. Um, from an evolutionary standpoint.

Speaker 4:          37:56          Yeah. I'm also curious if you've, um, uh, looked at work in a adult development. Um, so also at Harvard, uh, like Robert Keagan, uh, and, um, so kind of building on the like, so Piaget sort of identifying, you'd have stages of child development. Yeah. But as adults continue to grow, I'm seeing the world, uh, they're sort of perspectives, continued growth through phases, seeing the world in terms of greater complexity, understanding their own motivation and the motivation of others in greater complexity. Yeah. Is it something that you've looked at in terms of like the biological correlates?

Speaker 2:          38:25          Yeah. So, yes and no. Um, we've definitely looked at the developmental piece. So, um, especially one of the GS that I've studied most, um, Jewess Lee is this, um, a thing called Mal monoamine oxidase. And there's a particular kind of polymorphism. It's, some people call it a, some people call it a low activation, however you want to call it, colloquially, it's referred to as the warrior gene. But I don't really like that cause it's very pejorative. Uh, it gets that terminology really from its association with the Mallory population in New Zealand. And that is the only population in the world where you get a much higher percentage. So in most of the world, about a third of men show this particular polymorphism. And in New Zealand it's about two thirds. You don't get it as much in women because it's on the x chromosome. And it's a recessive gene, meaning since women have two copies, it's very rare to find women who have two copies of this polymorphism, somewhere between eight and 12% of the population of women.

Speaker 2:          39:23          But it's really lower than that and about, but in men it really is like 35%. Um, now the reason I point to that gene is it's the one that's been most closely associated with, um, a susceptibility to physical aggression. And it's hugely effected by developmental experiences. So, for example, if you, um, have traumatic early life events, it makes it much more likely that the gene will get activated or expressed and you're much more likely to then demonstrate physical aggression later in your life. And it matters when that happens. So in this sense, like Freud was right, zero to five matters. But what really matters is puberty, so 11 to 15, 11 to 16, and it's probably because there's a whole cascade of hormones that get activated around that period of time. So it's not just the traumatic early life events, it's how many you have and how severe they are.

Speaker 2:          40:17          So this is not like, you know, I think of it as, it's not the Stanford problem of like I got a B plus, right? This is like my parents were in jail, my brother died. Um, you know, I grew up in a combat zone. These are really severe developmental traumas. Um, and when you have a lot of them and particularly when they happen at junctures in time, which is why I personally believe father absence of puberty is particularly problematic for potentiating violence in certain populations. Um, I mean, populations who have those kinds of traumatic early life events, that's the way in which developmental aspects can really interact with these genetic things to change the expression of them. I don't usually like, um, what they call snips, studies, you know, single nucleotide protein or single, um, you know, gene studies. But the stuff around Mei was so well developed, it's very clear that this, you know, probably about 10% of physical aggression depending on whether or not you believe the Dutch, um, knock outs.

Speaker 2:          41:14          There's a family. And in that, that we study in, in the Dutch population where the whole family lacks this gene all together and so they're really violent. There are always causing arson and you know, murder and all this kind of stuff. And we do know from my snuck out studies that this is really important. So, um, those kinds of things developmentally really matter. The other piece that you add about like, you know, the, the Piaget and piece about understanding yourself and understanding others and perspective taking and how that matters. I see that as the way in which various aspects of education potentiate the activation or the suppression of, of not only genetic predispositions, but also the environmental contingencies that interact with and control them. And that's why that's the place where I think education really matters. And when I say education here, I don't mean just sitting in school, I'm in the ways in which you train your own brain, not through what you, not just what you read, but in social interaction with other people.

Speaker 2:          42:14          Um, particularly, I mean, if you really believe these studies, which I do has a lot to do with eye contact and the way in which you're able to have, um, um, perspective taking, which allows for the emotional recognition of somebody else's experience. So it's about learning empathy and then it can change the ways in particular in which you see expressions of violence, but other characteristics as well. You had mentioned that in the Mri scan there was sort of a indication towards a reaction of fear towards risk on the conservative side. And then you've mentioned discussed on the liberal side. Um, how do you see that manifest in political views on the liberal side? I think it's not the only emotion. I mean, I want to start out by saying that, but the way that I see it, and sometimes I see it manifesting as discussed and sometimes I see it as manifesting as contempt.

Speaker 2:          43:04          So it's this kind of, um, it's not just that the other side is misguided, but the other side is somehow morally corrupt, morally irresponsible. Um, the other thing I should say about the insula is it's not just about disgust. It also is about holding simultaneous holding contradictory ideas simultaneously. So it's about complexity of thought. And I do think that there's lots of additional evidence that shows that liberals in general, um, uh, tend to entertain a lot more complexity of thought. And that's not always necessarily a good thing because what happens with complexity of thought is you can paralyze yourself, right? Like, well, it could be this or it could be that, or there's 18 other ways in which the sub for, you know, the subtle form of it. I mean, you can see a lot of it in the debate. She know where Hillary would be like, and then there's point a and 0.8 has three sub points, you know, and, and Trump would be like, it's sad, right?

Speaker 2:          43:56          So there's this very different kind of, um, yeah, it's very, very different kinds of approaches. So I want to say that, that the insula has this other piece of, but the way that I see the disgust coming out is the unwillingness to see the other side or the other person as, um, a a moral being worthy of consideration in the same way as another liberal. Right. Um, so that there's this, um, I'm not going to call it a failure of empathy because it's not really about empathy. It's really more about, um, subject object to, right. So the way that I saw it in this last election was a real disregard for class considerations. You know, where you wouldn't see liberals talking a lot about poor people. So much as they were talking about race and gender and sexuality, you weren't hearing a lot about the white working class who is suffering.

Speaker 2:          44:49          Um, not just from poverty, but from, um, you know, a whole bunch of other, um, cultural upheavals that felt real to them. And because liberals didn't consider that they should be real, they weren't going to be considered as much. And I think that that's what ended up biting us, you know, biting the, um, uh, liberal, uh, supporters in the, but, um, when that group really rose up and said, I don't care that I'm hurting my own self interest, I just want to make sure that you get hurt too. Right. I'm going to take you down with me. And I think that there's, there's that, that failure of connection and, and, um, um, uh, equivalents of, uh, moral consideration of the other as a subject and not just an object that is what you see play out. I don't see that as much on the conservative side, but the fear thing is just activated. I mean, the Republican convention was like a festival of fear. Everything was like,

Speaker 5:          45:46          be scared and then be more scared and be more scared than that. And then there's these other things you thought about,

Speaker 2:          45:50          you know, like it was sort of a hysterical fear. Um, and that was very, very, very activated. And so that, that was the way I saw it on both sides.

Speaker 6:          45:58          I was wondering if you had done any research or had any thoughts on people who find themselves politically opposed to their parents and the rest of their family?

Speaker 2:          46:07          Yeah, so, um, that's the most obvious thing when you think about genetics. Like, well, if I'm not like my parents, then how can I, you know, be like this. And the way I think about is a friend of mine who had a kid who had red hair and was convinced that his wife had cheated. And so he went out and forced her to get a DNA test on the kid and, um, it causes a divorce. And then as soon as his mom came to help take care of them, cause the divorce was happening, she go on and look at the kid and said,

Speaker 5:          46:29          oh my God, that looks just like my grandfather.

Speaker 2:          46:32          Right. And what happened was he had never known his grandfather, but she had known the grandfather. And so things skip generations. It's true not just with hair color and eye color, but it's true with political ideology, right? So we're not just our parents, we are the sum of all of our ancestors across multiple generations. And so, um, if we're not like our parents, that doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't a genetic component. And part of how we know this is that people look much more like their parents till they leave the house. And I think that that's because there's a lot of socialization going on in the house. It's not okay to not be what the parents are, but once you go to college, what you see is people shifting dramatically and they're actually shifting back more toward their genetic predisposition. And it's because, you know, the sort of the, the, the tamping socialization of the household gets lifted and then you are what you are. And some of that is your parents, but your parents aren't just your parents and your grandparents or great grandparents or great grip, you know, and, and on back on through, you know, multiple history and these things have very, very long history is 13% of the men on the planet are direct descendants of Ganga con. Right? I mean there's these really long histories of particular kind of, um, high reproductive, you know, um, our strategy, reproductive males. Yes.

Speaker 7:          47:50          Oh, going back to the question or the observation of the emotions of let's say contempt or, um, discussed, uh, influencing or informing the, the liberal perspective and fear, primarily informing the conservative, um, imagine let's say a liberal work to overcome those negative emotions and, and really empathize and try to understand the other point of view and, and rise above it to let's say almost a Buddhist or like what I mentioned the Dalai Lama. Oh. Might be able to do, um, when the result then still be very liberal. I mean, isn't, aren't the qualities of empathy and understanding and compassion. Um, what I'm getting at is I, I wonder if I heard the hint of a, of a, of an equivalents or positive equivalents that, you know, there's this negative thing on the conservative side and this negative thing on the liberal side. And I can imagine that it's attractive to try to phrase things that way too. You know, when the point of view of trying to appear neutral, but it seems that if we were to extend this idea of just getting rid of the negative emotions altogether, get rid of getting rid of the contempt or the disgust and try to have understanding where does that lead politically? [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          49:06          okay. So I'm, I'm going to answer your question the way I think about it, which may not actually be what you mean. Um, so the way I think about these things is from an evolutionary standpoint, and, um, no society could exist if we were just all liberals. And the reason for that is that we'd get predated by other people, right? There's always going to be a few psychopaths out there, even if you just understand that as mutations of random stuff from nuclear fallout or whatever. Right? So if we want to protect ourselves from the environment, from animals, from other people, we always need some number of conservatives who are going to be, you know, lack of anything else really good at combat, right? Protecting the Ingroup outgroup from our group. Um, attacks. No, similarly, no society could exist who is just conservative because then there'd be no cooperation.

Speaker 2:          49:56          Nobody to build houses, organizations, institutions, Google. Right. The, it wouldn't exist. So you need both of them. The problem is, is how to get that to happen in concert. Um, I personally, there's a big debate about this in the literature, but I believe that we learn to cooperate because we needed to engage in conflict more effectively. Combat is what taught people to cooperate. In order to have effective combat against the outgroup, you have to be really, really good at in group cooperation. Those things happen together in genetic senses. What's that co what? What's that? What that is called is frequency dependent selection. You have two different traits or n number, different traits that have to remain stable in the population over time or, um, the overall society falls apart. If you have a trait that's so successful, it converges to universality. Think about the fact that when you're really scared, your vision gets better, your hearing gets Burke better.

Speaker 2:          50:53          That's a trait that's so, that's so successful in the potentiating, the survival of its possessors that it converges to universality. That's never going to happen with liberals and conservatives because you need both. The problem has happened now is because our societies are way bigger than how we were. We grew up, right? We grew up in communities of 150 people where we knew everybody we could tell who was cheating the system, we could sanction who was cheating the system. But we now have to apply that psychology that's really built on 150 people to 320 million people. And so all of a sudden that psychology gets hijacked and thinks that the only way we're gonna survive as if we destroy all conservatives are if we destroy all liberals, depending on where we go, that's not gonna work. What in my view is most likely to be successful is to find ways in which we joined together.

Speaker 2:          51:51          Liberals and conservatives for a larger goal like the nation, right? You can see it in the military, you can see it in some places where you know, you can see it in football teams where race doesn't matter, where ideology doesn't matter. What matters is the particular mission or the particular goal. Um, and how we get there to a place of tolerance and a place of recognizing the value of each side I think is a real challenge. And I wish I knew how to get there. And I'm working with some people both politically as well as, um, you know, academically to try and think about ways to do that. But it's a challenge for sure. And I agree with you. I think the Buddhist perspective is the right perspective. The problem is selling that perspective. To a majority Christian country.

Speaker 8:          52:40          So some countries seem to tend more conservative over time. And you mentioned that the u s you know, actually was liberal on the overall spectrum. Yeah. But there significant genetic differences. I mean, you could and you could imagine that being the case because the US is a nation of immigrants.

Speaker 2:          52:54          So, um, I, the answer, I'm going to give you a sort of half assed, which is that, um, we don't have good genetic studies of say Middle Eastern populations, partly because we don't get in there and do those populations. So I don't know whether there's genetic differences. Well, we do have are these world value surveys where you go around and ask people about their attitudes and you get dramatic differences, especially on things related to sex and reproduction. So things like whether or not homosexuality is okay, whether or not it's okay for women to be independent financially or socially, whether or not men or women should have control of reproduction. Those things, you get dramatic differences. The most liberal countries are always Scandinavian, right? It's always like Sweden and Norway and Denmark and the US is actually not that high. They are when you think about it, because like for example, there's still this thing and the United States where most people kind of think it's best if you get married before you have kids.

Speaker 2:          53:48          The Scandinavians got rid of that a long time ago, you know, um, the worst countries by far always the Middle Eastern countries. Um, and so what that, how much of that is socialized and how much of it is genetic? We don't know cause I, we haven't done the genetic work. I will say that based on the stuff you know, that I've done with mio and the work that I've seen done with women who survived the family. So there's a big study done with women who survived the famine in 1944, nine, 9:43 AM nine 43 in the Netherlands. And they've tracked their children now through two generations because it was a terrible famine. And their children tended to be really underweight. And what they find is that those children are differentially susceptible to diabetes and being overweight two generations later because of huge changes in genetic expression that allowed their mothers to survive in a famine allowed them to survive at birth.

Speaker 2:          54:45          But then the minute you look at a Reese's peanut butter cup, you have diabetes, right? I mean, it's this thing that that has really good survival advantage and then costs and an environment of abundance, right? So if you look at those studies and you think about the way that plays out, uh, with things like mio, I think if you have environments where women are pregnant in conditions of incredible deprivation, famine, war, violence, they're raped, whatever, and then they grow up, those kids then grow up in environments where most of their relatives are killed. They, they're in constant bombing. I mean, think about Syria. It's going to cause the expression of all those genes to get activated toward higher levels of violence. I think you're going to get what you see, which is the intergenerational transfer of only understanding violence as appropriate conflict resolution. So there's both social elements of it and biological elements.

Speaker 2:          55:37          And I suspect that's what's going on. So like, my whole thing is you want to change the outcome in the Middle East. Maternal mount, you know, maternal nutrition. Start giving these people vitamins, start getting them into safe environments when they're pregnant. Like that's the thing, what you should do. And everybody in the u s government looks to me like I'm on drugs like, and what drug are you taking? You know? Um, because they just think it's crazy. But I do think that that's how, that's the place you could intervene to change it and it would be acceptable and nobody minds being helped, right? I mean, in that way. Um, so, uh, but it's very hard to convince people that that's the, that's the right approach. It's Wacky, right? It's also true, but, um, that doesn't change the receptivity.

Speaker 1:          56:24          Thank you very much for speaking with us today. Well, um, hopes he have you back as your research continues. Thank you.

Speaker 9:          56:31          [inaudible].
