Speaker 1:          00:06          Hi and thank you so much for coming today and taking time out of your very busy schedules to listen to me Yammer on about my book. Um, it's called the vanishing season and it just came out last week and it had an unusual path to publication in that it won the mystery writers of America, uh, slash St Martins [inaudible] debut crime novel award, which is an annual contest that is held in conjunction with St Martin's, my publisher and the mystery writers of America. So it's open to anybody who has a unpublished manuscript. So if you have an unpublished manuscript lying around that has to do with crime, you can shine it up and send it in. The new deadline is mid January of 2018 and they usually get about 400 submissions. And the mystery writers of America have some judges who comb through those manuscripts and narrow it down to a handful of finalists, which are then sent on to the editors at Saint Martins who pick the winner.

Speaker 1:          01:13          And occasionally there's no winner. Uh, but my year I won, which I was very surprised and delighted to find out, which is how my book came to be. So that was March, 2016 when they said, yes, we like it, we will publish it. And it just came out now about 22 months later. So it's a long journey, um, from the decision to publish to the actual presentation of the book. But it's been exciting and fun. I recommend it, you know. Uh, and um, so the book is about, one of the reasons I thought that it might not, when is most of the winners have been kind of traditional mysteries or historical mysteries that don't feel feature a lot of, um, grit or, uh, well, body parts is my mother calls my novel, the body parts novel. Uh, so I was very surprised where they picked me and my body parts, uh, add delighted but surprised.

Speaker 1:          02:17          And um, it's about a serial killer who, uh, well who's active in, um, a small town in Woodbury and Massachusetts. It's fictional. And a living in this town is my heroine Ellery Hathaway, who was, has personal knowledge of a serial killer cause she was kidnapped off the streets of Chicago as a 14 year old to the eve of her 14th birthday. Actually, uh, she was alone outside on the streets at night because her mother was in the hospital with her brother who was dying of cancer and the father had run off years ago. So LRA was vulnerable. Um, and when the sedan pulled over, it's a hot night in Chicago, oppressive heat. She thought, well, if I help him, maybe he'll give me a dollar for a soda and I can cool off. But instead he got out of the car and her life changed forever. She would have been victim number 17 of, uh, Francis Coben who is an infamous Ted Bundy type serial killer, uh, who had a ducted and killed 16 girls before and he kept the hands and ditch the rest.

Speaker 1:          03:26          And so Ellery was, um, in prison by him and would have been killed too, if not for a very green FBI agent who was like low man on the totem pole in the investigation. But he played a hunch and serendipitously rescued her from the closet. Um, and that was 14 years before the book opens and now she's living in anonymity. She's changed her name. She's trying to put all the past behind her, but every year around her birthday somebody goes missing from this small town and they all seem to have, well most of them seem to have reasons to be missing. So nobody's very surprised and there wasn't, they aren't looking for them too hard in most cases and they don't see a pattern. But Ellery gets a creepy clown birthday card in the mail. After each disappearance it says happy birthday. Ellery and she doesn't really talk about a birthday much.

Speaker 1:          04:16          So this is a signal to her that somebody knows who she is for real and uh, the person may be dangerous, but she can't get anybody to believe her that these disappearances are connected. And to explain the whole story risks outing her past and again, being forced to deal with this ugly serial killer who had hurt her when she was a teenager. Um, so this year the, you know, the vanishing season is coming around again and somebody is going to go missing unless she can figure out a way to stop it. So she calls up the one guy she knows will believe her and that's read Markham, the FBI agent who rescued her when she was 14 and Reed's life, uh, skyrocketed, uh, after his, uh, rescue of LRA, he wrote a bestselling book about it. He got promoted, he became a hot shot profiler. Uh, it was great.

Speaker 1:          05:06          He hits, he met his wife kind of this way where she was starstruck a little by the whole serial killer. You catch serial killers. That's really cool. Um, and uh, so the best time of his life basically is the worst time of [inaudible] and that's why they're interesting to put together as they, they had their identities forged by this initial terrible case and they've both been living with it in different ways ever since. So for read, it's been a boon, you know, gave him fame and fortune and for LRE it, you know, has been awful obviously. And so forcing them to back together again for a causes them to confront those roles where you know, for read, if Ella is life isn't awesome. I mean he's always told himself he's the big hero of her story. He rescued her. She's the one that lived. Um, if her life isn't so awesome, then maybe he's not the hero.

Speaker 1:          05:59          He told himself he was. Um, and for Ellery she's always sort of a told herself she's going to be the victim forever. Like she's forever tied to this very famous serial killer. Uh, and so now she has a chance to see like who she might be apart from that story. Um, so that's kind of the main thrust of the book. And one of the questions I get asked a lot is where did it come from? And the genesis of the story was about 20 years ago. I was reading one of the stories about Ted Bundy and there are a lot of them, there's a new Ted Bundy story. Every year, basically a movie TV, movie, a book, something like this story, you know, it's 40 years old, but it keeps getting retold. And so ted Bundy lives on, um, and for the people who were caught up in his story, uh, this can be difficult to have to keep reliving it when the public won't let it die basically.

Speaker 1:          07:00          And um, so he has living victims, uh, one of whom is a woman named Carol [inaudible]. Carol was 18 and shopping at a Utah shopping mall when Ted Bundy, uh, pretending to be a police officer, told her that her car had been broken into and she needed to come with him to the police station and make a report. And so she got into the car with him and it was immediately struck that this doesn't look like a cop's car. And then he drove her, not towards the police station, but away from it. And so she freaked out and demanded to be let out of the car, at which point Bundy realizes that the Jig was up and he had to subdue her somehow. So he pulled over the road side of the road. And He tried to snap his handcuffs on her, but in the struggle he got both the cuffs on one wrist.

Speaker 1:          07:47          And so she was able to escape and she became the beginning of Ted Bundys end because they, people sort of knew that he was out there, this guy named Ted and there were the missing girls and um, they were probably connected, but they didn't really, they didn't know what he looked like, all these sorts of things. And she was able to say, here's what he looked like, here's the car he was driving and the cops were able to start putting the pieces together. So Carol, um, today, so more than 40 years after this incident still gets 10 to 15 messages per day about Ted Bundy. People write her saying, oh, he, he kidnapped me to, um, or they say, uh, Oh, tell me what Ted's really like. What was it like? They want her story. A couple of years ago, some guy decided to say he was her son and like he has this connection to Ted Bundy.

Speaker 1:          08:42          She doesn't have a son. So she was forced to come for either let this lie perpetuate or to come forward and say, I don't have a son. He's lying. So Bundy has been dead for decades. He was electrocuted in Florida in 1989. Um, but for Carroll, he's there every day. You know, the, her life now became, you know, about Ted Bundy and the public won't let him go for her. She has no choice. Um, another person caught up in the Ted Bundy story would be the read Marcom type character. And this was Bob capital who was brand new. He had been on the job as a homicide detective one week when he got handed the Ted Bundy case. And this completely changed the trajectory of capital's career. He ended up specializing in serial murderer. He hunted Bundy for years until they caught him. Um, he actually, when they Bundy was finally apprehended for good cause he escaped Weiss.

Speaker 1:          09:39          Uh, he was when he was finally an apprehended for good in Florida. Keppel traveled there and interviewed him multiple times and was able to get Bundy to confess for two more murders that they didn't know he'd even committed. Um, eventually Keppel went on to specialize in serial murder and try to help, uh, classify them to see if we could figure out how to get serial killers. Um, is there an learn more about how they think, where do they come from? So he participated in some scientific research. He ended up lecturing teaching about serial killers. Uh, you know, it also took over his life in a more positive way and that he was the expert in serial murder. Um, but again, like it was serendipity, right? He's just a guy, he and working for the Seattle police, when all of a sudden this call comes in about a missing girl and now he's been handed one of the most infamous cases in all of history.

Speaker 1:          10:32          So I was less struck when I read this book about Ted Bundy himself. He's very interesting. But all of these side people, the people who were approached by Bundy and didn't go with him. So I know somebody who was living in the sorority house that he attacked in Florida. Uh, he broke in and just basically went from room to room beating women, these young women with a log and he killed some of them and gravely injured others. There was one who was going to be a dancer. Um, and the head injury caused her life to be rewritten because she had balance issues after that. And so she lived, but her life was never the same. And the woman I know lived there, but it wasn't home that night. She was out. So it's, you know, the sort of sliding doors parallel lives. Like what if she had been there?

Speaker 1:          11:28          She wasn't. Um, but still it's something she thinks about frequently. When you have a brush with a, an infamous case like this, it changes you. And so the book is about serial murder and there's a mystery and who did it and all that other stuff. But it's also about what it's like to live attached to this infamous crime. How many people are familiar with mind hunter? Very popular Netflix series right now. I see one. So mine hunter is, uh, based on the work of two other people who hunted serial killers, a wrestler and Douglas and they went around and interviewed them. They had this idea like, you know, Sarah killers have been with us forever but nobody really studied them. And they said, well, we're going to study them and interview them and see if we can classify them and figure out where they come from and help people catch them.

Speaker 1:          12:22          So this is all about, you know, their interviews. They have creepy serial killers are people playing creepy serial killers and uh, they show the interviews and how the work came to be and whether people supported it at first and how it gained momentum. What's interesting about it now as if you go to the FBI site, the FBI's basically like, yeah, none of that really panned out like we tried. But it turns out serial killers are very hard to catch and they're hard to catch for a lot of reasons. But one of the things is all their hard work, it trying to figure out like, okay, what can we say about serial killers? And they could find some tendencies, like, okay, they tend to be, um, bed wetters, you know, into later adolescents. So they like bedwetting is a problem even when they're like 10 or 12 or something like that.

Speaker 1:          13:12          Okay, well if you suspect you have a serial killer in your neighborhood and you're a police officer, you can't really go like round up the bed. Wetters you know, like with the saw the cops. So looking at these profiles going, they don't help us, like have, you know, okay, so we had mommy issues, like how do we go round up the people who had mommy issues or whatever. Like this is not helpful. And then also some of it just turns out not to be helpful even as a classification system. So one of the big things they tried early on was you could be an organized killer who would be kind of like Bundy, who, um, planned his victims. And he had this very big rooms where he would dress up as an injured person with, uh, um, a cast on. And he'd say, Oh, come with me.

Speaker 1:          13:58          I need you to help me carry my books. To my car and the young woman would go with them, at which point he would leap upon them and subdue them. Or you pretend to be a cop or something like that. And he had a plan with how he was going to just, you know, be with a victim and kill her and where he was going to leave her. And then disorganized killers who would be, you know, like, Ooh, I'm just walking along when I'm overcome with the urge to kill and I break in and I just killed people. But one day did that too at the end. So is he organized or disorganized? And it turns out like organized killers have elements that are disorganized and disorganized killers have elements of organizations. So this category helped, not at all, but there are other things that are kind of interesting things that appear about serial killers in movies and television.

Speaker 1:          14:46          Um, so for example, you see things like, oh, they always take trophies with them. That's a big thing. And it turns out about half, half takes some sort of trophy, like some piece of the victims jewelry or a driver's license. So they can like relive it afterward, but only about half. Um, another one they found serial killers are more likely to have served in the military. So if 1% of the population is served in the military around now see what killers, it's one in three. So probably they're attracted to the dominance and the weapons and, and that sort of thing. But again, most the vast majority of people in the military or not serial killers, so even if you suspect you have a serial killer, it's not like you can go round up everybody in the military and say, are you the one?

Speaker 2:          15:36          MMM.

Speaker 1:          15:38          And then, uh, let's see other things that are so true about serial killers, um, that they kill strangers and that's why they're hard to catch. And it turns out about a third of their victims are strangers. It turns out the most common relationship between a serial killer and his victim is business.

Speaker 1:          15:58          So watch out when you're doing business. Now prostitution accounts for a good chunk is app that's classified as business. But also, you know, you go down to your Kinko's to make some mimeographs or whatever. And the Siri killer happens to be working behind the counter. Uh, so you get those kinds of things too where there's this casual connection. You would still mostly be classified as strangers and you don't really know each other, but you have met before. Um, so that's another thing that is sort of interesting about serial killers. Um, another one that pops up sometimes is like, are the victims, all women on TV, they're almost always women. And it turns out in real life they're mostly women to, um, it's about 80%. And again, part of that is the prostitution because if you're a serial killer and you're lazy and you want a victim, it's very easy to get a prostitute to get in the car with you.

Speaker 1:          16:50          You don't have to go hunt her and she'll, you know, opened the door and she'll get it and then you are expected to drive her off, some more secluded. So she doesn't freak out immediately. Um, so unfortunately like prostitution, people who are in the sex trade are still vulnerable to this kind of thing. You can call them up and like have the one delivered to your home. Um, so that's a chunk of where that comes from. So that's about 80% of the victims are women. Um, and another one I that I find interesting, there's this idea that, oh, they're already in the system somewhere. If we just look for people who are out there convict, you know, committing violent crimes, we can find the serial killer. And it turns out, nope, that about 80% of them have some kind of record by the time they are, uh, arrested for murder.

Speaker 1:          17:41          Uh, but it's usually nonviolent stuff like peeping or, um, simple theft. It's not really that they're out there committing these violent crimes and they have a record. So it turns out they're actually very, very hard to catch. So that was one, I got some feedback on my book actually, um, about reed and his ability to profile and everything. It's a bit like he's not very good at his job. Like he gets stuff wrong in the book and well, I mean, profiling is not, you know, a science per se. It's not like it has the guaranteed outcome that they're like, okay, and he's going to be wearing a red sweater and driving a blue minivan. It's just like they can't get it down that far. And indeed the cops off of get frustrated because what the profilers will come forward with or stuff like, well he's really angry at women and the cops are like, yeah, we kind of gathered that from the way he's killing them.

Speaker 1:          18:40          What else? You got? Nothing of the bed wetter thing. Okay. Uh, so there is this tension between the FBI that wants to do this research into serial killers and the local police who really just want help catching them when they think they have one. Uh, but this is another problem is how do you know when you have one? Because it'd be nice if they were always very consistent and they like slept. The sign nodes like the Zodiac, you, it's me or they always, you know, used a pair of red nylons to strangle their victim. Something obvious. It says, okay, yeah, these are all related. But sometimes they're opportunists and they will change murder weapons. So one might be a strangulation and then another will be a shooting. Um, so they can be very hard to detect. But what's interesting now is some people are beginning to experiment with like big data and it's hard right now because the way law enforcement works, they're all segregated.

Speaker 1:          19:34          So you can be a serial killer in one town and go like across the street and be a serial killer in another town in the two towns. Don't even know that there have related victims because they're not sharing data. So there's some people who are making efforts to try and get the police departments to share more data. So you can pick out serial killers and that's looking like, it might be an interesting way. Some people are saying this, this will work, but it hasn't been rigorously tested yet. But at least we are probably moving in the right direction to be able to spot these guys. And again, it is mostly guys, uh, you can't get females. They are killers. They tend to murder like serial husbands, like black widow's. Like, I'll marry a guy and then often, um, for money and then I'll marry another one off him for money.

Speaker 1:          20:22          And if you move around, this can be very hard to, uh, catch. And this is the thing, how do they finally catch serial killers? Well, it turns out their families turn them in, their friends. Um, the people who know them who can say, oh yeah, he was a bed wetter or um, yeah, or you know, and Bundys case, his fiance was like, he has a plaster of Paris in the, um, bathroom and some handcuffs in the car that looks suspicious to me. She had to turn him in three times before they took her seriously because nobody thought they were looking for a law student. They thought they were looking for some sort of savage on the street. He was like foaming at the mouth or something. Um, so it took a while to, even though like lots of people returning Ted and Ted Bundy, like, Ooh, this guy does drive a VW bug and his name is Ted. The cops just didn't believe it could possibly be him until, you know, his girlfriend. Actually turned him in when he moved to Utah and more women started disappearing there and she's like, okay, so ted, move to Utah and now you have missing women there. You really might want to check into that. But what's interesting about Liz, um, his fiance, she didn't break up with him.

Speaker 1:          21:38          It's a head scratcher for me. I, so she kept turning him into the cops. Like I think he could be a serial killer. I think he might be the guy. And then I'm also still gonna marry him. And indeed one woman did marry him on death row when he'd been convicted of all of it, uh, and actually bore his child. So out there is, uh, a woman who, uh, would be a little younger than me, uh, who has ted Bundy for a father. And her mother is somebody who had sex with Ted Bundy when he was on death row. So that's your parentage. Good luck. Are there any questions about publishing, about the book, about serial murder?

Speaker 3:          22:22          I found the, the addressing of the, um, the emotional scars in the book. Interesting. It. Um, uh, it really does feel like that is a major part of the book as you said, rather than, than just the, the, the killer in the hunt for the killer. Um, it's hard to make such a thing come across as, as believable unless you know, you, you, you have examples of people with emotional scars that going, I guess to some extent we all do. Did you use any, any particular examples from the real world to, to base, um, LRS behavior and, and the baggage on?

Speaker 1:          23:02          Um, so, you know, I have the, the Bundy cases, one of the imprints, but, um, uh, actually I was assaulted by a neighbor when I was five, uh, repeatedly by, um, a neighbor who told me he would kill me if I ever told my family. And so I said nothing for several years. Uh, he eventually went to jail for unrelated charges. Um, but I've always sort of wondered what parts of my personality or as a result of that experience and what would have been me anyway. There's no control Joanna, that we can run alongside me to be able to say, okay, that's how you would have been if this had never happened. Um, so it's something that's interesting to me. I started checking out books on rape from the library when I was like eight to try to understand this whole thing. So I've done a ton of reading and I've done writing about it.

Speaker 1:          23:57          Um, and what happens when I write about it is women come out of the woodwork and say, yeah, here's what happened to me. And so I've been collecting these stories over the years of different women. And so LRE is kind of an amalgamation of all of us. Uh, her story is very dramatic because it's famous and you know, you can't get away from it. Most of us live in relative anonymity. So that part is very unusual for Ellery. Um, but what's common is, you know, the shame, the wondering like, did I do something to cause this, uh, the feeling that if somebody knows what happened to you that it's going to change how they look at you, how they feel, how they act to you. Uh, you know, we've seen this with like the me too movement, right? So like a lot of women have some story, uh, and most of us are carrying it around in secret and just the, the secrecy part of it can be like a lingering pain.

Speaker 1:          24:57          And so, yeah, LRE is like a mixture of all of these tales. Yes. Another question. Uh, what did you find most surprising about the publishing process? Um, most surprising about the publishing process? Well, I'm really heartened that the book is doing well. Like to me that's the biggest surprise. I brought eight. It's a nice little mystery and, you know, I, I like, but it's like, it's sold out on Amazon and six days. Um, you know, and so people were coming forward going, I really liked this. And I'm like, oh, thank you. I'm just surprised every time. Uh, it terms of like the mechanics, I would say how long it takes is like, I sort of knew that intellectually, but you know, it's 22 months. And as I like to say, I could have birth to actual children in that time frame, you know, instead or one elephant, um, or a book.

Speaker 1:          25:52          And it turns out that there's a lot of different pieces that go into it. You know, when you, that my publisher publishes like 110 mysteries a year. So you have your slot about, this is when the editor can focus on your book. This is when the copy editor can focus on your book. This is when the, you know, cover artists can focus on your book. Uh, and you, you know, it's a complicated dance and you have to meet your steps or the whole process. You can, you can miss your opening and then your book is delayed even more. Uh, so it's, that kind of has been, I would say the most surprising part. The thing that surprises other people is like, I don't have anything to do with the cover. Um, the publisher picks both the title and the cover for books and authors depending on their statue or get more or less input.

Speaker 1:          26:42          And so the, this title actually is mine. Um, and the publisher agreed to it. The cover, like I was not even consulted. They're just like, here it is. Um, and I provided some feedback and they made some tweaks on that and I'm very happy with the way it turned out. But I know sometimes authors are very unhappy. Uh, Lisa Gardner was telling me this week, um, that they had tweaked her cover so many times that, uh, it ended up the woman had six fingers cause she was so, she's looking at the coverage, she's like, it looks odd to me and then they'll publish this way. She's like, it looks odd to me sending her husband, she says he's more visual than I am. And he came along, he was like, that's because she has six fingers. Oh yeah. And then even if you are at least a gardener who has published, you know, Zillions of a New York Times bestselling books, um, still the publisher will come to you and say, uh, can you give the heroin Brown eyes are not brown eyes but green eyes because we have green eyed art that we want to use on the cover.

Speaker 1:          27:45          And so brown eyes aren't going to work. Oh, can you go back and change your heritage so that uh, she has green eyes and Lisa's, it's like, all right, I'll just go tweak her heritage. So she has green eyes in the book. So the way the different pieces come together and where the author can push back and where the author can is continues to be a bit of a surprise for me

Speaker 3:          28:12          quickly. Thank you for that explanation of why so many books cover pictures don't match the story inside. I never understood.

Speaker 1:          28:20          Yeah. Well it turns out this is, you know, authors actually usually are not very good at figuring out what to put on the cover because they imagined that it's going to be like a scene. Like you act out a scene from the book and when it doesn't look like that, they're like, what? But this doesn't look like my book. And um, it turns out that the most important thing the book can do is signal it's genre, like what it is. Um, so is it literary fiction? Is it a, is it a scary mystery? Is it a cozy mystery like murder she wrote where like there's a dead body but nobody really cares. Um, that kind of thing because if you get it wrong, like the readers are angry, I've seen reviews where, you know, there's something on the cover that's super creepy and then they, the book isn't scary and the readers are mad. They're like, I really was prepared to be terrified by this book. And it wasn't even Martin Lee thrilling or, um, you know, this book looks Psi Phi to me. Uh, and it isn't. And honestly, even when you get in the genre, you can still have, um, problems. So one of my readers apparently thinks she looks pregnant.

Speaker 4:          29:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:30          And so she read the book expecting the pregnancy to show up and it never did. And she was mad. She's like, two stars off the, uh, cover is a lie. So you can't, you can't win, but you really more than acting out a particular scene or having the character look exactly like they're described in the book, um, you want it to signal what it is. So that readers who were like, you don't want somebody looking for a pizza to get a cheeseburger. What can you tell us about your future work? Oh, what a great question. So I'm very fortunate. Uh, saint Martins has kindly picked up the next two books in the series A. So, uh, no mercy is slated to come out, um, January, 2019 and then there was another one after that and it's read and Ellery again. And the Basset Hound speed bump, everybody likes the Basset Hound, so he's back to, and they solve more crimes.

Speaker 1:          30:27          The second book, um, Ellery is sentenced to group therapy with ordinary crime victims. Like one of them is a survivor. His wife was killed in a drunk driving accident. Another one had his buddy die in a convenience store robbery. Um, so none of them is famous. Like Ellery, none of them has like, you know, crime in big bold letters and Ellory's like she's been living with it all these years, so she's not too keen on getting in touch with her feelings. So instead some of these crimes are unsolved, uh, for her, her fellow survivor. So she starts trying to solve all their lives, all their rather than, you know, doing what she's supposed to. And then the third one read, actually his mother was murdered when he was an infant. She was found stabbed to death just a short way away from his crib and he was adopted.

Speaker 1:          31:17          Um, and he gets a hot new lead after 40 years and read an LRA, go to Vegas to solve his mother's murder. What would you say is the surprising part of writing a book maybe compared to other stuff you've written in the past? Um, sure. Yeah. Surprising part of writing a book. Well, I have to have some surprise. I discovered very early on that if I, um, outline too, too much of a detailed outline, I won't write the book because it's all like, well the, the hard part is figuring out the exact phrasing and everything and if the store is all there, I'm like, well that's it. I don't need to do that work. Um, I'll just leave it in my head. Uh, so I have a rough outline and then, you know, things happen where I'm riding along in a character I didn't think was going to do something, does something.

Speaker 1:          32:06          All of a sudden it's happening. And I was like, Ooh, that's very interesting. I didn't know you had that secret motive or you know, this thing and you're past that suddenly coming out to, to light. I know I'm, Ian Mckellen said he wrote like 13 books before he realized his hero was Polish, you know, like that was his ancestor. He's like, oh, of course you're Polish. I didn't know. So like that's the fun part is the discovery where you're riding along and you, you learn about your characters. So that's, I think the surprising part and the fun part. Thank you.
