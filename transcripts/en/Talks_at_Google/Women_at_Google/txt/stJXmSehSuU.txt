Speaker 1:          00:11          Thank you. [inaudible]. Good afternoon everyone. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. Rob also fall into for having us. It's an honor to be in London, although this way the gates to me every time I visit London. Thanks. Snack Lien. Thank you for coming to, how did you then become to work for him within his company and how did your family take your, I suppose that the change in a 1994, Mr Mandela became the first democratically elected president in 1990 in, in April of [inaudible] 1994 and in October of that year, I applied for a job, um, in his, uh, extended office and he had a few ministers in his office and it was the, one of the ministers, uh, it was a booth for a minister without portfolio portfolio. So I looked at the ad and I was only driven by the fact that I needed a job closer to my parents home because I was still living with him at the age of 23, which no child should do.

Speaker 1:          01:15          At the age of 23. I was living with my parents and I needed a job closer to home. So, um, that was the one thing that was attractive about the job that the union buildings in which the president's head office is situated, was close to my parents home. And secondly, uh, it all, the job was also advertised that you would do six months, um, uh, duty in Pretoria, which is the administrative capital. It's about 20 miles I think from, from, uh, from Johannesburg. I'm not sure about miles and kilometers, but I'm about 20 miles from Johannesburg. And then you could spend six months there, rest of the six months of the year you could spend in gaped down. Now you all know, if you know South Africa, everyone knows about Cape Town. And even as a young South African, we all just want to go to Cape Town. So the job was advertised as part of a sessional duty, uh, um, uh, office.

Speaker 1:          02:08          So you could spend six months of the year in Pretoria and then when parliament is in session in Cape Town, you would spend the six months in Cape Town. Those two things were the only things that I was interested in when I applied for the job in the ministry without portfolio, I thought to myself, well, because, um, these notebook portfolio attached to this minister, the job couldn't be too, too complicated. Um, this man does it. I thought to myself, this minister doesn't even have a job because he doesn't have a portfolio. So I thought to myself, I'm apply for the job and see how it goes. And of course, never thinking that I would end up in Mr Mandela's office. So I was invited for an interview in, in the head office of the presidency and during the interview, um, I was still conversing with the HR people.

Speaker 1:          02:59          The door flung open in this very flamboyant, beautifully dressed black lady intake. Uh, her name was married and she was, um, the president's brought President Mandela private secretary. At the time. Now, if you don't believe in fate or destiny, then the story will make you believe in fate and destiny. I sat in that office when Mary entered and she really just physically burst into the office without announcement and interrupting us. And she just said, I need an assistant and I need it right now. And I don't care what color she is. And I thought to myself, I'm your person. You need someone, I need a job here. You know, the two of us. I mean, it's mean to be. And um, do she lived, we never got introduced. And I was never told who she was. And often the interview that called me and they said, would you be interested in a job in President Mandela private office?

Speaker 1:          03:54          And I thought to myself, private, it sounds dangerous actually. Um, I thought, well, I hope I'm never expected to go to his house because now remember, I'm still very afraid of this person. I'm still, um, you know, with the same conservative mindset, I thought if I work in a, in a bigger office, I could just disappear. So private office, um, you know, didn't sound right. And so I said, is this job in the union buildings in the, in the aid office? Because I was trying to avoid to go to a private office. They said, GCA sits in the, in the Union Buildings. I see. Um, and would I be able to do sessional duties? So six months, Pretoria, six months, Cape Town? They said, yes. I said, I'm sold neighbor or asking questions about how big is this private office? Um, you know, who would I be working for?

Speaker 1:          04:43          Would I ever have to meet the president? Never asking those questions. It was just the logistics that might seems to me and that was attractive to me. And so I said yes. And of course then I realized, so I was the first day I started my job in the union buildings, I thought at first that I made a big mistake. I walked into this very stately office. It's like 10 Downing Street and you walk into this office and the door's open by motion detector and um, it's very stately inside and very formal and you can hardly a pin drop. And all this grand idea and um, beautiful carpets and everything. And then I made one or two people and I thought, well, where's the raced? Where's the other 200 people I'm expecting to find there? And they said, no, no, no, we are only five people in the president's private office.

Speaker 1:          05:39          So for the first few weeks in my job there, I would, um, whenever I heard the president deriving, I would just lock my door quickly, my office door, the door to my office and hide because I thought we can even meet, you know, we are just gonna meet this person and you know, he's the president. Now I also kind of feel a shame, um, for, for, for you know, a birthdate and down understanding a little bit more of course now of the environment. Um, but I saw it, it's just not proper that we even meet. So I would really hide for the first few weeks,

Speaker 2:          06:12          sister unleashing to go from that to where you ended up. Um, so the title of this book is, Good Morning Mr Mandela, but that came from a watershed moment, didn't it? So I know because I've read that book. How did that happen?

Speaker 1:          06:28          Eh, yeah. So two weeks into the job, um, I walked into Mary's office because of course I was now employed by her. I walked into the office to deliver a pile of books or something. And suddenly this group of people, a crowd of people exited her office, all men, all of them dressed in dark suits. They're wearing sunglasses indoors. Um, they have Yuring aids and they have all this technology speaking to their watches. And you realize that this is like a body guards. These are definitely the stereotype bodyguards. And immediately you think, well, you realize, wow, these people are so you need to behave in a different way. Now don't make sudden movements. And um, then things started happening in slow motion for me because this moment was so important. Um, and from this crowd of people emerged, President Mandela, the first democratically elected black president of South Africa.

Speaker 1:          07:28          And that first thing I, of course I see GM was good morning Mr Mandela. And he extended his hand to me and I thought, well, what am I supposed to do now as an hour? And you must remember I'm 23 years of age. I'm young, I'm naive, I'm stupid. I am, um, vulnerable, extremely vulnerable store. Um, and these extending his hand to me and I thought, you know, it's, it's, it was like moments that I thought, well, should I run away and can I turn around and run down this corridor? And then I realize, well, these people are all, they're going to shoot you on this golf. You're going to be blood every way. Don't run, you can't run. And then the first thing you noticed when you meet Nelson Mandela for the first time was this incredible kindness in his eyes. Um, the sincerity of his smile is infectious smile RVs.

Speaker 1:          08:24          And they looked at me, still waiting for me to do something and I took his hand. And throughout the conversation he held my hand into a firm grip, just holding onto it. And then there was a pause. You were saying something and there was a pause and I realize why. He just asked me something, but I, I have no idea what he just asked. And I had to ask him to repeat himself. So I said, excuse me, Mr President. So when he repeated himself, I realized he was speaking to me in Africans, my own, my home language and the of the white people, the language of the oppressor in South Africa. And I heard him say over the years that when you speak to a man, it goes to his head. But when you speak to your man and his language, it goes to his heart. That's what he did that day by holding onto my hand and speaking to me in Afrikaans, he destroyed my defenses immediately.

Speaker 1:          09:16          And the opened me up to the rest of my life. Um, that was the watershed moment for me because I then found this person in front of me. We stood there for about seven minutes. Well, it felt like two years, but, um, he asked about my upbringing. Luckily he didn't ask what I voted. Okay. I, because I think that was what's going to be the loss, but no, not really. He asked about my family, asked about their upbringing, about my parents, you know, everything, these, these, these, uh, very unimportant things really. And I felt respected for that moment, standing there and I, I felt undeserving because of the, of course then I knew of the history of South Africa, what happened in my country. And you feel immediately you feel responsible because the person you find in front of you is completely the opposite of what you were taught to believe about.

Speaker 1:          10:08          This man. He's friendly, he's kind, he's extremely caring in his, just his personality. So you know what women do based in a situation like that. Then we start crying as well, still holding his end. Now the DSR rolling down my face and I try and answer whatever you had. We was asking. And um, he, he saw I was crying and then he put his other hand on my shoulder and he said, no, no, no, relax. You are overreacting. Now of course he realized that I felt responsible immediately and that I felt sorry and that I, um, you know, I was just overcome with emotion. And, um, that moment really changed my entire life because I walked away from that meeting wanting to know more what happened in my country, why these things that I was told in the media, in the church, my parents, I had to question my own upbringing and have very difficult conversations with people asking, why didn't you tell me? Why did you only present one side of the street to us? Um, and um, they are, it was all started by just that one moment with Mr Mandela. Do we have any questions? Okay. Going, I have loads.

Speaker 3:          11:22          Sure. So I might just, um, hi. Um, you mentioned that this sort of role job can kind of consumer life and your life, their life becomes your life. Prior to you getting the first role, what was your dream job or where did you think he was going to be? And do you ever regret not pursuing that over? Wait, what now?

Speaker 1:          11:44          Thank you. Yes, I am at the age of 23. I really just wanted a dye job, you know, something just to earn a little money to buy my makeup. Um, I had no real ambition at that point. My father was a businessman and, um, he was a logistics men manager, um, at the South African breweries. And he had a very, very effective, uh, personal assistant. And she really embraced me. And I wanted to be as organized and, and, and, um, uh, the forming like Danny who was the secretary. So that was who I wanted to become. I wanted to marry and I have three, three children, three boys to be specific. Um, but then, you know, life happens, something happens along the way. You don't recognize these opportunities when they come along. And I think it's, um, as I said to your destiny and fight played a role, and this is the life that was handed to me.

Speaker 1:          12:39          And I always said to people that when you, when you talk of regret, um, I look at Nelson Mandela's life and I look at him spending 27 years in prison, um, away from his family, away from life, sacrificing release life so that I could have the freedom of speech, the freedom of movement, the freedom of association today. So who am I to talk about my sacrifices in comparing my life to he's my sacrifices. There was nothing, there was really none. I would do everything exactly the same if I knew what I, what I, what I do now, uh, 20, well, 25 years ago and um, this seven, 7.5 billion people on the planet now. Right. And I am that one person who had this opportunities. How do I day talk about regret. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          13:35          I Zelda and my mill fellow South African and wouldn't fabulous. Um, it was really interesting to listen to you talking about your upbringing. I mean I was born two weeks before the sweater riots, so I know about indoctrination by state and my family, uh, and by church more than most actually. Um, I was just wondering what is your perspective on how racial attitudes have changed for white people in South Africa towards other races and particularly, I Guess Afrikaners do you think we're there? We have a long way to go. And where do you see it going?

Speaker 1:          14:15          Thank you. And Yeah, I always say to people, and it feels like we haven't made progress, but we have my night lot of progress in South Africa. Look at me and change is possible and we measure things maybe differently now because of technology. Um, I think in South Africa you will always have, in any society across the world, you will have buckets of racism. People will just simply refuse to change, not for any good reasoning, but people who just don't want to change that. You always have that in any society. South Africa specifically, I think there's been massive, massive, um, uh, pro as far as racial relationships and our concern, the problem are either is that I heard someone said that we live in the age of smartphones and stupid people. So, um, what people, it's the age of instant gratification. Um, we don't listen to each other anymore.

Speaker 1:          15:09          Um, and, and, and you know, that was one of [inaudible] strongest characteristics was his ability to listen to people and to listen with the intention of really understanding what a person is saying rather than listening with the intention of, of responding. And with smartphones and social media these days, that's what we do. We look at something and without thinking or listening, we respond. Because I do want most likes. I do want to be the most famous person or I do want to shame someone. Public is a, that's who we as a society has become. Um, so when it comes to racial relations in South Africa, you have this, um, the radicals, and I'm sure you know, I'm talking about, um, we have the radicals on both white and black side that it makes it a beer that we haven't made progress or that we are moving backwards. But you know what, in all the years I have not found the people on the street that, so intolerant, as you see in politicians, people on the street in South Africa are not intolerant people in the street, one to live together. They want to bring a work together to bring solutions. So I do think we've made, we've made great progress. It's just that it appears because things are so open and so transparent in society because of, of the Internet that it appears different.

Speaker 4:          16:28          Absolutely agree with you. And especially when you see the newer, younger generations and just how, when you, when you see them going out socializing and just how comfortable they are living in such a multicultural society.

Speaker 1:          16:40          Totally. Yeah. And I always say to people that everywhere in the world, if you, if you look at the uas and did I as well, uh, you know, you have these, this very intolerant, uh, um, uh, atmosphere and um, it's always, it's everywhere in the world. It's not just America, it's not South Africa, everywhere in the world. It's the, it's the radicals shouting that makes us all move back into a more conservative societies are, I'd rather be blend and say how I really feel. The, the, the thing is that if you, if you are serious about, um, the, uh, righteousness and, and, and, and, and equality and the freedoms that people like Nelson Mandela fought for, you need to shout louder, um, and not become the blend society and the people, the person who doesn't have an opinion just because it's safer. Um, it's, it's hard. And I myself had to learn through social media or the hard lessons.

Speaker 1:          17:36          Um, but it is a powerful, powerful tool for us. And if you look at Nelson Mandela's legacy, he stood on the world stage and then at times they will maybe 50, 50,000 people in a, in a stadium that he addressed those days. We didn't, they didn't have smartphones. So the 50 people whose opinion was confined to the 50,000 people in front of him with the Internet today, all of us in this room is on some form, some form of, of, of social media. If we all have a hundred people to influence, actually our power is much bigger than it was. Um, uh, those years, you know, and we can reach more people. So how do you choose to use that responsibility, um, in this, in this age of, of, of, of influence, age of technology and use it to build the bridges, do, to promote tolerance, to promote equality, to promote the things that we all know, um, you know, makes the world a better place.

Speaker 2:          18:33          Thank you. And thank you for your time today.

Speaker 1:          18:35          Thank you.

Speaker 2:          18:37          Both my parents are Palestinian, so I'm sure you can imagine that this is something that's also very close to my heart. And I was wondering if you could be miss speak a little bit about, um, maybe Nelson Mandela, if he ever spoke about forget forgiveness from within or yeah. How he could come, come over this incident. The things that happened to him personally, uh, to work with and integrate the, you know, these people who had done this to him and in society as he was president.

Speaker 1:          19:06          Thank you. Yes. And you know, Mr Mandela at, at, at, I think about 10 years after I started working for him, he, he started this thing of saying that he misses prison. I forgot what I said. You can't say that. That's disgusting. To say that you miss prison. Don't repeat that. And then you said, and it's not that he miss prison, it's that he misses the opportunity to think about things properly. And he then said to me, I, I, at another stage I see team when I started knowing him quite well, I said, you know what? It's very unnatural of you not to hate, not to have resentment and not to want to have revenge. And with me alongside you, you know, just take the opportunity and, and, and I'm sure we can overcome this, but be angry at me because it's not natural that you are not angry.

Speaker 1:          19:52          You have to be angry at, at, at white people specifically. So I see it take it out on me. Um, we can sing Kumbaya afterwards. Again, you know, just, we can make up. Um, but you have to get it out. And then he would laugh at me and he would say to me, I'm these no anger. There's no resentment. Because he realized that unless he worth did himself, he could not take the country forward to, unless he worth it, his own anger and his own resentment. Um, he couldn't influence the people around him. And he said, it's much harder work to change yourself than it is to change other people. Um, so when it comes to something like forgiveness, when it comes to something like reconciliation that made me realize that, you know, in prison it took a lot of time thinking about these things, what is the best way forward I need is really to work at oneself much harder.

Speaker 1:          20:41          Um, in forgiving you have to also reconcile style with your own boss. I am my wisdom through my life story, I had to come to terms with the fact that that is who I was and that is why I can be so brutally honest about, yes, I was a racist when I started working for him. Um, but I've been through this change and, and, and, and we need to take the time to think of ourselves in any situation and how do I appear to other people rather than one thing to preach to people how to behave. Because we all know how difficult it is to, to change behavior. Um, if you want to stop drinking, stop swearing, stop smoking, stop, whatever it is, we, it's difficult. Um, yet we want to tell everyone around us how to be a, it's, it's, it's um, uh, behavior is like, it's like fashion. If I change my ba there other people will follow. So, you know, all of that made me realize that Mr Mandela worked very hard at himself to forgive. And it's only because he did that, that we had such a smooth transition in South Africa because people follow these example.

Speaker 2:          21:48          I am, that's very brave of you to work on herself and share this experience with us also. Thank you so much for that. Thank you very, very much. So, one final question. Um, what did you learn most from President Nelson Mandela?

Speaker 1:          22:03          I think the lesson that stands out nightly is to respect the respect people, um, irrespective of who they are and what they represent and what they appear to me to be. Um, without judgment. You know, um, Mr Mandela always said that if you question a person's integrity without valid reason, it could well be a reflection of your own integrity. And I often think of those things and I always think of the person that approaches me now stripping from all those layers because that's what I learned from Mr Mandela is strip him from what he weighs. He or she ways from the sexual preference, from the wealthy state, this, the appearance, all of that, the ideology, they, they religion, they conviction all of that politics, strip the person and connect with a human being. And that is what made him such an effective world leader as well, is that he always was able to connect to the humanity of a person above ideology.

Speaker 1:          23:05          Um, and I think that speaks of respect and, and if we can all just dry and do that, recognizing the human being behind every person that we, that we, um, that we come across, then, um, you know, that it makes the world a better place. And I be witness to the fact that I saw a person waking up every morning, um, Nelson Mandela for 19 years. He decided, and purposefully every single morning he decided if I can change or if I can touch one person's life today, I can change the world. You really believed in that individual action. And if you now look at, well, the street he did. So it's enough bower. It wasn't very, it was a super human being. He was a Audrey human being like all of us, but he made decisions and always choosing the right thing. And, and, and, and, and I think that kind of respect, that kind of self respect as well. Um, is, is the lesson that I take away from my experience. That's fascinating. So it's been amazing having you. Thank you so much for coming all the way from South Africa to be with us today. The book is available and you can buy it. It's a great read. I definitely recommend it. It's available on Google play.
