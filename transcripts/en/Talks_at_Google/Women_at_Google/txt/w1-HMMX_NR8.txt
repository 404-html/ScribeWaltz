Speaker 3:          00:32          So first of all, let me start, um, how I usually work with my clients.

Speaker 1:          00:41          Ah,

Speaker 3:          00:41          so this is the first example.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:46          Come on. Do I need your name and just say this?

Speaker 3:          00:48          So she is the lady who lives in this room. She is in the uh, in her 20s.

Speaker 2:          00:55          [inaudible] I'm a big, they bit the look there anymore. You cannot stand him up one over here.

Speaker 3:          01:03          You already see in this picture that she has full of stuff on my bed. Actually that's actually of bat. But you might not see it. And she also, how a lot of stuff on the floor.

Speaker 2:          01:14          It, C'mon [inaudible] they thought of the day, all they see on it.

Speaker 3:          01:20          And she first told me that, don't you think the bedroom is just like a storage?

Speaker 2:          01:28          They can Nigel die this time.

Speaker 3:          01:30          So when she comes home after work, she never ever feel relaxing in her room.

Speaker 1:          01:37          But

Speaker 2:          01:39          Holly Ball, I'll stop my lesson. It does look so neat and clean. Of course, nothing is on the floor.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Okay?

Speaker 2:          02:03          Tonto, Zuni easier to look at the mouth.

Speaker 3:          02:07          So, uh, my job is to consult how to organize. And Amit, I, I've been doing this job for more than 10 years.

Speaker 1:          02:18          Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:19          Characteristics or [inaudible] it's, that's my client. Never go back to the mess because they have been transformative to the [inaudible] person. Today I going to tell you how to make a hawk, have to make your house. He ordered Ela. That's when you change your life forever. It's a booster post

Speaker 3:          03:00          about the snow. Mistletoe. No, Katie. So before I start telling you what to do, let me, um, let me tell you how I start my job, how I discovered this method.

Speaker 1:          03:16          Okay,

Speaker 3:          03:16          well let's take a look at those again. You told me this, I was only five years old when I got very interested in how to organize things. So let's look you gotta [inaudible] data

Speaker 3:          03:33          it organizing Duchesnay it home [inaudible] and the [inaudible]. So I was already a picking up every single issue. Oh, the magazine that my mother was subscribing and the magazine was about how to organize the house. Well, let's take a home cook the Turkey days. So when I turned 15 years old, I start at a serious consultation to how to organize things if he posey stereo digits hasn't been time. There was a best seller book in Japan. Title, how to add the, a technique to technique to get rid of things. And I read that book and I discovered the method, the cut. Those are going to get good data. Nine [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] so you probably wouldn't, uh, you would probably wonder what I started, how I started researching, organizing things. First I started weeding every single book, publishing Japan on organizing at the Wa [inaudible] and I also keep organizing thing. I worked every single day organizing things today, my own Dube next day, my brothas room, Nick's the date next to the next two day. My sister's room for all the by the kitchen, living room, bathroom, my friend's room, friends, room, friends room, my classmate, classroom, classroom, classroom or with a [inaudible] and again, be down to my own mine.

Speaker 3:          05:28          It's got a Mustang. So I spend most of my teenage years organizing things just like that. Let's see this. And I started organizing, organizing consultant consultation business when I was 19 plus the [inaudible] Hidatsa King Sweetie. I also picked this topic in my thesis at College. It's this your, you look at it so safe to assume that I am la crazy hiding part, not the budget base. So you, you were perfect to think that I'm a fanatic organizer at this point. Yes. They look at their whole kill up [inaudible] or site. So I'd like to present Calmeri method, which I discovered to everybody here today, Heidi Musto. So let me start called mighty missile to one. So number one of come Mary Method Heidi in one shot as quickly as possible.

Speaker 1:          06:52          Okay.

Speaker 3:          06:54          Kayla [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] if you think you have to tidy around you every day, gradually, little by little, that's completely wrong. Nothing that up. Mostly Anna de [inaudible] Marico Tokai the small shop cook. I say you still got this because you need a shock that change your mind into tidying your thing.

Speaker 3:          07:48          I rotate the tongue. So you want to finish it in very short period of time. Oh, the muscle it's about has made guys number cause you to go to this. So the first important thing is to set the deadline of organizing. No, it's [inaudible]. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] can we can, okay. This of course you can sit the deadline in one week. Assuming that you're going to do that every day or you decide to do every weekend and set the, set the deadline in three months as it, what's it [inaudible] muscle? How does a killer Matsiti special event nowadays? So don't think about tiding is everyday event. It's a special event. Just like a festival. It's about dies in Ecuador. It's one of the iPhone eight has him. He made him, you might want to say no, you know, call me Miss [inaudible] name. So the number one number two item and can marry method is how are you going to do it?

Speaker 2:          09:07          Okay.

Speaker 3:          09:12          Fault by category, not by location.

Speaker 2:          09:22          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] today's,

Speaker 3:          09:26          it's very common to make this mistake. If you try to organize things in a specific location,

Speaker 2:          09:33          it's like [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          09:45          it's short. It never ends. If you try to tidy up and just one portion of the closet or one portion of the living room. [inaudible] mono category e catastrophe. Take play a couple of these. The right way to do is to organize by category and do it quickly. It's my little daughter though.

Speaker 2:          10:08          What's your [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] Yoga

Speaker 3:          10:19          cods well, for example, if you decide to organize your clothes first, take out all of the clothes in your house in one spot. Make a big pile of all of the clothes you have in newer house. Dot. Kale.

Speaker 2:          10:38          Yes. Your yet. Anatta No. Who slipped it dusty. It doesn't yet. Smitty [inaudible] then. No.

Speaker 3:          10:48          Yes. So it just, in the same way, if you decide to organize your books, take out all your books from your bookcase and pile them up in one location in there, in the house. I, he's will they sit with me? Both the, I still thought, I know. It looks hard. It's really messy. I'll tell you why you need to do this.

Speaker 2:          11:10          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] they'll know. Maybe that's comical.

Speaker 3:          11:19          If you bring out all your stuff, books, clothes in one location, you visually realize how much books, how much clothes, how many closes, how many books you have.

Speaker 2:          11:32          Well, that's, that's what [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          11:40          on a daily life. We rarely understand how much stuff we have around us.

Speaker 2:          11:46          Hey, the wall called [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] get d'amico. Nominal book pushed seal number. No. Oh, okay. This,

Speaker 3:          12:02          so it is a great opportunity if you bring out everything in one spot, we allies how much stuff you have, how many books do you have so that you can decide which one you want to keep, which one you really need to keep, and which way you can get rid of.

Speaker 2:          12:17          Talk to [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          12:36          So from, from this point, the next step you have to take is to sort them, you know, separate them, separate them between your nest ad that thinks you need and things you don't. And the criteria of this method cracked. The criteria I recommend in my method is a little bit unique. So de la [inaudible], that's number three. [inaudible] method. Septic shock. Does it spark joy cookie Nikki spark joy this. So it's, does it spark joy? This is the keyword [inaudible] I know, I definitely feel weird air in this room right now. Don't worry. I used to did the action of the ods. That's it. This is a really common reaction in my seminar.

Speaker 2:          13:41          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          14:03          so what I mean by saying spark joy, I can explain exactly what it is. So if you look at one thing, you should question yourself. If that thing makes you happy as a make you impressed,

Speaker 2:          14:25          it's a sleep state in one on it, on this man. Got To this. If they, although Arabic Dyson,

Speaker 3:          14:42          Anondi's Benny people always think first what, which one to get widow. But it is much more important to think which one to keep, which one you want to keep and lived together from now on.

Speaker 2:          14:57          Does so it's looking like come on. No intimate point though. They're not just saying oh slash mass. So I will tell you that how to make it the surgeon point the law come out as a solo mono Salado Cotto so

Speaker 3:          15:10          point number one, make sure you touch it.

Speaker 2:          15:15          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          15:18          take every single item you can think of in your hand on your hand.

Speaker 2:          15:23          Well, no, well no, no.

Speaker 3:          15:28          And Imagine how your body reacts to that moment. How you, how you feel when you touch the touch. The item

Speaker 2:          15:38          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] kind of like a door handle. SUNOCO spark joy.

Speaker 3:          15:47          So sparks Joey. This is, this is that we action from your body that we action you feel from your body. When you touched the item, you should keep

Speaker 2:          15:57          cool. Now Helen, it's like that. Even most hype can't see this.

Speaker 3:          16:09          You feel everything single part of your body faces up when you touch the item. That's the right feeling.

Speaker 2:          16:18          Jacqueline [inaudible] Dharma conceal certain Oka. So on the other hand, if the item doesn't give you any inspiration,

Speaker 3:          16:32          for example, this one, you start at feeling down

Speaker 2:          16:40          even though kind of squashed it. Soccer. Oh, body stride at feeling down. [inaudible] quite a lot. Am I mean that's hunger data issue. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] I know you are skeptical, but if you really tried to do this, you realize how your body really reacts. It's [inaudible] definitely after the seminar

Speaker 3:          17:17          when you go home tonight. Tried part of it.

Speaker 1:          17:21          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          17:22          Well that's in the Ho Ho Ho Ho, isn't it? [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] it's not mistletoe. This,

Speaker 3:          17:43          let me go over my three basic methods. Do we quickly in short amount of time and so by category and find the item if the item sparks joy ultimo [inaudible] life changing magic of tiding up when [inaudible] mass at mass. So this is my book, and if you need to know more about it, if you would like to know more about it, please pick up this book. Quit [inaudible] Miss [inaudible]. So I definitely want every one of you two week my book, but I will give you one more

Speaker 1:          18:27          technique.

Speaker 2:          18:32          Catholiccare no. Tadashi Jen Baum this.

Speaker 3:          18:35          So this is the right order of organizing

Speaker 2:          18:38          you thought. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] boundaries.

Speaker 3:          18:51          There's definitely the right order when you organize stuff, and this is how it goes. Stuff from clothes, books, document miscellaneous items. Then mementos.

Speaker 2:          19:06          Hello, Jim bow.

Speaker 3:          19:10          Make sure you follow this order.

Speaker 2:          19:15          That's an on the scale of the mall. And those was hashing this [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          19:25          it's Jonathan couples. Get, am I saying it often happens when you are going through old photos. Oh, the mentors, the items you were given from my mother. It always stops you from organizing.

Speaker 2:          19:40          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          19:48          that's why I definitely recommend you this order because this order gives you the sense of spark, joy feeling. You'd definitely learn that feeling with your body.

Speaker 2:          20:01          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible], [inaudible] [inaudible] or nothing.

Speaker 1:          20:11          Okay.

Speaker 3:          20:13          So in this order, while you start with close your body and your mind, get trained with spark, joy feeling. And, but by the time you reach to mementos, you're already good at how to do you already know how to go through momentos. Sure. Or Teen Kaytra Chico state. I'd like you to try my method with this order. Hopefully tonight. This coal mine always

Speaker 2:          20:48          works. I hope you [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] I know what the mass, so I explain all my message

Speaker 3:          21:12          to you right now by now. So I would like to open the floor for Q and a session. Please. Kinda tunnel. Should we say thank you to Josh?

Speaker 4:          21:24          So there's two mikes. There's one Mike over there and there's one Mike over there. If you'd like to line up, um, I'll get it started. Um, just cause I'm right here. So I wanted to know how do you deal with somebody who has a child, like a one year old child and there's toys everywhere?

Speaker 3:          21:42          Hmm. They buy [inaudible] advice. I did initial, yeah.

Speaker 2:          21:52          Well think the content is now, well this isn't right.

Speaker 3:          22:02          Difficult. It depends on the child's age. But, um, I have two different methods depending on the Child Age. The, uh, the borderline is about three years old.

Speaker 2:          22:11          Did come up. What are some on the Boeing, you are on the mall or the Bible or Carson [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          22:22          because if the child is younger than three years old, most of the cases parents just organize their stuff. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          22:29          Stay. The more, not the eternal, the Ariba Ocado is going to escape. They're not, they didn't, isn't it?

Speaker 3:          22:36          But if the child is over two years old, older than three years old, it's time to train them how to organize things and they're capable of it. Okay.

Speaker 2:          22:45          It's [inaudible] dot com as it one more time. [inaudible] day you'll. Yes.

Speaker 3:          22:57          And the important thing at this point is do not tell them to organize a toys. Tell them to organize the clothes. That's important.

Speaker 2:          23:08          [inaudible] oil. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          23:24          well, I'll tell you why. Because clothing is something you always put on every day. So if you learn how to fold the clothes that you always put on and put it back into the clothing, the right spot, that's the best way that they learn. We they need to organize and importance of organizing things. That's the point of this name. So a number one key is to teach then how to, how to, how to fold the clothes. Okay. Next question.

Speaker 5:          24:00          So I, I understand your method in terms of getting yourself into a mindset where you only have to do this once, but I was curious how you deal with things that we acquire. Either things that we acquire ourselves or things like gifts that come in to the house. Do you do an inventory annually or do you just not let them come into the house?

Speaker 3:          24:20          Wow, look all I know you didn't [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          24:41          these all say about this in the bite mark at the nineties

Speaker 3:          24:44          you know, in her case she doesn't really have any criteria, any order, any rules for that,

Speaker 2:          24:50          those sticker Ikea kitchen.

Speaker 3:          24:57          Because her method is completely based on if you were impressed, if you get inspired by the item. Okay.

Speaker 2:          25:05          Oh Steve Staiger

Speaker 3:          25:16          because it depends on the person, how often you want to organize or how much stuff you need to keep a wound yourself.

Speaker 2:          25:23          Hello? [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          25:43          because my method again and again, it's based on if you get inspired, you know, if you get, you know, at the sparks joy feeling that doesn't really bring it back to the crowd were cratering situation. It's not really depending on how often you should acquire or how you get the stuff. Yeah. In your room. Thank you. Thank you. A question.

Speaker 5:          26:07          Hi. Thank you so much for coming. Um, the question is I have a lot of things that I need, but I don't like what they don't inspire joy. How do I find the balance between keeping versus discarding them?

Speaker 3:          26:22          I all [inaudible] morning. Can you start? Well, you

Speaker 2:          26:31          on this card

Speaker 3:          26:33          for example,

Speaker 5:          26:34          what kind of like item g mat study books and like very old kitchen utensils that I haven't been please.

Speaker 3:          26:42          They do. Oh God.

Speaker 2:          26:46          Ah, we'll see. Talk to me tonight. We're still not there yet. I'm not only, I couldn't talk to [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] is your name.

Speaker 3:          27:03          If you judge, those items are necessary for you right now. That means those items to our making you happy.

Speaker 2:          27:10          Hold on. This email, we're still almost won the law. Get someone to stop [inaudible] milk.

Speaker 3:          27:19          So even if you're not inspired by those item items, but if they are necessary to you right now, you should keep them. Okay.

Speaker 2:          27:31          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          27:37          got it. So when recommendation recommendation I can give you is that if the item doesn't inspire you, if you don't get the special feeling, you know, try to try to talk it into it. Try, try to, you know, convince it. Convince yourself that this is a good thing. This is a good thing for you.

Speaker 2:          27:57          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          28:08          keep doing it. Even if the item doesn't inspire you, you started getting positive feeling about it.

Speaker 2:          28:14          MMM [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          28:18          so in this way, you probably find all the items you have in your house. Inspiring. I see. Thank you. I was thinking, I was like, man, next question.

Speaker 6:          28:30          Um, have you ever encountered like in some of your clients, uh, I think my question is basically about there's shared spaces. If you are sharing like a living room or the kitchen with somebody, maybe you want to keep it clean. Are the things that are important for you? Um, I know that many, but the things that are important to the other person or they, most of them and they're just all over the place. So is there like, um, a way to make it work? So I'm like dios how your space like from this and how, how does this,

Speaker 3:          29:01          okay. Can you, can you speak up? I'm sorry, I didn't catch the whole question. Okay.

Speaker 6:          29:04          Um, I'm just curious about how to deal when, how to deal with the case when most of the stuff actually does not belong to you. So it's not your decision to keep it

Speaker 3:          29:17          all hell. She had, I stayed at the [inaudible] food by I

Speaker 2:          29:28          oh, you up?

Speaker 3:          29:30          No. Are belonging to someone else. Correct. Yep.

Speaker 2:          29:35          That's all sort of, the muscle has made it. Okay. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] isn't it?

Speaker 3:          29:47          You should prioritize to organize your own items before you started thinking about someone else.

Speaker 2:          29:53          [inaudible] they go [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          30:07          can I say from my experience, you know, in the past 10 plus years of my career, um, I've definitely seen a several clients who keeps saying that, oh, I tried to tidy up my brand, but my husband does incorporate, my kids don't relate corporate. But if you look at clients saying something like that, they're, the women food are not tedding up correctly.

Speaker 2:          30:30          They had lots of what you want. Let just name this is true de [inaudible] Toyota [inaudible] so I'm not sure. No Basho so they're just on the space. They are not [inaudible] Schmidt, the committee smile [inaudible] candies.

Speaker 3:          30:56          I know you'll have to organize stuff no matter what. So the important thing is you organize your strap and put them in newer space. So separate the space with other people so you take care of your stuff in your space and leave the other stuff and other spaces to the out of people.

Speaker 2:          31:14          Magical one. Obama didn't. Scott [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          31:22          she didn't worry about this space allocated to other people because that's up to them. That's their own business. How do you use them? How to organize them?

Speaker 2:          31:33          Oh, what's wrong with Donald? Hello? Hello, hello. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          31:42          of course you can set up rules. A few rules like you shouldn't really, you know, anything shouldn't leak out or you know anything. She'd be exposed, stuff like that. But that's, that's the best way to do without the people think was that company. Good luck.

Speaker 5:          31:58          Hi. Um, thank you for coming. I was, since you talk here about how to initially kind of purge the items you have, just sorting into what to keep and not, do you also have recommendations for then how you go about organizing the items that you decide to keep or do you leave that up to the individual person

Speaker 2:          32:14          day? Bye. [inaudible] hello? Hi. Yes, there is a clear rule. What's it on? The whole thing.

Speaker 3:          32:38          So make sure to organize the same cat items in the same category. In the same spot.

Speaker 2:          32:44          Did you sang? [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          32:59          it's funny, I often see at people's houses the same I the items in the same category here and there. They're kind of scattered around. So my point is to put all of them together in one spot.

Speaker 2:          33:14          Okay. [inaudible] guys, it's not otherwise you'll [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          33:30          yes. So as I showed you earlier, um, organizing by category is very important and another important things I can definitely tell you is how to fold the clothes. That's definitely a big key. Great. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 7:          33:48          Hey, uh, thanks for coming here and thanks for taking the time to write a book. Um, I have a friend who, um, is, uh, you know, pretty serious hoarder with lots of stuff and uh, you know, when you ask him, you know, do you need this stuff? Can you throw this stuff away? The answer is, Oh, I might need it later. Or, you know, I have this grand plan to use this in such a way, but of course that never happens and you know, stuff just keep accumulating. I wonder if you have worked with clients like that and you know what you say to them and you know what the outcome is. Hm.

Speaker 3:          34:20          I know what the more that then a mom at the mall at the day [inaudible] so we stayed at [inaudible] Michelle,

Speaker 2:          34:37          that's the kid cannot otherwise

Speaker 3:          34:40          probably you were asking me the Fys to somebody food don't even bother organizing. Okay.

Speaker 7:          34:47          No actually is pretty organized. You know, he can find things. He's just a huge amount of stuff that,

Speaker 3:          34:53          oh say it's not cluttered, but he has a lot of items.

Speaker 7:          34:57          Is, is a lot of items and is kind of creeping into day. Cora. Dot. Space and so on. You kind of walk around in the House

Speaker 3:          35:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          35:10          not, we'll see. Um, what's [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          35:22          he is my client. I don't think it's important for me if he has too many items or not.

Speaker 2:          35:32          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          35:36          they will do this. I it is much, much more important to figure out if that person is happy with that amount of items.

Speaker 2:          35:43          Well, the [inaudible] what the sealer and Muslim [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          35:51          so I would probably recommend that person to imagine the ideal lifestyle for the person.

Speaker 2:          35:59          Do you go out the Legal Nolan? Could I say [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          36:31          I think your friend need to figure out what kind of lifestyle he or she wants. You know, what kind of, uh, what's the realistic life, you know, your friend wants so that he or she can figure out how much stuff to keep or what to keep, what not to keep, et cetera. And this is very efficient way of mindset for anybody. If you would have somebody like that in your family members, you know, friends around you, this is really highly recommend it. Okay. Thank you. So we have time for one more question. Those of you that were lucky enough to get here early and got a book, uh, Maria will sign them in the back afterwards. Okay. Oh, neat.

Speaker 8:          37:15          Um, uh, yeah, my question is related to something that as engineers to be thinking that sometimes a, be too much. That how frequently some we should run this task. They should have, we done it in an online, think about it all the joining all the time. It should be done in a batch. So what do you think about organizing? What's the ideal frequency that you advise? Like should we think always be running in our mind? Oh I just picked up a pen. Uh, it's probably not that useful anymore. So, and should we always be thinking about how should we do it? Something like at the extreme end would be like once in a year, which is what I do typically like at the end of the year in December I think. All right, let's, this is a bag for goodwill does the bag to throw and that's like the minimum that would be due. So what's when and when should we do that? Like should we do it like end of the year she will do the every end of the day. I should be constantly be thinking about every time we encounter thinking on how Sarah at workplace.

Speaker 3:          38:07          Oh good. I know him. Thank otherwise. Is Kai dad about okay. This, well Mike Answer is, the only answer is just do it one time.

Speaker 2:          38:31          It's sad about Anulka Toyota. It's the noisiest [inaudible] the wall [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          38:37          talking about when you should do, my answer is right now, it can be any time. But who, wait now if you cut that [inaudible] Mondays. Well, the reason is it's not for tidying up your house, tidying up your living space. It's all about how you want to spend the rest of your life from now on. Let me, I'm all day. No. [inaudible] awesome. So my, I highly recommend you to do it right now asap. Good luck. Okay. Any closing comments or anything else that those get hold to [inaudible] I know the, uh, the topic is kind of puzzling. It's very unusual, but um, you know, as a conclusion, I would like to tell you why the crested I started.

Speaker 3:          40:14          So I know every one of us has so many items. There are so many items in our life, but figuring out what items do you or how right now is figuring out how you are going to live your life. It's like you're not listening. So it stage. So my method is telling you to examine every single item in New York life. That means you will examine, you, assess your lifestyle and the life you want to leave from. No one no that, no that, that Daca, Daca.
