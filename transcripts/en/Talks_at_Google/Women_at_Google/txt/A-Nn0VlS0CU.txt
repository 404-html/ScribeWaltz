Speaker 1:          00:06          Thank you all for being here. And let's begin. So first off, Judith, we just want to start with that with beginning with what exactly is an empath. If you could speak upon that.

Speaker 2:          00:18          That's what I just want to say, how excited I am to be here. The energy here is so incredible. It's so beautiful. And I as an empath, I'm an emotional sponge and I tend to absorb other people's emotions or even physical symptoms or the energy, a place and to my own body. But when it's an and when it's like this, it's sort of true pleasure. I know it's a beautiful work environment. So I'm very grateful to be here. I'm a psychiatrist in Santa Monica and I'm also an empath. And so I combine traditional psychiatric skills with my ability to intuit what's going on in the environment and being an empath, somebody who is very sensitive, very intuitive, very open, but they tend to take on the stress of the world because they don't have the same filters that other people have. Um, and so I feel everything now, which can be a plus and a minus.

Speaker 2:          01:11          And so I wanted to write the empath survival guide to give people skills, how not to absorb the stress of others. You know, particularly in the work environment. If you're next to people, perhaps you're uncomfortable with how to just hold the space for them but not take it on because [inaudible] take it on and as a result, you know, I can get exhausted or what I was a child, I couldn't go into shopping. Malls are crowded places because I go in fine and then I walk out with an ache or pain or anxiety or exhaustion that I didn't have before and I didn't realize then as a little girl that I was picking up the energy and the emotions of other people, that the whole phenomena of emotional contagion that can happen, that we know so much now that for instance, if you're in a children's ward, a baby ward in the hospital, if one baby starts crying, the rest of them start crying in. Or if you're in a work environment and somebody you know has very negative energy and as a down or it can spread to the rest of the people like a virus. And so as an empath, that's particularly intense. And so I want to say that the, this is a gift and we need to learn how to, to manage it as well.

Speaker 3:          02:28          So I think you sort of answered part of my second question or the second question that we've put together, but it was how did you become involved in studying empathy and then because this group is a very curious and science minded, I wondered if you could speak about the science that has come out about empathy.

Speaker 2:          02:52          Yeah, the science behind empathy as fascinating. Um, it's believed that there's a spectrum of empathy, whereas ordinary empathy, which is so beautiful, this where you can feel something for someone else as they're going through it, but you don't actually take it on in your own body. So up higher on the spectrum or the highly sensitive people who have sensitivity to light sound noise like to be alone, like to be in nature, a replenish themselves by themselves rather than in crowds of people are going to parties. And then on the high end is the MPA impath who absorbs energy from other people and is extremely empathic and the science behind it includes mirror neuron research where it's thought that with people with extreme empathy, the mirror neurons, the compassion neurons of the brain are hyperactive, where they're just working on over time where we feel compassion for everything and everybody and the world.

Speaker 2:          03:51          And it could get to be too much, but it's thought that the mirror neurons are really working overtime as compared to let's say a narcissist or a sociopath who are thought, who have empathy deficient disorder, meaning they don't really have empathy as we know it. There are mirror neurons are thought to be hypoactive, meaning they're not really functioning at full tilt. And then there's the whole phenomena of emotional contagion, which I mentioned is that emotions can be catchy and we are sensitive to how people are around us. Their emotions affect us even if we're not in path that somebody else's emotions. If they come into your work environment and there a drama queen or there are chronic talker or they're a victim where they always want to talk about themselves and their victim status, it brings you down. If you're an openhearted person, you know, if you're open and you feel all this, your energy goes down, so it's important to understand emotional contagion and also the concept of dopamine or dopamine is the pleasure hormone and it's thought that impasse need a smaller amount of dopamine to feel good.

Speaker 2:          05:01          Then let's say extroverts who get their dopamine fakes from going out, you know, with big parties and big events and football games, and you get a large dopamine hit with that, but empaths get satisfied by very little interaction. For instance, as an Empath, I love one-to-one interactions. I really enjoy them. But when it gets to be a lot of people, it gets overwhelming. For me as I love to connect. And in too many people on a personal level is hard for me. I speak to large groups and that's a bit different. But on a personal level, I prefer to have small gatherings and it could be, um, the dopamine explanation and research because it just, I require very little. I get filled very easily, buy happiness, and I get drained. If I stay in a social situation for too long, it's too much for me because I get overstimulated and too much is coming in too fast with sensory overload.

Speaker 2:          05:57          So if you're an empath or you're a sensitive person, it's good to look at the science behind it. I know. And it's, it's not also the electromagnetic energy from the heart and the brain gives off information. And so we're transmitting information and if you're sensitive, I'm like, you're an empath. You can feel all this, but the problem has empass don't know how to manage all of this. And I think if you break down the science and you begin to look at the various aspects of the science, um, it's very useful in terms of explaining what you're feeling and why you're feeling it.

Speaker 1:          06:34          Thank you Judith. Um, in relation to some of the things you have talked about with the science behind it and some of the terminologies that you've used with regards to extroverts and introverts, um, that is a question sort of that when he, and I haven't read the book had talked a lot about because in the book, and it feels as if you have, you know, given your story as an introverted empath, as some of you may know, I'm extremely extroverted and I'm so, I'm more of an extrovert, empath. And so could you talk to us a little bit about these differences in terms of, you know, I, I do love going to parties and I do love talking to people and being out there and d and that fills me up versus if I'm alone, all the energies that I've picked out tend to make me really feel just more alone. I can't get out of the loop. So can you speak on,

Speaker 2:          07:32          yeah. Um, they're both introverted and pass an extroverted empath. I happened to be introverted. What, what are you, I am definitely the introverted type of empath. Yeah. And Heather is extroverted and most analysts are introverted, but some are extroverted. And by introverted, I mean I like to be alone. You know, I, I'm a writer and I liked it to be in my room alone. I know with my own energy, just allowing the creative flow to happen. I enjoy that. That's like the epitome of my life experience, you know, at that, at that moment. But extroverts, they tend to go out more and I go out, but I don't go out that much and that's okay with me. I'd rather be in nature. I'd rather be in quiet tranquil environments, um, or one to one. But you're an extroverted and passed, so you go out into environments. But my guess is you need to decompress afterwards is that, you know, at some point. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:29          I think one of the things that I sleep really deeply and I have a feeling that part of the reason that I sleep deeply is because I have, I process it in my sleep versus out in the about in the world. And I mean I just felt that, um, some of the things in the book talked about, um, some things to help an extrovert empath, if any of you can relate to that is to meetings with other people who also experience it because then you're amongst other people. Cause that was my big thing is I, I just, I can't function to take it all in and be by myself taking it all in.

Speaker 4:          09:11          Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:11          Well it just varies. I mean you might identify with various levels of this and so it just depends how you process things. And I just want everyone to know if you identify with any of this, you're not neurotic, you're not crazy. There's nothing wrong with you. It's a sensitivity level that I believe is important to develop. And certainly in massage therapy, you know, you're feeling what's going on in other people. And so the sensitivity is there. And we need more empathy in our world today. You know, desperately I be in places like Google to have empathy for each other, you know, and to make your work environment really positive and caring I think is, uh, a wonderful thing. And to have empathy for you know, the world and to bring that in. And it was something I'm really passionate about.

Speaker 3:          10:01          Thanks Judith. I feel very privileged to be in this company because there is such a spirit of inclusion and respect for diversity. And I also know that I have, you know, my, my own characteristics, um, where I get frustrated or feel victimized by things that happened to me and my day. And so when I was reading I thought, yeah,

Speaker 4:          10:31          yeah,

Speaker 3:          10:32          I wonder sometimes if I'm also an energy vampire, like do I flip between these two things? What if I'm the source of, of drain for somebody else? And how do I reconcile that with, with also being an empath? Because once I get through my mood, um, I'm kind of back to my, to myself, but I'm, one of my goals for this year is meditation.

Speaker 4:          10:58          Okay.

Speaker 3:          10:58          And I've, I've done a good job and I feel like it's helping me, but I really don't want to be that to other people. So how, how do I work on that? And how does an empath reconcile also sometimes being the energy vampire?

Speaker 2:          11:13          Great question. It's a very humble question actually, if we can all ask that. Um, there's a chapter on the book on combating narcissists and other energy vampires. And it's important if you're sensitive to identify who are the drainers, especially in the work environment, you can have a lot of different kinds of drainers. No, from the drama queen to the chronic talker, to the narcissist, um, to the passive aggressive person. So there are many kinds of energy vampires and yes, we can all be drainers. We can all be energy vampires. So not to think about is that Oh, them or him or her. But when we, you know, get in to are kind of lower selves and we get, um, no, our buttons are pushed and we're triggered and we're tired and we're not in our best selves, then you know, we can be victims, you know, or we can be talkers or we can be, you know, just people who will bring others down and so it, that's okay.

Speaker 2:          12:10          I mean that's part of being human and it's great to recognize it in yourself. I mean, that's so great that you asked that question and you know, it's wonderful also because you can catch yourself in a, with the awareness when you start getting into those energy vampires states, you can say, okay, you know, or if your coworker, you know, I hope has the freedom to point it out. You know, it's a little touchy subject, but to say, you know, I love you or I, I respect you so much, I love working with you, but you're complaining a lot today. I don't know if you have the freedom to you.

Speaker 3:          12:46          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          12:46          well Googlers tend to be extremely kind.

Speaker 2:          12:51          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:53          There. I'm sure there are conversations like that, that are done, you know, very,

Speaker 3:          12:59          I don't know what the watch fully tactfully. Thank you. I'd say I think that's true. People here are very kind and have a lot of um, exhibit a lot of tolerance and attacked and we always need to work on feeling like we can, uh, bring up a challenging situation and, and discuss it in a nonthreatening way with people. So yeah,

Speaker 2:          13:22          I hope that that's the case and it because somebody who is rolling with there being an energy vampire, it can really bring down the work environment. So it's really a toxic influence. Um, and so I feel that that needs to be addressed as you say it compassionately and lovingly. Um, because sometimes we don't know when we get into those states and it could just go on and on and on. And you don't want that in a work environment. You optionally want positive energy in your work environment. You want it to be easy and fun so your mind can just go to creative places, you know, and really envision, you know, the amazing things for yourself. And an energy vampire is important to identify because they could bring it down. And so to address it, not punitively but lovingly, you know, I hope I don't, I hope that there's a way to do that here and to recognize, you know, not to get angry at the person, but that they need understanding

Speaker 1:          14:17          nine, 10 tells money they're an energy vampire.

Speaker 2:          14:24          So, um,

Speaker 1:          14:25          and moving on with the questions. Um, we wanted to ask sort of related to that a person who, um, may be not just in a phase in that moment as an energy vampire, but that's their personality. They're like full on, complete like a narcissist or something lacking. Um, neural plasticity teaches that our brains neuro circuitry is malleable and the studies have shown that mindfulness meditation that includes loving kindness that you talked about can rewire the brain. So is it possible that somebody who could possibly have a full blown on low empath, narcissist trait personality change with that?

Speaker 2:          15:12          Um, it's very hard for narcissists to change. However, I just want to say narcissist can be really creative and productive and have great ideas and be very intuitive. So they're, they're not all negative in the work environment. It's just the problem comes in personally or you interact with that because they just think of themselves and they don't really care about what you're feeling because they lack empathy. The full blown narcissist now who are self absorbed and they become cold withholding and punishing when you don't do things their way. So it doesn't make for a great management style. It really doesn't. And so, you know, hopefully they're not too many here, you know, in terms of narcissist, because it doesn't foster creativity. It shuts people off. It makes people feel small and damaged and not heard and not listen to. And, and it's so important. If you're sensitive and you're an empath, you know, you care, you know, you really care about others and you don't want to be shut off.

Speaker 2:          16:10          But if you do have narcissist here, you know, just take advantage of all their strengths as nobody's all bad. You know, the, there's a Buddha and a demon inside everybody. It just depends on what we feed. We want to feed the best parts of ourselves. I know the most sensitive, the most loving, the most compassionate, you know, and then understand that we can be energy vampires. Sometimes we can be a get go through a bad period. Uh, so I think with a narcissist, if you look at what they can give to a work environment and not expect them to be your best friend, it's a lot of patients who come to me, I have narcissistic bosses and that's really hard because you really have to frame things in terms of how it will serve them for them to be on your side. And it's tedious, Ego stroking and as hard for sensitive people. But if you want to have a vacation, let's say you don't say, I'm so tired, I really need a break now they won't give it to you. But if you say this will serve the business, um, then a narcissist was like, oh, okay, how, and so then it would make more sense to give you a vacation then. So ideally you don't have to do that, but in case you're ever faced with it, now that's one tactic that will work.

Speaker 3:          17:25          I think that leads really nicely into the next part of our questions, which really involve how do we work with these tendencies in a workplace? What are some solutions when we're faced with small personal space, a lots going on, lots of distractions and, and

Speaker 2:          17:49          then we want to, uh, be able to be as creative as possible and work at our highest level. So what can we do as, as empaths to foster that? Alright. Right. Well, one thing I noticed here, Google is the high ceilings. I mean, that helps to have a feeling of space and it's very beautiful to me. I feel like I could breathe here. I don't feel claustrophobic. I don't, everywhere I look, it's high ceilings. So I'm not, do you have low ceilings, other places here? Not so many. No. Yeah. So that helps with the feeling of spaciousness. Um, but in terms of techniques to use, um, I really suggest meditation. There's a four, a three minute meditation where you can just check in with yourself for three minutes, close your eyes, focus on your heart, focused on something really positive in your life and breathe out stress and focus on the positive.

Speaker 2:          18:50          And during those three minutes you can recalibrate yourself and you could come back to your center B as part of the skill of being an empath and an environment is learning how to come back. When you start to swirl or when somebody pushes your button and you're triggered or you're disappointed by something, or if something happens in your personal life and suddenly you go down, you know, to recenter yourself through med at this three minute quick meditation is a a form of coming back to you that a lot of people don't know how to do that. You know, once you swirl, they just start swirling. And so learning how to breathe the breath is very powerful because the breath, you can breathe out stress and you can breathe in clarity or calm, peacefulness. But to breathe out stress. The breath actually carries the stress out of you, out of your body, which is what you want.

Speaker 2:          19:43          So these regular meditation breaks, I really suggest, you know, to help you feel better and to help you reconnect with your creativity. I keep coming back to that with this audience. Um, that creativity is so important for you to be able to really play up here and, and to play and to feel comfortable. You have to be in a good environment. And you mentioned that you have a close environment and some places that there are a lot of people in a, in a small space, lots of people in a small space. Um, how much room do you have between you? I'm not the best person to speak to that because I used to, I work in a spacious place. That mushroom. Okay. All right. That's not much room. All right. And so you need to create your own personal space. At least you have that much of them.

Speaker 2:          20:30          It is an open space environment. Okay. All right. That's particularly challenging for sensitive people. And so you have to make your desk, your spiritual station and know your energy station. However you can be comfortable there with pictures of people. Um, I wear the Kleinian around my neck, who's the goddess of compassion. If she really sets a tone of compassion. Um, sometimes gemstones are important to put around the desk or whatever is it centers you. It could be anything. It doesn't have to be spiritual objects. It could be anything that you love to create a circle of safety around your desk and like a bubble of invisibility, you know, if you feel like being invisible. And visualization is very important for that. If you have an open space environment to visualize a protective bubble around your environment. And although you see other people and you hear them talking and they're moving, you're in your safe place.

Speaker 2:          21:29          And so what you're doing is somebody in your own inner power to create a visualization for yourself. You're not helpless in this environment. And when you begin to experience that, you'll feel incredible relief. So then you can focus. You know, it's, um, when I learned to meditate, I learned how to do it in a room where next store they were having, it was a Sunday and they were having meetings, prayer meetings with songs. And so when I was learning how to meditate, I had a lot of external distractions, which was really helpful for me because I wa I learned how not to be thrown off. And that's part of this path of empowering sensitivity is how do you learn to center yourself, admits distraction and chaos. You see? And so you can look at it as a fun challenge. And I don't know if, um, can you hear other people talking next to you?

Speaker 2:          22:21          You can hear them. All right. Are you allowed to wear earbuds here? Okay, well sometimes that's helpful. The, and playing nice music so you can use, you know, these techniques, but most important energetically you want to just focus on your own energy, your own space, your own creativity and not on the, somebody cracking their gum next to you as empaths are very sensitive to that, like coughing, cracking of gum, clearing of the throat. Um, you know, all that like, you know, just, it's important to, to focus on yourself so that you can screen out external distractions and you could be in your best place.

Speaker 1:          23:03          So on that note, talking about the things that we can do in our workplace. Um, like one thing that I have told kinds that I know that they find their peace on weekends out in nature. I've told them go, you know, get a picture of that and put it in your work space so that when you're feeling that overwhelmingness and your mind's just racing and everything's distracting, you look at that picture to sort of calm that down. Um, and on that note, talking about the different types of impacts, you do speak of that in your book, would you like to sort of go over a few of those for people? Because once you sort of recognize this is what I took

Speaker 2:          23:46          away from the book, what type of empath that you are, there's going to be different tools, obviously that will work for you better than for a different type of empath. Yeah, there are different types of impasse and some impasse or emotional and paths where you're especially sensitive to other people's emotions. For instance, if somebody is angry and they come into work angry, you take it on. No. Or if somebody is depressed, you can be sitting next to somebody and suddenly your energy is going down and you're starting to feel a little depressed and you pick up their emotions. And so empath are sensitive to emotions and some are even sensitive to physical issues where you can pick up, let's say your coworker has back pain and suddenly you're back begins to egg. So it's just something to watch out for in yourself. Um, and then there's impact called intuitive empath.

Speaker 2:          24:38          And these impacts are very open to their intuition. Now really tuned into intuition. I personally feel as a psychiatrist and an empath that is so vital to listen to that inner voice and impasse have a, you know, a little bit more open than other people, but everybody can connect to their intuition. And that's the still small inner voice that comes through gut feelings or the enteric nervous system in the gut has actual neurotransmitters that convey information like the brain. So what's going on in your gut can convey information. And so as an intuitive empath, you can train yourself to listen to your gut feelings about somebody. Let's say you're hiring somebody and they, oh, they look totally good on paper, they look amazing, but when you're sitting across from them, your energy is going down. Now what is that telling you? You know it. It could be that this isn't a good match for your particular environment as you want to have people who are energetically harmonious and when you hire people and when you interview people, when you're an intuitive empath, you can develop intuitive skills in terms of you look at what they present on paper, but you also can feel what's going on in them is these are you listen to your gut feeling, you listen to a hunch.

Speaker 2:          26:00          You listened to an Aha knowing that it can be waves of goosebumps that say, yes, this person is right. This is exciting. This is going to be a great match or you can, you know, feel a kind of a downward, the mud, you know, or a wall or something that's unpleasant. But when you train yourself as an empath and as a human being to listen to your intuition, it can give you extra information. And so that's really essential. But what happens is sometimes people don't listen to their intuition and they second guess themselves. You know, particularly in a very linear environment, you know, where you're given information but something doesn't feel right. Um, I really encourage you to weigh that. No in your relationship choices and in how you do with your coworkers. Because it will tell you, maybe I should stay away from this coworker today.

Speaker 2:          26:52          Maybe they need a bit more space and it's a gift to give them that, you know, and to honor that they seem to be in their own world. They seem to want to go into a cave. All right, fine. I'll give that to them and I won't talk to them that much if possible. You see, so you can really have deep compassion for your coworkers and for others by developing this skill of intuition that many empath having some of the specific types, some impasse or animal empath. I see there's a doggy on here that's a great, um, that you're allowed to bring dogs here. Oh, that's amazing. Being dawn concert, you are and, and pass have a communing with animals, with dogs, with cats, with wild animals, you know, with birds that they, some feel a very deep connection to animals. Um, and some have a deep connection to the natural world and plants, they love to have plans.

Speaker 2:          27:48          They love to garden. Um, and some have of you, as you said, a connection to their dream life. And there were some impasse or dreamers and they could tune in to their dreams to get guidance in the morning by remembering your dreams. So these are all intuitive outlets that you can really explore and play with, you know, as a sensitive person as opposed to being a, a disembodied head who's just a linear person who lives up from here up. Um, I'm really advocating being your mind and reasoning and in the body. I'm listening to your intuition and your sensitivities as you can be both. And sometimes, um, there's a bias against men doing this. And I have a Facebook empath group and it's over 11,000 people and it maybe 85% men, I mean women and 15% men. So no, it's harder sometimes for men. I don't know how it is. So there are a lot of men in this audience, which is fantastic. Um, if it's harder to come out and salmon, intuitive feeling person. And I'm also really intelligent and smart and creative and grounded. So to balance everything for both men and women who are empath.

Speaker 3:          29:06          So there was one other empath that I wanted to ask you about and I'm also kind of looking at time and want to make sure that we leave some time for people who have questions out there. So you had spoken about being in nature, actually I think it was you, Heather, but it came up again when Judith was speaking and you speak about earthing or, or write about earthing in your book. And I often will tell my clients after their session, you know, you may want to take a few minutes, we're close to the beach or find a patch of grass and take your shoes off. Stick your feet in it. Can you speak to how

Speaker 2:          29:42          that helps us? That's so helps us in so many ways now to get out in nature and take your shoes off and go barefoot in the grass. I go barefoot on the ocean and just feel yourself what that feels like and just the freedom and an often reminds you of how you were as a child, if you had the opportunity to be in nature as a child. And to reclaim that and to just go play and feel what's coming up. The electronics change with the earth. I mean I have very strong feelings about the earth and preserving our environments and how we connect to our environment and how our bodies are intimately connected to the earth. So of course we're going to feel if the earth is harmed. And so the mission of helping the earth, these to be number one above all things as far as I'm concerned.

Speaker 2:          30:31          And um, you know, it's difficult for impasse in this day in time with the support of the earth not really being there and our social environments, it's just devastating. You know, for me, when I hear about certain ravages of the earth, however, you know, you can go out and connect. You'll see people aren't trained to connect to the earth. And if you stay in an office for too long or it's not actually an office is an open air environment. But if you stay closed up too long, if you stay at your computer too long, you can get kind of sealed off from the world and you want to connect. You want to take a break from the computer and your work and go out. You're so close to the beach. You could take a walk and go down to the ocean and see all the c goals and you know, get into your child again.

Speaker 2:          31:15          You know, I know you, you know, you're adults and you work at Google and you have very, you know, important jobs and you're, you know, you really are playing a role in bettering the world. But it's good to also let that down, you know, and go and play. You know, if you can't, it's go and connect to the earth. And you could lie on the earth. You could climb a tree, you could meditate by a tree. No, but, but to have that playfulness, you know, not impasse tend to get overly serious and life is chart. So you want to have as much playfulness as you possibly can to remind yourself of that because you deserve it. You know, I kind of live with the philosophy of this is the day I'm given the eternal now and I don't know about tomorrow necessarily. I know about today and I want to make it the best possible.

Speaker 2:          32:03          And that isn't just work, work, work all the time though I've always been a workaholic and a, I've always loved to work. When I was a little girl, my report card, the teacher said, you know, I need to take the pressure off myself. Like I'm seven years old. My parents didn't give me that. I was born that way. And so, you know, it's important for me to find the balance because I could get lost in my, in writing and patients and what's, you know, face, you know, in the Internet, you know, going on Google and googling things all the time. And so it's important. Dance, dance is a good way to, to sort of get your body moving so you're in your body. Yeah, yeah. But just moving and, you know, being in the body as an important way to balance and, um, but I just want to acknowledge the, this environment, you know, how creative it is and you know, what an opportunity you have here, you know, as employees of Google, um, to really, you know, create and change the world. It feels like and changing the world is here. It just feels so important to be here.

Speaker 2:          33:18          So you brought up children and I know there's a section in your book about that. And I, I guess part of changing the world is also making sure that we influence our children to be good human beings as they impact the world themselves. So it's so important to support the sensitivities and our children as they're going to save the world. And now they need to be raised in a way where, you know, you look at them and you say you're sensitive, you're open and that's beautiful and there's nothing to be ashamed of. And just because you may not want to be on the football team and you may want to go into the forest and meditate, you know, that makes you unique and beautiful will, you don't have to fit these children, these sensitive children or indigo children is new children that have a certain consciousness coming into the world.

Speaker 2:          34:10          You don't want to fit them into some arbitrary mold. You want to really help them and support them. And a lot of times as children, you might not have been supported, you know, in your sensitivities or intuition. And that hurts because I know as an empath child and I had to physician parents and 25 physicians in my family, so I came from this long lineage of scientific thinkers and I was a feeler. I would feel things, I would know things. I would, you know, process it differently than a traditionally scientific personal. Although I did go through medical school and I conquered, you know, that to balance both the intuitive and the, you know, the scientific. But it wasn't how I was born. And so I've had to reclaim that as a psychiatrist and as an adult. And that's what I'm inviting you all to do, is to be as linear as you want to be as inventive in your minds, but also, you know, reclaim your sensitivity and your openness and your playfulness and your connection to the earth. We can be everything.

Speaker 5:          35:15          Okay.

Speaker 2:          35:16          I love that. Yeah. Shall we surround the, so we have about 10 minutes or so. If people have questions, just go ahead and raise your hand and we'll be glad to throw you. Are you good at catching? I'm not usually, I mean even that's so creative. She's through the mic and a little box over to him.

Speaker 6:          35:42          Um, hi. Uh, I had a question. I noticed in your bio it mentioned energy awareness. Um, and through my process, understanding the human energy system and how to work with it has been really valuable for me. I did it through medical Chigong. I'm just curious what kind of energy awareness a little bit. All right. And just curious what kind of energy awareness techniques he used in your practice.

Speaker 2:          36:05          Can you repeat that for me? And so he wanted to know what kind of energy awareness techniques that Judith uses in her practice in. He found it through, um, I'm sorry. Was it and she gone, she gone.

Speaker 2:          36:21          She Gong. It's a wonderful way to center your energy as a movement where you center your energy and you feel the universal energies in your body. And that's a beautiful energy technique. Any, I mean you could even do a cheek on here, you know, to go out somewhere in practice, you know, here and just do a few movements. What I use in my practice is that I teach people to meditate and I also work on them energetically or I put my hands over their various shockers to balance it and teach them to open up their hearts. Shameless plug. We offer, um, ty gene, which has Chigong elements in it weekly. So yeah, so I, I'm brought in instructor, we weekly for a, and you can join us at the, I'm lax techy group and emails and I in some Mondays from four 30 to five 30 and there is a cost because I brought in the instructor but we meet over in the bin five courtyard or inside the bunker when it's called. That's fantastic.

Speaker 7:          37:31          Lot of people who are not empathetic. Right? Uh, they might be kind, they might be changing the world and not, might not be necessarily now cystic is there some tool, some kind of Myers Briggs personality test kind of thing so that they recognize that they are not empathic? Yeah, no. And if there is one and then we know what do we do with it once we have one, three, now the person is not the empathic. What are the actions apart from meditation, can a person take to sort of develop that?

Speaker 2:          38:09          That's a great question. Um, once you, how do you identify if somebody doesn't have empathy and then how do you deal with it? Okay. Um, the best way is to provoke a small conflict because if you provoke a conflict, you can see how they deal with it as if they have. Why are you laughing? Conflict, conflict. Oh, it'd be really fast for that little conflict. Let's say they say, let's meet today at 10. And you say, well, I can't do it at 10, but we'll do it at 11. I mean, even just a little, little thing like that. Um, somebody who doesn't have empathy is going to become cold, withholding, judgmental, punishing and change. They're very nice personality and to a different one. And so narcissists who don't have empathy, um, don't like it when you don't do things their way.

Speaker 7:          39:03          All right. Have you met people like that? No, I just meant to say that an mean maybe there's another classification out there which is basically kind people, not necessarily people, but they are not empathic. They have don't have the mirror mirror neurons as to say they do not understand what are you going through. So did you cannot relate to you. Uh, in general they sympathetic but not empathic. All right. They're very kind people that love data but they are not, they cannot understand what you're going through your emotions and will state this that you come in and you, you look very sad and you don't want to work. But let's say as a manager or somebody else, but he doesn't recognize that I knew was thinking why does he not recognize that? So they are lack empathy. Just it don't know but they're trampling over somebody.

Speaker 2:          39:52          Yes. Let me make the distinction of lacking empathy versus someone just being in their heads. Because sometimes people are self absorbed or in their heads and they're not tuning in. Emotionally happens. But that doesn't necessarily make them a narcissist and they could be the kindest person, but they can also be out of touch with their feelings. Yes,

Speaker 7:          40:12          exactly. That, that they could be. When I see a lot of people in general are very kind to bed on Tinder word, but when it comes to personal relationship, because they are very smart and then, and brains, right, they did. They don't tune in today. Empathic centers are, they not have the Blob tempurpedic center. So they just relate to to your brain.

Speaker 2:          40:32          Yes, yes. But they're kind people.

Speaker 7:          40:34          They find people didn't want to harm anybody. They don't want to, but they do not understand the actions. In fact, other human beings.

Speaker 2:          40:43          Okay. Do you, do you find that that's common? That's common really. Okay. Well that's, yeah. Not narcissist necessarily rate. Right. Well, I mean that leaves an opening on emotional training and intuitive training for people here. You know, it's something that's really important to train in a safe environment. And if that's the case, a lot of times it's something that think about, but in terms of your expectations of them, you could come in with a broken heart and they probably won't see it. Yeah. And to not take that personally.

Speaker 7:          41:14          Yeah. Yeah. I understand about it, but take it a is a, is a way I was, I was thinking more in terms of uh, in Myers Briggs test, you go take an online test and it tells you what letters you are ENTP I STP, whichever it might be the case. So is there an online test? I can go and say, hey, you're not empathic. You is

Speaker 8:          41:34          out one, 230 or 20. So that we know and we can say to each other, oh, we had pointy hundred so we know each other in some objective way.

Speaker 2:          41:45          I know an objective way. All right. And that would be in well and you would want to pass that around and have everyone take it.

Speaker 8:          41:51          Yeah, that will be, that will be the Google way of doing it.

Speaker 2:          41:55          All right. Well, I mean there's certainly a self assessment test at the beginning of this book with 20 questions that people can take and determine where they are on the empathy scale. Um, but you know, there could be other, other ways to do it too in terms of creating more formal um, tests and scores. But that's, that's a good idea. Um, but I think the goal would be really to help people recognize that that's right. Yeah. Cause the more empathy you have, the better your work environment is going to be because you're going to feel safe. You don't want to lose it. You don't want to overdo it. You know, cause sometimes impasse can be, you know, help too much and they give too much. They want to be too compassionate and they're looking at you in the eyes too deeply so it feels intrusive. You know, that, that kind of thing. You don't want to become that, but you want to become smart, intuitive, caring and blend it all. And that takes some training sometimes to do it and hopefully the book will do it. But trainings can help

Speaker 8:          42:53          but proposed you who recognize it. At least you can narrow that this person's at least like that. It's okay.

Speaker 2:          42:59          Absolutely. But you know also to recognize that being a good person is the best thing anyone could do. And even though, you know, they might lack other, you know, abilities. If you're a good person, that's a beautiful, beautiful thing. You know, it really is. So to recognize that in each other and you know, to affirm that, you know, Nama stay, I respect the spirit within you. I know to be able to say that to each other even, you know, with all your faults, you know, we have tons of faults, all of us, we're not perfect. But if we do the best we can and we're loving people, no, give people credit where credit is due. And when you can affirm that and others, the whole environment in the work environment can just increase the vibration, increased the frequency when you do that, as opposed to looking at all the negatives and someone, it's much easier to look at the negatives, you know, and criticize them and what they're doing wrong. But the shift in consciousness in terms of awareness of empathy is trying to see the best in people you know, not their worst. You want to bring out the best in people.

Speaker 8:          44:02          When we talk about empathy, normally we're talking about social with other people. So I thought kind of separate question a little different. Here we are. I'm an engineer. I think a lots of other engineers and even Judith yourself, you are Saudi. You like to work like writing by yourself. Sometimes I feel the stress actually from the work, not with interacting with other people. Uh, when you have something difficult, something you don't understand for a while, especially later of the day you of tired Rio, a cognitive capability can, tends to be done. And my personal experience sometimes in that situation I started, you'd have self doubt and it's kind of become a downward spiral. And that's an active energy can I can bring with me home even though I'm already out of work, I still think about it. But maybe after night, the Max day I look at it again, I can't figure it out. It seems so simple. So what can you suggest to do to prevent, you know, just to bring that negative frustration out of work when you want to not think about it at that time.

Speaker 2:          45:29          Very good question. How do you not take the work energy home basically? And you mentioned self doubt. Yes. Did you mentioned self doubt? Yep.

Speaker 8:          45:38          Because you know, I can figure this out. Maybe I was not good enough.

Speaker 2:          45:43          All right, well I'm a big believer in affirmations and so it's important to really affirm every day what you did well. No. And at the end of the day you could make that a ritual to just say, what did I do well today? What did I contribute? And it could be the tiniest thing. It could be a big thing. It doesn't matter. But instead of you know, the self doubt, no one, I talk about the demon and the Buddha inside. Um, the self doubt comes from more the demons side. You know, where you have to work with it. Everybody has self doubt. We all have self doubt. When you affirm I did this well today, I did that well today and I brought, I was breathing today. I was walking into today, I came to work, I had a day of life, you know, really, I mean, you can just get, always get back to that, you know, to uh, to affirm that.

Speaker 2:          46:30          And also to have a closure meditation when you are ready to leave work to actually sit, close your eyes, breathe center yourself, say thank you for this opportunity of work today and now I'm leaving. And so to have an official ritual of closure and to let go of what happened at work and that will help you. I don't, when I'm finished with my patients, no. Usually I forget about it. I know I go onto the next thing, you know, unless there's something in particular that I, you know, that I need to think about a little bit more. But I go on, I'm 100% present when I'm working. Like with here, I'm 100% present, but when I go on, I want to grab the next moment, you know, and inhabit the next moment. So it's good as a sensitive person to be present in the moment and then keep moving.

Speaker 2:          47:22          And I was like the warrior, your make your yell and then you move, you know, and that's it. And so we know that that's to think about to be in the moment. And how do you be in the moment now you can have a mantra even, you know, let it be no, I'm being in the now, you know, and to bring your mind back cause we have control over our thoughts, our attitudes and our mind. And so when we go into self doubt, you'll go, ah, Sam left out. I know you all right. Instead I'm going to breathe, I'm going to focus on my heart and I'm going to look at what I did well and let's say I need improvement in something. I will work on that. And we all, you know, are constantly works in progress. And so to have a lot of compassion for yourself every day and what you go through, we all go through so much. You know, all, you know, as a psychiatrist, they, I know well how much we all go through. And so just, you know, give people a break, see the best in them and you know, try and be empathic for what they go through, even if it's not something maybe you can relate to, but if you're empathic and your heart goes out, no, that's a good thing. It's really a beautiful thing to relate to one another in that way.

Speaker 9:          48:35          Hello. I'm kind of along those same lines. I find what's really emotional draining for me as being constantly connected, um, via my phone or social media, things like that. Do you find that it's important for, especially for sensitive people to have that time to disconnect? Maybe have a day without their phone, like is their tips and tools that you'd recommend?

Speaker 2:          48:56          I think it's important to have a technology fast, um, and not go on social media and turn off your phone and leave your phone at home and go for a walk on the beach so that you're not tethered to the phone. I mean, even in the gym, sometimes I bring my phone and I put it on the, you know, the treadmill and I have to talk to myself. Just leave it in the locker, tell, bring it, you know, your world can exist, you know, for a short period of time without that phone. But you know, it's very addictive technology and so you have to really make that extra effort to say no to it. And it makes me feel so much better when I'm not near anything. You know, there's a, um, a monastery that we go to sometimes in the, in retreat Tassa horror monastery.

Speaker 2:          49:42          They don't even have electricity. They have no cell phone coverage, they have no electricity, kerosene lamps. So you're forced into, you know, a beautiful retreat of, you know, without technology. So I think that makes you better when you come to work, when you have those breaks as if you keep checking and checking and checking. It puts you in a Zombie like state and that's not in the body. And so to put it down a little bit and go dance, I think dancing, you know what you mentioned or movement, any kind of movement, the Xi Gong Movement, dancing, walking, exercising, looking up at the stars and the sun. It just replenishing is very important without technology and just

Speaker 1:          50:28          want to add one thing and that is when we talked about the children and what we're teaching our kids that our future is, we're teaching them this importance of a, how much our phones are. And they will say, what do you mean you, you, you lost your phone. What are you going to do? Like even they as young as five are picking up on our attachments to our phones. So

Speaker 3:          50:52          my daughter, very worried one night because my husband went out for a walk and didn't have his phone. And I thought, oh this, this is a day without a phone. I think it's a new g. Did she class?

Speaker 1:          51:06          And thank you both Heather and Wendy for half a my hair and thank you all for coming.

Speaker 5:          51:13          Thank you. Thank you all for coming.
