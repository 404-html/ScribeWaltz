Speaker 1:          00:06          I'm very excited to welcome back. Ooh, one of those incredible women on Kumar. So many of you may remember Anjalee as one of our fearless lawyers, a senior counsel who worked on projects from Google x to youtube, but many more of you may remember Anjalee for hosting the Act Google Speaker series, bringing in incredible chefs like Anthony Bordain. Um, Jacques Pepin, Marcus Samuelsson. I hope you got some really good secret recipes from Ali's [inaudible]. Got a lot of really great reservations. I will tell you, I still know cod. Yeah. Was Nice. Um, and to entertainers like quest love who you might remember from her series lunchtime at Google shortly, but it's so fun. Delightful. Um, Anjalee like most of us knows that most people's hearts live in their stomach and so you're always having people who could talk to us about food. So after leaving Google Anjalee went to be founding general counsel and founding head of social innovation at Warby Parker.

Speaker 1:          01:10          And most recently was the chief people officer at Cheddar. And throughout these jobs, Anjali was also pretty busy starting a family with her beloved husband at tool in 2010. She had a daughter Zia and it was right around then and that she started to think about religion. And as a new mom myself, I can totally relate to the fact that there's nothing like having a baby to make you peek your head up around out of your bubble and say, how do I explain the mysteries of life? Yeah. Um, so Angela is here today to tell us a little bit about how she turned over every rock in what seemed like every corner of the worlds religions and spiritual groups and sects in her incredibly delightful book stocking God. So without further ado, please help me give a warm welcome back to Angela Kumar. How'd you so much for having me? It's such a thrill to be here and to actually not know everybody in the audience means that more Googler showed up and just my team, which still meeting. So Anjalee tell us a little bit about yourself. Like what was life like growing up for you? Where did you grow up? How did you kind of get to this place where you were asking all these questions? It's

Speaker 2:          02:27          sure. So I was born in Brooklyn actually, but raised outside of Chicago, Real Brooklyn Woo Woo for Brooklyn and raised outside of Chicago by Indian parents. I'm John is my religion. So it's sort of a small, very minority of religion, at least outside of India, but raised culturally Hindu and also went to Catholic school. Like you might get a sense of why I wrote this book when you start hearing because I'm not like there are a lot of religion and a lot of traditions around me. And it, for me it was really cultural and it was just something that I never really much about or questioned because it was so seamlessly interwoven into our lives. And I just never felt the need to ask the big questions. And as you said, it was when my daughter is zeal was more in, which happened when I was at Google, not physically at Google, but where do, oh, hold on.

Speaker 2:          03:14          We're having a mic and show. Oh, keep going. Okay. So, um, it was while I was employed at Google, I had my daughter Zia about eight years ago, almost nine years ago. And it was in a conversation with my dad when he said to me soon after she was born, he was like, Oh, you should take her to the temple. There's a John Temple out in queens and you should take her there to show her what we believe. And I was like, what do we believe? I was like, Huh, that's a really interesting question. I was like, what do we believe? It was like, wait, did I miss something? Because I was injured the traditions and I wanted to do all the right things and like, you know, check off all the traditional boxes. But I was like, I don't really know what I believe. And I just had never thought about it.

Speaker 2:          03:53          So I decided to start researching because I realized there was at some point there be the set of questions that my daughter would inevitably ask me. Like, what happens when you die? Is there a god? How'd you find happiness? What's the meaning of life? Things that I could not Google an answer too, but early, that was the start of the journey. Um, and so I started doing research and I was like, well, what do I really believe? And maybe I'll go see this healer and go do this other thing. And it started as a very quiet thing because I worked at Google and I was like, everyone's going to think I'm in bananas. And I worked at Google in the legal department, so the last thing you want is, are like going off and doing all this crazy stuff. Um, but then as I started telling people, and so, especially colleagues, a Google ad, they, they really surprised me because they started being like, oh, have you checked out this thing? I'm like, I know this healer downtown, or I saw this showman, or I've tried Iowasca or whatever. And I was like, what? I was like, everybody's doing this stuff except for me. So like I'm the only one who hasn't been searching. And that's what's sort of the whole,

Speaker 1:          04:48          I, well, I was looking, um, while I was thinking about like, what can I talk with you about? I was looking at emails that we exchanged and there was one titled Amaa. Um, and you and I are both friends with Gopi, um, who are extraordinary. As I said, if you guys don't know Gopi should, but he started the Yoga [inaudible] group and he teaches yoga out in California amongst the many other things that he does, including being a Googler. And um, he turned a lot of us on to Emma who's, who's sort of the hugging saint. Um, and I know you wrote about Alma in your, in your book. Can you tell us a little bit about her? She's actually my opening chapter. Um, and it was through a conversation with Gopi where he was like, oh, I follow this woman, I'm a, she goes around the world literally hugging people. That's her job. That's what she does. It sounds like, I mean, kind of a weird job, but it's, you know, she

Speaker 2:          05:40          makes a lot of money doing this and so she goes around the world giving hugs and she was coming just to midtown Manhattan and it was July 4th weekend, many summers ago. So I was like, well, I'm going to go check it out. And I jumped in a cab and I go there and it was, it was so interesting. It was like lines out the door, thousands, thousands of people. I stood in line for probably over four hours waiting for a hug and then have this experience of like settling in and like, it was like an overfamiliar Auntie. And you know, if you've ever experienced that, what you're kind of like, this is getting uncomfortable. Like I'm just, can you let you, she won't let go. But then suddenly you're like peeled off of her and like thrown off too. You don't like just like a puppy but like just thrown off.

Speaker 2:          06:19          And it was um, deeply unsatisfying for me personally, but so satisfying to so many people there who were in tears, having hugs from her and who are really deep followers. And I think that also helped me sort of go into all of these experiences with a really open mind being like, you know, just because it's not right for me. There might be something that I can take from it and then continue on the journey to find what really resonates for me. But then I really respect the fact that Gobi and other friends of mine really believe in her and really follow her around the world and go every summer to get a hug from her. I have not gone back, but there's great food when you go. And so if you're not into the hug, there's amazing vegetarian food in the basement of the hall.

Speaker 2:          07:02          It's nice. Yeah. There's always something redeeming and all of these things. So speaking of belief, your husband is a doctor, right? As a scientist, what did he, what did he think about things as the Nanas? What do you think he is? Um, he is the most patient man in the universe. So he is an interventional cardiologists. Like he's a super amount of science. And He, I think for him, again, so much of spirituality, religion has just been cultural for him. So he doesn't really think about it. He doesn't waver around these questions. He sort of goes through the motions of religion. He's Hindu was raised Hindu and I think if pressed would call himself into, um, but he definitely, there were moments when I was doing the research where he's like, yeah, you're not going to do that. I'm like, that's crazy. Or when I would come back from things and he was like, oh, my word.

Speaker 2:          07:49          Like to like the, um, the chanting, the tantric sound healing. I think that was, that definitely tested our relationship, but he's got a good sense of humor. So he mostly went along with it. Nice. Yeah, he did not come with me on it. Anything that stuff? No, just one. He did the meditation with me. He learned TM. He didn't do the Vipassana, but he did a transcendental meditation course with me. But I found out later from him it was because I had told him about all of these athletes that did it with professional athletes that he really respected and admired. So he was like, oh, really? Like that's kind of cool. It was like, you're not a football player. Like, when do you think this is gonna come in handy? But he was really into like the mental toughness aspect of it. I really want to do it because of David Lynch. So I, that's where I learned David Lynch. Let me write some sort of crazy. It's going to let you write a book and telling you. Yeah, baby. I caught the big fish, which is a book by David Lynch. Um, so

Speaker 2:          08:47          after you went to Alabama, what was sort of like your next staff? Like you're, you're, you're like, okay, I did this. I'm in New York City. This doesn't work for me. I know you started traveling around the world. You mentioned that your husband didn't go with you, but I know your sister went with you to Brazil, right. To See John of God. And so I thought the John of God's story was particularly a little crazy. So John of God, um, my sister and does not appear in the chapter because the narrative just worked better without her in it. But she was there with me. John of God is a healer. That a medium is what they consider him. So there's a lot of people around the world, including Oprah who really believe that he can cure all that ails you, whether physical, emotional, spiritual. And so people will go down to see him in the small town in the middle of Brazil and do get healing.

Speaker 2:          09:41          He sorta just pass in front of him and you meditate for days and that kind of thing. And, and he scans I guess your oric field and then heels you, I don't fully know how it works because it's definitely out there. Um, but people really believe in him and really he does surgery on people. Yeah, that's crazy. That stuff is, yeah, he does surgery without anesthesia. Um, sometimes there's cutting and he claims that he cuts because the people need to see the cut. Like the patient needs to see the cut, but not because it's actually required. But there are people who say that they had been cured of cancer and a lot of other things by going to see each other. Did you see any surgeries while you were there? You saw some, some cutting and some eyeball scraping. It was really, it was really out there.

Speaker 2:          10:26          Um, and it became, it ended up becoming a real anchor for me in the narrative of this particular book. So it's one of the first chapters of the book of going down to seeing him and you know, what happens there. And then when the conclusion comes, it sort of ties the whole thing up of what I found on this very long journey. Um, because of things that happened related to him but not directly from him. So tell me more about that. Sure. And so when you go to see John of God, you can also make wishes and so you go down with your three intentions and sort of like wishing for, you know, through a genie in a bottle. And what you can also do is bring photographs of other people who would like to be seen. My John of God, who can't make the trip. So you can save them the airfare down in Brazil and he will scan the photographs and apparently do distance healing.

Speaker 2:          11:18          So I guess if you believe that he can heal you by looking at you, it's probably not that much of a leap to think that he could also heal other people by scanning of voter photograph. So when I was going down, I started offering to people, including some colleagues at Google, um, that I could take their pictures down and that I could also take their wishes down if they wanted. And then I started telling around people because I'm super chatty. And so I was telling like the guy at the coffee shop and like the lady at whole foods and all these other people who have like a stack of photos with you. Yeah. So I ended up getting bombarded with emails, like to the point where it was really crazy. Like I just so many emails and I had to go run and get a bunch of photos printed, uh, you know, the local Dwayne Reed and whatever.

Speaker 2:          11:58          And so I went down with all these wishes and all these photographs. Um, and it wasn't until I was kind of researching the entire book and working on the conclusion that I went back and actually read the emails with a fresh eye and I noticed a few things in common amongst the emails and there were, you know, there are some things that were not necessarily as interesting. Like people gave me very specific instructions on how they could be reached. It was like, just in case this shit's real. Oop, sorry. Ah, it in cases Israel, uh, I want to make sure my wishes going to the right person. Right. So they gave me like a full addresses apartment numbers, like where they could be reached then the end of class. Yeah. It was like, don't, don't let them screw it up. If this is going to be real.

Speaker 2:          12:42          I want to make sure the wishes are coming. Like the, the good stuff is coming to my house. Yeah. Um, the second thing that I saw in these wishes is that everybody was asking for the same things and it was health, happiness and love. And it was in that order. And then the third thing is that they all ended, every single email I ended in the same way. And they all said, please don't tell anyone. Which I thought was like, I'm telling all of you. I see me. Um, I also told a bunch of people at Ted and laying everywhere. I did it on the stage and I wrote it in my book. So I've told everybody, but I think it's because it's really important. It's important for us to know that we at the end of the day, mostly all want the same thing, right?

Speaker 2:          13:21          So at the end of the day, despite all of our differences and all the things that we might be searching for that are different, um, all the political divides, the religious divides us, you know, every other philosophical divide in the divisive time that at the end of the day, we really all want the same things. It reminds me of, um, one of the things you talk about in your book, which is burning man. So I've been to burning man and, and you go, you have the opportunity to write on the wall of the temple. The temple, something usually like a letter to someone who's passed or wishes or whatever. Um, and I found that to be really moving. Um, can you tell us a little bit about your experience there? I know there's somebody in the audience here. You went to burning man. I met him at burning man. We didn't even know each other.

Speaker 2:          14:07          Google and we were in the same camp. Um, I feel like everybody at Google was wanting to burning man, isn't it a job requirement? There's nodding heads. So if you can imagine me as a lawyer going into burning man, I mean like a reasonably uptight person going to burning man. You can just do the math on what that experience was like. For me, it was really uncomfortable at first and I went and I was like, I feel so out of place and I don't know what I am doing here and I don't have clothes to radically self express myself. Like I had to borrow this outfit from somebody. Like I don't Ha, you know, I am. I worked in tech. No, I did not have costumes. I don't have a lot of feathers in my wardrobe. You don't like, I don't have stuff to where it burning man.

Speaker 2:          14:49          No one's going to see me in a bikini top. Like it's just not happening. I've had a child, it's not happening. So going there was really out of my comfort zone to put myself in that situation and I ended up loving it after a couple of days. Like once I kinda got in my groove and got over myself and got over the and not over the the general lack of dryness. Yeah, just the dryness and the lack of sanitary conditions around bathrooms. I once I got over that I was, I really enjoyed it and I felt like, um, I, you know, I feel like you really, that cliche of what you need out of that experience is truly what you get. And I think that was true for me. I got a lot of rest at burning man. I think I was the only person who came back reasonably well.

Speaker 2:          15:34          Preston, which also just tells you what a nerd I am. Cause I was like, [inaudible] I'm going to go to sleep. Like I just was like, not the person staying up until five in the morning and like doing drugs in the desert. Like I was just like, no, I'm just going to go read a book and like, you know, sleep in the healing dome. Like I was really taking it easy. Um, but I engage with it in a way that was comfortable for me and I think I got out of it what I needed to. And the temple I think was a particularly powerful thing for me as well. Did you write something? Yeah, I left a lot of wishes for friends. Again, sort of, I think part of the journey and the way I've kind of justified indulging in this journey, it was taking people along with me virtually or mentally, wherever I could.

Speaker 2:          16:14          So going to burning man, it's like who else has got a wish? Like I'll put it in a temple for you. And so, you know, writing those for people was a really emotionally cathartic experience in a way that I was really surprised by. Like people who are mourning friends and loved ones, including a Googler, you know, who had died in the Nepal earthquake, who you all probably remember who is a friend of mine and a friend of a lot of friends in common. Um, and so just being able to bear witness to that and to, you know, to kind of mark that for his mom and for his friends was really meaningful. And so I think again, I got, I got out of it what I needed to and it's my favorite chapter in the box. So there's also that, which is, so speaking of the book, when I was reading it, um, every night I would sort of come home and be like, yet, wonder what, what wacky store here tonight?

Speaker 2:          17:05          And it's sort of like hanging out with you on like, you know, and getting to hear all of your best stories. So what do you think of all of these wacky adventures? Like what's the craziest thing that you saw? I would say, uh, the tantric sound healing was probably one of the more out there experiences. My, my dad read the book and he, when the galleys came out and he was just like, he couldn't look me in the eye for a couple of days. Like he was just like, what on earth are you up to? And can you go back to Google? Are they still hiring? Can you go back and do you feel comfortable telling these guys? Sure. Yeah. So it's um, the, the experience was I actually went after a Google sales conference because we had sales conference out in health go with Google salespeople. No, nobody from Google joined me.

Speaker 2:          17:51          I should have asked people. I did not invite anyone on that particular truck, but other friends of mine who is a screenwriter was going to this thing down in southern California right outside of La and Santa Barbara and it, and she told me about it. And so I went to meet her after Google sales conference cause I was already on the west coast. So a lot of the things, it sounds like a very diligent like, oh, I'm like privilege and flying all over the world that I really did tack a lot of the things that I did on to work. Travel, not just Google were child, but just like generally because I'm a mom and I have a budget and I'm a working person. And so trying to coordinate these things into real life is, was part of the challenge. And part of the reason the book talks along the research.

Speaker 2:          18:29          Um, but how long they would take. I worked on it. I probably researched, I started at when Xeo was about one, she's turning nine in February. The bulky, I mean, probably like six, seven years. I mean, every research and writing, I'm not constantly obviously, but like, yeah, over the course of six years, it's a full time thing. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and so he basically, you lie on the ground and this, this guy is like a 65, seven year old Indian man who was not my husband. He lies on top of you. There's a sheet between you. So it's not, it's weirdly not sexual. I mean, not for me at least. So. So he lies on top of you and then he chance, I can't believe I'm telling the story of Google, he founded itchy your shock rub points. So if you know your shockers are, you can use your imagination of what that entails.

Speaker 2:          19:23          But he had like, he sounds into your, into your head and then like her throat, then you all the way down, all the way down. It goes all the way down. And it was, it was super bizarre. I mean, as you can imagine, so he's doing this and it goes on for like 45 minutes to really, yeah, like you're committed to this experience and then it's a group activity because there's people who are not all doing it with him, but they're all sitting around you as this is happening. So again, I mean it's just, it was, that's, that just wrote itself. I don't, you know, I don't know how you write about that and share that experience with people if you have experienced it herself. But it was, it was crazy, but it was also on legal moxie. Like it was really, it was like having noise canceling headphones on or being surrounded by like bs, but they're not stinging you like just the humming. Huh? I know it sounds strange. It was actually kind of delightful. I haven't gone back but I probably should cause it was there. There are people who really enjoyed it. I'm much more than I did but that aint give me his number. He's on Facebook. He follows me on Facebook. Oh awesome. So,

Speaker 1:          20:27          so, so, so speaking of group group activities, one of the things you talk about is going to this Wiccan, potluck dinner. Can you tell us a little bit about that? Because I found those, so when I think about Wicca, I'm kind of like, these are witches and you know, I don't really know what that means. And it sounds a little dark. But that chapter was super

Speaker 2:          20:48          lighthearted and, and women seemed really lovely. Yeah, everybody was amazing. That was actually one of the chapters that I think really challenged my own, I guess unconscious bias against witches. I didn't know I had it, but it was the one thing I know, I'm sorry. It's anyone in here as a Wiccan, like, I'm, I'm fully converted. Like I'm, I'm in it. I really respect what you do. Um, the, that was the one thing that my editor actually encouraged me to do. So everything else was basically researched and planned of what I was doing. Right. Already done the research. And my editor was like, you know, the one, the gap that you have in this is Wicca. And I was like, why? Like I, you know, I had this really childlike, um, preconception of what it would mean to be Wikipedia, black pointy hats. Like I, you know, my kid watches Disney movies.

Speaker 2:          21:36          Like I would, that's what I was picturing, which is so, you know, it's, it's such an unconscious bias. Like I didn't even realize that I have this bias against witches. And I was like, oh, I don't want to do that. It's kind of scary. Like I don't want to do that. And then she kind of kept encouraging me. She's like, I feel like that's the one thing that people do when they first step out of traditional religion that a lot of people explore that. And I was like, all right, fine. So I started researching it and as I researched more and more, I was like, this is actually super interesting because it is, um, there was no like rulebook right? Like it really is a choose what you want. I'll let and practice the AH, um, in a way that I think so much of us who don't ascribe to a specific religion or religious tradition but still want to find something and some meaning would actually be like, oh yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker 2:          22:19          Like I believe in equal like eating seasonally or would have, you know, like I respect nature. Like I do a lot of the things that are core principles. Um, I believe in being good to people and hoping that that comes back to me and that kind of thing. And so going, I went to a potluck, it was a Thanksgiving potluck for, but not related to our, like to American thanksgiving. It was, I guess Wicca, thanksgiving because there was a little bit, when is wicked thanks. It was right around my daughter's homecoming times. So like it was probably, I think October, September, October. I think it's done by the lunar Oh yeah. Must be harvest. Yeah. It's like Harvard. Exactly. Um, and it was at the LGBT center in Manhattan and it was, it was really wonderful. Like after you got off, after I got over the sort of initial awkwardness of just dining with strangers.

Speaker 2:          23:05          It was, they, it was such a wonderful, warm group of people. I know. It's really just people again searching like the rest of us, right? They just trying to find community, trying to find connection. Um, a lot of people were new to the city and they were just looking for somebody else to have that kind of moment with. And it was a really lovely dinner and these witches could cook. It was good food. My contributions were lackluster, but there's where we're quite delicious. It was a really, it was a really special evening. So was there any time during this, I guess, journey where you are, like your curiosity was really peaked about a particular religion where you were saying, maybe I'll actually go in that direction. You know, I didn't really do traditional religious stuff. So I mean if Waco was probably the most traditional religion that I explored there's, and it gives you an idea.

Speaker 2:          23:56          Yeah. So there weren't, the meditation was really powerful for me. I think that's something that I had started doing when I worked at Google. In fact to end the TM, the TM hard. Um, and that's a practice that's really stuck with me and that's become almost like mental hygiene for me. Like our daily flossing, right? Like I just do it because it feels good and it's not like your teeth will fall out if you don't floss one day, but you kind of feel achy all day. It's like, that's what I feel like about meditation. It's like if I download a 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes and I do 20 minutes in the morning, I used to be able to do 20 minutes in the afternoon when I worked here because they have things like because a girl and it cause Google. I know, but then don't leave Google ever.

Speaker 2:          24:37          You can never do that kind of stuff when you leave this place. There is no meditation room at other startups, like they don't have the space. And so that practice fall by the wayside when I left Google, but when I was here, it was something that I did, you know, twice a day and was pretty, pretty committed to it. Um, so that's a practice that's really stuck for me. And in terms of the other things, not really, like none of them are things that I've been like, oh, I want to go back to that again and again and I think this is my thing. So, but I think I've gotten it to be okay with that. I sort of got to the end of the, the journey, at least for the narrative of this story, um, and got comfortable with just sort of stopping for a minute.

Speaker 2:          25:17          When was that? What has, you know, I did bring a plus into the wine on the silent meditation retreat and I think just being still for that long and shutting up for awhile, it was really good for me and it got me out of my head and it got me out of this sort of frantic search and just being like, you know, you kind of, you probably know the answers to a lot of the things, at least what's true for you if you just quiet down a little bit and stopped for a minute. And so that's what I ultimately did. I sort of stopped the frantic search. It felt like a nice natural ending to the story for this particular book. And I don't have that same kind of, um, urgency around answering these questions, but I still, you know, people ask me to do stuff all the time and I'm like, yeah, let's go do that.

Speaker 2:          26:04          Like it's, I think the curiosity and the search of it is still fun for me. So I every so often we'll go do it. Like, yeah, I'm pretty sure if you asked any of the people in this audience they want to come with you, including me. So I have to ask, what about Zia? Like what was the end result for her? She must've seen you doing this. She knew you published the book. Like how did this impact her life? Yeah, so she was really little when I was doing most of the research. And so I think she just thinks I'm sort of cookie and like always off doing things. It was concerning when she would tell her her teachers about where you can imagine like a button hadn't private school. Like they were like, oh we heard you weren't talking for a few days. I'm like what is everything okay.

Speaker 2:          26:47          And I was like, no, I was at a retreat. You know, like they're like or kindergarten teachers were super concerned when I came back from that, from that silent retreat. Um, cause he would just give them a bit of information. But I think, you know, what's been the most interesting thing for the questions, she does ask me questions that are themed to the book and we just have conversations about it. I'm like, what do you think the answer is? Like, I don't know what happens when you die. Like what do you think? And she actually weirdly has a very easy relationship with the idea of death. Like that's something that since she was little, I had told her, um, actually went down Frydenberg who died. I had told her that when people die, um, but they become stars in the sky. My husband and I had told her that's because she had come across a picture of his mother who had, has to wait when he was quite young.

Speaker 2:          27:31          And I don't know why we said that, but that's what we kind of turned to were like, yeah, they become star. She was like three. And so when don passed away and she heard me on the phone talking to somebody and getting the news, she's like, what happened? And I said, well, you know, a good, a good friend of, of our friends, um, died in an earthquake and she's like, she's her pauses. And she's like, Oh, you mean you became a star in the sky? And I was like, Oh yeah, I think he did. You know, it was just a really, like, maybe I'm not screwing this up so badly, but it was really beautiful moment. It sounds, and you also described to me another beautiful moment about the library and in your daughters saw, I wondered if you would tell all of these. Yeah, so not really related to the spirituality piece, but I think just the idea of all these conversations we're having and in a place like Google or just across corporate America or Hollywood or anywhere around diversity and inclusiveness.

Speaker 2:          28:27          And one of the things that I did not expect was, um, how much that having that book on a shelf would mean to me. And so the story we were talking about, um, when my book came out soon after my daughter's school librarian, you know, to send me a text and she was like, oh, she sent me a picture of the book and the School Library and she's like, oh, we just got a copy of your book and the next time your end, could you sign it for us? And I just started crying and I was so surprised. Like this is the most impactful thing. Like I've done a Ted talk and I was like, this is the moment where I was like, I can't believe that my little kid will walk into a school library to her school library and see a story that literally reflects her, reflects her story in some way back to her [inaudible] I get like a little choked up thinking about it and it's, it had meant so much to me because growing up in this country, in the time that I grew up, uh, I did not have that expectation and I didn't even know it was an option.

Speaker 2:          29:21          Like, I didn't know to be, I didn't know I was being cut out of a narrative or that my narrative didn't exist on the library shelves or in Hollywood or anything else. They're just like, oh, I'm an recent immigrant to this country. Like, why would my story of nobody would tell your style, like, you know, why'd to watch Bollywood films? And that's definitely not my narrative, but that's, you know, that's what I would watch to see somebody who looked like me, um, and definitely can downs like me, uh, on the screen. But it wasn't something I had an expectation of. And to know that she and her friends would have that experience was so, so moving and meaningful to me in a way that it wasn't

Speaker 1:          29:51          expected. Yeah. So,

Speaker 2:          29:55          so what now, so what are, what are you doing now? Oh Gosh, a million dollar question. I'm trying to come back to Google. I've decided that I can just hide out in the hallways. None of you would even notice. Like I could just stay here forever. Now. I am kidding. I am. Uh, the book came out a bit ago, a few months ago, and so there's been some great, exciting and trust around turning it into television and some way, which it would be been. Talk about like seeing yourself on screen. Not that I would be in it, but that other people would, would play you. Ooh. Who are you thinking play you? Julia Roberts? No, I don't know. I'm totally getting, um, I don't know. I like the idea of Archie Panjabi do you guys remember from like, not like back home? She played her sister and, but I was like, fuck, I'm just super funny and like really like, she was like quick and funny.

Speaker 2:          30:44          I really liked her. Um, so yeah, maybe her, and then I told my husband that Dev Patel should play him just saying, and he started getting annoyed with me because I'm like, did you see him in Gq? Like he's somewhat sometimes minor. Like this guy, he got super cute. You should, he should play you. And he's like, you got to stop. So I'm going to, I was, yeah, it was, it was only funny to me apparently. But I hit on him in a gym once you did it. Yeah, it's great. We'll talk about that in the after show. That's um, so that, yeah. So there's some talk of that, which would be really, really exciting. Um, I'm thinking about if I would write another book. I don't know. I'm doing some writing different, like sort of my first time doing different things. I was just a clown in the Macy's Day parade. Yeah, Super Fun. There's definitely an article there. I highly recommend all of you to do that. If you ever have the opportunity, you can volunteer to be a clown in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. Didn't know that was a thing. Super Fun. Totally crazy. Um, so there's things like that that I'm exploring. Um, and then I don't know, we'll see. I'm excited. Stay tuned. All right, cool. Cool. Well

Speaker 1:          31:53          before we open it up to questions, I guess I would say like, you know, what advice

Speaker 2:          31:58          do you have for fellow seekers like

Speaker 3:          32:01          me?

Speaker 2:          32:05          I definitely don't have answers and I really do think it is about ultimately getting still and knowing that you hound them, you.

Speaker 3:          32:13          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          32:14          Like the, whoever's telling you that they know, they know for them but they don't know.

Speaker 1:          32:18          So I know for you that's my, that's my gut. That's good advice. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Will you take some questions? Anybody have any questions? Not all at once.

Speaker 3:          32:32          Okay.

Speaker 2:          32:37          Hi. Hi. Hi, I'm Susanna. Thank you so much. I think it's really interesting what you spoke about. Um, uh, definitely would read the book, but what I'm finding it difficult to is tying all this together and if you had to say something like what, what should the reader take away from this book? Like is there a, is there an underlying tank? Like, Hey, I did this, this, this, this, and this is what I would conclude or this is what I would say. I'm just trying to figure. Yeah. Um, thank you for your question. I think the, the conclusion is really a bit of a non conclusion. It was sort of like this is an ongoing journey. This is something that, it was a very naive of me to think that I could answer within the pages of a 250 page book. Because if that was possible, somebody would've done it already.

Speaker 2:          33:26          And, and it was really, you know, that I'll be searching probably for the rest of my life and then I'm okay with that. And then the story that I told earlier about John of God and about the letters that I've received about for me was really a conclusion to it was just that you were all seeking the same things. And so the health, happiness and love part of that, um, gave me a lot of comfort that ultimately everyone that I know really wants the same things. And if I can focus on that and on the things that bind us together as opposed to the things that drive us apart, especially in times like this, um, I might be on the past to something. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Angela, thanks for coming. Hi Erica. Thanks for being here. Um, so the tech industry is facing some really massive questions around responsibility, accountability, um, an analog parts of society and the way we've, yeah, in so many ways.

Speaker 2:          34:23          Right. Sundar was that car in Congress yesterday. Um, you also mentioned, it was interesting thinking about how when you started this journey you were a little like quiet about it at Google. And so the third part of this is Jack Dorsey posted this tweet storm or a few days ago he did a 10 day silent meditation treat in Mirror a retreat and Miramar. Um, what do you think the space is or the role is for spirituality in tech? Um, why is it not talked about and at the executive level, do you think it's an important character trait for a leader? Oh, that's such a great question, which I know is not the response we're supposed to give to a question, but it really is a great question. Um, why is it on talked about? Did you guys watch Silicon Valley? I mean, I suppose your lists, I don't want to watch it.

Speaker 2:          35:08          So I had missed seasons of it and there's, there's like season five or something on United flights and I was watching like one episode, which you can catch on pretty quickly, but like you can figure out what's going on. And it was an episode about one of the developers who was going to come onto the plot, the new Internet, um, where they find out that he's Christian, right? So it's like he's going to start a gay dating website and was like, that's cool. Like that's great. I like the word he's knew that. And then it's like, wait, he's Christian. They're like, don't tell anybody. And it becomes this big thing. And I thought was so fascinating. So look, that's what it's like, right? It's like the last taboo. We talk about everything now. Nothing's off the table. But for some reason, the thing that arguably is one of the most important things, like what do you believe about the things that really matter that really drive your every day?

Speaker 2:          35:53          And we can't have those conversations. And I don't know why that is. I was, I'm embarrassed to talk about it cause I really thought everyone would think I was nuts. And I'm sure people that, I remember a conversation at one of the women at Google events now, he'd just come back from Brazil and I was talking to a very senior salesperson at Google and I was telling her and you could see her backing away. She was going hard. Like why? He's like this woman's crazy. Um, and it was just such an interesting experience because I'm not this like deeply religious person, but the fact that I even have to say that by way of like contextualized and like don't worry, I'm not religious. Like I'm just, I'm a secret. I'm doing a lot of this for fun and I have to like make people comfortable with it I think is really interesting.

Speaker 2:          36:31          But the thing that they've also found interesting is that since I've written this book, people come up to me and they spill forth their religious views or their spiritual views or their religious upbringings like a confessional to me now. So I know all kinds of stuff about people, people that you know in tech, not in like all over the planet. And it's been, that's been really interesting to me. So to me there, there seems to be a clear desire to talk about these things because people really do want to get to the stuff that matters. And I think until we all started talking about this stuff, nothing's gonna Change. Right? So is it important for our senior leadership in a place like Google to talk about that stuff? I don't know. I don't want to impose on, you know, sooner that he should be telling everybody if he's Hindu and if he's practicing and if he goes to tumble and if he believes in God like it, maybe it doesn't matter.

Speaker 2:          37:19          But I think if that is something that drives him and it's a belief system that informs how he leads this company, I think that's interesting. I would want to know that. Just out of curiosity, I think it'd be interesting. Um, thank you, Angela. You for coming. Um, so I, and myself from of a passenger meditator and I did the 10 day course and everything. Um, but I am new to New York and I've found it to be extremely difficult in New York to like find like 20 minutes just to like calm down. Um, so do you have any advice or tips on how to meditate daily? You need to get access to the mother's room at Google and then go in there. I'm sort of kidding, but it's sort of true. I think actually focus rooms now. Focus rooms. Yes. We have focus rooms where you're not supposed to do anything except for sit and think, wow, I really want to come back.

Speaker 2:          38:08          That is the thing. I'm joking aside. I think it's really, it's, it's being really intentional about carving out the time and doing it no matter what. And I think if you start, when I did that first TM class, I remember they, they said that you had to do it for two months I think or where they're like try to not break the habit or the street for two months. And then it just became a thing I did where I now I am not a morning person and I will wake up early to do it. So if you can, I would start by just waking up like if it's 20

Speaker 1:          38:36          minutes, 10 minutes, whatever your practices, and then if you're trying to find space during the day, if you can block off a meeting, I would do that.

Speaker 3:          38:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:44          And I think in a place like Google, people respected, actually, it's not necessarily true of other workplaces. I can tell you that cause they'll be like, you know, we've got a meeting, this is the only other time everyone can meet it and they just schedule over it. But I feel like here you could actually carve that space. Have you done search inside yourself?

Speaker 3:          38:59          No.

Speaker 1:          39:00          So there is a course here called search inside yourself, which is essentially a meditation course. Um, started by, um, an ex Googler who's an incredible guy and Mang. Anyway, so search inside yourself as a course here and at the end of it, uh, you get paired up with a fellow. Why Alumni? And, um, you know, the goal is essentially you have meetings together so that you can carve out the time to meditate. And if you write to that, that list, which is [inaudible] why dash alumni, I don't know actually a full let me, he'll be able to access it. But, um, there are tons of people who I'm sure would love to set up time with you.

Speaker 3:          39:39          Great. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          39:42          Hi. Um, so I feel like maybe the questions that you started with in this book and the questions that kind of started this talk are generally like universal among people. And I think that everyone kind of wonders about a lot of these things. I'm thinking about like myself personally, I think my instincts are like my first, whatever my first movement here would be to think about exploring the more major religions in the more mainstream religions. And I think that a lot of the stuff you explored to kind of be a secondary thought. Okay. Um, can you talk a little bit more about your decision to kind of go that route instead of the more mainstream religion room?

Speaker 2:          40:15          Yeah, it's, it was really because I'm not a theologian and I didn't feel drawn Tonya them. So I didn't feel like I could do a real, uh, an adequate job of like exploring Christianity and then a little bit of Judaism and then Islam. It's like, how do you do that in a meaningful way with a full time job with the new kid. And I didn't feel Jon Tenney them because I don't think this project was necessarily a rejection of the religion I was raised with. If you ask me now like what religion are you, I'd probably still answer John. I'm like John Ish. Like people are Jewish. I'm Jen Esch. You know, like I think that's still directionally what I feel makes sense for me because it's so cultural to me. So I think because I tied religion and culture so, so much together, it would be like searching for a new culture.

Speaker 2:          41:00          And that wasn't really the project. But a lot of people have asked me that question. It just, yeah, it wasn't something that felt like the right direction. And so, um, yeah, so I went in this kind of other direction, but everything that I searched for and everything, all the experiences that I did were very much authentically what I felt curious about. And so it wasn't like, oh, what, don't make a funny chapter. I was like, no, I kind of want to go to burning man and like I think I want to do a silent meditation. We give us things that I actually wanted to try.

Speaker 4:          41:27          Can I ask a followup question please? Yeah. Um, can you talk a little bit more about the title of the book? Because I feel like this is maybe when it, like I, I got is something that I associate maybe more with mainstream religions then with other spiritual practices. Yeah. And I'd be interested to hear about kind of your thoughts about the connection between those and, right.

Speaker 2:          41:47          Um, so the original title of the book that I sold the proposal on was actually from Google to God and then, and I loved it and I thought it was really a funny title. And then my editor halfway through my writing process was like, you got to change the title because it sounds like you left Google to become a priest. And I was like, oh, that's true. And that's not what happens in the spot. Um, but the idea of it just being a search, I wanted some reference to the tech kind of piece of it and the fact that tech played such a large part, certainly in my personal journey and just of life and my career, but then also in how I was accessing a lot of these things because so much of it started with an internet search. What did you know that was part of the, the narrative, the stocking reference.

Speaker 2:          42:31          You know, it's a bit of a provocative sort of word to use, but certainly like a Facebook stalking kind of reference it like, but again, tongue and cheek. So there was a lot of thought put into the title and I think, um, it can be confusing to people. There's definitely Amazon reviewers who do not like my book because they're like, that's not the answer. And Christianity is answer whatever. There's a couple of very angry people on Amazon and I was like, well then it's not for you and I get it. But it was, it was meant to be a bit tongue in cheek to,

Speaker 1:          43:02          thank you. Thanks.

Speaker 4:          43:05          Um, my first question was the same as his actually my next question was, is was anybody actually healed like that you took to the Brazilian healer guy?

Speaker 1:          43:16          Oh, the followup. Like did anybody ever photos? So I don't think anyone I brought photos of was struggling with a real medical condition of the, of the batch that I had. Um, but that's said in followups. So he also, John of got also makes a trip to like Omega Institute in upstate New York. And so I had gone last year before my book came up, came out, I drove up there cause he was coming and I was Kinda like, Oh I feel like I should show a picture of my book cover to them and have them scan that and heal it. It's thought we be kind of like a nice tying up for myself. I don't know if he did it, but I watched a picture of the book cover and is in his bed in his basket. And I did bring a photograph of a friend who was just diagnosed with breast cancer and she is cancer free. I don't think that did it. I mean she also had medical treatment, right? Like, but, but uh, I dunno if it gives somebody a little bit of hope, I think that's okay. Yeah. Cool. Thank you. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          44:18          Hi Angela. Thank you so much for coming. I really enjoy that. Especially because last night I had like my monthly existential crisis, like taking on like these sorts of ideas. Um, and one of the thoughts that came was a, and this is actually a followup from a podcast I was listening to earlier this week, um, was a bit like this, this sort of rationalist mindset. The very scientific driven mindset is fairly modern. Like it's a byproduct of like the post industrial revolution movements. And, um, it's sort of like when you have that mindset where like we want to critically analyze, okay, why is this happening? I found that like even doing meditation, like my first thought after it, it's like, okay, it felt something but like why did I feel that it has to be something like neurological process that's causing this? Like clearly it has to be a rational explanation for that. So when you're doing all of these like very unorthodox things, like did you find that you needed to suspend that sort of mindset of like, okay, how like there has to be clearly rational way to explain like why this has happened?

Speaker 2:          45:21          Yeah, 100%. So if, um, when you read my book is a way that the, the narrative really plays off that way. I, there's, there's like this a very lawyerly part of me that does the research and we'll talk about oxytocin release during a hug and like what that might mean if, and that's why hugging him, I could be effective because of that. But then the other side is kind of like, well, what's the feeling like she smelled really nice. Like it was a little sweaty, a little uncomfortable, but like it was awesome and that, that juxtaposition, I mean it was constant. Like it was a constant dialogue in my head. It continues to be just the way I work and navigate the world. Um, but that was very, very hard for me and I would keep flipping back and forth. And I do address it a lot in the book cause I think that's so much of, uh, so many of us are in the same position where it's like we're raised to think of very specific way or educated and overeducated sort of repeating things again and again to be come experts at something.

Speaker 2:          46:16          And then here's this whole set of questions that are truly not Google a wall. You will not find a satisfactory answer. You will find people who are reporting to know the answers on Google to all of these questions. Um, I would challenge that maybe their incorrect answers on Google. You need to tweak the algorithm on these particular things, but there are just things that are unknowable. And so if you start, you know, I don't know how you reconcile those things, but I kind of flipped back and forth to, but then ultimately it was like I just got to suspend disbelief, like I can't try to explain these things otherwise I'll just be stuck in a loop.

Speaker 4:          46:50          Just as a small follow up the week when you were actually having these experiences, did you like just like push aside any of the thoughts that are like, okay, why is this happening? Why is that?

Speaker 2:          46:58          No, I think I did it really unsuccessfully. There were moments that I would like the, the tantric sound healing being a perfect example. There are moments I was like, this is so weird. Like my head was like, oh my God, I cannot believe, do I and I should not be doing this. My parents like, what would they think? Like they're going to hear about this. I'm going to write, I can't write about it. Like I was going on and I was like, this is bananas. I am married. Like what am I doing? You know? It was just like a loop, a loop, a loop. And then there are moments where it's kind of like, all right, just like relax, just breathe into it. And I was like, oh, it's got a nice oily, like this is him. This is bizarre. But it also kind of not altogether unpleasant.

Speaker 2:          47:30          And then so, and then I'd be like, oh my God, I can't believe this man laying on top of me. This is very awkward. Um, and so it would just be like a constant thing. And not for me is also my meditation cycle is like the monkey mind of the loop of like, what's going on? I have to make dinner, I have to go to this thing. I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning, blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, Oh, I'm just be meditating and like munch a bunch of much, much. I'm like, ah. And I'm like, crap, did I fall asleep? And I'd just keep going. And you know, it's like constant and I think, um, I feel like that's the very human journey. I don't live in the woods, right? Like, I don't live on a meditation farm. I live in New York City.

Speaker 2:          48:00          I lived downtown. I take the subway, I walk everywhere. Like it is hectic and I think that's just part of our life. But if you can push that reset button every day in some way, and the fact that you're just asking them questions I think is great, you know. Thank you. Going back this way. Huh? Nice to see you. Thank you for coming in. Um, how did you know, it sounds like you got to a point where you felt at peace that like the search you had searched enough, you didn't find specific answers and you were okay with that. Can you describe that? Because when you're just talking about the constant loop and it's really hard to break that cycle, how did you feel fulfilled on this journey and what was that moment like? Yeah, there are a couple of things that drove that. I think one was definitely the silent meditation experience of just being still for that long.

Speaker 2:          48:47          I didn't do a full 10 days. I tell that story of why I'm fuck, but it's, I did a five day retreat and uh, by the end and I was like, I think, I think I'm good for a minute. Like I feel like just stopping and I just need to sit with what I've already researched and sort of be in that, um, and, and feel like I have enough data, you know, to lead Gen form something that felt right. And then also, truthfully, it was partially because I was on deadline. It was like I can't keep searching and I can't, I've got to turn this book in and I have to be okay with not having a conclusion because I'm not going to in time for this book to come out. And so either I can spend the rest of my life writing this book and it will be written and published post humorously or I can try to wrap this up and be okay with the knowledge that I will never know the answer to these questions.

Speaker 2:          49:36          And that's where he chose to land. Sorry, one more, one more question. Um, it sounds like the impetus of this search was more about your daughter and the question she might have as she grows older. When did you decide, hey, this is a book and I should probably put this out there for more people to absorb? Ooh, that's a good question. You know, there was a moment where it was going to be a film and then I realized I did not want to be in a film. And so that was pushed aside and then I, but I felt like there was something I wanted to do with it because it was fun in anyone. I would tell the stories too would be like, you have to ride the salad. These are such funny stories or they're really interesting or whatever, depending on what story was.

Speaker 2:          50:17          Um, so I started taking better notes as I would do things. And then, uh, I met an agent a few years ago and he was like, you've got to write this. Like this is a book. I know I can sell it. And that's what ended up happening. So it's sort of, I never set out to write a book. It just sort of it and it sounds like such a jerky thing to be like, it's just sort of happened, but that's kind of what happened. It felt like, you know Jesus took the wheel. No, I'm just joking. I that's not inappropriate, but I just, I feel like it does. They just, it's sort of just played out the way it was meant to I think. Yeah. Even question, how forthcoming were you when you went and traveled around and met with different, like when you went to the and potluck, did they ask you why you were there?

Speaker 2:          50:57          Did you tell them and if so, what was the response? I was incredibly forthcoming. I am a lawyer. I do not want to get sued by anybody. I wasn't trying to dupe anybody. I was very, very clear that I was, once I decided to turn it into a book, I was very clear that I was writing a book and for anybody that was prior chapters, I reached out to people to make sure that they were okay with what I was writing because everything in the book was true. And so anyone that, I certainly if I named them, I gave everyone the opportunity to change our name or to read what I was writing. So I didn't want anyone to feel made fun of or you know, like thought, like kind of side swiped from what I was writing because it was not meant to be like a takedown of, of all these different practices.

Speaker 2:          51:40          So I was very, very forthcoming when I, when I did it. Thank you. From the legal team of Google for asking. Yeah. Um, were there any ways in which you feel like your life has been changed in either positive or negative ways that you were not expecting after the experience? From the research or just the whole experience reading anything? Yeah. Oh yeah. It's opened up in ways that I wouldn't have expected for sure. I think just, you know, what it did was one of the habits I think I learned working at Google actually was to be ready for anything and to really put myself into uncomfortable situations. Right. Like, again, as a lawyer, you're trying to like know something to go really deep on that issue to really be the expert. And working at Google in the years that I did that was not going to be the situation.

Speaker 2:          52:25          It was like, here's a new product, we're launching this other thing and you just have to go figure it out. And working that muscle here, um, I think led to me being really comfortable going into these very uncomfortable situations for the research for this book and has become a theme of both my career and my personal life since then where it's been like, it's just opened up all these things because something like becoming a clown in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, like that is not something I would ever have thought I would do. And I went, I had so much fun and it was so goofy and it was such a delightful thing to do. And I think it's because I worked at Google and then did something like this that I'm willing to put myself out there and sort of suck the marrow out of life while I'm here. And I think that's definitely what this has taught me. For sure. Yeah. Thank you, Angela. Faye coming. And I think if we've learned anything, it's that in addition to wanting love and health and what was the APP enough and happiness, I think also everybody kind of wants to know. Yeah. What's

Speaker 1:          53:26          it all about? So thanks for bringing us together to talk about that. And, and um, if you haven't read the book yet, I highly recommend it. So much fun. Such a fun journey at the back of the room. Pick up a copy and it's nice to see you all. Thank you all for being here. Thank you so much.
