Speaker 1:          00:06          Thank you. Let's get right to it. Uh, the obsidian collection, that term obsidian comes from a volcanic rock. It's a dark glass that's formed when lava and dirt, certain explosions, all of that come about. So there are lots of obsidian around Hawaii and other places where there are volcanoes. I love the name because I think that's what black culture is. Beautiful Black, shiny, formed from high pressure, heat, et cetera. And that's what we're doing. The obsidian collection, we're collecting the black archives, but more than just that we're digitizing them and making them available for younger generations. And as I started the project just a little bit over three years ago, we were asked why, why are you doing that? There's already archive groups that are collecting history. The universities are collecting it. And uh, we got that big beautiful new, uh, Black Smithsonian in DC. So why do you need to form the obsidian collection?

Speaker 1:          01:13          And I think I can best communicate that and telling you about my love of football. Now I know it's going to, it's going to work its way back around. But I love football. I Love Chicago bears football. And I can tell you from when I was five to seven years old, I was, my dad's friends would come over. We had a giant floor model TV and they would let me get the beer and they will let me empty the ash trays. Now this is the late sixties early seventies so beer cans were made of like what I would think was solid titanium steel. And the ashtrays were these huge ceramic platters. So my responsibility was important. I remember the screens be in green, they're being white lines on the screen. People would crash into each other. And then my father and his friends would either cheer or gea and it was football.

Speaker 1:          02:11          And I love football. Now fast forward, I started seeing football throughout my life and I know how football works, the x's and the o's lineup. Then they crash into each other and then somebody throws in the yellow towel and then people stand around like this and then they wait, and then the guys and the stripes come out and do some things. And then they either say this way or they say that way and then you cheer or [inaudible]. Now I've been watching football my whole life. I would argue with you that I love football just like any other American. And I love the Chicago bears. I'm a native Chicago. But imagine if I was the curator of the Chicago bears, I would put together an exhibit and it would be all of the collisions, right? Because that's what they kind of do. They run into each other a lot.

Speaker 1:          03:08          They line up and then they run into each other and then they, then somebody throws the towel. I've seen it. So what I would do is I would have an exhibit of all the collisions and then I would have another exhibit of the towels because they went from like a mustard and then they started being more yellow. I do remember that. And then I know when some of the bigger games they pour containers of water on each other at the end of big wins. I do know that to not, it doesn't make a lot of sense, but that's happens in football. And I love football. So one of my exhibits is going to be all the coolers of water dunking on people because that's football to me and I love football. Now somebody who actually likes football would go to my exhibit and inside of 15 seconds they would go, what is this?

Speaker 1:          04:07          And this isn't football. They are layers to football. And there's a whole ecosystem and culture around football and this isn't football. And that's what happens with a lot of African Americans that walk into an exhibit and go, what is this? It's people who just focus on the collisions. So you just here picking protests, slave struggle, and it's like, um, look, there are layers to this thing. This isn't the sum total of the black experience. And just like me with football, and this is true because that is my understanding of football. I would say, well, explain football to me. And then people who know football, like, look, you just don't know for a ball and you can't be in charge of it. It's not. It's okay that you think you love it or whatever your association is with it. That's not the sum total of football. And I remember my senior year of college, the bears went to the Superbowl and I watched it with everybody.

Speaker 1:          05:24          And again, they lined up. I don't know what the problem is cause that's what happened. They lined up, there was a snap, somebody man, this way, somebody, they ran into each other, somebody throwing the towel. This is what, this is what I see. And I love it. But I loved everything around it. I'm football adjacent, I'm not, I don't, I should not be in charge of telling the story of football. So it was then when one of my friends said after they, after we won, I know we won. I do that, that we won that Superbowl. The um, one of my friends said, who do you think is going to be the MVP? I didn't know what an MVP was, but everybody burst into conversation and they started discussing these plays in these little nuances and all of this other stuff. And that's when I realized I don't know what they're talking about.

Speaker 1:          06:17          And that's how black culture is. You can be adjacent and you can love it, but there's a lot of layers to it and it's important that there be an independent free standing organization run by black people to cure rate that story because we can walk into an exhibit and go, I get it. It's a protest struggle, SSA slave. It's a lynching. It's like, it's like that's all that's there. So it's important for us to take the narrative back and that's what the obsidian collection is doing. So we started with the Chicago defender. Now many people know, and I don't want to preach to the choir, but the Chicago defenders started in 1904 and it's essential to black history because as we were freed his slaves, everybody needed to know. People wanted to start migrating away and the Chicago defender was different from other newspapers and they took the initiative to actually start getting these newspapers down south.

Speaker 1:          07:23          So they partnered with the Pullman porters and the Pullman porters were in a way to make extra money. They were distributed in selling the papers. When in down south it was kind of frowned upon for black people to actually even read, let alone get the scoop on where to go. So the Chicago defender actually helped show black Americans what was going on in the rest of the states, where they should go, where safe passage was, what to dress like when you come up north, what to wear. All of those good things came through the Chicago defender and um, the Chicago defender had sold the family, the original family from 1904. So the paper in about 2007, the theory was that all of the images were taken by the family and then some were given to the library, some to Getty, et cetera. And there weren't that many images laugh.

Speaker 1:          08:17          So when we came there, we thought they were going to be 10,000 images and we found actually 250,000 images in this one room. And what happened to me was you can't see 250,000 images of yourself and ever be the same. Right? So it was like being bit by a radioactive spider. We said we got to get this information out and, and I've learned through my own child that young people get everything through the smartphone. So when I was telling my son about some of the stories and some of the things we found, he would go right to his smart phone and say, well that's not in here. And you know, are you spelling it right? You know, and I remember in my own naivety, I thought when the Internet was invented that everything was automatically on the Internet. Like, well now it's on the Internet now through some kind of magic, what I came to learn was we weren't digitizing the black newspapers.

Speaker 1:          09:19          The black photo journalists weren't getting, there just weren't specific platforms to get the information out there so that younger and future generations can immediately access it. So that's one of the things we started with the Chicago, the Chicago defender was our first effort and now we have a lot of black newspapers in the queue to share their images so we can get them out so that everybody can see him until fabulous new stories. So what John mentioned, we, we have a wonderful partnership. Our first immediate platform is through, uh, Google Arts and culture who we met through the black Googler network. And we started by just putting up some images. Now these are just three of a quarter of a million. And so, you know, I narrowed it down. You're welcome. And uh, but the, the first image I like a lot because it's just one of the secretaries when the Chicago defender move their offices into the south loop of Chicago, that's an important play.

Speaker 1:          10:21          That story is on the Google Arts and culture obsidian page and it's a series of images, but just being able to accomplish a feet like that back in those days. And then there were printers in the basement and all of those other feeds. Those are, those are the kind of place that we would discuss amongst ourselves. That's the kind of information that would, would, that's the narrative of how we see ourselves. Um, aside from just the newspapers and the photographers, we've got small community archives joining us. And so the other picture, the opposite one is a Fred Hutchinson with a plane. Wonderful story of this guy who wanted to fly planes. But as a, a black man in the early 1920s, there was a nonstarter, but his family was a family of means. So his father bought him an airplane and so he learned how to fly by starting the plane, getting in it and flying it.

Speaker 1:          11:21          And Landon, you know, that he, that happened and uh, and that, that was hidden. There was a small plane, a single engine plane, but he wanted to learn how to fly the commercial airplane. So he moved to Canada and he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force where he learned, then he eventually moved to Haiti and opened up a black flight school. But by then we were entering World War II and America had decided we're going to need some black pilots. So he actually became a flight instructor for the Tuskegee airman. So that story is from shorefront legacy archives. They've been collecting the history of the black people who lived on the gold coast in the 19 hundreds that's a story that doesn't get told, but it was a lot of them. And that was, you know what, 120 years ago, but we were there too. So shorefront has a great archive and now the obsidian platform, they've joined us and we'll be able to get those stories to the world.

Speaker 1:          12:16          The one in the middle, it's just one of my favorite photos because it's just black boy joy. I raised a black sign in in Chicago and, and the kids have fun, but that's not the narrative that's in the mainstream. But my life was fun. My son's life was fun. If he says it's not, he's lying was amazing. I was an awesome parent. But those, we've got a ton of images like that. This is one of my favorite and this just helps me communicate that we're not, I'm not doing this alone because I'm not an archivist. They will let you know that, that uh, that's a postgraduate degree industry. I am not an archivist. I am not a historian. They will let you know that too. Uh, and that's a phd process. So what I am as a storyteller, but I've aligned our s with experts and we're creating new experts.

Speaker 1:          13:08          This picture, the man with the hat is Joe Lewis and he's a famous boxer and I knew he was a boxer because when I was a kid we drank Joe Lewis milk and on the cover he was posing like this and he had on boxing gloves. So I knew he was boxing. I didn't know he was one of the most famous boxes ever. Blah, blah blah. But that's Joe Lewis, the guy in the metal judge Duke Slater. Duke is the first African American linemen to play in the NFL. And that story doesn't get that much coverage. I will spare you in long and short. The in NFL in 1926 he was, he's got one of the best records. It was just broken recently by a Chicago bear, but the NFL let five black people play in 1926 then they hokey pokey and it back and said no, no black players.

Speaker 1:          13:59          So he, it went down, it was five then it went down to zero. So he was the first head coach and formed the Chicago Negro All star football team and after he retired football. And this, you're just as long story about that, but we'll get those narratives out there because it's a good story. In 1928 he actually got his law degree. So after he retired from football, he became an assistant assistant district attorney and then he's the second elected judge in Chicago. That is an important part of our narrative. We got to get those stories out there so that this is second nature. But the picture in the defender archives, they were on the back. It was written judge Duke's later and Joe Lewis. So I put that on Google Arts and culture. That's it. Those two. So one of my friends call me who's 60 and he said, why don't you credit the other guy?

Speaker 1:          14:55          Now you as people of a certain age know who that is, right? You know that it is. I didn't know who that was and it wasn't written on the back because you know my love of sports, but I won't bury the lead too much longer. That's Jackie Robinson. Now I only know one image of Jackie Robinson is the one that's on the trading card when he was 24 and so my friend said, I'm gonna need you to write Jackie Robinson's name up there. And I said, but it doesn't say Jackie Robinson on the back. And that's not how you're supposed to do it. You're supposed to record the history that it's accurate. And he said, you know, and anybody with a pulse of a certain age wouldn't have thought to need to write Jackie Robinson's name. So I would tell younger people, it's like if you had 100 pictures of Lebron James, you wouldn't feel the need to make sure you wrote his name on every page.

Speaker 1:          15:47          But fast forward 50 years later, some child that has not been born yet is going to go, what? No name on there. So we threw that out. So I asked five other people who were over 60 do you know who this isn't even looking at me like is this a cause? You know who that is? Right. And I was like, well I'm just trying to see if you know, you know before we actually put Jackie Robinson's name on there. But the other beauty about this photograph is these were three captains of sports, boxing, football and baseball. And they were actually playing golf because Joe Lewis made serious inroads into pro am and the PGA. And so this for black people who knows sports better than I, but you know, I know football, the, these, these kinds of stories and these pictures, they knew they were taking an iconic photo and we've got to make sure that not only do we get the photo, but we've got to get the elders involved to make sure we get the good Intel on there.

Speaker 1:          16:52          Cause I know everything else really well except sports. But we also have added more than just photo journalism in history. We've got a fashion and beauty photographer, Ernest Collins loaned us 120 images that we put up for black history month this year. So on our Google arts and culture page, we've added a lot of fashion and beauty specifically because that's part of our history. The key part of that is we also want to alter the metadata. So when you go and Google black man in Chicago, primarily what's being populated, our news outlets and crime. So you don't, you only get images from 1940 if you're lucky, but you mainly get crime. So it's important that as the obsidian uploads all of this metadata onto the Internet, when you type in black man, black woman, all of this, we're going to be populating it with, uh, hundreds of thousands of images that are not the collisions because that's already been done.

Speaker 1:          17:55          So we're picking the, the real intricacies of the culture of the layers to this game. So let's get back to reclaiming the Chicago narrative. And let's talk about Bronzeville. I'm going to go over what a lot of people know, maybe others don't. But this is one of my favorite photos. So we don't own this. When this was actually owned by the library of Congress and it's completely royalty free. It was shot in 1940 1941 and most of us, this is the Goto photograph for Bronzeville, but this was, this was just a photographer come to here. Another narrative about how brands Bronzeville was, but he just stopped five ordinary boys who were on their way to Sunday school and said, take a picture in front of this car, because that's what Bronzeville looked like. If we're writing the story, this is just another day in the life, everybody dress like that.

Speaker 1:          18:51          All of the images from my childhood, that's what they looked like. So Bronzeville was called the black belt, but there was also a restricted covenant. So as we were moving in droves from about 1916 forward 1916 and 1948 it was a law on the books that black people could only live in a specific area. And that was to call the restricted covenant. So we all piled into Bronzeville. It's not the Bronzeville proper today, it's about seven of those neighborhoods and it's a big part of the south side. So with the black belt, somehow we had three hospitals, six newspapers, 1000 small black owned businesses, 2000 people worked in the numbers game and we were three times densely more densely populated than the rest of Chicago. So if you pick the a certain series of blocks in north side, there'd be 20,000 people that same square footage in Bronzeville, 60,000 so we were piled in, but it wasn't what the narrative, kind of what the narrative I've been reading kind of leads us to.

Speaker 1:          20:04          It was vibrant. So we had the Jones department store, we had the palm tavern, we went to the theaters, we had clubs. Bronzeville was really extremely exciting, populated and vibrant. I'm stunned at this current narrative that kind of implies, again, just collisions of, I dunno, they came here and Gosh, we got to help them. And it's like, wait, you're, you're, you're leaving something out. So we've got to get that online so you guys can go to it as quickly as, what I love about the youth culture is somebody puts out a fact, you guys clap back so fast with all kinds of facts and links and hyperlinks is like boom, boom, boom, boom. And so we've got to get this information digitize so that you can clap back against these negative stories. I don't know if it's that they are black adjacent or if it's malicious, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          21:03          But the truth will set us all free and easy, quick access to the truth will get us there. So I'll leave it to, I'll leave the clap back to you guys cause I can't text that fast, but we'll get the information out there so that you can have access to it. But I was trying to figure out how did we do all of that with out all of this help that has become the new narrative. Like oh my goodness, if we don't help them by, you know, eliminating their entire culture, then they won't be helped. So what we also did was formed what we call the elder circle. And we started talking to people from Bronzeville. We've started interviewing and filming them and talking to them, getting the nuances of what's happening in Chicago and what happened back in those days. Now the guy in the corner is not a of that same generation.

Speaker 1:          22:03          His Nathan Thompson who wrote a book called the Policy Kings, and actually we'll be doing a documentary, we'll be doing film. There's a lot that will be going on that will be explaining why Bronzeville was vibrant. And it was mainly because of the number runners. Now I'll say this, the uh, and now because I don't want to give that story away cause that's coming. But essentially those were the guys who played, who ran the numbers, which is like the lottery. I think it's important when I'm telling the story, I'm starting a narrative of 1746. The New York general assembly had a lottery and they built king's college, which went on to become Columbia University. So when somebody else is telling the story a lottery is acceptable. But, and then when we did lottery it became, you know, thuggery and illegal and illicit and all of those things. That's why it's important to drive your own narratives.

Speaker 1:          23:01          But the policy king's lived in the community and they actually invested in the community and if you want to just open up a small business, you would get a small business loan from a policy king. So that's how we were able to be vibrant and self sufficient. So I want to make sure that we get that information to you guys. So that's kind of the overview of what the obsidian collection is and why we're doing it and what it is. So to take that forward, I am going to invite my colleague, my young colleague, who has been amazing and bold in that she's one of the cofounders of the tribe and they are a

Speaker 2:          23:46          digital platform that speaks to millennials. I'll say this, when I saw it, I was like, I don't know who some of these people are. My son was like, oh, I know all these people are. And he immediately joined the tribe. I've joined it too, but I'm going to bring Morgan up to the stage. Let's give Morgan.

Speaker 2:          24:08          Thank you. Thank you. So first I want to ask you to tell everyone what is oh, to tell everyone what is the tribe? Sure. So the tribe is a publication and production company with a mission to reshape the narrative of black Chicago. And we were born out of resistant to the dominant narrative of Chicago, which is that the dominant narrative of black Chicago, right? Which is that we are a violent throwaway community and especially black millennials in youth that we are not invested in or that we don't care about black lives, which, um, is, is a gross lie. So, um, I did a crazy thing and I said, I can't take it anymore. I can't continue to watch the news and see black bodies on the ground. I can't continue to read the newspapers and see sensationalist headlines about what the body count was this weekend.

Speaker 2:          25:14          And, um, I called one of my best friends who I went to Northwestern width and I said, what can we do? Um, she's a journalist and I talked to her and I said, why don't you quit your job at your newspaper, move back to Chicago and write about what you care about. And that's what we did. Is that Tiffany? That's Tiffany. Yeah. Cause what I love about you guys' logo is it's, it's, it's forward, it's progressive, it's young and it's, I guess the tribe. Why did you call it the trial? We needed it to feel communal and we want it black Chicago to feel like this is ours. That we are finally taking back our narrative. I want you to talk about, that's Tiffany, that's you in the middle. And tell me who the other gentleman is. Um, that's David. He's our web developer and designer.

Speaker 2:          26:02          So he's the one that came up with that logo. And it's funny because I actually pushed back with him on it and then he said, I thought you wanted to do news different. And I was like, you know what? You're right. We're not going to look like your typical, uh, mainstream media platform. This is going to look like a movement. We're going to brand it. It's going to be a lifestyle. Yeah. Well as grade one of the things I, when I met Morgan, um, I was so moved by the entrepreneurship. It reminds me of all of the entrepreneurship that I've learned in the archives and then the history. But one of the things I wanted to make sure everybody understood. One of the platforms you guys did was shy vote. Can you tell us about that? We're a

Speaker 2:          26:44          small collective. Really. There really is three of us. And so many people think that we're this huge conglomerate. But really we hire freelancers and we hire, um, black voices to help tell these stories about black Chicago. But at our core, we thought there's no way that we're going to be able to take on the elections with all the 5 million candidates that there are. So what can we do? So I said, why don't we reach out to other independent platforms and say, can we come together and amplify each other's stories so that we're not duplicating the same efforts and then create an election guide together? And that's what we did. So we reached out to the better government association, Chicago reporter, the daily line, Black Club, shy south side, weekly, a bunch of organizations to put together this nonpartisan election guide. So it's shy.vote.

Speaker 1:          27:37          That's great. What do you think that the Obsidian, the platform that we're building, which should launch later this year, how do you think that those tools can help what you guys are doing?

Speaker 2:          27:51          Well, we had the same mission. It's all about reshaping the black narrative. Um, black youth are not being told the truth about who we are. It's not taught in schools. Um, there's no way for us to find some of this information really until we get to college. When we get to college, that may be the first time that we start reading texts by black authors. So, um, when I think about the news and I think about a hundred years from now, what are people going to go to, to reference what Black Chicago is right now? Can you really look at the archives of the Tribune or, or any anywhere and say this is a full picture of what black Chicago is, when the majority of that is going to be headlines about who was slain. So we see the tribe as someone and the obsidian collection as someone who can step in and say, here is a more holistic, multifaceted view of who we are as a people.

Speaker 1:          28:48          That's great. I think what I was hoping to make sure we accomplish is that people can get involved and follow the tribe and all of that. But tell me one of the fun stories or one of the important stories that you guys covered as the tribe that matter to you, that, that does the stick out. Cause I know they all matter.

Speaker 2:          29:10          Sure. It's, we have a series on our site called out west. Um, Tiffany who's the cofounder of the tribe and the editor and chief. Um, she's from north Lawndale. It's okay. West side. Um, but you know, everybody talks about the stories of the south side because there's so many kind of vibrant middle class communities, but people just leave the west side either the dialogue completely when it comes to west Chicago. Um, and so we wanted to focus on a series that talks about, um, Tiffany's routes to the west side and also the great migration and that journey, um, to the west side and why, um, the west side is kind of like the city's forgotten stepchild. So we actually journey to Mississippi together. Uh, we found out Tiffany and I that our families are both from Bolivar County. And so we went there to kind of discover the past. And, um, it's a very fascinating story. If you look at this series about us as young people discovering who we are by rechecks true, retracing the, the roots of our grandmothers. So,

Speaker 1:          30:20          so you use a lot of things more than just text. You use videos and you create documentaries.

Speaker 2:          30:27          Well, absolutely. So my background is that I'm a filmmaker. And so while Tiffany is your more traditional journalists, I'm coming in like, no, we're not doing this the regular news way. I don't care about the 24 hour news cycle and what's trending on Twitter. Let's do more long form stories that going to matter later on. You know, so I use my documentary film background to tell, um, um, like to make, to create documentary series the multimedia stories because I'm in this day and age, not everyone's going to read the text, but you need something that's going to go on. Social media grabbed their attention. So we like to use audio, video, all different types of mediums to tell stories.

Speaker 1:          31:10          Wow. Okay. Well I think we've covered everything that we wanted to talk about today and we can open it up to questions if anybody has any.

Speaker 3:          31:23          As I sit here and listen to you guys both present, I'm feel with goosebumps in terms of the power of both of your platforms to tell new stories for our African American experience. So I want to thank you guys for this presentation and just really appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          31:42          How sponsors responded to your site. I'm actually very well, we, I sell the tribe. I keep it real with people. When I'm selling the tribe. Nobody's going to tell stories about black Chicago like weekend until they start hiring black people. So that hasn't happened. So we're going to be your best voice for telling stories about black people. Yeah. So they really come to us because they want to reach our audience like you want to get, um, I mean black millennials are coming into like buying power. Everybody's interested in that. So yeah, people are really approach us along those lines. How can we best support you, both of you and your organizations?

Speaker 1:          32:25          You go first.

Speaker 2:          32:27          Money. Money is always an answer. I wish there was another answer I can give you. Um, but we had the creativity, we have the, the education. We have a conglomerate of creatives who are ready and can't get hired at legacy papers. So yeah, if we have money we can, we can tell more stories and that is the best way to help us out. If we can talk afterwards if you're interested.

Speaker 1:          32:53          Oh my gosh, I love her. Because I, I want to say Ditto to that, but, um, gosh, I just love these young people because that's it. I, I would've, I think my generation would have said the exact same thing and, and so many more words. I would have stretched that out to about seven or eight sentences. But, um, you know, with my formal education and all that. But I think that's, that's what we're going to be reaching out for that as well.

Speaker 2:          33:22          Hi, thanks so much for being here. Um, what kind of conversations are happening with teachers and with like the CPS system to kind of help, um, with these gaps in the narrative that you're talking about because it's obviously such a crucial piece of this.

Speaker 1:          33:36          Well, I appreciate you asking that because both of my parents were teachers and I, so I, I know way more about teaching than football. But one of the things that we're doing at the obsidian is we are going to be creating educational content as well. But the interesting thing about education right now is it has gotten very narrow, right? But people are teaching to a very standardized, uh, systems. And, and it, it doesn't leave a lot of room for extra curricular that way, but the charter school system is coming up and, and, and even they, I've already been talking to them. It's, it's just a very narrow space. But we're working with virtual reality and, and some of all these other things so that when that relaxes a little bit because I'm excited that that places like Google and, and these big tech firms are moving away from these traditional narrow requirements and that's allowing for a lot more creativity. We feel like with these platforms we can get the knowledge and information out even if it doesn't come through organized curriculum systems. So we're just going to keep creating and then you young people just keep inventing. Just when I figured out this tool now everything is on the virtual. So we're going to get it there and then we'll get the information out there. Cause you guys are taking in information so many different ways. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          35:02          Let me add onto that because I love talking to teachers about education. I think we need to totally reframe the way that we teach about history. Um, and I always tell this story. I remember being in about seventh or eighth grade and my social studies teacher wrote on the board and huge letters manifest destiny. And we're literally talking about the u s going through and stealing everybody's land and just massacring people. And we'd call that section in history manifest destiny. So I need for teachers to start teaching from

Speaker 1:          35:38          the point of view of the oppressed. And if the title of the texts in history sounds like a comic book, then it's probably wrong. And we need to like reassess what we're teaching our kids.

Speaker 4:          35:57          I, uh, first of all, I want to say that, um, from my perspective, you nailed it on football. What's the problem? What I see, right? Um, but curiously, exactly. Um, uh, model any Hendrick, I'm both a columnist for the sun times and president of the National Association of black journalists. And I just want to say that, you know, I'm more of a comment than a small question and that is that I'm blown away. I'm blown away. Um, you know, I've, I've heard about your project, I've, I've read bits and pieces, but today, just sitting there in the, in the few minutes that you went over some of the photos, you told me stories I didn't even know. And, and you know, and, and yeah, I think I know everything, you know, but, but I'm saying, you know, as black journalists and as veterans, we think we pretty much know the history, but there were pieces that history you told me, just little small photos. Um, the one about the guy who, Fred, is it Fred? Oh my God, I've never heard of him. I was like, oh my, I made a note, go look him up. And you know,

Speaker 1:          37:01          son turn those archives over to shorefront legacy. His grandson is still lives in Evanston and that,

Speaker 4:          37:08          that's amazing. And then, um, just to say, you know, Morgan, of course, Hey Morgan, I am so, so proud of Morgan and, and she and Tiffany and her team, um, you know, they just started their stars, their Navj stars here in Chicago. Um, the one thing I wanted to ask you is, so as I sat here listening to it, I was struck by how do I, I mean, besides telling the story of the obsidian collective, how do we share those photos? I mean, in terms of when you think about copyright and like if, if the Sun Times, if I wanted to do a story on with the gallery of these photos, how were they being allowed?

Speaker 1:          37:47          I'm glad you asked that too. So we, we've got lawyers and uh, and and so I've learned a lot about copyright law but the, a big part of the obsidian collection platform, we're building a very expensive website. Uh, yeah. Uh, is that is going to be a quick access to licensing and permissions so that it's going to rival kind of the other stock photo images out there as well as a platform for viewing and pleasure and enjoyment. But there will be quick access and that is a revenue share model so that the owners retain ownership and then can monetize. What it does is it allows revenue to go into these small archive groups that need those dollars. And then it makes it a available for you to tell the stories because, uh, the Schaumburg Library, which gathered all of the Harlem Information, the reason Harlem is written more about then Bronzeville was, is because you had access to the information. The Schaumburg is actually gathered up all the images and then you could go in there and licensing and tell all these stories. Right. That hasn't been nearly as easy. And Bronzeville, I, uh, I do the licensing and permissions for the Chicago defender right now and we, we've negotiated with movies, documentaries, books, but it's very manual. It's voluntary and it is not the, uh, it is not scalable. So we're, we're making that, uh, as a revenue stream for black legacy newspapers that own their archives, the photographers and the archive groups. Okay, good.

Speaker 1:          39:31          Hi. Thank you ladies so much for your information. Um, it's going to be beneficial to all. So, um, my comment slash question is in the form of money since you mentioned that. And so my question is, have either of you thought about any type of fundraising efforts in order to not only get your information out there, but then also collect funds at the same time? All right. The tribe is actually celebrating our second anniversary right now, so we'll be having a huge fundraiser on April 12th so yeah, you'll be getting all of that information and we don't have a fundraiser scheduled, but we will. It's, it's going to be as, as new collections join the obsidian. Our hope is to, as we welcomed them to have a fundraiser to celebrate because the, the digitization takes time, treasure, money, all of those things. So we'll that, that's our strategy.

Speaker 1:          40:27          Thank you. I was going to ask you, you know, we, you're here in Chicago, so the Chicago defenders available, but what about the other black newspapers across the country? How urgent, what's stat? And can you give us an example of what it's like going into the bowels of whatever defined this material and is some of it destroyed? Is it salvageable at the other newspapers saying Lincoln, Pennsylvania, or, uh, you know, Amsterdam News in New York? Yeah. So it's, it's, that's a, that's a phenomenal question. When, when we started with the defender, the first thing I did was start talking to other black legacy papers just to kind of see where they were so we can mirror what they were doing and, and nobody was doing it. As, you know, as journalism, uh, institutions have shrunk. The first thing you kind of put on the side is the archive and you maintain the journalism.

Speaker 1:          41:14          So, um, and then when things are so different people have them, different people feel they own them. So we've got the lawyer's sorting all of that out. But we've got a lot of, we've got like eight legacy newspapers in the queue that want to join the Obsidian, but most is local. So in terms of rolling the man and getting them digitize, those are very specific to the local community aspects. And we're looking at partnering with local Hbcu to partner with their library science departments and get some of that Labor go in and get this whole thing kind of this big obsidian circle, which is the logo of sitting in circle.

Speaker 2:          41:58          I can add on to that little sure. Archiving. Um, again, we do see the tribe, um, as a future, um, source for these types of materials because so many newspapers and publications have laid off photographers and people who take videos and things like that and, and a lot of millennials and youth, we get our news from our phones. Um, and from really kind of like tabloid sites on, on Instagram and, and Twitter, like the shade room and things like that where there's not real news and it's people just aggregating materials. So it's very important for us to be very persistent and going out and taking new images and capturing a what Chicago is today. That's one thing I love about you guys is you're not just aggregating entertainment and, and just actually make a point, not, we don't aggregate at all. Like we'd all go and say, oh, this is trending right now. We're going to just like copy and paste with this peep with these people said, because our whole thing is since we have a small staff, it's like if this story is already being told, there's no reason for us to like tell it to. Yeah, yeah. You know, we need to go in and tell the stories that are not being told.

Speaker 5:          43:16          That's a great point with this big black history month and I think it's important, like you said, you need to tell the stories that are not being towed. Uh, my name is crystal Allison and I tell people I'm first generation great migration to Chicago by way of Arkansas and Tennessee. And in that process I've been, Angela and I have known each other since high school and we've talked a lot about amazing, we talked a great deal about this and I shared and I think that what is, you know, what she's doing is phenomenal. And I just learned about the tribe today. Angela Mia, miss mentioned it and none of some of our other conversations. But, uh, when the movie the Butler came out and I was at the advanced screening and it was done by, um, what's his name? Um, Lee Daniels. So talking about it because they didn't know about that story.

Speaker 5:          44:12          So I was there for the Q and a, et cetera. And I said, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. The black man that was in the White House, he was the highest level executive in the White House at that time, who happened to be one of my relatives effort, Frederick Morrow. He Ha I knew the Eisenhower. He was the first African American to have the highest level position in the White House when Obama ran for president then a talked about it, he here in there and buy Ebay because I like to look stuff up as well. I realized that he had written a book and it was entitled Black Men in the White House and he chronicled a lot of the things that were going on in a lot of the involvement that he had. So as I spoke to the Daniel's, I was gonna like and telling that story. You also need to tell this story too because he was a republican and he was a lawyer.

Speaker 5:          45:08          And in addition his sister also made some major inroads as well. But it was kind of like I'm learning like I didn't notice, you know as well as I'm learning a lot of other things. I didn't know. One of my great uncles was a Tuskegee airman. He is going to be 99 years old this year. So I think that what you guys are doing on both sides, on the millennials side and on this side, that there are stories to be told. There are photographs that are out there that are in people's personal collections. And so I'm not sure if I missed part of it, but what are you doing to get personal collections included in your archives as well? Well or, or how do you communicating that this exists so that people who, you know, cause some people where as you're leaving us, you know, the photographs, you know, like being buried, thrown away or kind of locked in somebodies a photo book and not being told about,

Speaker 1:          46:05          well one of the things, uh, that uh, personal archive collection actually kind of falls under the category for us as, as a small community archives. So when the obsidian first joined Google Arts and culture, we put out a press release and we got a ton of pickup because everybody was just so excited about that. And uh, one of the phone calls I got was a woman who had inherited her dad's collection of 300,000 photos that included 1960s Motown, which is gold and 1960 Chicago, which was awesome too. And so many times people inherit these wonderful collections of black legacy, but they definitely want to retain ownership. And most people think, well, I've got to stand up a museum. I've got to create my own foundation. I've got to replicate this entire thing and what we're offering. And instead is a platform for some of that. But at the same time we're going to be, uh, having workshops and symposiums on how to properly store and keep your own archives and also what's valuable, what's, what's valuable to the world and what's valuable to you, which may be two different things, you know, um, what, what happens when people, things with, uh, a collection, what happens when people leave him with a museum or a university?

Speaker 1:          47:34          So we're going to do a lot of education around protecting black history as well. So our goal isn't to build another blacksmiths, Sony. And even though that place is amazing, we're going to be doing, we're focusing more on digital outreach, even though we will have a location.

Speaker 5:          47:52          I mean, I think that there is, you know, there's another museum that's in the process of being built. I forget where it's going to be about that. Well, there's always, I mean, we're not, we're not, right. So there's all watering that space, right? Exactly. Yeah. So there's always room for I think, four additional stuff because justice, that museum has a lot of wonderful stuff in there. As I was told, they couldn't get everything in there. So there's, you know, again, more stories that are out there to be told as well. So it's good to see that they're both platforms or forums here to provide that as a mechanism for learning more because I think it is important that we're taught who we are and, uh, learn more about ourselves.

Speaker 1:          48:34          Thank you.

Speaker 6:          48:37          Thank y'all very much. Okay. Come in. And I wanted to ask you guys like, I do y'all really inspire me here today. Like listen to this a lot and it was really interesting. I'm wondering, um, it's fine. Are Ever gonna be part of that? Like, you know, like, cause this, I, you know, I'm 50, so I'm like in between, uh, you know, the millennial or whatever, but I have seen, I have my first piece in the museum when I was 10, so I've seen fine arts. Yeah. Like what about like Richard Hunt and Kerry James Marshall and all those people. Like they did some really cool, interesting shit back in the day

Speaker 5:          49:10          on the tribe. We recognize that, um, news isn't the only way to capture our story. So we have a section on the site. If you go to the top, there's a tab that says the works and it's just a space for creative works of many different mediums from like short films to photography are. Um, so yeah, so we opened that up for people to submit that type, that type of material to, yes.

Speaker 6:          49:34          Okay. Ben, let's get to know. I'll check you guys out.

Speaker 1:          49:37          Yeah. And, and so we haven't been able to get into the fine art space yet because that's a different set of legal questions. And, and so right now we've got images and who owns the image but put projecting artists and something we've gotten to yet. Yeah. It was some really beautiful things out there. I agree with you on all over Chicago old stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I thank you a Morgan and Angela.

Speaker 6:          50:02          One more round.
