Speaker 1:          00:06          I'm excited to open up our talk today and to introduce you to two incredible leaders and let's start with this. How do real people succeed in the real world of work? Kind of a loaded question, but how do they do it? What is their secret sauce? That's the question that bestselling author Joanna Barsh sets out to answer, but not by talking to well established CEOs or motivational gurus. Instead, she dives into the trenches with some of today's brightest and boldest up and coming leaders with 30 years over 30 years at Mckinsey and Company and three bucks to her name. We really have a lot to learn from Joanna. She's here to distill the stories of over 200 rising leaders from 120 companies around the globe, all with the aim to help millennials grow through the challenges we face at work. We're also joined by Amy Yuri, who was a 15 year veteran of Google and I sell multiple leadership roles on the advertising side of the business.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Amy currently oversee developing video ad products for Google marketing solutions globally. She is also a founding member of the women at Google Leadership Board and hosted Joanna back in 2012 at one of the first women at Google leadership summits. Without further ado, I'm going to bring Joanna and Amy up to the stage. Um, Joanna is going to dig into some of the key learnings from her recent book before being joined by Amy for a fireside chat. I just ask that you make sure you're sitting next to someone. I'm as there's an activity that will take place, um, during Joanna's talk and it's important that you've got a buddy. Um, and without further ado, let's give Joanna a warm welcome.

Speaker 2:          01:47          Well thank you. And I could see the gentleman over there. You sit next to that Nice Lady, right? Right. Uh, one and I'm, I'm here. Yeah, yeah. You're sitting by yourself, just squeegee over, which is a technical term for sitting next to somebody and the two of you are like back to back, front to back. Now you should sit on this, sit together. Come on it. This won't be painful and it won't take much, much time cause I've only been given 10 to 15 minutes. So I'm going to talk like a New Yorker really, really quickly and see if I can get you curious about yourself, about the challenges that you're facing at work. And you know, maybe we can have a conversation about that very, very shortly. So let's start with the first risk, which is you, you're here. You took a risk, today was a big day in New York and we're proving that terrorism is nothing to New Yorkers.

Speaker 2:          02:40          So we've already jumped off a cliff. What does it feel like? What about your work? Think about the risks that you could be taking at work and you may be thinking about or avoiding. So what risk are you taking today given that the subways are now working again? So that's no longer a risk that you couldn't get here. Think about it. Uh, during this talk, I started out in 2015 after 30 something years as Taylor said it, Mckinsey, to actually talk to younger people. Why? Because, you know, it's really awful talking to CEOs who have made it. They have their stories, men and women alike, and they've been media trained and so it's very hard to actually get to know them. Younger people don't have their stories finished yet. It's very exciting. Like you don't know how it's gonna turn out after you've interviewed them.

Speaker 2:          03:35          So I thought it was a feminist idea. I reached out to a hundred or so companies. There are about 15 startups in the group. There are also individuals who are actors, artists, scientists, not your norm, lawyers, doctors, not your normal big company employees. Every single one of these people was considered by the person that recommended them to be high performing high potential. So that's the base. And also talked to another of 55 HR professionals about them, which was very enjoyable. And we'll see what came out of that and in a moment. And I basically said, what defines you? Let's talk about your childhood and how you grew up and what you think of now. What's coming to you now. It's kind of a deep psychological interview, which worked pretty and it's got some interesting things out about people. And then I asked them about what is a high point at work or a low point at work in the last year.

Speaker 2:          04:33          And it just collected those and got those stories, which are amazing. Oh, ah. I also asked people, what do you think about millennials? And I got an ear full. What do you think about women? Interesting. Why did, we could talk about that later. Why asked that question? What do you think about women? And I meant it in a truly collegial way and what do you think about work? So we have a whole battery of what millennials think and it is mythbusting. But first the weird thing happened that this group of people, which I had not thought about, turns out to be the most diverse group of people ever that I think have appeared in a book. So they're from all over the world. Are People working in the u s from 80 different countries? I'm sure in this room we have a similar dispersion of where people come from.

Speaker 2:          05:21          And what experiences you've had in life already. And that's part of diversity. They also, I met, uh, married people, single people, single people with children, married people with children. People work in every function. You can imagine. People who didn't go to college, people went to premier colleges. You name men. I met those people. So that to me says we've got an interest in pool of experiences. What can we learn from them? Well, here's the first thing we learn. Uh, a lot of people make their living off of talking about millennials. I do not, first of all, I don't really make a living anymore. But secondly, when I talked to people, I generally talk about leadership. So you probably recognize these words that people talk about when they talk about millennials. Uh, my favorite being the trophy hunter. Uh, but as one millennial told me, hmm, let's just think about lazy.

Speaker 2:          06:17          I'm sure in the baby boomer generation, there are plenty of lazy people as well. So before we cast a dispersion on millennials, let's look at every generation. So I did, and this is what I learned as well about uh, older people, myself included. And you know I like the slow because I am a little bit slower these days at 64. But nonetheless, this is complete bullshit. So you already knew that I haven't touched you anything new yet, so I'm going to keep going. This is what they told me. To me, if you think about your life in these terms, it's pretty scary, right? You're at a place and you've just made a mistake and you know that mistakes are not an option here or that you wake up every day and say, I don't even know I'm working here because work has no passion for me. And everybody says I should have passion.

Speaker 2:          07:11          What about pressure? You all have deadlines. Pressure is the kind of thing that destroys health. It boils over and then you lose sight of what it is. It's really important to you. What if you are working with bullies and Villian villains, and I have, I wrote tough characters, but come on for the record. We know who they are, they're assholes. What are you working for them? What if everybody says you have to have a sponsor and you know in your heart there is no sponsor and and the people around you and you don't know how to get one. You're not even sure you want one. You just got a bad review, literally whack you over the head and then the person giving you the reus says, well what do you, what do you think about that? It's like, what? What do I think about that?

Speaker 2:          07:52          Then you're given an assignment, you're a superhero, you feel really good about yourself and it turns out it's mission impossible and nobody's ever succeeded doing that before. But you've got the job and my favorite of all favorites, you wake up and everything sucks. What does everything sucks. That's a military term by the way. It comes from the army. What this means is that your job is going badly. Your relationship just exploded. You have been gaining weight at a steady pace as your badly eating's since you're not sleeping enough and then finally even your mother calls you up to yell at you, right? So everything sucks. In that scenario. And then the final chapter of this book is worth work. Just as if you have passion but not for this work doesn't feel worth it. What do you do? Do you go or do you stay?

Speaker 2:          08:44          Do you wait it out or not? So those are all the challenges that are in this book. And every story in this book is if you would instant experience for you. So you don't need to be 64 years old and thinking about your whole life deeply as the other training that I do for Google. You can just read the story. So I give you the story of Greg. Let's meet Greg. He's a sports writer. He has a dream job writing for a famous magazine. He's what a he. He likes to call a bro. So Greg's Bro, very bright one, and Lo and behold, six months into his job, his father is hospitalized with a failing heart and probably will die. So Greg quits his job. Doesn't mean, think about it. He moves into the hospital to help his father run his finance business. The father needs a heart, but he is not very high up on the donor list and time is running out.

Speaker 2:          09:44          So what does Greg do? Greg says, I'm going to find out about donations and see if I can solve this issue. And that's what he did. He got into it and then he realizes the entire industry of donations is an old boys' club. None of the CEOs of any of these businesses want anything to do with Greg was a 26 year old guy. He says he looks like he's 12 so he doesn't have a lot of Gravitas. Um, but he comes out of this situation. There is good news here and I'll get to it in a minute. He comes out of this situation, able to change his job, help his father and start a new business, which we'll talk about. But before I get to the punchline of that story, one of the tools that comes out of this chapter, which is bringing others on board is something that I learned from Greg.

Speaker 2:          10:36          And so I want to, I want to test it out on you. Is it? Are you okay being Guinea pigs for like the next two minutes? Okay. The guy in the back says fine, so the rest of you please come along. Here's what we're going to do. Pair up and if you're a trio then one of you can be the observer and just sort of Doctor Freud like just sit there like this. During the next two minutes, one of you will be a speaker, one of you will be a listener and if again, as I said, you don't want to do this exercise listening to somebody who's doing it, you'll learn a lot speakers, you know who you are. You are the one who's willing to talk to the guy or lady next to you about something that seriously is important to you. It probably is bothering you right now, so you're going to get two minutes of free coaching listener. There is only one thing you have to do, which is listen. Okay, that's it. Everybody ready you? You got your pears go. I should hear noise now.

Speaker 3:          11:42          It sure.

Speaker 2:          11:50          Okay. Who amongst the listeners said something spoke, said anything like, ah yeah that happened to me or yeah. How did it feel to listen without saying anything to anybody? Succeed. Succeed in the, in the two minutes she did. So what did it feel like? Just shout it out.

Speaker 3:          12:17          It feels like relating to their advice.

Speaker 2:          12:22          It's hard not to say something. That's interesting. Did anybody who was among the speakers, did you find, what did you, what did you find speaking for two minutes, having the floor. Does anybody have the floor for the whole two minutes? Yeah. What did it feel like?

Speaker 2:          12:42          Weird. I love that. Weird. It felt weird. What was weird about it? There was no response. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, it's very hard to talk for two minutes, but did anybody have a different experience too? You got to talk for two minutes and I have a lot to say. Yes. Yeah. Isn't it wonderful that somebody is listening for do friggin minutes? You felt the same way and have somebody hear you and see you? So I have done this experiment, uh, last week in Dubai and I found that half the room thought it was weird and really hard to fill two minutes and the other half thought it was like 10 seconds. It just flew by. So there's a right answer here, but the act of listening is the most powerful leadership skill you can develop. So if you have a team and you truly can listen with your heart, not from our normal stance of listening, which is I wonder if that person's right or wrong.

Speaker 2:          13:51          I wonder if I'm learning something I didn't already know. What I'm going to say to that person is where you stop listening. The minute you use the voice in your head starts, you are no longer listening. Even if you think you are. So learning to just listen from their stance, not from yours is a huge skill. So that's, that's the tool. What, what happens to Greg? Well, you notice the Greg is no longer a sportswriter. He is now a founder and CEO of a nonprofit, which is called organize of course, right? Organs donating, organize. There you go. And it turns out as Greg's dad was on the way to the hospital with his wife to have an end of life counseling session, a 26 year old in Massachusetts, died in a car accident or a motorcycle accident. And while he was HPV positive, his heart was in good shape.

Speaker 2:          14:51          And therefore, uh, Greg's father was the next person on the list at this hospital, got the heart and survived, which is pretty amazing. But that's actually not the story. The story is that Greg learned as he started up organize to listen and stop selling his ideas. And he shifted from telling people to asking people. And that made all the difference to the donors that came on board. What he learned is that if you actually engage people with the problem, I have this really hard problem I'm trying to solve. Can you help me? People's brains get engaged so fast they can't stop thinking about your problem. And now they're on board and it turns out the money is the easy part. So that is what Greg learned. And he managed to bring a guy named Al Roth onboard who won a Nobel prize for a designing markets. He teach, he was teaching at the time at Harvard.

Speaker 2:          15:57          He's now somewhere else. I don't, I haven't tracked him down, but this is a very cool story to bring someone like that on board to a startup. So Greg learned that, that lesson. So now you've got listing and you've got to asking, but what else could you do if bringing people on board is your challenge of the day. Start with your intention started. You go into a meeting or you go talk to members of your team. What is it you really want to create? If you have that squared away, then everything will fit into that framework. It's most of us don't start with that. Most of us just start with, I'm just here and let's see what happens. Stand in the other person's shoes, which you know how to do. The hard part is to to let go of judgment. We always stand in their shoes and then we judge them because we're human beings.

Speaker 2:          16:47          Everybody does that. But if you can learn to stop judging and get curious about that person, you will actually create a connection that is very strong. You, you don't have to love them, you just have to try to understand them, listen from their center, not your own center and ask really good questions. A good question is a question that doesn't just have a yes, no answer. Free often does not start with the word why and opens up possibilities for solutions. So what are you trying to create is a great question to somebody who you might be having a conflict with. Tell me more about what you're trying to create. Be present, not dominant. What does that mean? Well we know a dominant means. It means like I am the smartest person in the room so I'm just going to keep talking and being present means I'm alert and focus and here with you, which is better if you want to connect to people, it's pretty clear. Being present is going to get you a lot more connections then big dominant and the final to do is to use silence as a tool.

Speaker 2:          18:03          Silence is really uncomfortable. It is also weird and all of us fill it. If you learn to not fill it, the good thing is somebody on your team will fill it and they might tell you something you didn't know or have a really, really good idea. So practice silence. And if someones asks you a question in a big meeting, you silence it will cause everybody to listen harder if you use it. So those are my thoughts. We, I was told it's t did we do 10 minutes? Come on up Amy, because at this point I am becoming dominant, not present. So

Speaker 4:          18:44          I give it to you please. Uh, everybody gives Joanna.

Speaker 2:          18:50          Oh actually I want to go one more

Speaker 4:          18:52          Diogo you'll help me one more. So this is the big, so what Amy went through training and centered leadership. Uh, with me, I was really, really honored to have people from Google as part of our training when I was at a Mckinsey and shaping it. This is the big, so what? You're an iceberg. We all see what you say and what you do, what you don't say, what you don't do. That's what we see. That's all we see. And that's what we judge. And you are so much more than that. Underneath that is everything you're thinking and feeling and you're never going to disclose. And underneath that is your really, uh, thinking about what matters to you, what you believe, what your values are. Sometimes you don't even know what's, that's what's driving your behavior. And underneath that is your human needs. Often people talk about it as fear, but actually it's what is your deepest, deepest need as a human being. And that is what drives all of the behavior, everything that's down there. So you start to think of yourself in that way without judgment, you're going to learn a lot. And as you read through other people's stories, you can put yourself in them and accelerate your own growth. That's what I had to say. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          20:16          Yeah, no. Um, it's, it's an honor to have you back at Google and, uh, and yes, I do remember many of these exercises as part of the central leadership program. Um, and specifically some of the young childhood memory, um, exercises where you asked us to look back and talk about experiences that shaped us. Um, so, uh, it's, it's an honor to have you back and thank you for coming off of a trip from Dubai. Um, Joanna has been traveling around the world talking about, uh, this book and obviously centered leadership. Um, and you mentioned, uh, you know, that your first book, uh, how remarkable women lead, um, was focused on what you'd call the more experienced works at. So what drove you to say, all right, maybe I shouldn't gain new perspective. What, what created that sense of curiosity for you? Show it and action

Speaker 4:          21:12          started with this young ladies in the room, um, in the front row. Who doesn't work at Google? Well, my, um, she said, I think your a book is boring. Um, and she was my, she's my daughter. She's allowed to say that. And so it's actually, it's really okay. And W I asked her what she meant and she said, they're so old, the, these leaders, I can't be them, I'm not even sure I want to be them. And so how do I get there from here is, is a mystery to me. Uh, and I began to think about, well, what about people under the age of 40, what w w what is happening to them? And is it different today than it was 40 years ago? I mean, some of the people I interviewed were 80, and you know, I was like on the edge of my seat to make sure they made it through the interview.

Speaker 4:          22:05          They were amazing people, but they lived in a different environment and a different situation. And today, uh, I'm impressed. I'm in awe of millennials. So I thought it would be really cool as I was retiring from Mckinsey, uh, to hang out with a bunch of people who actually had a lot of hope for life. And was it, it was, it wasn't. I'm still interviewing people, so if anybody wants to be interviewed, just let me know. In fact, somebody in this room was interviewed, but I'm not going to tell you who it is because everybody's confidential.

Speaker 5:          22:38          Um, so what did you, what was the epiphany for you in terms of what red would resonate in the way that it changed the way you wrote this book? I, I've obviously read both and, and the style, how remarkable women lead versus the story is a little bit different. Can you talk about what changed that?

Speaker 4:          22:59          So a one interviewee said, I'm through with school, I just don't need to be taught anymore. And adults learn by doing. And uh, the adults that I'm trying to reach for everybody in this room, you don't have that much experience. You might have six years, 10 years of experience and a jor experience has really important. But wouldn't it be really cool to have like infinite experience of all these other people who face the challenge that you're now facing, but they did it differently than you. So at least they'll give you something to think about. So that's what I wanted to do. I want it to collect the tapestry of stories. Now the Internet is full of people with stories and I started to look at them and they're fake. It's like Susan had an issue. And then it gives you like one paragraph and then in the second paragraph she solves the issue and gets promoted.

Speaker 4:          23:51          So or she doesn't solve the issue. And then the author says, [inaudible] it had Susan only asked a question she would have, you know, whatever gotten the brass ring. So I wanted to write stories that you would go like, what's really going to happen? And the answer is I don't know, because they haven't lived their whole life yet. Will that person becomes famous? I don't know. But there, to me, they became very, very interesting. The second thing I wanted to do is make it real. And you could argue with me that it's not real enough for you and that may indeed be the truth. But I didn't want to sort of say, Amy, just I want to leave you with thinking about why you're so uncomfortable about that question. Instead say, Amy, why don't you go meet that person over there and have a discussion about what gets them excited?

Speaker 4:          24:39          That's something you could actually do as opposed to go home and go, what did she say? So that, that was my goal. You, you did a, um, something at the end of every chapter as well to try to give kind of a toolkit for folks to think about how to solve the challenge. Um, how did you think about creating the different solutions that you did and, and is there any order in which you could go through and, uh, solving these, these work challenges? And, you know, every buddies challenge is different. And I became quite humble. I don't, could only put in the original book had it was like 400 pages and it had 120 stories in it. And now it's 75 stories and you may still find it too long. But nonetheless, I went through all the stories, bottoms up, kind of like a Google data mining exercise.

Speaker 4:          25:29          So though I was an English major, I apologize. And uh, and I, uh, found what these people did. And then through my own experience of centered leadership and being at Mckinsey and Bain consultant and on and on, I put them into a structure, which is first one, a CEO once said to me, just tell me what to do first, second, third in that order. So I tried to order the actions at the end of each chapter based on if you don't know where you are, start at the top and have you already done that. Go to the place where it's now news for you. Great. Um, I know that I am managing people. People always say, well, okay, well where do I start? How do I do this? So I appreciate you giving that specific advice. Um, I love that the titles of the challenges, um, and you know, you went through all of them upfront.

Speaker 4:          26:17          Uh, you know, some of them definitely probably hit closer to home for Googlers. Um, including, uh, the, what do you do after a poor review? Because we just had our, uh, peripheral view cycle, so everybody's just got their annual feedback and might still be digesting and thinking, okay, not what it, what do I do next? Um, uh, I also love, uh, you know, the, the, some of the titles including when you have to be a superhero because you know, working for a company like Google, I know people feel like, you know, the, the bar keeps moving higher and the task keeps getting bigger. And to your point, I have to solve a problem that nobody's ever solved before. Um, uh, I personally love when a risk taking feels like jumping off a cliff. Um, and for some of us we either enjoy jumping off cliffs where or are afraid of heights.

Speaker 4:          27:08          Um, what is your favorite challenge in the book? When I woke up this morning, I, for some reason I was thinking because of that jump off the cliff of cliff divers, which I woke up with like, oh, a semi heart attack. I don't want to do that. So my favorite chapters to actually win everything socks because the came from a military story of a woman who had been to Afghanistan. And uh, she taught me some things that I had really never thought about it. I don't know if anybody has military experience in the room, but it's completely different than anything in life. So I put her in the book for that reason. Uh, ended. Um, there were other people where everything sucks. For example, a woman who started up a really cool business with her friends from her prior work and uh, she was kicked out by those friends and on her own one June morning and had to restart herself.

Speaker 4:          28:05          So there are all kinds of situations where you find a man who worked in an automotive company, uh, who, um, his marriage started falling apart. He was working on the most exciting thing, renewable energy in cars. He was totally committed to this. And then they shut his project down, which I'm sure happens at Google, you know, once in a while. And he just imploded. And somebody said to him, he didn't. One day you'll tell your grandchildren about this project. And he was thinking, I don't have a job be, I'm not gonna have any grandchildren. So he had to pull himself together. So why, that's why I liked that, the chapter. But what it does is it helps you prepare for something that hopefully you'll never be in, but I'm sure you will cause, um, work ends up, you know, after a great week, the next week, it sucks and you didn't ask for it.

Speaker 4:          28:58          And the first thing you do to prepare is, uh, to be mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually resilient, which I hadn't thought about, which is why the military forces people to go through physical training. That's awful because you develop stamina and resistance and alertness in the midst of the unexpected. So resilience, curiosity, bravery. What are, what are some of these attributes that if you look at the collection of stories and the people that you've seen, obviously their stories are not complete, but what are some of the attributes that you've seen, um, are common amongst those that have learned how to overcome challenges and even reframe challenges as opportunities? The, so people, uh, you know, we, you remember that first slide was stereotypes. People think of millennials is waiting for someone to hand them the answer. And I didn't find that at all. I found the strongest element to be curiosity and bravery.

Speaker 4:          30:04          So a challenge is something you really don't want to face, uh, because you know, it's not going to be fun and it might actually be painful. Um, and yet the people who faced these challenges did so because they were driven by a desire to grow. Uh, and some of them were driven by fear. So a fear that if they didn't grow, they would fall behind. And in this generation, if there's one theme that I didn't know, I would find it is that, uh, you're, you, you are growing up with uncertainty. Um, and when I grew up, uh, in, in the 50s, it was like fake on Sir. Fakes are empty, but it was certain, you know, you lived in a house and your dad came home at night and you never saw him, but you knew he was working and everything was cool and you played.

Speaker 4:          30:53          And that was your job just to play every day. Whereas today, I think people from the Internet, from being global citizens of the world, from having, you know, parents who've lost their jobs, you, you grew up with uncertainty. And that means that you gotta be growing wherever you work because you're in charge of you. You already know that. Now it's up to older people who manage you to realize that that's what's driving you. And once you're an owner of your future, then you basically measure everything in terms of am I growing? And challenges are the best way to grow. So the people in this book, they didn't all succeed, but they all sort of took the challenge on, um, in, uh, in looking at the, at the stories of people, um, and those that are continuously growing. Did you find any differences in terms of the stories from men or women?

Speaker 4:          31:53          So I counter programmed the book, uh, because there, um, there was no theme that I found, maybe you could prove me wrong, uh, but, uh, men told me that women were more aggressive, more driven, more goal driven. Uh, we're really kicking ass and women told me that men were more courageous, willing to take a chance and kicking ass. So, you know, it was, and there are all kinds of people in the book. So I put in men who were afraid, men who made mistakes and had to live through it. Uh, and I put in women who are totally, uh, you know, bold, aggressive because that's what I heard. And then I, and then I put the opposite in as well. So there are, for example, a quiet people in the book were very introverted and still heroes. And then there are a noisy, noisy people in the book too, who are very outgoing and able to lead through their social skills.

Speaker 5:          32:55          So I have a couple of more questions, but I wanna give you guys a chance to ask Joanna some questions, uh, about centered leadership, about women's leadership, about grow or you work, uh, about life challenges, uh, uh, about, uh, bringing your daughter with you along the journey. And so on that I just will ask one more question and turn it over to you guys. Um, you know, what do you hope, obviously you, you've mentioned, um, you know, Gabby and she's part of the

Speaker 4:          33:23          trove, this of this in terms of the impetus for, for writing this book. Um, what beyond, um, you're on family. What do you hope people will take away from this book? I, I, um, I'm passing the baton, so I'm, I'm 64 years old. I worked my, not my whole life. I worked in the movie business and some other things before a Mckinsey. Uh, but you were the future. Uh, millennials are our future. So my hope is that this book accelerates enough people to take on challenges and, uh, and become leaders at very early ages. Um, and maybe you already are all leaders who are in this room or, and by leader, I don't mean somebody who runs like a company with a million app, employees leader meaning somebody who sees something and makes it happen because you believe it should happen. It should be the way reality is.

Speaker 4:          34:19          Um, a person with vision, a person with a drive, some kind of purpose. And if you don't have any of that right now, I hope this book will help you on your journey to find it because it took me 50 years to realize that meaning is for me the most important thing in life. Uh, and it's sort of beats all else clearly loving having friends you love, having family love, um, helps you along that journey. But I discovered, at least for me, that it wasn't enough that you needed to be able to help people be part of something bigger than you and that that's what this is. I want you to take action based on the challenges that you're facing. That's what I want. I'm going to turn it over to you guys. If you have a a couple of questions, they're stupefied God kick us off. So that, yeah, in the B

Speaker 5:          35:22          dangerous question to take us off track a little bit, but I, I, I'm dying to know. How would you think about the challenges that you framed in the book for millennials compared to Gen x and, uh, does it matter if you're in the gen x working at Google?

Speaker 4:          35:38          Um, what, what, what do you, how do you see that dividing over for, you know, just kidding. I'm worrying about that chapter. Yeah. And um, there are a couple of you in the room who may consider yourselves more gen x then, um, millennial gen x ers told me that they were raised to suck it up until they reached the goal that they wanted. That, uh, for some reason they felt the loyalty of the company that if they were to wait it out and gain the skills that they would get where they wanted to go. And millennials basically said, I'm out of time. I can't wait that long. In fact, maybe I can wait a year. So that's the, to me, that was the fundamental difference between the two. If you, you know, and an, and as Sheryl Sandberg Admonish me, uh, just a few weeks ago, never say all because it's not true of all people.

Speaker 4:          36:33          It's always true of some people but not all people. So genexers I think can learn a lot from millennials, which is what are you waiting for? Do it now as, take the risk. Now ask the question now. And if somebody says no, they say no, you will have learned from the experience. And I said something a few minutes ago that a lot of the people, the book took on challenges and quote unquote did not succeed in the normal scheme of things. Right? They didn't get the promotion or the gold ring or whatever you were hoping they would get, but they learned something. So in that sense, they succeeded through every challenge that they met. There was a story of a woman who got a bad review. Actually. It was a pretty good review. She worked for a tech company, not yours. And, uh, she, uh, was an African woman set very high standards for herself.

Speaker 4:          37:23          And so she didn't like the review she got and people didn't like her apparently that was in the review as well, that, you know, she's pushy and she set the bar high and she couldn't stand mediocrity. Does this sound familiar? And everybody around her was mediocre and her mind. So she quit and I had the conversation with her. I'm sure that company was sad that she quit, but she said, I, this is not the culture I want to be a part of. I don't want to fit in and have harmony. I like reaching for perfection. And so the only thing that saddened me with her, and I call her EFA in the book, If you read the book, is that she was striving for perfection because she felt she had to make it. It's one thing to strive for perfection because it motivates you. It's another thing to actually think you have to achieve perfection because that ain't gonna happen.

Speaker 4:          38:13          So in that sense, if it made me sad, but I kept in touch with her, she ended up in a startup and she's really happy doing, you know, striving for perfection and creating software that the world needs. So you just said the differences act now versus a wait a little bit later and one of the, well the first chapter hit me personally, uh, because uh, I just lost a longtime colleague who said, I just have, I don't have passion in what I'm doing here any longer. Um, and you mentioned in the book though that you say, you know, as part of the toolkit, maybe wait a year before you actually make a move. So how do you think about the, there's a lot you can do in that year. Yeah, I mean so do you, I mean cause you're saying millennials want to act now and you are giving more that invite advice that I would say is, you know, take a little bit of time before you make, just make that, um, act action.

Speaker 4:          39:09          And that was the same advice I gave her. I said, just stick it out for another couple of months. Try to do this with your job differently. Do this. And, and she just, she came back to me after, uh, taking a little short leave and just said, I can't, I just, I, I, I'm no longer my heads nod. My head and heart are no longer in this. First of all, the good news is you may have lost her, but the world didn't lose. No, I know. And I'm helping. I'm helping her find something else. So, so, so, uh, let me rephrase. Um, she was probably pretty busy while those few months were going by in which she was meditating on her decision. So let's say you're in a job you don't want to be in, and I'm telling you, uh, maybe you should wait a year because it's a brand new job.

Speaker 4:          39:48          You will not have seen the whole business cycle if you leave in three months. Because if it's a really bad fit, you'll know it and you should leave right away. If in fact, you just uncomfortable, you're not learning fast enough, you feel sadness, then what are you do? Well, you talked to a lot of people, so you take that time to learn as you go learn something else, do something outside of work that expands your horizons. So don't wait as in, okay, I guess. So cycle starts in five hours. So I guess I'll just hang out here and go there tonight and see if I can pick my spirits up instead. You really just network like crazy. You're introverted. Absolutely network like crazy and go ask people what their jobs are. Learn how to do to ask your boss. I want to do more. I'm bored to tears for God's sakes. Amy gimme something else to do and Amy will dream it up and give it to you and you and you won't get paid more, but you will love learn. So during that year, be busy growing and there are very concrete things you can do to do that. I see this gentleman. Yeah, patient as can be. Thank you for coming the bunking millennials yet again.

Speaker 6:          40:57          Got It. Quick question for either one of you. Um, if you guys have a story or anecdote from kind of early on in your careers. The first time that you maybe did have this impactful leader and kind of maybe what it looks like to you or how it did influence your kind of career going forward.

Speaker 4:          41:12          Take it away. Um, the question is, did I have an impactful leader?

Speaker 6:          41:18          Yeah. Early on in your career, was there anybody that stood out and really, you kind of recognized, oh, this is a, you know, um, an obvious great leader and there, or really bad and they're helping me in this way, or, you know, kind of push you to, to do something, maybe challenge you in some way.

Speaker 4:          41:31          Okay. Um, so, yes, on both sides,

Speaker 5:          41:34          right? Um, those that were not as, um, those that you don't admire and you observe very carefully for all the things that you make along mental list of the things that you'll never do when you're a manager. Um, and then, um, I love, um, actually, um, I lean notten is somebody that endorsed, um, Joanna as buck. And I lean started in the New York office long time ago when I was here. And she sat, uh, one cube away from me and became somebody that I helped her figure out how to, uh, navigate Google because she'd come from timing. And, um, so I helped her figure out Google. She helped me then learn a lot about, uh, leadership, women's leadership and we became, um, a longtime friends. She's obviously gone on to be a mini different roles within Google, um, and most recently is now our head of people operations. Um, and I had the opportunity to see her last week. Um, and one of the things, uh, she, she had this, did a talk on leadership a long time ago and um, you know, she said, be a snob for talent, meaning higher are really amazing people, people that are better from you. That was one of the things. And, um,

Speaker 4:          42:49          and she also gave me a lot of permission early on to, um, to not always be thinking about

Speaker 5:          42:58          vertically climbing, but the importance of horizontal and as Cheryl Wofford's to edge climbing the jumbled jungle gym to kind of, you know, have lots of different experiences and having somebody like her who had done that in her career, she's moved and now you see, even within Google, um, to lots of different roles and functions kind of gave me

Speaker 4:          43:15          permission to think about doing the same. Sometimes villains can actually teach you as much as great leaders. So early in my career I worked in retail and uh, there was a woman who was my height, which means that she was height challenged and Mrs Wilner, uh, and she, uh, tour people down. She actually enjoyed it. So I think she was on the spectrum of a sociopath close to close to the edge. And I developed, I'm a bloody nose. I would come, uh, unpredictably, I was running some shops in a retailer and I did all kinds of cool things in those shops to get people to actually stop and buy things. Or even just look. So I had everything up ended and looked all like it would fall apart in a second. And she took the whole team to the shop and in front of all the customers screamed at me till I was in tears.

Speaker 4:          44:09          So that was my earliest memory of uh, what, uh, it's really like to work for a villain. Um, and so I switched retailers and I ended up with a taller blonder version of the same woman and worked for her. And, uh, she, uh, did similar things that taught me. Uh, essentially if the doesn't want you to succeed, there are a billion things that you have to get right into your job and you will get something wrong and they will find it. So I learned that I couldn't be perfect. Uh, that it was really embarrassing when I had a bloody nose in front of customers. Uh, and, uh, it gave me the impetus to go to business school and completely changed my career. So I went from retail to consulting where people, only clients yelled at me, Oh, got a lot better, another improvement part. Another important lesson that I give, uh, and, and have tried to follow, which is, you know, once you work for a terrible boss, you kind of say, okay, cut your losses. Yeah, fine, great bosses.

Speaker 1:          45:17          So I opened up your book, I'm on an airplane and I think it was in the forward, but I was reading that what I really love about it is it's designed to, you can read any chapter, you don't have to go chapter one, two, three, four, five. Um, and I think that's a really unique approach. And I went straight to the table of contents and was looking at like, hmm. Like what do I want to start with your first, um, wanted to ask you why you made that choice and if that was based on some of your interviews with people that you met with, um, based on, you know, what books are available in the marketplace and how they're structured, um, or what led you to make that decision?

Speaker 4:          45:48          Um, the, the simple answer is I did structure it in a way that I thought, uh, people on average would evolve. However, uh, you're going to be only interested in the challenge that you're facing. So you should start with that challenge and get into it and see if you can get value from it. Um, I, uh, enjoyed all the chapters and I spent a lot of time thinking about where, where they should go. So it turns out that, uh, there are a couple of basic themes in the book. Uh, one is about fear and that's, uh, shows up in pressure, it shows up in superheroes, uh, and uh, it shows up and taking risk or speaking up, daring to challenge. Another one is caring, meaning purpose that shows up in the first and the last chapter, uh, and feeling purposeful. And then there's a third theme around people.

Speaker 4:          46:44          And so, uh, I put all those guys together, bringing people on board, even when you just like, wish you could just tell him what to do and make them do it and they just won't do it. Uh, or working with creeps or, uh, or trying to get a sponsor. So those, those kind of fit together. But you're going to have the best experience of the book if you start with what's what matters to you. Thank you. All right, time for Tim or questions. I know we're running a little over for folks that have to leave.

Speaker 1:          47:14          Hi. So I guess after listening to you, I fall in the millennial category. I thought it was a gen x, um, that I have noticed I'm a millennial too, even though I'm an old one and it's something I've noticed in train and network or new conversations

Speaker 4:          47:30          is that often it's really hard to get on the connecting side with people as often. I find that because of whatever perceptions they have, they want to other you instead. And so I know that listening to them is a good strategy to try and bring them back, but it's always like, how do you get to that listening side? Like how you ask questions that will help open them up or what are things that you can, strategies that you can do, like getting to that part or in that process to kind of maybe open them up, maybe bring them back. That's a really good question. So there's, there's a couple of things for you to think about. What is, who do you admire and as you reach out to people you admire, actually tell them why you admire them specifically, not generically. Uh, there was a woman in the book whose name is now escaping me, jet lag, let's blame it on that or my age.

Speaker 4:          48:27          But anyway, she, uh, she always starts with specific praise that is genuine and people love to hear about themselves. So if you start with that, you've now opened them up and then ask a question of what's important to you. For example, Amy is an extraordinary marketer and you tell her that and then you say, I would really like to learn more about the skills that you developed early on. Is there a way that I could, without taking any of your time learn from you? And she might say, just walk with me here or just come to this meeting with me that, so there, there is that sort of, that way of saying don't. Um, instead of saying, will you be my mentor? Which the only answer is no because I'm really, I'm a re everybody is really busy. But to say, could I just, you know, walk with you down in the elevator.

Speaker 4:          49:21          I have one question for you. That's one way to do it and you've got to have the questions that matter to you that you think will better to that person. The other thing that Sheryl taught me, uh, and we've interacted now since 2013 because of our shared passion for women is a, the offer to help has to be specific. So you might say as a younger person, and I really want to help you and that's, that's a burden. So you think about I by helping you, what I'd like to do for you is, uh, look at all the research that we have access to and then I'm going to call Carla correlated for you or do something. So the specific help that you offer, then I could just say yes or no. I could probably would say, oh my God, you're such a doll. Would you please do that for me? That was how I ended up becoming better friends with Eileen. And the early days when she was starting women out here in New York. And I said, well, let me just comment. I'll take notes and follow through on the action items. And she was like, great. But it was an exam very specific with how I could help, um, with something that was important to her. But very tactical and specific. So last question, or we have to, we, you guys want to fire them away.

Speaker 7:          50:41          I wanted to ask about the slide where you had perceptions of new leaders, the to old leaders and what you think will prevent the new leaders from ending up like the old leaders. Do you think that it's the company's culture or something with millennials that will end up changing things for the future? Or will we sort of see how things are happening from the old leader's perspective and say, we've got to get in line.

Speaker 4:          51:06          So there's this psychological research that was done on monkeys. Um, and it was, I'm trying to remember, I think Adam Grant wrote it up, uh, in the book option B, but Oh, Mckenzie uses it a lot as well. So this is notion that there are a bunch of monkeys. They're in a a pen and they, there's a beautiful bunch of bananas up these stairs and the first monkey goes up to get it and he gets doused with, you know, water like really horrible hose. He falls down. So the second monkey goes, I can do better. I can do this. It goes up water. Third Monkey. After a while the monkeys stop going up the ladder to get the bananas because they know what's coming. The monkeys died sad, but it happens. They take the monkey out, they put a new monkey in. The monkey doesn't go up the ladder, the new monkey.

Speaker 4:          51:58          And why is that happening? Because the older monkeys are saying, you go up the ladder, you're going to get like shot with water. It's a horrible experience. Don't do it. Now obviously they do that and monkey talk, but they figure out, they literally hold that young monkey from doing that thing. That's my fear. My fear is that cultures tend to show us how to be successful. And the people, the young people who are the most successful in the cultures definition will mold to look like the leaders. And this is one of the many, many reasons why it's harder for women than men because men are more capable of mirroring the man at the top that they see. It's much harder for women to do that. The second thing that happens to people as you get successful, so you're a young person and you're getting success in this formula that you're you, that you didn't even know you have, but it becomes a formula pretty quickly.

Speaker 4:          52:53          And then you just repeat it. And as you are successful, your mind starts to shut down. You like, I'm successful doing this, this is efficient. I'm going to do it again. I'm going to do it again and again. Make all this money and be famous and all those things. And um, you close yourself down. And so one of the things I noticed when I interviewed older, very successful leaders is they weren't that curious. They had it, they knew the story, they delivered the story and they were done. Um, so those are the two like giant rocks that are threatening to crush you as you go through the ladder.

Speaker 2:          53:26          And I think what you could do to avoid it is one, as a community shifts the culture, which can actually be done pretty quickly. The leaders have to want to do it, they have to role model it. And the second is to ask yourself all the time, what can I learn here? She just start with that. I'm successful. What can I learn here? It'll help.

Speaker 5:          53:49          I learned a lot. Um, I always did from your Joanna. Okay, I'll be here. Uh, wonderful. Uh, thank you for joining us. Stay curious. And, uh, we will, uh, do our best to grow and continue to grow while we work here at Google. So everybody thinks,

Speaker 2:          54:06          okay.
