Please welcome Emily to Google.

Speaker 2:          00:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47          All right. So before talking about how you discovered a passion for space exploration, let's start with why space exploration is so important. What's your elevator pitch to skeptical politicians?

Speaker 3:          00:57          Yeah, so it's hard to make an elevator pitch for this, right? I get this question a lot. It's the most popular question. Usually it's stated as more of an argument. You know, why are we spending so much money on space exploration when we have so many problems down here on earth? Um, and I usually skip the traditional arguments of, uh, you know, there's thousands of NASA spin offs. There's a lot of great commercialize technologies we've gotten out of NASA research and development. Um, or the fact that, you know, how would you live your life without a space based technology, without satellites, without gps? Because I think those arguments are overstated. There are there, there said a lot and we've become numb to them and they haven't convinced everybody yet. So instead what I like to start off with is trying to understand what we're actually talking about here.

Speaker 3:          01:45          Um, how much money is actually spent on space exploration, right? Uh, so NASA gets $19 billion a year and if you think of the federal budget, the total federal budget as $1, then NASA allocation of that dollar is half a penny. So it's a relatively small piece of the pie, but it's still $19 billion. That's a lot of money. We should be able to have a great justification for spending it on space. Um, for example, I, I think Google's earnings last year were about $20 billion. So if Google wanted to, they could fund the entirety of NASA. Um, that's a good perspective. Yeah. But it's still a lot of money, right? So that even out of that $19 billion, half of the money at NASA is spent purely on science efforts on studying climate change on setting solar, whether that, you know, the sun emits radiation towards the earth and that can be very harmful to our national assets in space to gps, things like that.

Speaker 3:          02:41          Half of the budget is spent on education and on aviation. We often forget about that second or that first a in Nasa, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA is doing a ton of work on developing planes that can be a more fuel efficient, more cost effective and fewer emissions, things like that. So we're really talking about the other half of NASA's budget, the $8 billion or so spent on human space exploration, the traditional rockets they sending humans to the ISS, going to Mars, that kind of stuff. So it's an even smaller piece of an already small piece of that Pie. Um, but when I, theoretically if I'm talking to a policy maker and trying to justify that money for space exploration, I like to talk about the three g's. Gold, glory and God. And those are often used, the often used as the three justifications for early European explorers to explore the new world.

Speaker 3:          03:35          They were there incentives, they're motivators. And for us, I think it's very similar for space exploration. Those are similar incentives that we should use for space exploration for gold. Nearly every resource that we have here on earth is available and nearly limitless quantities and outer space, right? And so there's, there's already a few private companies working to mine asteroids and harvest those resources. And there had been prominent entrepreneurs who have said the first trillionaire will be made in space. And if you're a policy maker, you have to think which nation do you want to be in control of those resources ultimately. And then with glory, uh, ultimately there will be a flag placed on Mars. And where do you want that flag? It'd be from, because there are many players in the space industry that are working to do that. You know, China and all of Europe and Russia and India, they have great space programs and one of them is going to be the first person, the first nation to land to human on Mars.

Speaker 3:          04:32          And then with God, you know, with the early European explorers, they felt like they had a moral obligation to spread Christianity. But with, with space exploration, I think we can think of that in a more broader context of culture. And when there is theoretically, ultimately a colony on Mars, what culture do you want them to have? What government do you want them to set up? What civil rights do you want them to implement? And if you're the first person there, you have leverage to dictate how that all plays out. Um, and then the last justifications that I give to everyone that I think are even more important is a national security and the survival of the human race just to, you know, put it lightly. Uh, because 99.9% of all species that have ever roamed the earth have gone extinct. And none of them, to my knowledge, have had space programs, right?

Speaker 3:          05:25          They didn't have the ability to check the climate and see how it's changing over time and figure out where in the earth they should live to avoid extreme climate. They didn't have the ability to track asteroids or they certainly didn't have the ability to have the technology to, uh, to move an asteroid away from arts path. Um, and Elan Musk always uses the analogy, you know, setting up a human colony on Mars is like backing up the human race on a Martian hard drive. And I think those above all are some of the more long term really powerful justifications for space exploration.

Speaker 1:          06:01          So you've had a, I'm sure you've had a chance to take their message directly to, to some political leaders. Do you find that your argument is persuasive or does it get a, and that you can break through by framing it in a different way like you just did or there's some just huge barriers to understanding that that issue?

Speaker 3:          06:18          Yeah, I think it's hard to understand the really important justifications like the survival of the human species because that's not likely to happen in the next four years. During their next election, right? They have to think election to election. They have to get, uh, their job in the next four years. And it's hard to, uh, make decisions based on something that could potentially happen decades or hundreds of years from now.

Speaker 1:          06:44          So you've had the cup, I'm going to combine a couple of questions here. You've had, if you've had a both at NASA and with a political leader, what did those two internships earlier in your career teach you about the workings of Nasa, a gum or organization?

Speaker 3:          06:59          Politics. Yeah, so this, this is really interesting. So, um, I have learned from those experiences that when Nasa, NASA is often criticized for being inefficient or that a lot of their projects run over budget and over schedule. For example, eight years ago during the Bush administration, we were going to the moon through a program called Constellation, but for a number of reasons, the program was over budget, over schedule, and for a number of other reasons, when Obama came to office, he cancelled the program and said, you know what? No. Instead we're going to go on a journey to Mars. That program was really inefficient. We're going to do our own thing. Um, and it speaks to the sort of, uh, political instability of a NASA program over time because when a new administration comes in, they have their own ideas on what they want to do with the space program and NASA, I think it's a lot of unfair criticism on that because when Congress gives them an engineering challenge, like we, we, we want to go to Mars in the next 15 to 20 years.

Speaker 3:          08:07          They want to go back to their desks and figure it out and find the best technologies to do that. But then in addition to that problem, congress is like, but also the congressman from Alabama has a factory that builds rocket engines and you need to use his rocket engine because they want to keep all those people employed. And also the congresswoman from California, very powerful. Congresswoman wants to have her rocket assembly line kept in play. And so you have to make the maximum diameter of the booster of the big rocket. Bayer is going to bring the humans to Mars B, you know, this big. And, uh, then NASA is working under these very ridiculous restraints on optimizing this already very difficult engineering problems. So it's no wonder why things ultimately become over budget and over schedule and it's to it, it sort of speaks to why it's so difficult to ever implement a program to get to Mars. Cool.

Speaker 1:          09:01          Want to go run back down to, uh, before you got into college because some of the people watching this will be in high school and wrestling through her parents of high schoolers. So you've spoken about not being surrounded by a lot of stem role models growing up. How did you make the decision to pursue a degree in engineering? What led to that?

Speaker 3:          09:18          Yeah, I, so I wasn't one of those kids when I was little that always wanted to be an astronaut. I liked space, but it wasn't something that I was obsessed with. Like a lot of my peers in the space industry. Um, I liked math when I was in high school and I googled careers that would make a lot of money after college and across the board, they're all engineering, right? And so I was like, I liked math. Engineering uses math and they make a lot of money. And so I honestly, that is how I chose to go into engineering. But engineering is hard. It's very time consuming. A lot of people leave engineering once they start. So what kept me in engineering was because there are more opportunities for students who pursue stem careers, uh, and more interesting opportunities, more paid opportunities, more opportunities to travel.

Speaker 3:          10:07          Um, then I would argue any other, uh, a major that you could choose. For example, when I was in stem, I did as a student, I was 21 years old. I think I wrote the vomit comet. I did an internship in China. I was paid to do, you know, speak at conferences and Italy. Like all of this stuff was, was things that I was able to do were things that I was able to do because I was in stem and I didn't see my friends who are pursuing other majors, uh, able to do things like that.

Speaker 1:          10:37          So maybe drilling down at, I mean, engineering is such a broad terms. So let's drill down an aerospace engineering. So for a student that's never heard that term before, but her baby is hurting, this curious, bringing that terminal, like what does it actually mean to be an aerospace engineer?

Speaker 3:          10:50          Yeah, so it's, it's Arrow and it space. So if you go into aerospace, you either like planes, helicopters, missiles or rockets. Um, and, uh, the people that that go into that major, they typically leave and they work at NASA or they work at one of NASA's primary contractors, uh, for industry. They work at the Boeings or the north of [inaudible] of the world, or they work in the really new and exciting sector of private space. Uh, and the private space industry like space x or blue origin and virgin galactic, um, or they go and serve in the military at the air force or the navy. Um, or they work for the Department of Defense or the CIA or something like that.

Speaker 1:          11:30          Yeah, there's private space industry. Just to pivot off that w, what, what effect has that had on aerospace and, and the opportunities to do new and innovative things? It's a bit of good thing. Has it been a bad thing? It's been somewhere in the middle.

Speaker 3:          11:41          Um, like so touching on what I said before about the NASA having all of these restrictions on how to implement the best solution to this engineering problem a lot, I mean the private sector certainly does have their own restrictions like making a profit, which is a different type of restriction, but they don't have the, the, the, the congressional restrictions that NASA does so they can innovate in a different way, which I think is, is really great. And a Elon Musk came up with the interplanetary transit system recently, which was a really innovative cost effective approach to go to Mars and is different than a lot of what NASA had proposed before. So I think that is disrupting kind of our approach to innovation in the space industry.

Speaker 1:          12:27          That kind of leads right into my next question, which is, so the Fox series that you a host and produce exploration outer space, there was an episode focused on Mars. So having a, I mean I know there's a lot that goes into creating an episode like that, that the, that you don't see when you watch it. Great show by the way. He strongly recommended, um, the, uh, what did, what did you learn about how realistic it is for us to conceive of having any kind of colony on Mars in our lifetimes or children's lifetimes?

Speaker 3:          12:52          Yeah, it's going to be really difficult. The cost I think is the, is one of the primary factors of that to the lowest number I've seen on a round trip mission to Mars for one round trip mission leading up to all the technologies you need, um, is $30 billion. Yeah. Right. And if we're going to go to Maurice, we would probably want to do something similar that we did with the Apollo program. You don't want to just go once, you want to go multiple times and if you're really ambitious, you want to build a colony there. Um, but the minimum number of people that you need to build a genetically stable and healthy colony and a new area is 40,000 people. Interesting. Yeah, it's sort of a rabbit hole I went down recently, like how many people do actually need so that, you know, it's like not incestuous and in 40,000 is a lot of people.

Speaker 3:          13:43          That's a lot of trips to Mars. That's a lot of $30 billion trips to Mars. So that in itself makes it really, I don't want to say unrealistic, but a really difficult challenge, especially when you consider, uh, the political sustainability of NASA programs. I mean there's rumors that with the incoming Trump administration, they may want to go back to the moon and scrap a lot of stuff that we've gone that we've already built, uh, to going to Mars. So it's hard to keep on track to one destination and, you know, be being able to afford those trips is, it's just a whole another beast.

Speaker 1:          14:20          So I wanna circle back to something that you said earlier about the vomit comet. Um, I've always wondered this, I still kind of crocket are you actually wait lists or is it just feel like you're weightless cause you're still the gravitational force. Are you high enough? Like what? What is it as sensation of weightlessness or is it technically wait lists? I'm old.

Speaker 3:          14:36          Yeah, so you're weightless relative to the airplane. Got It. Right. So, so the airplane is diving down toward the ground and you are both in a free fall, so you're free falling within a plane. It's kind of like if you were in an elevator, they cut the cables and you both started free falling towards the ground, you would feel weightless within the elevator. So that's exactly the, the plane flies and parabolic motion like this and it's essentially a 10,000 foot roller coaster. And when it's diving toward the ground and your falling within the aircraft, that's when you feel about 30 seconds of weightlessness.

Speaker 1:          15:11          Yeah. That, that weightlessness. If you were in a, you basically in a constant free fall and when you're in orbit and it physiologically different, in other words, when you're waiting list the space station, are there different physiological effects then when you're in the vomit comet for that little window of time?

Speaker 3:          15:25          It's so it's the same feeling, but the physiological effects I think become problematic when you're in that period for a longer period in 30 seconds. There's a lot of fluid issues, especially fluid in your brain. They have a lot of vision impairment issues because you're the fluid inside your body acts a little bit different under extended periods of weightlessness.

Speaker 1:          15:47          If you're looking for gifts for the holidays, vomit comet on my wishlist or at the head of these days,

Speaker 3:          15:52          low, low price of 6,000

Speaker 1:          15:54          a little little, little more attainable than the mission to Mars. Yeah, that's true. Relative to your cool factor, you get to work with Bill Nye the science guy, probably one of the ultimate science communicators and a role model for me. So what can you share about your role on bill? Nice upcoming Netflix series.

Speaker 3:          16:13          Yeah, so he has a new show that's going to be airing on Netflix in the spring called Bill Nye saves the world and I am one of five correspondence. So if you imagine what the daily show was like, they have field court or is like they have field correspondence that go out and do different stories or segments. And so I'm one of the correspondence, Derek Muller of potassium, youtube severity. Tassian he's another one. Then there's two comedians, uh, Joanna Hausman and then Nazeem Hussain who's from Australia and then Karlie Kloss, the supermodel slash Victoria secret model slash advocate for coding. So yeah, so it's a really great, smart, funny, super talented group of people that I get to work with. And we each have tackled two to three different stories in different countries around the world. Uh, and then the show, we'll be talking about the stories that we've done and then bill and I will do a lot of experiments and bits and they have a lot of really amazing guest stars on the show. So I think I'm, what I'm really excited about with this show is that I personally think that it can do what the daily show did for politics, which was, you know, politics can be confusing and sort of annoying and sometimes very boring. And I think science in many ways can be similar. And I'm hoping that, and I believe that this show can do the same thing for science.

Speaker 1:          17:40          Cool. Well, another initiative, if you didn't know enough on your plate is you recently announced, which I picked up just a couple of days before this, is that you're working in a chapter book series, Simon Kids to bring a love of science and tech, the girls. Tell me a little bit about the series and the first book, Ada lace on the case.

Speaker 3:          17:57          Yeah, so this is in general, I have this chapter book series that's meant for third graders and it's called Ada lace, a nod to Ada Lovelace that what many people consider the first computer programmer. Um, and I, I wanted to do something like this because representation in stem is so important and there's not that many books out there with strong female leads who have a knack and an interest in science and technology. So Ada lace is the main character. She's a third grader with a knack for science and tech. She loves building gadgets and robots and she uses her inventions to solve mysteries and solve problems.

Speaker 1:          18:36          Cool. It sounds like a partners with Goldie blox would fit into the words there at some point. This very similar, very cool. Engineering has a reputation of being one of the harder decrees to tackle. And you mentioned that, that it's, it's tough and some people don't make it through. What advice do you have for surviving and thriving in an engineering program?

Speaker 3:          18:52          Yeah, so I, I will say that, uh, when I was younger I didn't consider myself one of the smart kids. I was more of a slow learner and I was very intimidated by the topics of science and engineering and all of that. And so I get it. I understand how it's very intimidating because it was very intimidating to me. But I will remind people that there's a lot of time in the day, yes. That you can work to make yourself smarter about on various topics. We waste a lot of time watching Netflix and on social media. And so there's a lot of time in the day to make yourself be better at at certain topics. And I've learned that personally because I wasn't one of the smart kids and I had kind of tried to work my way up to becoming one.

Speaker 1:          19:37          Yeah, that's actually the follow the next week you didn't consider yourself one of those markets yet. You got a Ford Auto and in college and you've got through a very tough part and then went on to get a master's degree in a way. Do you think that that maybe it helped that you didn't have the arrogance of I'm the smart kids and you felt you had to work really hard or,

Speaker 3:          19:53          no, I, I, that's hard because confidence can be really helpful in certain situations. It can make you sure of yourself, but in the same way knowing that you don't know everything makes you always check your sources, always check your answer and make sure that you're always studying a little bit harder than maybe you need to. Uh, so having, being humble about your own intelligence is probably helpful.

Speaker 1:          20:18          Cool. Uh, what's the most common misperception about engineering that you find yourself correcting other than engineers? Drive trains. Yeah. He's still here though.

Speaker 3:          20:28          Yeah, that's it. Go on for little kids. When we go and talk to little kids about joining stem fields, the, the narrative that's often told is, you know, you can be part of, of the, the generation that shapes the future. You can build the next Tesla, you can build the next a rocket. You can do work on iPhones and all of these tech gadgets that we work with every day. But I don't often hear the narrative that you can use these skills to help the world do. You can use the skills to not just make it cool and fun and interactive to, to, uh, you know, virtual reality and things like that. But you can do it to help people less fortunate than yourself. And I like speaking about that side of engineering engineers without borders, for example, which was something I was active in when I was an Undergrad. Um, because I think that speaks really loudly to kids who want to help the world in some way. And if you can tell them that stem will give them specialized tools. Did you that I think that can make it sound really, really interesting.

Speaker 1:          21:28          Well, it's, it's, it's a giving time of your engineers without borders. Um, tell me a little bit about that. I'd actually had heard of that before.

Speaker 3:          21:33          Yeah. Oh, and this is an incredible organization. So it's a student run organization, uh, Thor, I believe it's under, I participated in it and it as an Undergrad. So maybe it's also for Grad students, but you, you find engineering problems in, in developing countries or in, in areas that that are in need and you can apply engineering solutions to them. So for example, we sent a group of students to Nicaragua to build a water filter made out of sand because when it's a, they always had these really interesting engineering problems. So this, this village in Nicaragua, there was a school where kids were constantly getting sick because their water was contaminated with fecal matter with waste, things like that. And the kids were getting really sick and some of them were dying every year. Um, and you can't just build the infrastructure for an elaborate water filtration system that we have here, right?

Speaker 3:          22:28          That that's unsustainable. So instead we built a water filter made out of sand because a wet sand has these wonderfully magical properties that there's a bio layer that exists on the top of wet sand that can kill many types of bacteria, including fecal matter bacteria. And if you pour wastewater on top or contaminated water on top, it's like just a huge bucket of sand out the other end comes, uh, clean water, potable water to drink, cause the sand itself acts as a, a mechanical filter. And then the, the biolayer on top kills a lot of the fecal matter bacteria or kills the fecal matter of bacteria.

Speaker 1:          23:07          Very cool. Well, I got a few more questions then I'll open it up to the audience and I'll check the dory. So, um, you noticed that you noted in a recent interview that it was once you get to college, you kind of looked around and were, where are all the girls? What are your strategies, what were your strategies for success in that environment? And then I'll pivot to more what we can do about it. But first what we just strategies for getting through and graduating and not being one of the statistics. It didn't,

Speaker 3:          23:31          yeah, I, you know, I don't know that I have a lot of good advice for that because it's, it's not easy and it's, it's a little bit uncomfortable. I always try to turn the situation on my guy friends and imagine, you know what if you had no preconceptions, preconceptions about engineering before you got there, and then when you got into your first class, it was filled with all girls. It was a total girl club and you're the only guy. It would be kind of off putting it, make you feel a little bit uncomfortable. Um, but if you really like the topic, you, you deal with it, you cope with it and you become like what? I became a guy's girl. All of my friends were guys. Um, I would tell other girls to make sure that they are making in sustaining strong female friendships because those are absolutely necessary through life. And they are hard to make if you're pursuing stem. So you have to be more proactive about it then, um, then maybe your, your male peers. Um, but for me, that's, that's been one of the ways that I've remained sane through my career. Um, and it's absolutely necessary.

Speaker 1:          24:36          Cool. Well, on the positive side, what have you found to be the most impactful when speaking with groups that are underrepresented in stem?

Speaker 3:          24:43          For me, it's always about representation. I always introduce if parents are trying to make science and tech sound more interesting to their kids who may be a minority or a girl. I showed them role models who are in stem that may look like or come from the same community or whatever, like their kid. Because you can talk about the same things. Science is interesting. Science is great. Science can help the world. But when it comes from somebody who looks and sounds a little bit like you, the message, uh, rings louder and it feels more relatable. So I always try to find people on Youtube or, or good books or good toys that have role models that look like their kid.

Speaker 1:          25:27          Just to wrap up with a couple more. So the, uh, you've spoken in Ted talks and others about stem literacy, which is, uh, when we started talking about politicians and how to articulate to them why is stem literacy going to be so important going forward, not just for our political leaders, but the population as a whole. And maybe describe what you mean by stem literacy.

Speaker 3:          25:46          Yeah, so similar literacy for me, it's any time there is a science related issue that affects your life personally. So things like genetically modified foods or climate change or net neutrality, basically it's anything that sounds really scary and complicated, but with a little bit of knowledge of science and tech, you can understand the situation better. And I think it's so critically important because I haven't checked the recent congress, but the last congress, there were fewer than 7% of our representatives who had a formal background in stem. And when we're talking about issues like net neutrality, that is so scary to me because if or you know, or genetically modified foods or climate change or basically, you know, uh, self driving cars or drones that deliver packages, things like that, we need policy makers to science and technology and if our policy makers don't, then our citizens must.

Speaker 1:          26:49          Very cool. Just to close, so imagine you're speaking to a room full of a high school girls. What advice do you have for them as they think about college and beyond?

Speaker 3:          26:57          With my frame of reference with stem, the best advice I give to girls is to lift each other up, lift other girls up. Because when an engineering, if you're the only girl, you have this, this feeling throughout college or Grad school or even your career that you're the token girl in any given group, you are one of one girl or two girls in any situation that you were ever in. And so if all of a sudden you're in a group with, uh, multiple girls, you have a natural instinct to want to be competitive with them. So I try to tell them to fight that instinct because life will be a lot better and a lot happier if you are lifting each other up.

Speaker 4:          27:37          Um, you talked about, uh, role models and mentors. When you're, um, meeting with people who are underrepresented in stem, how about for yourself? Have you found good role models and mentors or do you feel like you're trailblazing and kind of figuring it out by yourself?

Speaker 3:          27:54          I, there's always someone I'm looking up to. I mean, it's hard to find people that I, I see exactly myself in, uh, I mean my role models are bill Nye, Neil degrasse Tyson, people who are a great storytellers and also really effective and efficient science communicators. That combination of skills I think is, is really unique. And I find it in people who are on Youtube and people like Neil degrasse Tyson and uh, and Bill Nye. So those are my role models even at, for me, it's hard to find, um, women in this science communicator role who are much, uh, you know, more into their career. I have peers that I look up to who are, you know, at the same stage that I am. Um, and I think that's fine to have a role model that's, that's your friend as well cause you can always learn from each other.

Speaker 1:          28:44          So a question from the virtual viewers is, you've already mentioned the volume of content. What's the coolest thing that you've gotten to get exposed to through either the programs you've done or internship with NASA in the space field as a result of this opportunities you've had?

Speaker 3:          28:59          Uh, well working with they'll NYSE hands down the coolest.

Speaker 1:          29:04          All right. What makes them so cool? I'm that everything you've already said, this

Speaker 3:          29:06          is exactly as you would expect. He is, he's somebody who has been in this field for so long and has incredible science stories that I imagined him as sort of a, you know, your, your uncle or your grandpa that has a million stories to tell and just will go on and on and on telling really fascinating stories. But you know, it's just somebody that will ramble about science for as long as you will let him. And He, it's so endearing that he is something that he genuinely cares about and is really excited to talk about. So I love that with my show. Um, I've, you know, anytime I get to fly, I'm really excited. So I interviewed Dick Rutan recently who was the famous test pilot who flew the first nonstop flight around the world on, on fueled nonstop flight with voyager. And Dick Rutan is part of the, uh, aviation duo.

Speaker 3:          30:00          His brother is Burt Rue Chan, who built actually designed spaceship one that's in the hallway out there. And, uh, Burt Rutan designed voyager. And I was interviewing Dick Rutan and he was talking about that nonstop flight around the world. And, and I asked him, what was your expectation, what like was it as just as good as you expected? And he started to tear up. And it was one of those emotional moments that was the last milestone in aviation. And I was talking to the man who achieved it and he was getting emotional telling the story and that was so powerful. And then after that we flew in, um, a test vehicle that his brother had designed that was not FDA approved and we were doing aerobatic maneuvers. And this plane, I mean inside the plane it said, warning, this airplane is not FDA approved. And then Dick Rutan wrote under it. That's what makes it so fun. Cool.

Speaker 1:          30:53          Other questions from the uh, we here, we got one back here.

Speaker 3:          30:56          I love all this great science programming that I'm starting to see. I the 12 year old daughter who was really into science and so we used to love things like mythbusters. Oh, you just discovered the white rabbit project. Yes. Um, and then now there's your program and those two at least are both on Netflix. So I'm wondering if you're seeing Netflix is really taking this as a focus area for them and how's it been working with them? It's been amazing working with them and I, that's my impression too. I don't have any insider knowledge on that front, but from what I've seen, it seems like Netflix is really investing in science programming. I been talking to my manager a little bit about this. I, it feels as if there's been a reality TV show bubble that has bursted people. It's been a completely saturated market and now people are craving more educational programming. Um, then Netflix I think is answered that call and they've been investing in these projects. I hope they continue to do so. Uh, it's been really great. And in terms of finding jobs, so yeah, I mean we feel that the people who work in this industry feel the same way. It feels like there are more opportunities available now than there have been in the past even four or five years. So yeah, it, it feels like there's going to be even more educational programming coming online soon. Cool.

Speaker 1:          32:13          Great question. So another one from the virtual sphere is, uh, you graduated from MIT, probably going many different directions. Um, the decision industry versus science communication. They're both industries, but I'm very different than versus going forward for a corporation. How did that decision that, that sort of happened organically or was it a conscious choice?

Speaker 3:          32:33          Um, I was looking for jobs and one day I got an email from a production studio that like, would you like to be the host of the outer space TV show? Um, and I was like, yeah, that sounds cool. And so that's honestly, that's how that started. That's how that began. I had never tried to be the host of a TV show. I had never professionally done science communication. I did a lot of outreach and that's how they found me is I had, um, I had spoken about the benefits of NASA and the value of NASA, uh, to, to public audiences before. And there was stuff on youtube of me doing that. Um, and I really liked that. I think if I weren't doing science communication on TV because of my masters in technology and policy, I would have wanted to work at it on the hill for maybe the office of Science and technology policy influencing science related policy. So I was already going that routes that sort of non technical routes, but working with science and technology. And then that came along and it sounded like a really cool adventure. And now that's just become my career. Cool.

Speaker 5:          33:36          The question about colonizing Mars. So there's a lot of uh, you know, talks about colonizing Mars. I wonder if you think it's a one way trip given that it's a very expensive taking people there is going to spend some time like in the trip, uh, ms specialist living there for awhile, then coming back to earth will be a problem because first, uh, I imagine like a bodybuilder and Mars is going to be like a, just a regular person here are weaker. I Dunno. So how feasible is all that now people talk about,

Speaker 3:          34:06          yeah, so I will say that I think the only way to go to Mars is going to be with government funding and that NASA would never allow a one way trip to Mars. So I think in general they will figure out how to do a round trip. People argue that the technology is already there. It's just making better technology to make it more cost effective. For example, the, one of the problems right now is the radiation that astronauts would experience on the way to Mars by some calculations. And an astronaut would definitely have cancer by the time that they got to Mars or by the time that they were returning, um, just because of that radiation. But what you could do is literally fill a space ship with a foot of water of simply h two o, um, and that would solve the problem, but that is extremely expensive and that can be really, uh, fuel and efficient and propelling an, uh, an astronaut group to Mars.

Speaker 3:          35:07          So there's technologies that are out there that are, could be simple, but it's not really cost effective. But anyways, I, long story short, it will eventually, I'm sure it will be a round trip. I can't imagine anyone participating in a one way trip to Mars or funding a one way trip to Mars. Cool. We had a question right behind you there. Um, do you want to go? Oh, definitely not. No. No. I'm don't even like camping. So that's, yeah, Mars is definitely extreme camp. Can we talk about, so one, have you guys heard of Mars One? You guys have heard of this? So this was, this was a big, uh, I don't want to say gimmick because I think they were very sincere and their, and their ideas, but they didn't have the technology to really describe their mission thoughtfully. But they put out a request for proposals for, you know, people who would sign up for a one way trip to Mars and they got 200,000 applications. And I saw that and I was like, I would bet my firstborn child that half of you have never wanted to go to Antarctica. Half of you have never even thought about climbing Mount Everest. And probably many of you are like me and don't even like camping. Like Mars is a terrible planet to live on. I don't think people really understand the full ramifications of, of going there Starbucks to very light. There's not many there.

Speaker 4:          36:27          So there's a lot of talk today about how we now live in this post truth world. Does that change the strategy for you as a stem educator? Is, is there some context there? We have to communicate differently if facts may be don't mean what they used to.

Speaker 3:          36:40          Yeah. My strategy with that and I think that there's always been some hesitancy to believe experts or there there's, there's distrust of the scientific community and there has been for a while. I think it's, I don't know if it's growing, it's, it's uh, a hard under a situation to understand. But for me, the way that I address it is I always tell people you are the most influential in your own circle of family and friends. And the most effective way to combat, uh, stem illiteracy is to speak to the people who care about your opinion and to have those hard conversations about climate change or about whatever topic that you find interesting and personally care about. Cause they, you are the person that they are most likely to listen to. Cool

Speaker 4:          37:30          Tech. I feel like we, uh, at least in software development we get to kind of stay as far away from the government as we possibly can unless we have to. Like we'll do the bare minimum to interact because it's just generally a very slow, uh, institution. I feel like in space exploration, working with the government is at least half of it. So it's certainly not just about science and math and technology. It is half about like policy makers. So we'd love to hear your thoughts about what it's like working a little bit more with policy makers, like how you navigate some of that bureaucracy and not nepotism, but like, you know, uh, short term goals that a lot of policymakers have.

Speaker 3:          38:13          Yeah, I mean, so I don't personally work with the government, but you know, through my show I speak with NASA who often does. And, um, what I think that the trade off there is that for people who work at NASA, it's, it's very annoying to deal with that bureaucracy. It's annoying to deal with those restrictions. But at the same time they are working on some of the most profound questions humans have ever asked. Like, where did we come from and are we alone? And so they get to work on some of the most exciting projects that any engineer could help to work on. Um, but they are working under a government salary. They're not getting paid as much as they would if they were in industry. Uh, and then they have to deal with all the red tape and the bureaucracy. So I don't know that that answers your question, but it's, if you're in the space industry and you're working for NASA, you get to do some really incredible work and really exciting projects. But there's, you know, there's a give and take to that.

Speaker 1:          39:11          So I just want to close with one question since it's the end of the year and it's always good to end positive. So what's the, what of all the things that are happening right now in space exploration or science in general that has you most positive, enthusiastic, optimistic?

Speaker 3:          39:25          Yeah, I think the fact that people like ending this is a very specific technology that I'm excited about, but blue origin and space x working to perfect reusable rockets is just changing the game in the space industry. I mean, Elon Musk thinks that he can take that $30 billion price tag with, with Mars. Um, and that would equate to about a $10 billion ticket for sending a person to Mars today to a $200,000 ticket to sending a person to March today because of rocket reusability. And so I think that once that's perfected and proven to be safe, it's going to completely change our mindset on going to Mars and expanding the human race into the solar system. Cool.

Speaker 1:          40:14          Thank you very much for those virtually avoiding the rain and those in the room. Thank you, Emily, for sure. Thoughts. Really appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you.
