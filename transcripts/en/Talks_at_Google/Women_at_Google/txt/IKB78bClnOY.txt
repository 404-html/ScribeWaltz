Speaker 1:          00:06          So it's my pleasure to welcome my friend Maura here today and we're so lucky to have her with us. She's a writer, an academic who is currently part of the Harvard Society of fellows. She just finished her phd at Yale, so we should all congratulate her afterwards. And her work is fascinating. It's at the intersection of social theory along with histories of labor, media and Technology in the 20th and 21st centuries. Her book, which we'll be talking about today, is called Labor of love, the invention of dating. And Maura is also a founding editor of logic, which is a new magazine about technology or Weigel. Thank you for joining us. Thank you for having me. Whoo. Okay, so just to kick it off, I want to start by digging into the book you've called the Book Labor of Love, secretly an economic history. What's the connection between economic forces and dating and how has that played out in the last century?

Speaker 1:          01:04          Yeah, well, there are a lot of connections between economic forces and dating. I feel like, um, to backtrack to when I was first starting to think about the book part of why, you know, contrary to what it might seem, I wasn't always obsessed with dating or at least not anymore than I think most people up. We are. Um, and, but, uh, one aspect of its history that really interested me is that this practice that we call dating that we might take for granted as sort of like natural and not think about is something historical is actually like pretty new in human history. If you look at most societies, uh, it's not been the case that young people go out and meet one another on their own. And it's really only emerges when you start to have large numbers of women in the workforce. Dating is connected to the economy in a number of different ways.

Speaker 1:          01:49          But one of the big ways and part of why as a feminist, I was excited to write about it, is it only emerges as a practice when you have large numbers of women going outside the home, going outside private space and the public space earning their own money. And we'll sort of like taking control of their own romantic and sexual lives in a way that really was pretty unprecedented. I mean, it's quite interesting because of course this happens differently. My Book's mostly about America, but we can watch this happen in Asia, uh, in a different way or like an African a different way. But it's the history of dating. It's very tied to the history of women entering paid work. Uh, and then of course there are some other ways too. I think that the ways we think about love and romance are like totally shaped in a number of ways by the way.

Speaker 1:          02:32          We think about economics, uh, in terms of being, you know, on the market, off the market, hard to get. These are all economic metaphors. So I think there's a kind of economic unconscious that how we think of a lot about a lot of things about dating. Absolutely. So how has today's economy reflected itself in this age of Tinder? Um, what's the Gig at the sexual gig economy like? Um, I think that, uh, I think that, you know, like every other aspect, our lives, our romantic and sexual lives are becoming more flexible and uh, this has both positive and negative aspects. I feel like one reason I wanted to write the book was to push back against all these kinds of doom and gloom and narratives about dating apps and online dating. I feel like around 2012, 2013, when I was first starting in 2013, 2014, when it's frustrating to think about these questions, there were a series of how it high profile stories in books.

Speaker 1:          03:25          I don't know if folks had like mom's send these to them or saw them in another way, but there was like this big end of men story. Uh, that was in the Atlantic. There was a huge New York Times story called the end of courtship. There's all this anxiety about hookup culture and uh, and I'm always interested in these conversations about crisis because I think it's where people actually articulate what they believe men should be and women should be. So I'm always very suspicious of them. But at that time anyway, I was interested in all these articles that were basically like, you know, humans have always met and fallen in love in this, in this way. And ever since cavemen days, this is how men and women were until Tinder. And like now everything's over. This is like a historian. And as, as a young person who is still dating this seem suspicious to me.

Speaker 1:          04:10          Uh, so I wanted part of why I want it to do this research was I was like, well, it can't really be the end of sex and the end of men and they end up loving the end of courtship all because of Tinder. Um, so what's behind that? Uh, so anyway, that was wanting to push back against that narrative of like crisis around courtship was part of how I got into this project. Yeah. That's something that really fascinated me about the book. It felt like there were these moments of crisis every time there was new technology. And I actually found it pretty comforting. So you talked in the book about how when the automobile came out, people were like, this is the end of morality. And at the different stages people had this moral hand ringing. So I would love if you could talk us through some of those moments and then also tell us like, is there even such thing as traditional courtship, this idea that people seem to think is being lost?

Speaker 1:          04:56          Is that even something that exists? Yeah. So totally. So this will either be really comforting or really depressing depending on how you think about it. But one of the interesting things about the history of dating is that, and I start to talk about it by the way, people often, I call it in the subtitle, the invention of dating. And people are like, well, what does that mean? Having people always dated, and I joke that dating was invented in 1896. This is the first time that we see it and the print record, uh, being used that word in the way that we use it now. Um, but basically, and again, as I was saying earlier, it's tied to like women entering the workplace and young people in general moving to cities and this new kind of urban culture that you have emerging in that period. But when you go back into the history, the thing that is either comforting or depressing depending how you think about it, is there has never been any time or place in which people are like dating great, killing it.

Speaker 1:          05:45          I'm sure I'm doing it right. All the kids are doing it right. We're not worried about them at all. It's constantly, you know, from the very beginning of dating, dating, dating is said to be dying or in crisis. Um, and one of my favorite research things is that I learned that during the first decade or so that you have women going out with men, uh, on what we would now think of as the most traditional looking kind of date, like going out to dinner, going out to a movie, uh, that the first one who do this are often were arrested on prostitution charges. Um, and a lot of the early research I did was in like vice squad reports because there was no precedent for women going out on their own with men at or for money being transacted in courtship. Like when you think of a Jane Austin novel, Mr Darcy isn't buying anything.

Speaker 1:          06:28          He's just like going into her living room and hanging out with her mom, Elizabeth, that that's her name. Um, so anyway, I think that like back in the very beginning, like the very first period where you have this thing called dating, you have not just handwringing but literally like arrests and people being dragged off to reformatory. And then throughout the history there's this constant kind of overtone of anxiety both from the grownups and from the people who are participating in dating. Because one thing that's distinctive is nobody ever knows. Unlike courtship systems when it, where it's controlled by parents or by rabbis or priests or whomever, a defining feature of dating is that nobody knows exactly how you're supposed to do it. And that's always been true. Right? So let's paint a picture for people who haven't read the book. What came before dating. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:09          Uh, so in the book, you know, of course everywhere has their own variables and their own situations, but the dominant middle class system of courtship and the 19th century is called calling. Uh, and again, it's the Jane Austen scenario, right? You like sit in your living room, your mom, your aunt, your sisters are there gentlemen callers can come visit you. Uh, it's almost is since I'm an academic, I always think of it as a kind of awkward, like office hours, no magic kind of situation whenever it goes to that. Um, no one wants to go to my office hours. Oh. But yeah, so calling and calling is, as a system of courtship is symbolically important. I mean, I believe that all of our social practices and code, all kinds of beliefs about how we think the world works and what kinds of roles different people should perform.

Speaker 1:          07:56          But it locates courtship in the home. Right? So it's like in the territory of the family, it's being supervised. It is supposed to be noneconomic. No money is exchanged. I mean, I think that's very interesting as it, it's also very much understood to be in control of the women. Uh, I read there's an advice column and the Ladies Home Journal, which is like the most popular magazine in the world around 1900 and there's an advice columnist called the lady from Philadelphia who, and who answers people's romantic questions and she would get these letters from young men saying, oh, can I go call on a young woman if she hasn't invited me? And The lady from Philadelphia, contrary to our belief that men are always the initiators is absolutely not. You know, you can, if a woman doesn't want to see you, you can't go show up at her house in this way.

Speaker 1:          08:42          So there's, it's important sense in which the calling system makes women like the hosts of courtship. Uh, and this dramatically changes when people, when portrait moves from the Living Room with mom and dad into the public sphere, which historically has been seen as the sphere of men, the year of money, the three of the market. So it's the predecessor to bumble women have to make the first move. Something like that. I think about it. I want to hear if your mom were on bumble maybe. Great. So we'll, we'll talk about that in a little bit in terms of these ideas that we think are deep seated into our DNA and actually are relatively new inventions. So one thing I read was that you had initially thought of things like dating and relationships as maybe too silly or trivial to warrant serious study. How did you change and come to write this book?

Speaker 1:          09:32          Yeah, well this book as my phd supervisor be happy to tell you it was a distraction from my main h d research. It wasn't what I was supposed to be working on it, you know, where I was in Grad school. Uh, I feel like, again, about this time when there were all these stories coming out, which I see in a way as a reaction to the financial crisis, and we could have a longer conversation about this, but why around 2013, 2014, there was all this anxiety in the air about like, men are an acting like men and women aren't, you know, kids aren't dating properly. But in that moment, um, and I was in Grad School, I was getting trained in all these ways of looking at theory and history. But of course on my own time, I spent all my time with my friends talking about love and sex and romance soon, if not all of it, but quite a lot of it.

Speaker 1:          10:13          And I feel as if I came to this point where I realized like, we're all developing these huge intellectual tool kits to look at certain kinds of questions. Um, but why, you know, why don't we take this other kind of questions seriously. And I think in a very deep way, um, you know, dating for better or worse is the system that our culture has in place for like reproducing the world, like forming social bonds for intern biological reproduction, for setting up a kinship networks. Like there's very little that's more serious than that actually. And I think that there's actually something really kind of sexist and conservative about treating some of these topics is if they don't warrant serious intellectual consideration. I mean I think it's kind of funny to have this whole cultural system, especially if you're a straight woman where you've grown up, you know, your whole life with magazines and movies and books and all of these cultural signals telling you, you know, here's what you should want.

Speaker 1:          11:10          Here's how you should be if you want to be loved, which by the way is like the most important thing about you. And then the minute that you're like, ah, I have a question, I have a question about that. It's like it's not serious. Don't, don't waste serious intellectual energy looking at this. So I feel as if I came to the project kind of extra curricularly in graduate school. But then once I started thinking about it and all the ways that, um, that are romantic beliefs are in meshed and like deep social beliefs, historical practices, that kind of thing, I really felt like it felt important to take like a serious intellectual lens to look at the sources of these messages and the work they were doing in terms of teaching us to desire. Well, I'm so glad you did write the book. Oh, thank you. I was wondering if you would read this passage us and then I have a followup question on it.

Speaker 2:          11:56          Ooh, look at this. All right.

Speaker 1:          12:01          I began to feel a need to write this book when I sensed that I was trying to make a life according to rules I did not understand and that the process had blinded me to mind desires following my desires was supposed to be the point did, I had never reflected long enough to discover whether the feelings that I believe should be there actually where I had no idea who I was. And as long as I kept impersonating all the women I thought I should be, I could not receive love much less give it, I had no self to choose to give it from.

Speaker 2:          12:38          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          12:39          she was still. So have you ever feel moved to laughter? It seems like, I'm trying to be funny, just like, so based on that passage and based on what you know now, I'd love to ask you, what advice would you give 16 year old Maura and more broadly if you could design a class that every high school girl had to take before entering adult relationships, what would you include in that course? Okay, these are big questions. Um, I think, I think that, and I'd be very curious to hear from people here. I think what's interesting, if you're a certain kind of ambitious [inaudible] sort of like high achieving straight woman, especially, you received this one set of messages about your career and you're supposed to be confident in your soul to be able to act in all these ways. And then you receive basically opposite messages about your love life. And indeed, not only are you not supposed to show initiative, you're supposed to do all this extra work to like cover up the fact that you have that you have those traits. Um, so I feel as if if I, I mean 16 year old more like who knows what could have helped. But if I good think about could have known anything earlier, I think,

Speaker 1:          13:45          I don't know, I would have liked to be more aware of the ways in which these rules that are given to us and these things that we're taught about how to be, if we want to be desirable, um, serve all these incentives that are not necessarily our own. I mean, it's an excellent way to sell women things like anxiety. It's like tell them woman that's something that she didn't even know was a thing wrong with her and then sell her the thing to fix it. It's like an engine of quite a lot of the economy in general. But I feel as if, um, yeah, this way in which you get so many messages that are also always about like repressing your own feelings. Like, if you think, and we can talk about this, but do you think about how many self help franchises are basically like whatever you might feel like doing, do the opposite thing.

Speaker 1:          14:31          Like don't do that. Don't show your feelings, don't express your desires. Um, I think being aware of the ways in which that grew out of history that's deeply sexist and certain institutions and practices that are deeply sexist is would have been helpful and probably would've made me less anxious and self Hayden and various moments. Um, but it was the other thing is syllabus. Yeah. So I think, I mean it's kind of a combination. It's like what would 16 year old Maura have benefited from knowing with what you know now, but what would women in general benefit from knowing? And I think the answer of just be skeptical of somebody telling you that something's wrong with you and then trying to sell you something to fix it is good advice for all of us. And I think also, and it's hard for us to do and it's especially hard to do in romance because we all have so much at stake personally and want to make things work, but also to think structurally and systemically sometimes can be very helpful.

Speaker 1:          15:20          And I think that this is the opposite of what we usually want from self help. Usually what we want is a totally normal, fair thing to want as we were like what are the 10 tricks that will like help me navigate this situation, you know, whether it's professional or personal. But I think that what is exciting and radicalizing, I'm like liberating about studying history is you see how many of these issues and problems are in fact structural and social. Um, and you know, there's quite a lot of work left to do before women are romantic equals or equals of any kind, um, in, in all kinds of social situations. It's substantively and meaningfully and those solutions can all be done by like working on yourself personally. Is that a real pep talk that you've given your friends where they're like, what's wrong with me? And then you're like, it's not you, it's market forces and society and 100 years of sexist institutions that have contributed to where you are today. More than a hundred. I feel like, I think that

Speaker 1:          16:22          I have my, trying to think of specific friend and specific pep talks. I mean I think this sense in which like the answer that we get is so often like work a little harder on yourself. Do a little bit more about this. I think that the idea that it's like that's not the problem isn't always you is certainly a thing that I've stressed to friends. Um, whether I talk about market forces when we're putting up there and I hope I don't. Um, but yeah, so I want to talk a little bit more about what you mentioned about self help books. So you make this really great point in your book that if you go to a bookstore and you walked down the self help I all on your left hand side you might see are all the career books that tell you lean in work harder, don't speak with uptalk.

Speaker 1:          17:02          And it's all about like really putting effort in toward your career. And then on the righthand side could be all of these books about your love life that say whatever you want to do, do the opposite and not him. It's you. Yeah. I think I'll quote you here when you said, um, if you want to call him, don't, if you want to sleep with him, don't, if you slept with him and you want to call him afterwards, don't, and it's true, it's like the rules is literally 32 chapters each one of which is like don't do this thing they want to do. Right. So I think it's fascinating to just explore how on one hand we're being told to put so much effort in. And on the other hand we're told to be passive. So how do you navigate that tension? Wow, that's a big question.

Speaker 1:          17:40          I mean, I think that again, to look to history, like a thing that interests me. To go back to the beginning when we were saying how this whole phenomenon of dating is predicated on women being in the being like mobile in cities having certain kinds of agency that we hadn't had historically that it's been, that you start to see all this romantic advice as almost like a reaction or an attempt to control female sexual sexuality given that it's no longer being controlled by mom and dad and the rabbi or the priest. I think that, um, sorry. I think that that perspective was very interesting to get while researching the book. It was funny to look at 19th century advice like advice for calling cause people were also anxious about calling, but there wasn't this emphasis on deceit. Like I feel like a contemporary of self help.

Speaker 1:          18:24          There's so much emphasis and I mean this by the way for straight people fascinatingly self up for Queer people, it was very different. And I think shows how much of this is about reinforcing certain binary gender roles actually. But, um, there's so much emphasis on, you know, not showing too much about how you feel or um, you know, covering up your desire. And this really only emerges with dating and this earlier era, there's much more emphasis on sort of sincere self expression and straight forwardness. And I think that in a lot of ways from a macro perspective, this is about controlling female sexuality and how anxious it makes a culture broadly for women to have certain kinds of liberties that they hadn't had. And also if you tell women men are from Mars and women are from Venus, it's a lot easier to sell both of them above to explain the other jet.

Speaker 1:          19:08          Yeah, exactly. I feel like it's, um, very, very many self help books and kind of be summarized as like what dudes are like by a dude. And I was like, what women are really like by a woman that this sort of mutual mystification of men and women to each other is a very good engine for selling both sides things. So this whole idea about women needs to be passive in dating. It's often chalked up to this evolutionary legacy. Can you talk a little bit about that and kind of where some of that pseudoscience emerges from and how that impacts us today? Yeah. Well I think, I don't know if folk scene, I feel like maybe this trend has peaked and gone down a little bit, but I feel like the, the sort of ebbs psych clickbait the article that's like did men involved to like women in high heels?

Speaker 1:          19:49          Like yes, click it. This is sort of like a kind of piece. There's that new book that came out, casual sex about how Tinder is affecting monogamy and I think it reinforces a lot of these ideas. So it's still, it is that books, I haven't read it yet, I just read an article about it. But it was basically saying that like men had to become monogamous in order to get married, which gave them access to women and an ability to reproduce. But now with Tinder, men have this easy access to sex when they want. So there's this bifurcation between like the place I go for sex in the place I go for marriage, which is leading fewer people to want marriage. It's really amazing how many respectable academics and scholars in 2017. It's like never occurred to them that women might also enjoy sex, but it's like there's still this idea that heterosexuality is like this depressing truths whereby women give his little sex as I can get away with for affection.

Speaker 1:          20:38          Um, and that men do the opposite or the contrapositive or whatever the mirror image of that is. Um, I think that it's very comforting to believe that certain phenomena are natural or biological or hardwired in like the Pleistocene era. Uh, and we all love, we don't, I don't, I love carbohydrates, but many people love Paleo diets are like this idea of, you know, that something was natural and it's how Cape people did it. So it's how we should do it. Um, I think that this is very rarely they useful framework for like explaining human behavior. We're social creatures or historical creatures. Um, this isn't just some wishy washy kind of social construction thing. I mean brain scientists talk about the plasticity of the brain and how quickly it can change sellers of gene expression to talk about how much environmental factors trigger and shape, like which genes express themselves or not.

Speaker 1:          21:30          So this idea that the nature of heterosexuality, it was like established by cave people and we're still somehow acting that out always to me seemed um, very circular and all sorts of ways. You know, it's often, um, Stephen Jay Gould, who's the evolutionary biologist at Harvard. Describe this kind of story is just so stories, um, but also like just not that useful and mode of explanation as I was suggesting earlier. I can look back at advice columns from like 1905 and they say totally different things to what we say now about who should take the initiative in a courtship situation or whose role it is. So I think that like humans are much stranger and more flexible then this kind of narrative suggest and it's really comforting sometimes I think it's kind of Ed psych narratives are comforting to everybody. It's like if you are a conservative, you know, if you're a conservative and certain gender beliefs, it's reassuring to think like, oh, things won't change that much.

Speaker 1:          22:23          This is how people are. Um, and if you're frustrated by the lack of progress, it's like your boyfriend's not a jerky evolve not to pick up the dry cleaning, you know? Um, so I think that these narratives are very appealing as clickbait, but I think that they don't really, they're not very useful actually in terms of their explanatory power. And there've been many critiques within academia of, of evolutionary psychology specifically. It's funny, this is one of these modes of thought that's like existed in its popularized for much beyond a much longer than it's existed and it's institutionalized academic form. I love how you call it clickbait. And I think it's interesting to note that it's neither helpful for explaining gender roles in dating nor for why there are fewer female engineers at places like Google or do there. Um, is there a question?

Speaker 1:          23:15          Implicit question and implicit question. Um, yeah, I think that, I mean this is a very, a very charged lead to talk about here. Again, I would just say I think that explanations that refer to some kind of absolute natural disposition or like not usually very useful. And usually when you go back to the scientists who were being cited, um, do not hold up to scrutiny. I think that it's, you know, there are gender distributions. It's not that there is no, um, there are differences among genders, but I think that usually it'll be like, you know, the brain scientists when you ask them say 10% of this differences due to gender and 90% of it is due to other factors. There are more differences among people button and this one class then across the classes. So I think that again, it's reassuring to certain people to believe that, you know, what is natural is good and that nature sanctions a certain kind of social order.

Speaker 1:          24:06          But, um, but I think this is usually not a very useful and certainly not a very progressive way to think about our relations as humans. So I just want to underline your point, which is that if anyone does point to these things like women being passive and men being the aggressor and relationships as natural, like even looking back a hundred years, things were totally different. So it isn't really based in history. Yeah, no indeed. History provides plenty of cadre examples. I mean that's what's so cool to me and exciting about studying history is like it's so much weirder than you think in our social arrangements are so much more contingent than you might imagine, which also means that they can be changed. Incidentally, I'm sure everyone here knows this, but programming is originally a female profession predominantly. There's a great new book about this by my friend, so I'm going to tout it called the program didn't quality about sort of the pushing out.

Speaker 1:          24:51          I've been doing a little research at MIT on this, but the pushing out of female programmers and the 1980s basically from their profession. So the idea that the current gender distribution reflects some sort of like timeless biological reality rather than a certain set of social arrangements to me seems pretty, pretty tenuous. When you look at it as recently as you know, 1972 in the 1980s the gender distributions with that different, I'm excited to talk to you about that later. Yeah. Take that microphone off and talk about later in this conversation you've identified yourself as a feminist, but I read or I heard in another interview you did that you didn't always identify as a feminist and in fact you felt like you could sort of overachieve your way out of these glass ceilings situations. What's been your journey from feeling like that was a possibility to where you are now?

Speaker 1:          25:37          Yeah, I think, I love this question. I feel like, I mean I'd be very curious. I want to put anyone on the spot, like who identifies as a feminist here. Yeah. I mean I think most of the room, most of the room. Yeah. Um, I think, did anyone else, maybe this is a question people have to think through, but experienced this thing of like not identifying that way and then in their twenties they're like in a later life period coming to identify that way. Yeah. Because I think the only thing that makes me feel less embarrassed of how long it took me to identify that way is how many brilliant women I know who say something similar. Um, I think that part of it, I'm sure, you know, I grew up in the 90s I'm sure part of it was like the historical mood when I grew up, but I also think until you reach a certain age, there's this way that you imagined as a young woman of a certain kind that if you're just good enough, if you're just good enough, it won't apply to you.

Speaker 1:          26:27          Um, it's amazing looking. I mean, I, I'm thinking about this because of the Harvey Weinstein stuff today. I mean, it's amazing when I think about how many women I admire have since we've gotten a bit older, talked about getting sexually harassed at work and it was his stomach and prevalent that is, but I think that when you're younger, you just, you know, if I just do this right or if I'm just smart enough, I'm just good enough, surely this won't apply to me. And nobody wants to identify with the class that systematically disadvantaged, you know, nobody. And this comes back to your question about what's trivialized and what's treated as on and sort of pink and frilly. It's female things. Um, so I think that, gosh, it's hard for me to pinpoint the moment and I do think something the zeitgeists change. Like if we look at that moment, I always think of Beyonce at the Vietnamese in front of the big feminist to sign that there were many things in the air and like 2013, 2014, I think, you know, lean in Sheryl Sandberg's book, uh, all sorts of, of other cultural signals suggested that feminism was like trends.

Speaker 1:          27:24          He for the first time in our lives. I'm sure that influenced me, but I think that aided a lot of it is just growing up and entering more professional situations are more adult situations. When you realize that you can't overachieve your way out of out of like anything or everything, but it's like these, these structural things do indeed apply to you. Um, and no matter how excellent you may be. And of course this applies, it goes that saying across intersectional identities, it's not just women. I mean this is true for all kinds of, of groups that are historically oppressed. But I think that, yeah, I think it was the experiences, my twenties and also dating really terrible if I'm honest, but both in work and in love. Um, I think that I came to that really realization or did that identification belatedly.

Speaker 3:          28:08          Yeah. I mean, this really resonates with me every, I mean we're similar ages and everything you said about like if you grow up on the power puff girls and spice girls and girl power and being told that girls can do anything, you sort of believe it and you don't want to identify with people who are having a harder time and maybe you haven't experienced it, but at a certain point being the teacher's pet or doing everything right, like it doesn't necessarily serve you and there's like structural things that are actually affecting you at work or affecting you in academia. And I even feel like in Silicon Valley a lot of risk taking behavior is really valued, which in some ways is at odds with this teacher pet teacher's pet persona that a lot of women are forced into. So it's something I've been observing, which is for women to be successful and take risks, they almost have to shed that teacher's pet persona that they were praised for for, you know, the first 18 or 22 years of their lives.

Speaker 1:          28:59          It makes sense. And of course when this runs into issues with age too, but it's easier to take risks if you have no caring responsibilities or children or other kinds of things that are disproportionately put on women. So of course this value that's placed on risk taking, um, has certain gendered elements as well. But it's true. I think, you know, I was raised to be a very good girl. It was a very good girl for a long time and you sort of do everything you're supposed to and realize that it nonetheless doesn't get you out of this, you know, the situation situation. You might be an odd that that experience can be very radicalizing. Yeah. And I think I realized this became a plotline on the show insecure recently, which I'm a big fan. I love it. See what, what part should date of like how much I realized I thought in shouldn't statements.

Speaker 1:          29:41          It's like, oh, I should I talk about, are you a Molly? I guess so. Yeah. I didn't know if I'd claim to be a full mile, you know, I don't know if I get to claim that, but I definitely, and I opened the book talking about this, but I realized that I thought so much about like what I should watch or what I should want to do or what I should be doing while my was I doing the right things and that it's really hard to shake that and be like, what kind of, you can't shoot about a want, what do you want? But that were very socialized to think about what it's like the good thing to do or the right thing to do.

Speaker 3:          30:10          Right. I mean that feels like a very familiar narrative. If I do these things, I will be desirable. Versus like what do I desire and how. Oftentimes when I debrief with people after they go on dates, they talk all about whether or not the person's seemed interested, but they don't get to the point where did they like that person or not. And I try to kind of get them to that point. But it's interesting that our brains don't naturally say like, what do I want? It's what should I want? Or how can I get them to want me? Yeah. So something that we're working through. Absolutely. Yeah. So we've talked a lot about how dating is this arena where people play out these gender roles and we have these scripts we've inherited, whether it's through books or culture or movies. If people in this room or people watching online want to flip those scripts, what are some things that we can do? Wow. I really do you think

Speaker 1:          31:00          a recurring theme that I came across in the different areas is that despite this, um, tendency of the self help industry to miss, if I men and women to each other actually like most humans want more similar things. You know, like most humans want some combination of like sex and intimacy and respect and communication. And there that I think that one of the most harmful scripts is this idea that men and women are sort of essentially at odds and that all gender and sexual relations or this said compromise, um, of, of women for whom sex is like work. And you know, for men it's like correct creation or something, but that's a whole other topic. So I think that like it's really important to get out of that script. And I think, um, yeah, I don't know. I think there's so much like gamification of they or this idea that it's a game where you master the, I mean the rules and the game.

Speaker 1:          31:54          These are the two most successful dating franchises of the past decade or so. But I think that sort of trying to get beyond these sort of games and this idea that partners are mysterious to one another and, and do this like slightly more challenging emotional work of being in touch with one's own desires is sort of like the most fundamentally important thing and scripts. I mean in some of the research that I cover on hookup culture, it's so funny you get these young men again and again saying like, well I imagine everyone else just having so much sex and like I feel sad but I shouldn't because I'm a man and this is, you know, this is what men are supposed to want. And it's like first of all, none of your classmates are having as much sex as you think they are or very few of them.

Speaker 1:          32:39          And second of all you can't shut about a lot. You know, if you feel sad about this and you feel you shouldn't because you're supposed to be masculine and it's not masculine. I'm Matt. That belief again about this absolute gender difference in different aims is producing a lot of unhappiness. It's actually very counter productive for everyone involved. Do you feel optimistic about the generation younger than us? Yeah, I think I do. I think I do. I think the kids are all right. I mean I think that, you know, we have to, we always have to think about class difference in geographic differences and it's very hard to generalize. But I think the generation below us has better gender and sexual politics than I did at their age anyway. I think that there's a way in which the Internet is creating new kinds of discourse and awareness.

Speaker 1:          33:21          Um, I think that there is, despite the depressing state of affair, you know, this apocalyptic smokey state of affairs in America generally, there's a lot to feel hopeful about with young people. Well since you are on a college campus and in fact the college campus that you and I attended, I would be curious to see whether, um, women who are undergrads right now, whether they've been affected by sort of what you called, like the beyond say 2013 feminism or so basically like either on one hand they are more feminist than we were when we were in college or it's just an age thing and maybe they will reach that point of identifying as a feminist later. I think, I suspect some people in this room might be younger than I am, so we could ask them, but I, I think that feminism is trendier than it was when we were in college that this idea, my like I can't think if I have any hard numbers to prove this, but when I think of like when I encounter young women now who are in college around that age, they think it's cool to be a feminist and that's a thing they identify as.

Speaker 1:          34:20          I think that Beyonce and Hillary and Cheryl and all these, all these women help produce that moment. Um, which I think is basically, you know, Tim, Amanda Negocio, dgs, that we should all be feminists moment that that really resonated, which I think is basically a great thing. I think that there are limitations to um, I don't know the sort of the transformation of feminism into a lifestyle brand or that's a side thing that you can just, you know, make, make a choice individually to be this way and that that will fix all, all the problems that women face. I think that there are limitations to it, but basically the kids are more politically aware, more politically engaged maybe than we were at their age. I certainly around these questions of gender. That's great. Yeah. I do find that really comforting and that this idea that there is more gender fluidity and flipping the scripts and that people at least whether or not feminism is being commodified on some, in some ways it's at least giving people the space to say like, Hey, maybe we shouldn't wear really short skirt so we can get into that final club and see the list.

Speaker 1:          35:20          Yeah. I think that that does feel, again, there's a lot more work to do, but that feels like a basic improvement. Okay. It wasn't even a conversation they were having. My friends and I were having, um, when we were undergrads, at least not, not with the same explicitness and emphaticness that or the CEO's idea

Speaker 3:          35:38          from like, you know, from nine to five you were in class and you were killing it and answering all the questions and doing well. But then like what happened at night was like a different part of your personality. And my hope would be that people are kind of more unified and being that strong woman like during the day and

Speaker 1:          35:52          in the evening. Yeah. I think what's privileged, again, we were both undergraduate, Harvard and I mentioned a lot of people here are also sort of, you know, a certain kind of type that we saw a lot in college. I think what's hard is that we were, we're very conditioned to want to succeed and get approval. And that's, you get that for one set of things professionally or academically and you get it for a different set of things like socially and sexually. And so there's no real contradiction between being the straight a student who wears a teeny tiny skirt and stands outside of Finals Club at night. Like they're both ways of seeking approval from institutions of authority. And you know, the men and the real estate of the finals clubs too. I mean there's this deeply, um, gender and system of social power that, that we were really responding to. It wasn't just in our heads. So it's this weird way that it's like you're overachieving by being what someone else wants, whether it's on your CV and about a boss or a teacher or about looking cute at night. And I think that it takes a lot of personal strength and also political solidarity and these more collective forms of thinking, the change to change that. And I do think it's happening.

Speaker 3:          36:53          I love that perspective. Yeah. I think it's hard for an 18 year old or certainly would have been hard for me to say, Oh, success during the day is doing well in my classes and success night is standing up to the patriarchy. Yeah. Well hopefully we can make standing up to the patriarchy. Cool. I think it's already cool on its way. Yeah. So I do want to leave time for questions from the audience. Um, before we get to that, I'm going to ask you one more question. So this is something I ask all my guests who joined me for these toxic Google. There is the google.com homepage that has the Google logo. And then underneath it, sometimes there's this line of text. So if you could write the line of text for one day and millions of people would see it as they do their billions of searches, what would you put on that line of text?

Speaker 3:          37:35          And since this is a modern romance talk, maybe what would that line be to help people with their dating and relationships? Oh my gosh. Oh yeah. No pressure though. No pressure, I think because I usually think with Google over those wonderful drawings. Oh yeah, we do have drawing when I like, I'm a terrible drawer. We could, you could commission a Google doodle for something that's on your mind. No, I've been thinking a lot. And again, I feel like, you know, we've just scratched the surface of this history, but I've been thinking a lot about, about

Speaker 1:          38:01          the leftists and feminists slogan. Um, none of us are free until all of us are free and that might seem like a stretch from dating. But I think that there's a way in which, um, we can have fun at Romance. Um, and you know, we not always supposed to be thinking about the structural and the political, but men and women, and again, we've hardly talked about queer dating, which is the funnest part of dating history by the way. But, um, I think that we can't, it's all very well to say that we're more flexible in that we're more permissive about romantic relationships and family structures and all these things. But men and women, um, can't really meet full romantic equals until we address these kinds of underlying social and structural problems. So again, they should have these two is, there was this double vision between the personal and the social.

Speaker 1:          38:45          Um, but I think that the idea that none of us are sex until all of us, they're sexy. None of us are free until all of us are free as a sentiment. I've been thinking about a lot. So that's my grand claim to stake on the bottom of the Google homepage. I love that. Well, maybe somebody out here today can actually get that on there. Oh yeah. Okay. So now we'll open it up to questions from the audience. And Scott has a handheld mic. Um, I'm really interested to hear your perspective on race within dating, um, race or ethnicity. Um, I recently heard a podcast on NPR about, um, dating apps and how it's completely skewed when it comes to race and yeah, wait at throughout history or just what your perspective on it is now in current times. Yeah, I mean this is a great, it's a great question, a huge question.

Speaker 1:          39:28          I think that there is all this data and one thing that's interesting about the proliferation of these apps is it does give us much more sort of measurable information about People's preferences and behaviors. There's certainly a lot of kind of disappointing information that's come out of Okcupid and other apps in terms of how forms of social prejudice, uh, that we see elsewhere in society play out in dating. Uh, there was so many things to say. I mean, historically, one thing that's really interesting is that dating is a practice really emerges out of the working class and the early 20th century. And so you have these really vibrant dating and go nightlife cultures in the Harlem Renaissance for instance. Or you have, um, a really vibrant, like queer dating culture. We didn't even talk about, this isn't my favorite facts, how a Tgi Fridays, which was the first singles bar was invented because the entrepreneur who started it was like, we need a gay bar for straight people often like what I call been dating alleged potato skins.

Speaker 1:          40:25          But it just like Grindr and Tinder again. It's like exactly a Tgi Fridays was a sexy singles bar in the 1960 [inaudible] it's all the New York. But anyway, I think that uh, we often see these sort of like experimental spaces where there are kinds of interracial dating or there are opportunities to express other kinds of desire and affiliation that open up and then pretty quickly are sort of like captured and commodified and made mostly for straight white people. Um, and it's this sort of always this horizon of possibility. Cause one of the things about dating that's different from organized courtship is there are possibilities. I mean is a very hard thing to pin down. It moves in lots of ways. And so you do get these sort of spaces where there are other kinds of relationships and then, um, it gets sort of like whitewashed and locked down.

Speaker 1:          41:11          So that's like one historical observation. I think we can keep talking about it later. There's like so many possible things my mom likes to say don't, should on yourself. So I should, I wish she could've told 16 year old Margaret that I should on yourself. Um, but uh, I maybe have kind of a Google design question for you. If you could wave a magic wand and kind of take away a social norm within dating that you feel like is detrimental to the way that kind of society design stating, um, what would you change? What would you change about, cause it's almost like as individuals, we're, we're functioning in this bigger picture, so, so much of it you can't control. But if you could control something, what would you change? This is going to sound really, really grandiose, but I do think that so much, I'm dating in America and so many of our practices are still organized by this, not just assumption or false belief, but real belief that because we have, again, the dating, the purpose of dating is not always getting married and reproducing, but it is the dominant system that our culture has for that.

Speaker 1:          42:20          And because our culture still treat, um, childhood and social reproduction, these highly privatized ways, it's not supported socially very much at all. Uh, it actually is a reality that for a woman who hopes to do those things you have, like there are real incentives to be married here that shape sexual behavior in a way that you don't see in like Scandinavia in the same way, for instance. So I'm like, am I allowed to say paid parental leave, socialized medicine and child care? Like I feel like those would be some really good design changes that I do think actually relieve, would reverberate and why stop there. Universal basic income. Oh yeah. That's a complicated one. We have to think about that. But, uh, but yeah, I think that, you know, wage inequality for sure. It's a funny thing, um, that I get into the first part of the book. But how much early dating was often just a way for women to get men to buy them dinner because it didn't make enough money in the city to like afford dinner. And I think that there are all these ways that like wage inequality and other kinds of social inequality and to continue to shape like the dating unconscious and those inequalities are still real as we know. But yeah, I'd, I'd settle for socialized medicine, childcare and paid family leave.

Speaker 3:          43:29          Um, so I've always kind of heard our subscribe to this pervasive belief that women are designed to want to like build a nest and foster home and sort of settle down. And men are designed to spread their seed as far as they possibly can and in so many different directions as they can. I'm curious what your research has uncovered around that from a biological perspective and if that is just more of a social norm that we've adapted to or if there's something inherent about human beings that makes that sort of true.

Speaker 1:          44:02          Well, one thing that's really interesting, I do tend to think that it's like, I joke about this, but I think it's real. It's like if there's any widely held belief about gender and sexuality, usually the opposite thing is actual time. There are these new studies, there are studies that ask, you know, men and women, would you like random anonymous sex? Sorry, I'll get to the question, I promise. But random anonymous sex like right now. And you know the initial findings, you're like, oh, men would love some random anonymous sex right now and women are not so sure. But then if you control and it's like he won't murder you, like you might get orgasm that that then suddenly women are much more interested in that. It was like some men are, and it's similar with cin numbers of children that people want to, it's like there are recent do recent work.

Speaker 1:          44:40          There's a woman named marina add shade who's an economist at University of British Columbia who could public his published and would know the exact numbers on this if she were here. But men, you know, historically I think there's this assumption that women care more about having children or want children more or that motherhood is more defining them fatherhood. But indeed when you control for or when you tell him, I know you might have to do some of the work that's related to child raising or you that actually men want children more and a greater number of children than women do. So I feel like there are all these beliefs, um, that start to shift under scrutiny and often the opposite of what the general assumption is true in terms of settling down. I mean I do think there is a certain biological reality that like female investment in pregnancy and parenting is greater.

Speaker 1:          45:27          Like a woman has to make a greater investment of time and physical effort to become a parent than a, than a male does. And there surely is something biological about that. At the same time. So much of this is socially conditioned. Then I think we've seen in societies that had more robust forms of communalized childcare where it wasn't just going to be a private responsibility to take care of your kids in your home. That you see very different outcomes in terms of how much women feel. Their whole life needs to be oriented around planning for that. And I think part of that is a, it's a reaction to the fact that in our country and this time there's like very few other options for getting that work at home done. Um, I've just, this is a much longer different coverage of, I've just come back from this trip to China to this matriarchal society where children are raised communal and have no fathers and it's very different. I mean there really are other ways to live, but I didn't know, I imagine there's some biological element, but it's also quite socially constructed and also variable if you control for, um, the equivalent of will I have an orgasm and will he not murdered, you know, these kinds of variables

Speaker 4:          46:29          as dating has evolved to dating in the public sphere as it is today as opposed to calling in the parlor and where maybe these experiences were more chaperoned or there was more commentary invited from your priest or your rabbi or your parents. How, um, how that conversation has evolved in, in ways it's maybe improve like Logan you're saying like you try to encourage your friends who are dating to say like, yeah, but what did you think of this person? Um, if there are ways that we can as like the armchair therapist for our friends who are dating, um, be more constructive and be more helpful in navigating the dialogue that is associated with dating and maybe the debrief.

Speaker 1:          47:15          It's a really good question. I think that this will be a strange thing to say. I think another thing that's come up a lot like back when I was on book tour doing a lot of radio interviews is that people feel this pressure to always be dating. And the same way that our phones mean that we feel like we should always be working and our boss can email us in the middle of the night. People feel like they should always be on Tinder. It should always be on OK cupid. Um, again, they should, um, but should be working at it all the time. And I feel as if this, I would very often when doing events back when I was on book tour get a question where someone would say basically like, I don't feel like dating right now. Like, is that okay? Like that's what the question would boil down to.

Speaker 1:          47:54          And I feel like I also so often just want to tell friends that it's like we've completed romantic success and professional success and a lot of ways people often speak about like feeling that they need to hit certain milestones romantically as well as professionally by certain ages. And I think that to the extent that it's like you also don't do that and you know, a lot of, um, well that also goes back to the biological clock. Yeah. Idea. Talking about earlier, this idea that women, straight women in particular feel all this pressure to like plan their life out at every stage. Um, I think that so often people seem to just want permission to like desire otherwise or to not be dating or working at at a certain time. And I also found like, I think that can be a useful kind of advice and maybe it sounds very Kumbaya, but I think that women in particular are encouraged to be so hard on themselves and so self critical and to feel so anxious and we, that's actually very counterproductive to establishing intimacy.

Speaker 1:          48:50          Um, but I feel like sometimes I just want to tell friends like, you don't, you don't have, um, if what you're, you're hearing from yourself that you want is that you don't want to be doing this right now. That is also okay. However addictive it might be. Just swipe all the time. What's the term? And a normativity had oh, a motto. Normatively. Lots of normativity. Yeah. Yeah. So our friend Mandy is very into this idea that, um, we're kind of raised to think that like the goal in life is to like find one partner and like everything is like leading up to this moment of romance and actually like perhaps lots of people are happy single on. That's not necessarily the goal and everything. So what does it mean for society to take a step back and say like perhaps it's okay for a woman to be seeking something other than like ultimate coupled them in partnership.

Speaker 1:          49:37          Yeah. And I think that it's like, again, it's a hard thing to see in our own individual lives, but the purpose of marriage and the purpose of courtship like has changed greatly over time. You know, when you think to like an agrarian preindustrial society, you'd have a range marriage because extended families are like the unit of production and you need to be married to like the dude from next door so that his brothers and your brothers can like work the farm. It's like what marriage becomes what it becomes about. Love. Basically around the time of the industrial revolution is something very different than that. And maybe we're entering another new phase, you know, that the purpose of these relationships in their functional role in our lives do change. We're all gonna live to be so much older than people. Uh, then people did. I mean, hopefully. Um, then, uh, they did and you know, the early 19th century we have very different working circumstances. We have very different lives. And so this idea that um, a certain kind of like straight, usually white, monogamous romantic love is like this one measure of societal success is really, is really outdated. I think. Like there are many ways to live, so yeah, absolutely. Any other questions?

Speaker 5:          50:45          You alluded to this a few times, the differences between, you know, queer dating historically and view straight dating and can you elaborate more on that? Just some of the history, the differences. I'm really curious.

Speaker 1:          51:00          Yeah, totally. I think that it's funny, it was a thing I struggled with writing this book because this is a book about sort of dating as a cultural institution and for most of the century or so that people have dated queer dating has not been like legible adds dating to most of society at the same time and perhaps not incidentally. It's also been like the funnest and most experimental and best and best place for you to these terrible a gendered norms that we see across so much other dating. So I think that in my book they should have two chapters that deal primarily with LGBTQ dating. And I think that it often, the first one sort of deals a lot with the roaring twenties and the 30s in sort of speakeasy scenes and these spaces that are at once like theoretically out of the public eye, but then also become sort of like an avant garde or lead or what's fashionable for dating.

Speaker 1:          51:49          Um, you see it again as I was suggesting in the 60s with this hilarious guy, Alan Stallman. He starts Tgi Fridays. And it's like if we could scale this restrict people, we'd make a bazillion dollars a as indeed he did. But I think that often you seem cultures of experimentation not burdened by these norms about, you know what I keep joking about this idea that men and women are like inevitably at odds and then sex is this depressing compromise, um, that allow for a lot more possibility. I think because there aren't, or for most of the history of dating haven't been such overbearing social scripts about like how men are and how women are, you know, Lgbtq folks and have to deal with those in the same way that often you've seen much more um, self awareness or sort of thoughtfulness about defining desires and expectations cause there aren't these assumptions about what they should be.

Speaker 1:          52:38          Uh, I think one part of the book deals a lot with the AIDS crisis and the safe sex movement too. And the ways in which like really heroic activists around HIV and AIDS, um, started building materials to help couples talk about sexual practices more specifically and more openly and how that became really important for people of all genders and orientations. But I think that, so I think that like queer dating and my book and, and in, in history, um, is often a space of greater experimentation and self awareness. Uh, and then often sort of like sets the trends in the same way you get Tgi Fridays imitating gay bars. You get Tinder imitating grinder. Uh, so it gets sort of co opted and made and made it less fun for straight people maybe. But those are just, those are a couple
