Speaker 1:          00:06          Thank you guys all for coming today. Uh, I would like to present Ruth Whitman, we're here today to talk about her book America, the anxious, uh, why are search for happiness is driving us crazy and how to find it for real. Um, as a quick introduction to Ruth is a British journalist and has contributed pieces to the New York Times, The Guardian, the independence and the Huffington Post. She previously worked for BBC where she was releasing numerous documentaries and in her book she examines what's gone wrong with American happiness and why it is leading such an anxious and ultimately unhappy society and what can be done about it. Um, my name is Nisha Hoti, Emma, long time Googler. Um, and yeah, so do you like to tell us more about yourself?

Speaker 2:          00:50          Um, so yeah. Well we moved to California about six years ago from the UK and it was quite a culture shock. You know, my background is in journalism. Um, do you want me to tell you a bit more about, yeah, what prompted [inaudible]? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Well, when, when we first got here, we came because my husband got a job working in a tech startup and it was quite a leap into the dark for us, you know, and I had given up my job in journalism back in the UK and everyday he would kind of shut the door to going off to work and I'd have these 12 Calvinists hours of time to fill before I could have, uh, an adult conversation again. And know we had a young baby at the time. So I was sort of putting myself out there and trying to make, um, you know, as many people as I could, having lots of random conversations with senior people in the dry cleaners and the grocery store and you know, um, in the park with my son.

Speaker 2:          01:42          And I found very quickly that this strange thing was happening. I seem to be having the same conversation over and over again. You know, different people, different situations, different, you know, different, different scenarios. But the same topic just kept on coming up and this was some variation on this theme of happiness. I painful, we're talking about happiness almost as a real source of anxiety in their lives. You know, people were kind of asking these really big questions of themselves, you know, am I happy? Am I happy enough? Am I as happy as all my friends that I see on social media? You know, could I be happier if I was following my passion? But what is my passionate, you know, what did this? And there seemed to be this real gap between what people expected in terms of their happiness and how happy that actually were feeling.

Speaker 2:          02:30          And you know, and so I was kind of prompted. I was really fascinated to do and it was a real cultural difference because I think in the UK, you know, happiness is that a little bit suspect. You know, you don't want to show too many overt signs of being too, too, too happy. So I just was, I was, I wanted to look into it. And what I found was that, um, you know, you would think given the kind of cultural focus on happiness here in the states and the amount of money and time and effort that people put into becoming happier, you would think Americans would be the happiest people on the planet. But statistically, you know, they actually ranked very, very far down the list of happiness. So that was kind of my starting point for writing this book. I just wanted to find out why, you know, what's going wrong and you know, what, how we could, you know, how, how we can find out what really makes for a happy life.

Speaker 1:          03:17          Yeah. Um, one thing that you defined it in the book, almost like a rat race. Yeah. Happiness. Um, what did you mean by that exactly?

Speaker 2:          03:25          Yeah. I mean that the expression, asset of happiness, rat race kind of came to me when people would kind of talk about happiness almost in the same way that people talk about going on a diet. You know, there's not much pleasure involved in it. But you know, if I just read this book and do this meditation App and you know, go to this in my gratitude journal and be more mindful and Damon positive and be well this, then, then I can be happy. You know? And it sort of felt like it was really a lot of hard work, happiness, you know, there wasn't much pleasure involved in it.

Speaker 1:          03:55          And something that's interesting. You've, you have had all these experiences, you've talked to all these people who seem to be filling their life with all these measures to become happier. Yeah. But when you look at it statistically, if United States, maybe one of them, the least happy countries and also our happiness levels really haven't changed in quite some time. That's correct. Right, right. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:13          So, um, when you look at the actual data on this, um, despite spending more time and money and emotional energy and trying to kind of become happier compared to other developed nations, Americans as some of the least happy people and in the Western world. And actually there was a study that came out a year or so ago, which actually put the day to day contentment of people in the U S at two places behind Rwanda. I mean, if you just think about that for a moment, you know, Rwanda is a country that has suffered a major collective psychological trauma, but yet people that we're writing is more content than, you know, American office workers. So that really kind of, that was a paradox that made me want to know more and you know, find out what was going wrong. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          05:01          And are there, are there key differences that you noticed specifically for moving from

Speaker 2:          05:06          okay to the United States and whatever that was? I think that there are a lot of differences in the way that people talk about happiness. I think there's a real focus in the u s and you know, I think this is a good thing in many ways, but there was a real, um, valuing of people being positive, you know, people being cheerful and positive all the time and appearing happy in a being happy and also looking happy to everybody else. And don't be a Downer and everything. And I think in the UK maybe people are a little bit more dated and I actually, a big kind of negativity is almost part of the culture in a way. You know, it's not expected that people would have such a in a such a high level of, of, of happiness all the time and people don't go after it and quite such a relentless way I think.

Speaker 2:          05:53          Yeah. So let's take a step back then and then talk about the book for a second. Could you give us a brief kind of quick outline? I found it really interesting how you went about examining this rat race. Um, could you give us a brief outline of, of what you did? Yeah, so, um, I did lots of different things. I spent a lot of time, I am sound put quite a few of the south help offerings that, that people are selling. You know, I realize this is south help in this country is a multibillion dollar industry. A lot of money is changing hands in this pursuit of happiness and this and this idea that we can kind of control our happiness and make ourselves happier. So I did the landmark forum. I don't know if any of you have heard of that, but it was, it's a very popular self help kind of weekend, four day course that's incredibly intense.

Speaker 2:          06:43          And you know, I went through everything on this spectrum of emotion while I was doing that from sheer terror to depression, to anxiety, to joy, to all, all of it. I spent time, um, with uh, I went to Las Vegas where I spent time in, um, Tony Shay, who is the CEO of Zappos, the shoe retailer. He has a kind of happiness, um, city almost that he's set up in downtown Las Vegas. He's bought up a whole load of land and is running it as a kind of happiness community based on principles of positive psychology and um, you know, on the idea that you can maximize people's happiness. And that was a very sort of strange place to be. And I spent time with Mormons in Utah. The moments actually rate as statistically as the happiest people in America and but actually what, what makes this slightly more complexes that they also have the highest rate of antidepressant use.

Speaker 2:          07:38          So I was kind of trying to unpick what was going on there and I looked at the workplace, some trends and kind of happiness engineering in the workplace. I looked at parenting, social media and I spent some time looking at the kind of academic research on happiness, which frankly was the most joyous part of the whole endeavor. Academic studies on happiness are really quite dry. Yeah. And so in, in listening and reading a good book. Yeah. It was really interesting to see how you jumped from one topic to the next in this overall vision of what you perceived the United States to be in terms of this pursuit for happiness. Which one of those experiences did you find to be the most revealing? Huh? That's an interesting question. I mean, I think it's hard to pick one. I mean don't to to spend some time at the downtown project in, in the, um, you know, the Las Vegas thing that was talking about where, you know, this very, very wealthy tech billionaire has brought people from all over the United States to live in this, in this community and work as entrepreneurs.

Speaker 2:          08:40          And that's this kind of semi communal living, a lot of it where they people live and work in the same place and they've kind of maximized happiness by, you know, putting the buildings in certain places and the square, you know, how many people per square foot and everything is so planned. And one of the really kind of shocking things was in this site called happiness community, they ended up having one of the highest suicide rates in the United States. So I'm in that was a very dark and awful tragic but also kind of fascinating. And I think it sort of had partly to do and a lot of the people that were saying that it partly had to do with this extreme pressure to be happy all the time. You know, the I think really kind of stress people out. And that was the thing that I kept coming back to.

Speaker 1:          09:23          Yeah. I think it's an interesting topic too for discussion because in the tech world, a lot of what we're discussing today is how can the Internet, Internet of things influence your surrounding. So whether it's your home or whether it's the city itself that you live in, how can being surrounded by technology create a more fruitful life, a happier life. Um, from your experience, was that something that was most relevant to the time that you spend in downtown? Was technology ever present and did it cause more happiness or was it rather something else that calls people to commit suicide?

Speaker 2:          09:58          I am. I'm in, all of these things are quite complex. I mean the, the downtown project, I mean there was a slight sense at the beginning that they were going to use happiness. That they were going to use technology even more to kind of monitor where people went. And they had this idea that everyone was going to wear a wristband to measure, you know, how many social interactions they had and how happy they were. And this technology actually exists. I mean I found that they weren't actually using this response in the downtown project, but they do use them in many companies. This has become something that your boss can kind of monitor how happy you are and how productive you are and how the two relate to each other. And there was something very big brotherish and sinister about that. And I think in terms of the way that most people use technology and the Internet, I mean it's no one thing.

Speaker 2:          10:42          I mean technology is kind of what you make of it. And I think there's good and bad in that. I mean I looked at social media was a big thing that I looked at and I think that can bring it so, and anxieties. I think it sort of raises the expectations. It's the way that we use social media now. You know, Instagram and Facebook trying to make our lives looking quite, it was almost like a personal PR project has it, you know, your Facebook profile and how happy you look. And here I am having so much fun and all these different situations and I think that in itself has kind of raise the stakes for anxiety. So many of us,

Speaker 1:          11:12          one of the things that I really loved about, and I thought it's so relevant to my life was two things. First and foremost tell you, you're right, social media becomes this PR, right? It really, it is your brand and it's unrespectful. But then you also mentioned in your book that it's also creating a sanitized version of your life to a degree. Right? Right. And maybe even replacing some kind of interpersonal communication you have with other people.

Speaker 2:          11:35          Hi, I'm in. It's kind of become an Oms, rice. And I think we all did it to a certain extent. And I find myself doing it. Even having written a book about this, you know, I find myself doing the same thing. Like, for instance, you know, when we went, um, I took my kids apple picking in a, in a sort of local orchard recently. Frankly, the day was kind of miserable. I mean, we did, you know, the kids were whining the whole time. It was really hard. Everybody was kind of butchered. The APP was rural, mushy. And then the five times the w ended up on Facebook of this day, the one probably many second and the entire day when everyone was smiling and posing and whatever. That's what ended up there. And anyone looking at that thing would've thought, you know, there's what a great day she's having. And you know what? I wish my life was like that. Meanwhile, you know, just sort of thinking, how come that God that's over, you know, and it's, you know, the way that we kind of curate our lives now, I think it does give a very unrepresentative picture of what happiness looks like. And I think that is adding to this anxiety of, you know, my life really should be like this and it's on my hair and you know, this gap. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          12:41          that's very true. Um, one thing I wanted to touch upon was, uh, really diving into your experiences with the self help community. The landmark forum is kind of the pinnacle one in your book. Then there's a few other ones. It's an elementary schools as well. Um, and you do a really good job of just bashing on these forums and these pundits who really examining in a, in a, in a crude way like almost other swindling people. Um, what do you think from what you saw attracted people to the form and then also it's even ray up and say like all do level two,

Speaker 2:          13:15          right? Well, I mean this thing it's, it's also, I mean I think that the naturally, the type of people who are attracted to south help tend to be in the more vulnerable end of things. I mean, you don't go on a self help course when your life is already bullet in. I see you, you know, you're already dealing with people who have issues and problems and this is a business. I mean this is, there was a lot of money changing hands and that it is in these people's interest to take out as much money as possible, which is not to say that everybody in the south end health industry as some kind of, you know, Charlatan or fraudster or whatever that's trying to steal your money. But I think there was an element of that in this thing. And I think the landmark forum was a very, very intense program.

Speaker 2:          13:56          I mean, you're in this room, it's a kind of conference room and you're there for a very long hours. You have very limited breaks. Um, your, you know, it's till 10 o'clock at night and you're just getting all this information and everybody's sharing these incredibly dark moments from their lives and you feel very, very vulnerable, you know, and those moments. And then they come in at just the crucial moment and say, well, maybe you'd like to sign up for the next course and you not, you're whipping about, they had a terrible childhood and whatever, and you're like, okay, whatever, whatever, I'll pay whatever it takes. And you know, I, it was a very powerful emotional experience being there, you know, and not necessarily

Speaker 1:          14:32          for the good, that's for sure. Was there a for a time, because I imagined in researching this book, you want it to you as much information. He's good. Was ever a time where like, I don't want to go to another self up for them and yeah, but you force yourself to do so.

Speaker 2:          14:44          Yeah. I mean, what the, you know, it's funny it, the deed, when it came to the landmark forum, I actually did the landmark forum before the bucket kind of went the other way round. And that was one of the things, you know, everyone had told me, you know, do this thing. It's amazing. It's amazing. Amazing, amazing. You've got to go. And it was partly, it was sort of almost the other way round that I did the forum thinking, um, just because I'd want it to be happier, you know, I was kind of lonely and my new country and um, and I went and that was part of what led to the book rather than the other way around. But yeah, I'm in through email. Debus I did a lot of this kind of mindfulness workshops. I did meditation, I did various things and a lot of the time I did sort of say, Oh God, not another one. But you know, at the same time I want it to be open to these things. I didn't want to start from the position that this is all a load of rubbish and you know, just, you know, w I wanted to see what, what actually worked and what didn't.

Speaker 1:          15:33          Um, and, and you bring up a good point too, and the majority of people that are maybe going to a self folk forum or reading a book about self help or an actual need of help or other, or are seeking some kind of answers from the people that you interacted with from people that you met. Do they, they find answers in these books? Um, did they, did they experience some kind of transformation?

Speaker 2:          15:56          Well, I think a lot of people do. I mean, that's an atmosphere, kind of like a tent revival. And there's a lot of these places where it's like, ah, yes. And everyone gets whipped up into this kind of [inaudible]. And then the most successful people in this industry are the people who can really prey on those emotions and kind of whip people up into a kind of a frenzy. And I think people do feel very transformed. But then one of their kind of depressing statistics is that the most likely customer of a self help book is somebody who's bought another self help. But within the last 18 months. So there's obviously something where people get on it kind of spiral and you know, none of these things are actually providing quite the answers that the people are hoping for. And I think, you know, you raised an interesting point when you said these are the people who need help.

Speaker 2:          16:37          There's something about in this whole idea it, so it's a very American idea in a way. This idea that our happiness is something that we can control, you know, that self help, you know, rather than helping others or that you know, that help should be provided from some other source or that you are entitled to help. It's like, you know, go out and help yourself and pull yourself up by your bootstraps and make yourself happier. I don't know if you've ever seen these memes that say, you know, happiness is a choice. You know, there's a quite a common phrase here. It's almost like if you don't, you know, it's your responsibility to make yourself happier. Yeah. Which can be quite insanity inducing in itself.

Speaker 1:          17:10          And that's, that's definitely an interesting point you bring up in the book, which is that in America it seems that we're really seeking ice happiness in isolation. Yeah. And is that starkly different from your experiences not having lived in the country?

Speaker 2:          17:24          Well, so this is one of the things that I cat's coming back to in my research, which is that pretty much every piece of research that's ever been done and to human happiness and no matter how much that all these studies all kind of contradicted themselves in other ways. There is one factor that we know is like the single biggest cause of happiness and that is our social connections or relationships with other people, but yet the south hop industry and are kind of conception of happiness is moving more and more and more towards being about the self. And you know, a lot of the activities that we're taking part in now like meditation, like mindfulness, like yoga, like you know, they're all about having a very private emotional experience about looking within your soul and Gina being internal rather than external. And I think that's one of the, one of the real problems.

Speaker 2:          18:15          I think that was one of the key findings that really made me think, okay, this might be where we're going slightly wrong. And you know, I think it's a trend that's true in other western countries as well. We're living increasingly isolated lives. But, um, I think in America there's a very individualistic culture and I think that is, you know, and our approach to happiness is, you know, me and my happiness journey and my quest for happiness and how can I make myself happier, which is probably going about it in slightly the wrong way. And I've only really first and needing to listen to the stories that you bring up specifically the grown a yoga and meditation help people would be so doing that four or five yoga classes a week to try and get that sense of fulfillment and happiness and mindfulness. Um, and it, it had kind of opened the door to maybe a different world than, than I would see.

Speaker 2:          18:59          Cause I don't know many friends that are doing yoga on a day to day basis in order to view your content through in order to build that happiness. Um, from what you saw, do you think that maybe, I don't know if extreme is the right word, but where they extreme examples of the Sikh, is this the seeking out of there can cause, yeah. I mean, you know, I don't want to give the wrong impression that I think that yoga is the cause of all the problems because obviously that's not true. But I think it's about a kind of mindset. I think California is kind of the world headquarters of self actualization, isn't it? So I think the things that you see here in California, and maybe a little, oh a little more extreme than you would see elsewhere, but these trends do hold true. You know, across the country.

Speaker 2:          19:40          You know, you think about Oprah and the influence that she's had and it's all about, you know, my personal happiness journey and you know, my own responsibility for my happiness. And you know, a lot of these, um, you know, these, the, the whole sort of yoga, mindfulness meditation, what I've come to think of as the spiritual industrial complex, I mean, that is worth about $20 billion to the economy. I mean, it's, it's, it's a lot of money changing hands it units, it's very popular. So these self help forums, you've software books are to a degree useful, but maybe not there. Maybe will hold all the answers for us. Right. From your research, what do you think could lead Americans to have your life? Well, I think that what I found, just again and again and again, whether that was through the kind of field work or the academic staff or whatever, is that the key to happiness really is in relationships and other people.

Speaker 2:          20:35          And you know, I could say this all the time and one of the most common responses that I get is people say, well, you know, that's fair enough, but that doesn't apply to me because I'm an introvert and I hate other people and you know, rather just sit in my basement. That ends to it. I'd never, never talked to anyone, but actually all the research supports that, uh, the fact that the, the importance of social connection is just as true and important for introverts as it is for extroverts. It might manifest in a slightly different way. You know, it might not be going to lots of huge parties and being the center of attention, but I'm still, you know, the importance of having supportive relationships is just an author. It's not just for our happiness, it's for our health. Um, um, low social connection or loneliness is, has carries with it. I risk of premature death comparable to that of smoking and it's about twice as dangerous to be lonely as it is to be a base, you know, and you think how much money and effort we put into dieting and not big on base, you know, when actually, you know, here's, here's an answer, which is so important. Right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:42          There was an interesting part of the, um, at the end of the book talking about the genetic component of happiness and how you kind of have this like biological marker of where you're going to always be happy and then you can have your words. Was there ever any information or studies that you've found that showed maybe that that fulfillment and that the biological market could be tweaked upward? Not, not necessarily change? Yeah, at the baseline, but like social interactions with the things that made that mark or move up? I don't even know if it's measurable.

Speaker 2:          22:09          Yes. I mean, I think there's been various ways to measure it and I think that people are generally agreed that there's a big genetic component to happiness. So people have a kind of happiness set point that they keep returning to. But you can kind of walk around it a bit. What were the whole positive psychology movement has become slightly political, slightly ideological is that it very much downplays the idea of circumstances on our happiness. I'm very much plays up the idea of individual control. So there's a lot of research now and it's kind of, a lot of it is funded by a very right wing by a very what right wing bias organization that this belief that you know, we can kind of is this bit straps idea that we can make ourselves happier by, by trying all this stuff and you know, it's kind of your responsibility and if you're not happy, it's almost like it's your own fault and downplays all these factors like, you know, um, income, race, social class, you know, so social projects, which actually is not a fair reading. I don't, I believe it's based on a very, very fluid reading of the, of the data. And actually circumstances do make a huge difference.

Speaker 1:          23:13          So maybe a, an an open ended question is we have all these things. We have yoga, we have, we have meditation to, to build mindfulness. Um, religion is something that you discussed, you and that religious people are statistically more happy, but maybe in real life those statistics don't necessarily hit all the actual, the reality with, with all of these things. Um, how, how do they get built into a happy life while also maintaining it? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          23:38          Well, the religion thing that you just mentioned is really interesting because across the world it's, it's pretty robust finding that religious people do, right? As happier than nonreligious people. And I think the temptation is to think that that is because people have this kind of private belief in God and this, this certainty that things will be okay because there's an afterlife or whatever. But when you control for the fact that religious people have much greater number and quality of social connections, when you control for that in the study, it's the difference disappears. So actually the reason why religious people tend to rate us happier than other people is because they have such a strong sense of community generally. And when I went to spend time with movements in Utah, that was a huge finding. You know, I was staying with a Mormon family and we were sitting there for half an hour and their living room.

Speaker 2:          24:26          And I think 10 different people stop by for drop off some cookies or a cup of tea, not a cup of tea. They don't drink tea, but that's my Britishness and whatever, you know, a drink or something. And you know, so I think it is that sense of community that really is at the heart of why religion, you know, does it make people happier? Um, so maybe, uh, a point for the audience as a guardians of technology at Google arbiters of new things. One recommendations would you have to us as we, as we build technology for people, um, from what you've seen in terms of, in terms of happiness, one of the key things that we say at Google is like gold to me that someone will look to use. Um, almost like a toothbrush experience. It's kind of when things, it's like you want to use them, you wanted to use it every single day cause they love it so much.

Speaker 2:          25:15          It's so useful when we're building these things. What should we be considering? Wow, that's a big question. I, if I, if I knew that I'd be making a lot more money than I, than I am now. Um, I think, you know, technology is a competitive thing because it can be a force for connection and bringing people together. And it can also be a force for isolating people as well and keeping people locked in their own smartphone and not, I've been, um, this is not Google, but I remember one of the, you know, one of these moments when I was researching, there's Burke and I thought, oh my God, do you know this is the end of civilization was when I downloaded a happiness app to my phone and I went onto the APP store and there's like a thousand different options for happiness apps that you can eat conducted, you know, they'll, you know, send you pictures of sunsets and puppies and beaches and, and there was this one liquid, you know, send you pictures of your own loved ones so that you could kind of sit looking at your phone, scrolling through pictures of your loved ones.

Speaker 2:          26:14          Well, presumably your actual loved ones. I like looking at pictures of you maybe, I don't know, on their phone. And I remember there was this one time when the one that I downloaded actually we'd send you these kind of positive affirmations every hour or so throughout the day. And you're supposed to repeat them. So it was, you know, I am beautiful, I am enough for whatever it was. And I remember like the problem was every time my phone buzzed when I got a message from this thing, I get that Pavlovian kind of jealous of, Oh someone sending me a message. Great. You know, somebody wants to go out and meet for coffee or you know, it's a friend or whatever. And then it would say, you know, I am enough. And I think the cross the cross the thing, cause the whole point is, you know, I am not enough and I think if we are really looking to, to an APP to make us happy that something's gone.

Speaker 1:          27:01          And then just kind of put a little bit on the research you did around social media. Have you found that, um, at least in your research that a lot of people have replaced those in person connections, those interpersonal connections with your phone, with your application?

Speaker 2:          27:14          Yeah, I think that's quite good evidence to show that that has definitely happened. And especially for the kind of millennials and younger generation, I think there is a lot of um, concern over the fact that people are replacing real world interactions with online once you know, smartphone. Yeah. Thanks for sure.

Speaker 1:          27:33          Cool. Well I think we're going to open it up to questions from the audience. Um, and as well as on the dory. Uh, Alison, if he's still in the room, uh, I think he has a mic that he can pass around. I think someone had fun.

Speaker 3:          27:48          Hi. Oh, hi. Oh, so one of the topics that you kind of pointed out, like regarding this whole stress of trying to be happy is like the whole like self help community and like whatever. But like, yeah. Oh, also the other thing I kind of I'm curious about is like what about the contribution of the family? Like, because like one of the things I see, I, I could be wrong, but my understanding is also like we are in this trend where like probably the kids are being like either or pamper, like this whole notion of having any kind of negative emotion is like, oh, something is like extremely wrong. Rather than just teaching them, it's just part of life and like, yes, oh, you need to just go through it and like kind of teach them how to handle it. So yeah. Oh, how much is that also contributing and creating like generations of people who are like kind of probably extremely confused about

Speaker 2:          28:39          what is right. It's an excellent point. I actually wrote a whole chapter about parenting and, sorry, I lost my thing here. So sorry. Um, yeah, I write a whole chapter in the book about parenting and exactly what you're describing. I think there's this, you know, in the same way that there's this feeling that we can kind of force ourselves to be happy with enough hard work. There's also a kind of parallel feeling that we can kind of build this half a happy child, that if we just make every moment kind of magical and we take away every negative sense and every negative emotion, prioritize positivity above all else, then we will turn out this perfectly happy kids and it's backfiring, you know, really badly. I mean, some of the examples that I came across when most of the book, we're actually quite ridiculous and humorous. You know that there was this, one thing I was so shocked by when I first moved here was that a friend of mine left her two year old, I think two and a half year old with another mom while she went to run some errands and this woman, the other woman breastfed this friend's child, this friends to road because she was crying.

Speaker 2:          29:45          He does it was this, this villain, there's talk can't be distressed for for one moment without somebody stepping. I mean, that's a very extreme example, but I think that is this sort of data that we've become, or you know, I'm a, I'm a parent and I know that I'm part of this and it's hard to get away from it, but yeah, we have become these helicopter parents who, um, sort of micromanaging our kids' lives and then the, the evidence is showing that kids in college now are actually suffering some really serious mental health problems, you know, so it's severe levels of anxiety, depression, lack of resilience, those kinds of things. And I think those trends are, are related for sure.

Speaker 4:          30:24          Okay. Hi, I

Speaker 5:          30:27          took a class at Google called search inside yourself about a year ago. Um, it's, uh, I don't know if you call it a self help class. It does include some meditation. Um, but I think the biggest takeaway I had from it was a piece of advice that was don't aim for a happy life, aim for a meaningful life. Right. So is that something that you found is you should look for meeting instead of looking for happiness?

Speaker 2:          30:51          Yeah. So I think it's really, I mean, I haven't done that course so I can't speak to exactly what was discussed. That, and I think meaning is obviously really important. And I think connection is the thing that's most important. I think in a way there's this trend where meanings become the new happiness. Everyone's testing meaning meaning meaning, and then it kind of loses its meaning because what is meaning meaning is something that's different to everything else. And I think when it's, when there's this kind of MacGuffin this thing that we're all supposed to chase after, then it becomes its own rat race. But yes, I think you're right that, that it's, um, it's important to see what things have value in our lives and just for happiness to be a kind of byproduct of our lives and living a connected meaningful life rather than chasing after happiness. Specifically,

Speaker 2:          31:42          you touched upon briefly the connection between religious people being more happy because of social gatherings. And you elaborate a bit more on that correlation. Like what exactly causes that? Why does social connection? Because religious people that I'm happy because of their social, yeah. Well, I think that there's lots of research that shows that people who have a religious affiliation, um, spans more time socializing and being part of a community. And it's not necessarily, you know, that they go and more dinner dates or whatever, but it is that if you have a religious place where you go every week, you know, if you go to church or mosque or synagogue or whatever, you know, that's very much based on community and it's based on this kind of shared understanding that people are responsible for each other's welfare and people will look out for each other. You know, not every religious community is like that, but I think that's a kind of baseline. And so people, you know, and there's research that shows that people who are religious are more likely to do things like give blood and uh, more likely to, to be involved in community events, to have

Speaker 6:          32:42          more social events per week then than other people. And I think that's why when you control for that, when you take that out of the equation, then actually religious people aren't any happier than, than anybody else. Got It. Thank you. Thanks. Hey, thanks for coming. So you've been talking a lot about the happiness aspect, but you also mentioned the term self actualized. Yeah. Uh, and I was Kinda curious to hear your perspective on how you view the difference between those two and come to the point of out of cheese, like a life of trying to find meaning. What about like an effort to try and get to better know yourself, uh, do that self actualized term. Yep.

Speaker 2:          33:15          Yeah. So I think it's about balance because obviously getting to know who you are and you know, becoming the best self that you can be, all of those things are important and to, to work out who you are and how to work with that. But that's very, very important. But I think what's happened in America is that we've, the balance has somehow got out of whack. So we're putting self actualization above connection. So the idea was that we kind of engineer happiness from the inside out. That if you can perfectly know yourself and understand yourself, I don't know if you've heard this phrase, happiness comes from within. It's actually impossible to do to get a result on a Google search that tells you the opposite. Because I typed in in our happiness, I was going to do some, at one point, I was going to think of Dang some slides for this and I typed in, you know, meme happiness comes from within. If you've got a thousand results of all these, you know, different that memes sort of same variations on this. If you type in meme in an image search, happiness comes from other people. Every single result seemingly, or at least on the front page that comes back says happiness does not come from other people having a discussion with them.

Speaker 2:          34:20          And it's almost like that's how I think the balance has got robbed. So I'm not saying that people should not, you know, tried to understand themselves, reflect on themselves, all of that. That's obviously important, but I think the emphasis has got wrong some somewhere, you know, I think if we make connection and other people are starting point and then throw in a bit of self actualization rather than, you know, having the balance so skewed the other way. Thanks. Hi.

Speaker 3:          34:46          So you were talking about the importance of social connections. I think there are two types. I can imagine. First there, for example, close friends who I spend a lot of time with and I have deep connection and then there are just, just people I barely know. Yeah. So, uh, it just hard to have many close friends because it's like, it takes a lot of time, but you can have a lot of people you barely know. Is there any distinctions which type of relationships is more like what's the difference between them and how do they influence happiness in different ways, close relationships and more meaningful or just know as many people as you can

Speaker 6:          35:21          actually important surprise in it. So it goes without saying. I think that close friendships and really supportive relationships are more important than, you know, the women who sells a your newspaper in the morning or whatever. But um, and that's really the key is sort of focusing on a few very close supportive relationships. Ah, there is pretty good evidence to show that having lots of um, uh, what there is a technical term for it, but it's sort of small social connections also and being part of a wider community and feeling invested in a community also has a big impact on our happiness as well. So you know, just feeling that we're, we're, we're part of something bigger than ourselves I think. So I think an aggregate unit might not be that every single one of those little connections really is, is that meaningful. But overall I think they can make a big difference.

Speaker 1:          36:09          And I thought that there was a, an interesting point in the book, not to give too many details away, but you kind of quote Thomas Jefferson in the pursuit of happiness and in your interpretation it's not so much pursuing this inward happiness, which is kind of is perfected from all my self actualization, but rather pursuing a happiness which makes you part of a community. It makes you part of that larger hole.

Speaker 2:          36:30          Yes. I mean, I think that's, that's pretty clear that the founding fathers weren't really thinking about a self help workshop when they eat. I mean there's taking it straight, but yes, they were talking about kind of civic engagement and community and that was very much being part a kind of part of a larger,

Speaker 1:          36:45          okay, cool. That's just, yeah. Hi. Um,

Speaker 3:          36:52          wonder if you can read your book feet touching that or what'd you think about, what are you notice I'm not from here either. Uh, and um, I wonder if you've noticed that there's some, seems to be some bragging around mentioning or just even implying that you're busy and people, you know, it's just fun. I find it very hard here to just call a friend up and say, Hey, here you go for a beer. Nice. Almost. It's virtually impossible. And where I come from, it's like, you know, we're adults, we have these lives. But yeah, it's just easier. And, and I, I've, I've almost become that and myself to where I have to kids and you know, and I work full time. And so, yeah, it's also hard for me sometimes, but I get the sense too that sometimes that I feel this inner pride of saying, well, you know, no, I'm VC tonight. It's not, can make it work or not. And I'm like, Oh yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm going to be the person. And then I'm like, that feels like shit. I haven't had a beer in a long time, would anyone, and I dunno.

Speaker 2:          37:56          Yeah. I mean it's so easy to purchase socializing down to the absolute bottom of their priority list, isn't it? I mean, you know, if you have a full time job, you work hard. I think there's this, I mean, we didn't actually talk about this, but it's something that we touched, I touched on in the book that now what used to be called work life balance, they're now calling work life integration, you know, which it just makes my heart sing. I used to be more work that you have to have your phone on all the time, that your answer, boy, you're always on the clock. And that we're kind of merging all these parts of our lives. So there's very little socializing or communicating or whatever with, with friends that is totally free of work and free and responsibilities in the way that perhaps it used to be.

Speaker 2:          38:37          And I mean there's this really just sort of chilling I thought, chilling statistic, which is the, um, I don't know if you've heard of the American time use survey, but they just categorize how people literally spend every moment of that day and every activity that you can think of, you know, working, sleeping, drive, him, having sex, whatever, it's all categorized. And there's a category on the survey called socializing and communicating and it doesn't just cover the good stuff. So it's not just the United, the lovely heart to heart that you have with your best friend or their, there's door in compensation with deal with your boyfriend or girlfriend. It's like all the arguing then lighting the bitching and whining, everything, oh, thrown in together. So as long as there's one more than one adult present and um, it's not an incidental part of something else. Does anyone want to hazard a guess how much time we spend on that category per day? The average American.

Speaker 4:          39:26          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          39:28          Yeah. It's about 30 minutes a day. So put another way, you know, we, we know this is the single most important sort of pillar of our happiness, but yet we spent 23 and a half hours out of every day not doing that in know, doing something completely different. So, you know, I found that pretty scary.

Speaker 3:          39:51          Hi. Hi. Thanks for your talk. Um, did you happen to see the article in the New York Times magazine this last weekend? It was called the kids who can't just kind of like a Meta title. Oh, I don't think so. It was about an anxiety with millennials and especially the youngest millennials. Um, it was saying that, you know, it's talking about this phenomenon. So first of all, I wondered if you came across this in your research anxiety being a bigger problem with younger people. Yes, definitely. And then, you know, hazard, any guesses at how to explain it and mentioned the social media phenomenon, which I think is right on the money. And you touched on that. Yeah. But another thing I talked about was how, I don't love this word, but it says that, uh, it said that the youngest people were being cuddled in the sense that it's common now if a kid's feeling anxious, that they're just allowed to stay on from school. Yeah. Or that they have their own like dedicated entrance to avoid the stressors of the main entrance at school. Yes. And that was one of the ideas that was put forward as to why does actually having a negative effect and keeping them in this like spiral of anxiety. So I wonder what you thought about,

Speaker 2:          40:54          yeah, I think that's absolutely right. I mean, I, and I notice it in myself as well. You know, I have two kids and um, in know my, my, what, my oldest son, he goes to this kind of drama grade partner on a Thursday and he decided he doesn't like it and he doesn't want to go and that he's got some anxiety around that and it's an, I take into like, oh, we've got to stop him. He doesn't have to go, well, you know, why should he have to go to that? And you know, it's, it's very easy to, to think, you know, and I was about to pull them out of this thing and the hell am I doing, you know, I mean is there, you know, and I send it back to my [inaudible] probably a good 70, 80% of the stuff that I didn't really want to be doing that much. And you know, nobody was suggesting that I would not be doing it because of that. I knew that there's a balance and, and whatever. And I think it's good that we consider kids failings more now and that we consider their emotions and treat them as important. And I, I do think that, but, but absolutely I think there is this tendency and this idea that everything has to be magical and wonderful for kids and that we remove negative experiences from their path. You know, that the is very damaging for sure.

Speaker 4:          41:56          Yeah.

Speaker 7:          41:57          How you doing? Thanks for coming. Um, so my question actually kind of relation to that right there along with the gentleman's question. Never hear about it shrank the connection and also time usage. So you talk about the sense of community obviously and uh, to go along with these younger generations kind of being a little more hyperactive or something, these social media and everything. Um, it's, it seems to be like a stereotype type of millennials that there add, they can't keep their attention for anything. So this idea of fragmentation of not only your working life balance and everything, but also your personal interest. Um, do you find any correlation between simplification of kind of kin or really focusing on a specific interest of yours, um, in, in regards to this idea of like having too many communities are to me, friendships that you don't actually get the value out of it that you might, or is there a threshold or correlation at this idea of that, you know, at some of these less developed countries have less things to worry about? Not necessarily lessons were about and very important things to worry about, but this idea that maybe they're just not overexerting where they, where their interests lie and trying to do too much or have too many communities to really get invested in. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          42:55          Too much choice. And I think that is, you know, we live in this very consumerist world whether we have so much choice for everything all the time. And I think that can sometimes be paralyzing. That if you can be anything, you know, if we were all told you that be whatever you want to be, follow your passion, you know, find your, find your path, you know, you can, you can do anything. I think sometimes you kind of think, oh my God, I can't do anything because it's just, you know, the expectation is so high of what happiness should look like and you know, there's so many choices, so many demands on our time and attention. I think absolutely that it, it can be quite paralyzing.

Speaker 7:          43:31          Yeah. Sorry, just super quick followup meaning, um, more specifically like do you think that there's value in trying to find a few interests as opposed to kind of just diversifying that a bit? Okay.

Speaker 2:          43:41          That's interesting. Yeah. I don't know. I didn't look into that specifically, but I think that probably depends on the individual as well. I think some people you know really have a very deep and abiding passion for one thing and that really brings them happiness and meaning to, to, to follow that. And other people will try lots of different things throughout the course of light. And same with friendships. I think somebody over here have asked about, you asked about, um, you know, is it one handful of close friends or is it nothing, lots and lots of people. And I think that is to do with individual personality really what it comes down to.

Speaker 4:          44:13          Cool. Um, any more live questions? If not, we can go to the dory for one or two. Oh, I think, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          44:24          I was actually curious about what you found when you were reading. Um, because I actually, I'm like a natural born cynic

Speaker 5:          44:32          generally when it comes to things like this. But I went to a talk here actually last month, um, this guy named Daniel Gorman. And it was really interesting and actually kind of skewed me towards, he came with the gun, other neuroscience. He came with a neuroscientist and they basically had done research where meditation and this practice of mindfulness. Um, there was data done where they looked at the brains of monks and it showed that it actually decreased, you know, stress. And there was just, and that's actually the same book we were talking about before. Altered traits. Yeah. And so I guess I was curious in your own findings, you know, this is

Speaker 2:          45:12          so, this isn't really, this has been one of the most controversial things actually, that I'm, this whole thing about meditation. Every time I ever bring up meditation, I get a million emails from angry meditators. All of the world's wanting to run me out of that. So I think there's a few things that I think neuroscience is much more complicated than popular neuroscience would allow us to believe. So when we say something changes the brain, it sounds amazingly impressive, but pretty much everything we do changes the brain. So you know, from going to the bathroom or to, you know, sitting here now to hear, you know, hearing your questions, everything we do. So the changes the brain because that's the nature of, of brain. But so meditation and mindfulness, there have been many thousands of studies done into the effects of these things. And the results have been, I would say from my experience that, not that there are no effects of these things, but they have been quite strongly overhyped.

Speaker 2:          46:05          So there was a metro analysis that came out a year or two ago, which looked at all of these studies and found that out of something like 1800 studies, only 40 of them actually had a control comparison group. So I don't know how much people know about how these kinds of studies work, but you know, sort of comparing a group of people who meditates or group of people who don't do anything isn't really a fair comparison because you know, there's so many other factors that could be going on. They could be placebo effect, it could be the effect of, you know, having a social connection, whatever. When Meditation is compared to a control group where they are doing something comparable, you know, a reasonable control group, meditation performance no better and often worse than than something like exercise, listening to spiritual audio tapes. Um, any kind of sham control where you're just, you know, putting something to be a control condition. So I think we need to approach it with caution, which isn't to say that for many people, you know, it's an extremely meaningful, an important part of their day and something that they really get a lot from and that's great. But I think once we start rolling out as the answer to everything, then that's where it becomes problematic.

Speaker 5:          47:17          Sorry, one more question. So in your foe, so while you're writing this book and doing research, was there anything that you found was effective?

Speaker 2:          47:25          Yeah, I mean I think it comes back, you know, this is just keep banging on about the same thing in a really, it does come down to to um, connecting with other people and doing that in a way that's most meaningful to you. But um, you know, but literally spending more time, you know, seeing that we spent half an hour of our day socializing, communicating as opposed to three hours watching television or being on the internet or whatever and actually just try and to upsize minutes, you know, to just spend more time doing it and sort of nurture the relationships that we have. I think that really is the far and away the best thing you can do for your own happiness. Sorry to clarify, I meant out of all these kinds of help. Help. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Huh. That's an interesting, you know, I think a lot of the things, a lot of these self help things it dead. They were one or two points within them. They were interesting and that I took away and thought about some more. And you know, there were things in the landmark forum, there were things from mindfulness that I think in certain situations can be useful. But I think overall any one package of solutions I think is usually over promising quite heavily. And so there was no one book or apple costs or whatever that I could say, okay, well the answer is this in a because it didn't, it didn't really feel that way to me.

Speaker 1:          48:45          Cool. I need more live questions. Sure. Cool. We'll go to a, one of the door to questions then when measuring happiness, how do you correct it? Yeah. There's a question that have is how do you correct for cultural differences and what being someone very et cetera happy. Um, I guess maybe how do you, has your id measure for cultural differences? Yeah. Happiness.

Speaker 2:          49:10          It's a really interesting question. I mean, there's, um, there's a lot of research on this because people are in different cultures define happiness in slightly different ways. And I think, um, they, uh, people in the west tend to favor, there's a word for it, which has gone from my mind, but very high energy kind of emotions, like exhilaration and excitement in a real sort of extreme emotions. And I think maybe in some other cultures they value our calm, I kind of contentment, whatever. There was some really fascinating research that came out of UC Berkeley recently, which looked at how have people define happiness in different countries around the world and hey, how they defined it. And then B, how happy, you know, how happy they were. And they found that, um, in parts of East Asia and in Russia, I think that people define happiness in a much more collective way. So they didn't really see it as a kind of individual pursuit in the same way that we do in the u s but they're still at Maura's. I kind of socially orientated endeavor. And for those people, the more they, if you define happiness in that way, the more you perceived happiness, the happier you became. Whereas in the u s where people define happiness in a more individualistic way, the more you pursue happiness, the less happy you become. So it's kind of the opposite way. Super Fascinating. Yeah. I'm just cool.

Speaker 6:          50:28          Well, Hey, thank you for coming here and thank you for speaking with us. Oh, thanks for having me. It's wonderful. Thank you.
