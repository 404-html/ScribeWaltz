Speaker 1:          00:05          And so now without further Ado, uh, Sarah McBride,

Speaker 2:          00:11          thank you

Speaker 1:          00:15          on, can you hear me? Thank you so much. Thank you all for coming out during your lunch break. It's wonderful to be here at Google. My brother in law works in the New York office, so it's great to be with family. Uh, my name's Sarah McBride. Uh, I'm the national press secretary at the human rights campaign, the nation's largest LGBTQ civil rights organization. I am 27 years old. I'm a native of Wilmington, Delaware, a proud graduate of American University and I'm a transgender woman. It took me 21 years to muster up the courage to say those last two words, transgender woman today, they are among my proudest identities and this afternoon I can stand before you as the person that I am, but of course I don't have to tell you that. It hasn't always been that way. I remember as a child lying in my bed at night praying that I would wake up the next day and be myself to just have my family be proud of me and to still be able to pursue my dreams.

Speaker 1:          01:18          I was a big reader of history growing up and in reading the history books, it became abundantly clear to me, but no one quite like me had ever made it very far, at least no one who was out and growing up. It was clear as the sky is blue that my dreams and my identity or mutually exclusive. And so I kept that fact inside. I told myself that if I could make it worthwhile for other people, for me to stay in the closet by making a difference in this world by making my family proud, but those things would somehow bring me wholeness and completeness. I think one of the challenges we have in the fight for trans equality, uh, differs in the fight for gay equality is that people who aren't transgender have a difficult time understanding what it feels like to have a gender identity that differs from your sex assigned at birth.

Speaker 1:          02:12          For Straight folks, they understand generally speaking, what it's like to love and to lust. And there's a entry point into empathizing with gay, lesbian, bisexual, and queer individuals who aren't transgender but because they don't necessarily have that analogous experience for the experience of being in the closet as a trans person, it becomes a little bit more difficult and for me and while every journey is different and every experience is different for me, being in the closet, not being seen and affirmed as my whole self by society felt like a constant feeling of homesickness, that unwavering ache in the pit of my stomach that would only go away when I could be seen and affirmed as myself and I'm like home sickness with physical location which has a dissipates with time and getting your used to your new surroundings. This homesickness would only increase with distance during my sophomore year in college after moving down to DC for my home state of Delaware, I was elected president of the student body of American University and it was through that experience.

Speaker 1:          03:19          It was through advocating on a number of issues including LGBTQ equality, that it became clear that the things I told myself would make me feel whole and complete. Making a difference in this world, but those things would actually fill the void in my life and at a certain point that homesickness had become so all encompassing that my gender identity was a reality, was a fact that I thought about every single waking hour of every single day. I remember sitting in Church on Christmas Eve night with my parents listening to the choir sing and looking up at the stained glass windows and just knowing that I couldn't spend any more time missing the beauty in this world. I couldn't spend any more time watching my life pass by me without fully living as myself. And so I didn't waste any time. I came out to my parents the next day on Christmas Day in 2011 I kind of ruined Christmas.

Speaker 1:          04:12          But you know what? The big present for them that they were not expecting. And while my parents struggled with my news, while my parents made clear that they really wished this wasn't the path that we were on, that they loved me, and that they would support me in every step of the way. My parents, they, they feared rejection in every sense of the word. And we sat down and we talk for the next several days as they went through a mourning period, it sort of felt like I was dying to them. So I sat down with them and I ask them every question while simultaneously listening to their cries and telling them that there was nothing I could do about this, that this was who I am and this was, these were the steps that I need to take. And so I answered every question, mostly beginning with, are you sure?

Speaker 1:          05:01          And I said, I'm as sure as the fact that I love you. They asked my dad a progressive, uh, asked me, he said, I don't quite understand. One of the things that I feel like we've learned is that gender is a social construct. And how do you feel a gender identity? How do you have a deeply held sense of a gender identity? If gender's a social construct, and I told my dad that for me gender is a lot like language. Language itself is a social construct. Every single word has been created by humankind, but language expresses very real things. The feeling of happiness, that sensation is very real. The word happiness is a social construct and just like with gender where there are an infinite number of ways to express an individual deeply held sense of your gender identity with language, with everyday individual feeling, there's an infinite number of ways to express that feeling, whether it's in the different words you use for the different construction of sentences or the nonverbals and gender in many ways operates the same way.

Speaker 1:          06:08          So these conversations, they could help my parents intellectualize this news, but it didn't solve the fact that they were scared. But with the courage and confidence that that my family gave me in May of 2012 during the last day of my term as student body president at American University, I announced to the broader campus community that I was Sarah and an op Ed in the Aau student newspaper. I was very scared and nervous about the university's response. This was 2012 it was well before what Time magazine called the transgender tipping point and I had seen the university welcome gay, lesbian, and bisexual students pretty seamlessly, but I wasn't quite sure how they'd respond to a transgender student, let alone a transgender student body president. And almost immediately after posting that note and then posting the op Ed, the messages of love and support began to come in from students across campus.

Speaker 1:          07:06          And when I was student body president, I always said that our college campuses should look like the country we want to build in 10 or 15 years. And what was amazing was that on that night in 2012 Aau was trying to send a message to the country, which is that while we may still be learning about transgender identities, and while we may not totally understand transgender experiences, this is how you respond with love, with acceptance and with support. One student commented that the joy on campus sort of felt like we had just won a sports championship, which I don't know how we would know because a doesn't actually win sports championships, but it was just an overkill, overwhelming sense of joy and love. And it became abundantly clear to me that as difficult as it was for me to come out, it was relatively easy compared to the experience of far too many transgender people across this country, particularly transgender folks living at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities.

Speaker 1:          08:10          And so I wanted to make sure moving forward that the privileges that I had and coming out of keeping my family, of being able to continue at my school of being safe from violence, that those would no longer be a privileged but rather a right guaranteed to every single person, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity. Because it shouldn't be a privilege to keep your family. It shouldn't be a privilege to be able to keep your job or stay in school because you come out as transgender. It shouldn't be a privilege to be safe from violence. So I moved back to my home state of Delaware. I began working with our states, a quality organization, Equality Delaware, because at that time, Delaware was one of a majority of states in this country that still lacked clear and explicit protections from discrimination for, uh, for transgender people.

Speaker 1:          09:00          And to this day, a majority of states and the federal government still lack those same explicit protections for Lgbtq people more broadly. And so day in and day out, we went down to the state legislature and I started out telling these legislators about all of the stack stats and all of the statistics and all of the facts. But as I watched my parents connect with these legislators, I realize that my job wasn't to offer the most cogent case. My job was to offer the most compelling case. And at the end of the day, stories have the power to make change. Vulnerability, I learned was oftentimes is oftentimes our best path toward justice and equality. Because vulnerability, it transcends geography. It transcends ideology, it transcends race, religion, gender. Everyone understands what it feels like to be vulnerable. Everyone understands what it feels like to be other, and everyone understands what it feels like to be scared.

Speaker 1:          09:59          They don't want that for themselves. And hopefully they don't want that for other people. And so by telling our stories, it became abundantly clear to these legislators that behind this national conversation on transgender rights are quite simply real people, people who love and laugh, hope and dream, fear and cry just like everyone else. And when they learned that simple but radical fact about transgender people, they could no longer look us in the eye and deny us the equal protection of the laws they swore to uphold. And so in, in June of 2013 we were able to convince enough state legislators to pass the gender identity nondiscrimination act. And fortunately that night the governor signed it into law in Delaware. But like I said, that isn't the reality in most states across this country. And so I moved back down to DC to begin working first at a place called the center for American progress and now at the human rights campaign to try to make sure that the change we've seen in states like Washington and states like Delaware, while there's so much more work to do, to at least allow other places in this country to see the change that we've seen in places like Washington and Delaware.

Speaker 1:          11:07          Now I come to this fight and one of the most important stories that I share in my book is the fact that I come to this fight, not just as a transgender person, but also as someone who's loved, someone who's transgender. I met my future husband Andy fighting for equality and we fell in love. I did myered his extraordinary courage, optimism, and advocacy. You was a transgender man about three years older than me. After we started dating, Andy was diagnosed with cancer and after radiation, chemo and surgery, and eventually getting a clean bill of health. Andy received the news that every single cancer patient fears his cancer was back. It had spread, and for him it was terminal. After Andy found out that he didn't have much time left, he asked me to marry him and of course the answer was yes. Three weeks after his terminal diagnosis, we married on the rooftop of our apartment building in front of family and friends, and then just four days after that he passed away and I share that story today and I share that experience in this book because knowing and loving Andy left me profoundly changed.

Speaker 1:          12:29          He taught me how to love and be loved. He taught me how to live the values. I fight for it work in my own life, but more than anything else, my relationship with Andy underscored for me that change cannot come fast enough that every day matters when it comes to building a world where every person can live their life to the fullest. After Andy passed away, I went through the different stages of grief. I went through sadness and disbelief, and then I eventually landed on anger. I'm not an angry person. By nature. I find petty anger, the kind of anger that you feel when you're slighted by a friend or feel under appreciated to be kind of a waste of time, and I'm a pretty lazy person, but that's not the only type of anger that exists. There's also righteous anger. The kind of anger that when met with a mission and hope has throughout history help change the world.

Speaker 1:          13:24          Andy had had the courage to come out as his authentic self at a relatively young age. He have the courage in college to say to this world that tells us that who we are as wrong, that he would not spend one more day hiding. He was supposed to have three quarters of his life as his authentic self, but because of circumstances outside of his control, he had less than a quarter. Some people have even less time than that. Hope it can be limitless. Ideas can always be found. Inspiration is often endless, but time that is the one resource and none of us can afford to waste. Dr. King called it the fierce urgency of now. I was angry that society, that a hateful world, even with his progressive family and friends had kept that time and truth away from Andy that had kept him inside of himself for what ended up being a majority of his life.

Speaker 1:          14:19          And it made me more fully realized that when we ask transgender people, when we ask any marginalized person, whether we ask people living in poverty or women or people of color are those with disabilities. When we ask anyone to sit back and allow a slow conversation to take place before we grant them opportunity and treat them with dignity, we are asking that person to watch their one life pass by without the respect and fairness that every person deserves. This is truly a critical moment in the fight for trans equality and the fight for Lgbtq equality. Over the last year and a half at the federal level, we have seen attack after attack after attack on the Lgbtq community. Not to get too political, but the political is personal and this conversation and just a few months after taking office, Donald Trump, Mike pence, Betsy devoss and Jeff sessions rescinded lifesaving guidance promoting the protection of transgender students.

Speaker 1:          15:23          They've appointed Antia quality extremist people who've compared being gay to pedophilia and called transgender youth. Part of Satan's plan. They've appointed people like that to administration positions and the federal bench. They've granted a sweeping license to discriminate to government workers, federal contractors, and even healthcare professionals against Lgbtq people, religious minorities and women, and of course, and one of his most shameful moves, yet in a series of erotic tweets, although every single one of his tweets, his erratic, he targeted transgender troops, whereas hate by trying to reinstate a ban on transgender people serving openly in the military, which is America's largest employer. But we also know that the challenges facing the Trans Community do not begin and end with the federal administration. 2017 was the deadliest year on record for the transgender community. At least 28 transgender people, mostly trans women of color were killed. And while that violence has been on the rise, in part because of politicians all too eager to appeal to the darkest undercurrents of American society that hate is not new.

Speaker 1:          16:30          I mentioned that a majority of states and the federal government still lack clear protections from discrimination and employment and housing and public spaces. And through it all Lgbtq people are as diverse as the fabric of this nation. And for those living at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities, those forced to face not just transphobia, but misogyny and racism, the stigma, the prejudice, the discrimination, and yes, the violence can have often deadly consequences. In 2017 we saw over 130 Antia quality bills introduced in 30 states. I'm very proud that here in Washington, you all were able to keep an initiative off the ballot that would have targeted transgender people for discrimination that sent a powerful message across this country. That discrimination will not be tolerated by voters, by activists, by people across the state. But we still have a lot of challenges in state legislatures across the country.

Speaker 1:          17:26          And the two most frequent types of bills we're seeing. The first is legislation that seeks to utilize religious freedom as a guide, as to license discrimination. These bills are coming from the same folks who are trying to keep people from an entire religion, from entering this country. And yet they're trying to claim that religious freedom allows them to have a sphere without LGBTQ people, without interaction, uh, with Lgbtq people, religious freedom as a core and fundamental value. But religious freedom has always been a shield against government persecution for religious minorities. It has never been and should never be a sword to inflict harm on people. The second type of bell we're seeing are the North Carolina style bathroom bills, legislation that seeks to forbid transgender people from accessing restrooms consistent with their gender identity. One of the most frequent questions I get is why do we hear so much about bathrooms and this fight for trans equality?

Speaker 1:          18:25          And the first thing I say is that frankly, transgender people would rather, for the most part, not talk about bathrooms. We're talking about dignity and equality and fairness throughout daily life. But yes, that includes restrooms. It's opponents of equality that keep bringing up restrooms. And they do it for two reasons. The first is the knowledge that bathrooms are politically potent weapons. Every single battle for civil and human rights. Opponents of equality have sought to center in on bathrooms. In the conversation, we saw it in the fight around the civil rights act. We saw it in response to the push for the equal rights amendment. We saw it in the early days of the gay rights movement. We saw it in response to the effort to pass the Americans with disabilities act, and today we're seeing it in response to the transgender rights movement and they understand that everyone feels a little bit vulnerable and restrooms.

Speaker 1:          19:18          Everyone feels a little bit squeamish and restrooms and when you can stoke fears, when you can take advantage of people's ignorance and lack of understanding of who transgender people are. Bathrooms become fertile ground for for fearmongering and for scare tactics, but it's also a little bit more insidious than that why they are focusing on bathrooms. The reason is because they understand that if they lose on every other issue, if they can win on bathrooms, if they can legislate or allow for discrimination to occur in bathrooms, it becomes the closest thing to a silver bullet to allowing discrimination throughout daily life. Because if you cannot easily and safely access a restroom that makes sense for you, it becomes much more difficult to go to school, to go to work, to leave your house for more than two or three hours. And so these efforts are nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to legislate and pushed transgender people out of public life.

Speaker 1:          20:13          And we need our allies to understand that we need folks to understand just how dangerous this agenda is for transgender people across this country. That it's not just an indignity, which is bad enough. It's not just allowing discrimination in one small area of life. It is nothing more than an effort to push us back into the shadows and into the closet. But we've also seen in response to every single one of these attacks that when a politician comes for us, whether it's Pat McCrory in North Carolina, whether it's Donald Trump in the White House, we have seen that each attack unleashes a national dialogue that only hope only serves to open hearts and change minds further, and in the end it ends up sewing the seeds of the destruction of the politics of hate and the policies that they seek to implement. We saw at North Carolina, we're seeing it now nationally, which is that when our allies stand up, when diverse LGBTQ voices are heard, when the business community speaks out, we can still defeat the politics of fear and division, the politics of discrimination and misinformation.

Speaker 1:          21:23          One of the things that I carry with me in all of the work that we're doing is advice that my brother gave me in the last month of Andy's life. My brother who's a radiation oncologist and has watched far too many people pass away from cancer. He said to me, this is going to be incredibly difficult, but take stock in the acts of amazing grace that you see around you every single day. And while it's almost a trite saying, sort of find the beauty in even that tragedy, it was a perspective change that allowed me to truly find that beauty, to see that hope only makes sense in the face of hardship and a witness, the little miracles that happened around me every single day. And it taught me beyond that experience that all of us can bear witness to acts of amazing grace that even in the darkest moments, even in the most troubling times, if we look around for it, we can see acts of courage, bravery and compassion all around us.

Speaker 1:          22:23          And we're seeing it every day across this country and the people marching and the people protesting and folks showing up in record numbers and special elections and people standing up against the politics of hate in ways that we've never seen before and young people in Parkland turning tragedy into action. We're seeing that amazing grace every single day. And if there's also one thing we've seen throughout the movement for Lgbtq equality and throughout every single battle for civil and human rights and our country's history, it's that change is always possible. It's not easy. It doesn't happen inevitably, but with hard work and compassion, it is clear that we can make more tomorrows better than today. And I get to see that change every single day. In my job with HRC when I came out six years ago is transgender. It was clear that my dreams and my identity were mutually exclusive, and yet today I get to meet countless young transgender kids across this country, young transgender people like Stella, a 13 year old from just out of Seattle, who when I met her last year and asked her what she wants to be when she grows up, she declared without any hesitation that she will be the first transgender president put once seemed so impossible that we could live our truth and dream big dreams is now very real to kids like Stella.

Speaker 1:          23:48          The mere fact that these young Lgbtq people exist today demonstrates how far we've come. But of course, the fundamental truth remains that no one in any community is totally equal until all of us from the gay Muslim refugee to the queer undocumented immigrant to the transgender woman of color living right here in Seattle until every single one of us is treated with dignity and fairness. But I know that that day will come and when it does, when our understanding of we, the people finally includes all of us, a young Lgbtq kid will grow up and learn about these struggles for justice and equality in their history books and never have to know what this progress felt like to all of us because they will never know anything different. And that will be because of advocates and activists who dreamed of a different world. It'll be because of Lgbtq people, marginalized people speaking out and stepping up. It'll be because our allies worked with us to bend the arc of the moral universe just a little bit more towards justice. So I want to thank you all for having me today. I'd love to answer any questions and I appreciate you coming for this conversation. Thank you all very much.

Speaker 2:          25:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          25:07          So there are several openly trans, um, celebrities, I guess you can say. Ah, we had like Renee Cox,

Speaker 3:          25:15          uh, um,

Speaker 1:          25:16          Laverne Cox, silver, not sorry.

Speaker 3:          25:18          Um, uh, and uh, Caitlyn Jenner. Um,

Speaker 1:          25:23          very different, very, very different, very different.

Speaker 3:          25:26          Um, any comment on, on how they, um,

Speaker 1:          25:31          represent the trans community or it's a good question. Um, I think Laverne Cox is an incredible person. I think Laverne Cox is one of the best spokespeople that we have for our community, even though that's not her job. Her job is, is to be an actor, but she has taken on the responsibility that comes with being a trailblazer with such grace and such compassion and, and, and such scale that I am perpetually thankful for folks like Laverne Cox, Janet mock, so many others. Um, Caitlyn Jenner, uh, is, I'm very happy for Caitlyn Jenner. Um, I think on the whole, Caitlyn Jenner is coming out has been a net positive for the transgender community because I do think that her coming out offered a opportunity for conversations that weren't happening in far too many places. One of the best things that that happened that night, the Diane Sawyer interview aired was that every single local ABC station also after that segment, how to story about a local transgender person, right?

Speaker 1:          26:41          Not Laverne Cox, right? Every single one feature a transgender person in that community. And so often we hear from elected officials, from people. Um, there aren't any trans people that live around here. And that's just an absurd, it's just not true. Uh, and so in having that opportunity to elevate those stories, to demonstrate the diversity of our community, the fact that we are in every single area of this country, uh, was truly profound. And I think, you know, there were, they were, excuse me, seven year old people in Iowa or in Arizona who were having conversations perhaps in perfectly, but we're having conversations about trans identities and trans people maybe for the first time around their dinner table that night. And that's how change happens. Now. I don't for really one second, uh, agree with, uh, Caitlin Jenner's politics and, um, I would love to have a prolonged debate with her about that at some point.

Speaker 1:          27:38          Um, but, but I'm, I'm, I'm happy for her. I think for the most part, we've got some exceptional folks who we're serving as, as Laverne Cox says, this possibility models for so many young people. And that's truly incredible that there is a generation growing up that's living authentically that can turn on their television and see folks in television, in business and politics for the first time, not just as themselves, but succeeding as themselves. And that's lifesaving. Thank you so much for being here and telling your story. Of course. So my sister's transgender and she, she wants to just be perceived as female and wants to erase her past. So I'm wondering what's your, how do you make sense of your past and what's it like being out, being openly accepting of your own identity? So that's a great question. Excuse me. I think one of the most dangerous narratives I think we have in the Lgbtq community is that everyone has to be out, everyone has to be out.

Speaker 1:          28:45          And I think that that is an unfair burden to place on an already marginalized community. I think particularly for transgender people, when in existing in this world, if people know they're transgender, it can oftentimes be an asterisk on their gender and they know they can't be fully seen as themselves, which then causes pain. I don't want to cause anyone pain and I don't want to have to go about, one of the things that Andy always taught me, and we actually had this conversation around out in Antioch Quality Politicians who were closeted. And Andy said to me, one, we're not gonna, we're not gonna open any one's heart by adding people. But I'm fighting for a world where every person can live their gender identity and sexual orientation the way they need to. And that's a principle that I'm not willing to sacrifice, so I'm not willing to universalize.

Speaker 1:          29:38          This notion that everyone has to be out in pursuit of a, that contradicts that tactic and if my principal that I'm fighting for is not a first principle that I'm not willing to break than what is, so I think we have to get past this place where everyone has to be out. Sharing one story can be incredibly empowering. I want to build a world where people can be seen as trans people and be seen fully as the gender identity that they are. Right. One of the things that I always say is people write trans woman as one word and I say, no, it's two words. My identity as a woman and my identity as a trans person, they compliment each other. They interact with each other, but they don't negate one another. They don't change the other fact about one another. I'm proud of my transgender identity.

Speaker 1:          30:21          I'm proud of the journey that I've been on. I think being transgender has made me a stronger, a more compassionate person. I think being transgender helped lead me to find the love of my life. And I think being transgender has brought me into a community that is beautiful and part of the rich diversity of this country and this world. Um, and so, you know, there are going to be people for me who aren't willing to see me as a woman because I'm also out as trans. And I'm fortunate to have, I think privileges that allow, that shield me from the consequences of those stigmas and biases. It doesn't bother me either. Um, at the end of the day it doesn't cause me pain anymore. It may be used to. Um, but for those who would experience pain, I would never want to say to them, well, you have to go through even more for a political end. Even if that political and his moral imperative, I'm not willing to require someone to live their life, to watch their life pass by or to experience more pain in their one life, uh, for this movement. There are so many other ways that we can achieve a quality. So those are sort of my individual feelings about me being out, but also my feelings more broadly about not requiring other people who are Lgbtq to be out.

Speaker 1:          31:39          So the, the human rights campaign is not have the best track record for trends, advocacy. Uh, for example, there's the scorecard for lots of large companies, um, that will mark 100% this, this company is, is great for Lgbtq folks and their, their, uh, medical insurance will be, we'll have trans exclusion clauses and if they can't get a hundred, if they're, if they have exclusion clauses, that's, that's that that has changed. That has changed now. Sorry, if you want to finish your question and I can respond to, to all of it. Right. I was sorry. I was just asking, um, that now that you're with HRC, what positive changes have you seen in that organization? So that's a great question I think, and I appreciate you, you asking that question. Um, so the first on the, on the question of the Cei, um, there is a requirement in the, that companies have, don't have exclusions that companies have inclusive health insurance.

Speaker 1:          32:44          Now, that doesn't always mean that every single, unfortunately health insurance plan is going to cover the full range of services and procedures that transgender people need. And that's an ongoing conversation that we continue to work with insurance providers on ensuring that their standards are truly inclusive of the medical needs of the transgender community. Um, but the CEI does require trans inclusive health benefits. And actually we've seen in the several years since the, that aspect has been included in the CEI and because of so many people within companies articulating and advocating for change. Um, but we've seen that the percentage of major companies that are scored by the Cei that have trans inclusive health insurance or don't have exclusions at the very least has gone from single digits, percentage wise to 60 something percent. Um, so, so on that front, um, the Cei, uh, I think has, is, is always evolving and always constantly looking at what are best practices and best practices, rightfully, are always evolving and changing and improving.

Speaker 1:          33:50          Uh, but on the specific question of health insurance we do, we do require that, um, uh, or one of the major elements of scoring is that there aren't exclusions, um, more broadly. So I'll, you know, I'll be up front about this history for folks that don't have quite the same context. In 2007, the human rights campaign continued to support the employment non discrimination act even after gender identity was stripped out by Democrats in the House of Representatives. And that was a decision that was wrong. Plain and simple. I don't think there's anyone at the organization that would make that same decision twice. The organization's new leadership, Chad Griffin has apologized for that. We have a principal that will, that is unbreakable, that we will never support legislation that is not inclusive of gender identity. Um, and um, and one of the things that I truly appreciate about my colleagues at HRC is they understand that that was a decision that left real scars for a lot of people.

Speaker 1:          34:50          And that changes in perceptions and that people healing from that pain and that wound doesn't, that healing doesn't happen overnight. That it takes time. And one of the things that I really value about my colleagues, both trans and CIS, CIS gender is a term for people who aren't transgender, is that they understand that even though there is a ton of great work happening at the Human Rights Campaign Today on Trans issues, that it's going to require that sustained investment before people are willing to, to forgive. And frankly they'll, they'll, they'll never forget, um, that those scars are deep and they're lasting. What are some of the things and some of the work that I see right now in the human rights campaign on Trans Issues, first I wouldn't go to an organization that I wasn't totally positive, was 150% behind, passionate about and centering trans equality work in their work.

Speaker 1:          35:44          Um, before I was on staff at HRC I talked about the gender identity non discrimination bill in Delaware, and I can tell you without any question in my mind is the person who helped lead that effort and Delaware that we would have not passed that bill without HRC. HRC came in with resources. They came in with staff, they came in with expertise, they came in with skill, they came in with mobilization efforts that truly allowed us to pass both marriage equality and gender identity protections within a month of each other, which is historic. And, and I saw that passion. I saw that skill. I saw that commitment from the staff, from Chad Griffin on down. Uh, and I, I have seen firsthand and been the beneficiary firsthand of that work. Um, the organization is always, every organization is always on a path for growth, right? No organization is perfect.

Speaker 1:          36:31          There's always more that can be done. But in terms of the Progress I've seen over the last several years, trans work is probably 60 to 70% of our work at this point. Um, trans work is not just as the center of the movement, but it's at the center of the work that we do every day. Um, you know, we put on precedent on an unprecedented amount of staff, volunteers, uh, and money into the state of North Carolina to specifically defeat Pat McCrory after HB two. Uh, because we understood that defeating Pat McCrory would send an a really important message to Andrea quality politicians that if you come for us, we're going to come for you, not just the Trans Committee but the Lgbtq community and our allies will come for you on election day. Um, I see the amazing trans work that's happening in our foundation programs, which is working to ensure that our schools are inclusive of trans and gender nonconforming nonbinary and gender expansive students.

Speaker 1:          37:30          Making sure that our hospitals are becoming a bit more safer. As someone who's been a caregiver and a patient in a hospital, as a trans person, I know just how important that is and how much work there remains to be done. So we have a team that's working specifically on expanding hospital a safety and access and a lot of their work is trans focused. Um, at the state level. For instance, there was a battle in Pennsylvania. We removed our support for a bill, a nondiscrimination bill, not that that still included gender identity, but they stripped out public accommodations and we knew that stripping out public accommodations would disproportionately harm the Trans con change transgender community. And so we said we can no longer support this bill. And the bill died in part because of us and other organizations saying this is a first principle. Any legislation that disproportionately does not protect the trans community is legislation.

Speaker 1:          38:21          We can't support. Um, we're hiring more trans staffers. I think the diversity on our staff, both in terms of gender identity and trans identities, but also in terms of race and religion, immigration status, all of these different identities that make up a diverse workforce, uh, that were consistent consistently trying to make sure that we're hiring more diverse staff, more trans and gender nonconforming people, not just in entry level positions, but also in senior leadership positions, public positions and communications and the foundation and our legal team. Um, so I've seen a lot of progress. I'm really passionate about the work that we're doing and the fact that I didn't join an organization because I wanted to come in and, and, and try to make it start doing trans work. I came into this organization because I saw firsthand just how much they were doing and just how skillfully they were doing it. Thank you. Thank you. First of all, thank you so, so much. I have had a cough for like four weeks, so I apologize.

Speaker 4:          39:19          Uh, so my question is, I like, no, and I know of a lot of people whose opinions on Trans people are like pretty uninformed by actual interactions with or hearing the stories of trans people that are often, you know, very sort of biological essential list or very rooted in sort of data, gender theory. Um, and I was wondering how you interact with, uh, people like that. People who may not even think that they know any trans people without like taking the whole burden on yourself to try to humanize yourself or make this about like to try to like convince them that trans people are real and people,

Speaker 1:          39:55          so that's a great question. Um, I, I think in terms of how do I deal with it, I feel a particular responsibility to deal with that and I feel a particular responsibility and the fact that I, I, this is my job to, um, uh, to be willing to, to bear a bit more of that burden of humanizing and educating. I think there are a couple things. One, there are certain things that I am from about that I'm not going to talk about, right. My personal medical history, it's just that it's personal. Um, and I am pretty clear, particularly for a reporter asks me about that, that like I politely push back and just say, you know, I'm sorry, I'm not comfortable talking about that. Certainly not all on the record. Um, you know, there are some people who aren't going to change their mind either ever or in one sitting. And I think understanding that and, and sort of freeing myself from that responsibility of feeling like if I don't change everyone from, you know, a to z in one sitting, then I've failed or I'm not doing a good job. Um, I think that's been been freeing in many ways. My approach is this.

Speaker 1:          41:07          I know that there are, there's a lot of ignorance out there. I know I want my, I want allies to educate themselves, but I understand that like, it's also difficult to not know what you don't know. And so people are going to make mistakes. People are going to come in with knowledge gaps that exist. If you're coming to me with a genuine interest, a genuine desire to understand if there's a willingness to grow, if there's a willingness to not get defensive, if you make a mistake and I politely correct you, then I'll sit and I will engage. If there's no willingness, then they can come back to me when they may be grow the heart that they're lacking in that moment. Um, so I think, and I think for the most part, most people are in that, um, in that, in that former category, I think most people are compassionate people.

Speaker 1:          42:02          Most people are empathetic people that when confronted with a human being in front of them, when confronted with a story, their hearts will be opened. Their mind, their minds will be changing, their hearts will be open at least a little bit. And you know I, and so I think that, wow, I'm not, don't need to spend my time with someone who's, who's doing this just to troll or just a hurt that the vast majority of people I can engage with because they are, they're coming to me with a genuine willingness to have their empathy tapped. And, and I think that at the end of the day, if we do that, if we allow ourselves to do that, and if we allow people to make mistakes but offer people the willingness to grow and the opportunity to grow that, that will make progress.

Speaker 4:          42:49          Hi. Hello. I'm, I'm also from Wilmington, Delaware, and I'm also a trans woman and we have like family connections actually people that I grew up with it no, your family. Yeah. Can I ask you? Yeah. So your brother is best friends with my cousin Philip Lahm Plo. Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. Delaware is truly so every time not tell her, you're like, oh my God. Do you remember chocolate pit? Maybe they're dated, made it or relate. Exactly. Exactly. So I was in a trans activism here. I'm a founder of Gender Justice League. I'm for Washington state. I Love Gender Justice League. You, we love you. And I was part of the effort, uh, in front of the Senate to get the bathroom bill shut down a couple of years ago. And I have since stopped doing activism because it's exhausting and draining and it, it will eat your life. And My masochism has led me to the dregs of the Internet and to get my anger out. And so I was, I see a lot of direct misinformation campaigns like intentional structured toxification of communities. I see things like Prager u and you know, Jordan Peterson and these people that come out with this sort of low level soft sell this information for the hard right. And I wonder how aware slash concerned are people or places like the HRC, which I know you guys have legislation as sort of your main deal. And,

Speaker 1:          44:09          okay.

Speaker 4:          44:10          When it comes to social communities on the Internet, like Reddit or youtube comments sections, where do you guys feel like the responsibility lies to make sure that these platforms aren't used specifically? Um, to spread this disinformation and to sort of weaponize

Speaker 1:          44:27          awful? Yeah. Um, so to the first question of sort of how aware and concerned are, we are very aware and actively engaged on the issue. Um, one of the things that, that we have tried to do is, uh, you know, there are a handful of, um, while the vast majority of the medical community and scientific community affirm the reality and of transgender people on the need to have access to affirming healthcare and affirm transgender gender identities, the validity of transgender identities. There are a handful. There's always plenty of like home waiting in the background. Paul McHugh is a great example. Um, we have done a lot to try to engage, um, educate the media, uh, to get statements of opposition from their research institutions if they're affiliated with research institutions, articulating that these positions are not the positions of this institution, that this institution, you know, Johns Hopkins is a great example with Makiah was a hospital too that my husband went to as a cancer patient.

Speaker 1:          45:26          And every single time we got a new doctor or a nurse, we would wonder, is this person familiar with Paul Mchugh? Are they an Acolyte of Paul Mchugh? And will that change the way they interact with Andy and me because of that. Um, and so we've actually spent the last two years trying to engage with Johns Hopkins to get them to make a clear affirmative statement that Paul McHugh does not represent the positions of the hospital and the institution. Um, because those are important statements to be able to combat the misinformation that Paul Mchugh, who's not a gender or sexuality specialist, but who has these personal biases that he writes about a nonscientific journals. But with a doctor in front of his name. That makes it seem like he has credibility on the issue. Um, to make sure that we get these statements that we can have them ready in courts if he's ever testify and legislatures, if he's ever testifying.

Speaker 1:          46:12          And to again educate the, the, the, the media about why this person is not a credible person to be, to be interviewing on trans identities. Um, so we're very aware of that. There's ongoing efforts depending, uh, Bailey, I think Jay, Michael Bailey. Yeah. There, there's a whole host, there's a wonderful person named Brent Hannah Hill who does a lot of writing on Brynne's great. And we work actively with Bren tracking these folks and making sure that we're going in and engaging with their institutions. Um, the, the second question of like the responsibility of platforms to make sure that social media and the Internet is a force for good as opposed to, um, you know, a force that Aleks, the 45th president of the United States, um, is I think one of the most significant questions before us. How do we, how do we leverage changing and advancing technologies for good and not for ill?

Speaker 1:          47:10          How do we address the reality also that in this individualized media society, half of the country is truly not even hearing the other half. How do we bridge that divide, whether it's in cable news, whether it's an f on Facebook, whether it's on social media, where people are going into these echo chambers and if you're going into an echo chamber of hate it emboldens or heat. Um, I don't have a good answer, right? That's honestly above my pay grade. In terms of like what sort of, what are the mechanisms that these individual platforms should, uh, utilize or what steps should they take to address it? I do think they have a moral, a moral obligation, a business obligation and a practical obligation to make sure that they are truly rooting out hate speech when it occurs at, in violent speech when it occurs on their platforms. If they have these policies they need to actually abide by them.

Speaker 1:          48:09          Um, I think they need to make sure that, um, that if they don't have those policies that are adopting those policies for one, I think one of the exciting things that we're seeing right now is that the generation just behind me, I'm a millennial generation, that's sort of our digital natives are, I think, I don't, I think they're doing it. I don't think they know how they're doing it, but I think they're already doing it where they're bridging that divide that exists across media and, um, they're utilizing social media for good. Um, and, and I think that's going to be the generation that truly figures out how we solve what feels almost like an unsolvable problem at this point. Um, I know the obligations exist, but I don't have answers for them. Um, and, and I would certainly charge anyone who's working in tech to actively grapple with these questions to actively grapple with the policies you have and the practices that are occurring. Um, because I truly think it's probably the biggest question we face. Both. They use both the echoing of hate on social media that emboldens hate. And also this divide that no longer allows us to operate from the, from from the same fact patterns and the same conversations and keep us from talking with one another. So it's a great question. I don't have a good answer. No, that's fine. I'm passionate about it and I think we need to address it. Okay, great. Great. Thank you so much, Sarah, for coming today,
