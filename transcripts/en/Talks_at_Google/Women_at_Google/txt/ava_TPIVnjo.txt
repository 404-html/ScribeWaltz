Speaker 1:          00:05          Please join me in what calling Victoria Tucker.

Speaker 2:          00:12          Thank you very much and thank you so much for everyone for coming. Thanks for inviting me. It's a real pleasure to be here. Um, I'm Victoria Tech. I, I'm an editor at wired UK and I've also just written this book, digital etiquette, which is out this week. Uh, before I go any further, I just wanted to make a quick confession, which is that this is the very first talk I've given about this book. And in fact it's pretty much the first dog I've ever given about anything. So you guys are my Guinea pigs and if my knees look like they're shaking, it's probably because they are. Um, but anyway, yeah. Oh, also it is the first PowerPoint presentation I've made since like high school. Um, so I haven't used any clip art, but I, I might have got a little bit carried away with the animations.

Speaker 2:          01:03          It touch a keynote. Do you know, it didn't even exist when I was at high school, I think. Anyway. Um, so what is digital etiquette? Um, well the idea behind this book was basically a fun modern take on the traditional etiquette guide for digital communications. And I think a lot of people when they think about this term etiquette, uh, it sounds very old fashioned and kind of stuffy, but actually I think it's super importance. It is the social glue that makes it possible to communicate with each other without accidentally offending someone. And we all kind of do it where the or not. And I think it's especially important online and in digital communications for several reasons. Firstly, because most digital communications are text based, that means you're very limited in terms of the tools that you have to get your point across. You've probably all had that situation where you meet someone only over email and you kind of get the impression that they're very terse and very brusque and kind of rude because their emails are always really short. But then you meet them in person and that absolutely lovely and really nice. So I think for that reason digital communications can be full of a particular pitfalls when it comes to you at a cat. Also that obviously rarely, truly private. Even if you think you're just talking to one person, a, your conversation could easily be shared more widely and they leave a digital trail. So that angry email you send it three in the morning is going to be in someone else's inbox forever. Once you've sent it.

Speaker 3:          02:38          Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:39          Say this is a saying you've probably heard on the Internet, no one knows you're a dog.

Speaker 3:          02:43          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:44          But that's no excuse for poor manners. Now the book covers for different chapters, each of which is dedicated to a different sphere of modern life. So there's uh, the workplace romance, which is obviously a lot of online dating, friendship and community, which is social media. It would be impossible for me to attempt to cover all of those here today. Um, and given that this is for most of you, your place of work, I thought we'd focus on the workplace and specifically on how to do email. Um, now I do realize the absolute conceit of me coming into Google and trying to tell you how to do email. But the last I checked, you don't have a chief ethercat officer. So you know, maybe I can, uh, bring up one or two points that are of use. Um, and actually just to see what I'm dealing with. Let's start with a quick question. Um, let's talk about email sign offs. I want you to think about your default email sign off. The one you use 90% of the time you type it without even thinking who uses best wishes. So whenever that anyone use best or all the best kind of variations on a theme, quite a few. Great. Who uses anything else?

Speaker 2:          04:07          Okay. It's worse than I thought because you guys are wrong, but we'll get to email sign offs and the details of actually writing an email later on. Um, first I want to step back a bit and just think about the bigger picture of email etiquette. My driving philosophy behind email etiquette, uh, comes from one pretty universal truth. Everyone hates email. Again, maybe not the best place to be saying that. I'm sure there's a few of you out there. Um, now don't get me wrong. Email is a fantastic innovation. There's a reason we all use it and we still use it decades after it was invented. Uh, it lets us communicate with people on the other side of the worlds in different time zones and it's really actually reshaped workplace culture. I don't think it would be possible to work remotely if we didn't have email.

Speaker 2:          05:07          So is you know, a really great thing and it is often very convenient. However, it's also stressful time consuming, annoying and it often feels like it no longer just helps us to do work. It actually is work. You don't see many job ads were in the listing. They put, you know, the skills required being really good at email. And yet I've spent whole days in my inbox just writing and responding to emails. I don't think anyone really wakes up full of a sense of joy or the number of unread, unread messages they've got in their inbox in the morning, in the morning. I think you probably feel more of a sense of dread and he's, I hope I'm not the only one. In fact, I know I'm not the only one cause there have been studies that have shown this. Um, one of my favorites is actually a really small study, but I really liked it because they actually put heart rate monitors on a bunch of office workers and they made them go about their daily business and they tracked their email usage and they found that the more people spent on email in a given day, the more stressed they were and the less productive they felt.

Speaker 2:          06:18          I think we can probably all relate to that. So based on that, given that email is terrible and everyone hates it, the main principle of good email Atget if do reduce it as much as possible. Every time you send an email you are asking to take up someone else's time and mental energy. So obviously that means you should only send emails when you actually need to, but when you do, you also want to make sure that you're making it as easy as possible for your recipient to deal with. You want to make sure you're including all the information the first time round. So you're sending one email and not 10 and you just want to make it very clear. You want to be concise and precise, take up as little time as possible and make it as easy to deal with as possible. And often the best email is actually the one you don't send.

Speaker 2:          07:12          So that said, sometimes you do need to email. Sometimes it is a good thing an email has become for many workplaces, the default means of communicating certainly an office space, workplaces, uh, that is changing a bit at least for internal communications. Um, I know a lot of officers use instant messaging tools like slack. I'm sure you guys probably use Google hangouts. I'm getting lots of nods. Yep. Um, but certainly for external communications and still a lot of internal communications, email is king. It's the thing you kind of just automatic you go to first, but maybe you shouldn't always because the very same things that make email really good for some things make it really bad for others. So what is email good for? It's good for distributing information, especially if you need to send a message to lots of people at once, especially if it's quite a long message.

Speaker 2:          08:09          Maybe you need to attach documents. Perfect, simple back and forth at Kiva. That was simple. But if you want to have a quick question, answer, question, answer with someone, it can work. Um, you know, if you have too many people on a thread or the threat goes on for too long, it can very quickly get confused. Um, so simple is key. Starting a paper trail. Um, I think this is particularly important if you're working on a project that you know is going to take quite a lot of a long time. One really good thing about email is it's really easy to search. It's not so easy to search back old instant messages and things like that. Um, but you can find an old email from days ago, weeks ago, months ago, even years ago, very easily. So great. But more importantly, what is email not good for? It's good for immediate responses.

Speaker 2:          09:01          This is actually a bit of a controversial one because I think certainly today a lot of people expect immediate responses or near immediate responses from email. But going back to the whole nature of email and the first base, the whole point of it is that it is asynchronous. Okay. So you can send an email at one time and your recipient can pick it up whenever they like, you could send it one evening, they pick it up the following following morning. That is one of the major benefits of email we'll get onto how fast you should be expected to respond soon. Uh, but I do hold that if you're looking for a really immediate response, you shouldn't be relying on email, discussion and debate. I can't emphasize enough that email is not a discursive medium. Um, I know the one thing people hate more than email is meetings, but if your heart, if you have some kind of problem, especially if you need to work as a group to come together to create a solution or come to some conclusion, email is just way too open for miscommunications in that situation.

Speaker 2:          10:08          So it might be better just to speak in person and nuance I mentioned at the beginning of the talk, the thing about digital communications is it can be very hard to get your meaning across and especially to get any kind of sense of your emotional meaning across. Um, so if it's a situation that's a bit sensitive, you probably want to be choosing a format where you can use those nonverbal cues like tone of voice, like facial expression, body language, uh, to make sure that you're not misunderstood. And that's not only to make sure that your coming across the way you want to, but also so you can pick up on those cues from the other person and you're dealing with and maybe kind of tune your, your response along the way.

Speaker 2:          10:52          So you've decided that you do need to send an email and the email is definitely the best medium I key thing around email and to get his timing, um, when to send an email. So obviously I mentioned that email is asynchronous and that you shouldn't be expecting an immediate response. Expectations have changed hugely over the past decade because of smartphones. Um, you know, it's pretty obvious point. It used to be that when you left the office at night, you leave your computer and you wouldn't be expected to check your email until the next morning. In fact, you probably couldn't, you couldn't even be tempted to, uh, because you had an immune cell doing say, now we've come to expect everyone to carry these mini computers in their pockets. I mean, it's better than to be available 24, seven. Um, and this has really blurred the lines between work life and personal life to the extent actually that France recently brought in a new law called the Dwight [inaudible], uh, which is like the right to disconnect.

Speaker 2:          11:58          And it essentially in shrines in look at your right to ignore your boss's email on the weekend, um, because they recognize that work life was just impinging on personal and family life. Um, so that workers could never switch off. And I think if you wouldn't expect someone to be in the office that late working, you shouldn't expect them to be checking that email, that late working. Okay. It takes just as much effort to do so. Uh, so I really think that you should stick to work hours or near abouts I here, none of us are perfect. Maybe an hour or so either side. Um, but try and stick to work hours and try if you want to be extra good and stick to your recipient's work hours, especially if they're in a different time zone. Now you might say, you know, that's great. I totally respect my colleagues, right?

Speaker 2:          12:49          To have a personal life and to not check that emails in the evening. But I the super conscientious worker, I really liked sending emails late at night, you know, I actually enjoy it and that way I'm not keeping anyone waiting. They've got their answer as soon as they want it and I feel good about myself, I can take it off my to do list and I'm done. The problem is that goes back to the original paradox of email. There you are enjoying the convenience of being able to send it at anytime but you're putting the stress on your recipient because even if you don't expect them to respond immediately, they're going to feel that unread email guild they are. And they're going to be unsure about whether they're supposed to be replying right then or not. So the onus is on you as a sender to set a reasonable norm.

Speaker 2:          13:41          And if you really want to be answering your emails late, you can also use the delay send function so you can just schedule it to email the next morning, which makes us to how fast do you respond to an email? And this is obviously the first thing that comes up whenever I bring up the idea of email etiquette with people. And what's really funny is that people have completely different views on this. And I think this is one of the main things that contributes to email stress in the first place, is that we don't have an agreed consensus on what was supposed to be doing. So we're all just kind of scrambling around trying to please everyone and no one knows what they're supposed to be doing. Um, now it's easy to say good educate is to respond to an email as fast as possible. Usually if someone's emailed you, asking you something, they want a fast response.

Speaker 2:          14:29          Um, but it obviously is just so context dependent. It could be something really simple that you can respond to right away or it could be something that actually requires quite a lot of work. Um, and that, you know, you might not be expected to respond for several days. So it's a bit of a cop out answer here. There is no one size fits all, but there is a sort of workaround achieved ask them. Um, so yeah, I think a lot of people assume that etiquette has to be this sort of unspoken thing. I kind of secret code that everyone else, but you knows. Um, but I, I'm very much pro being transparent and being very practical. So if you receive a message and you don't know what you're expected to do with it, just send a quick line back. Say Hi, is it okay if I get back to him this by Friday?

Speaker 2:          15:21          Or Hey, this is going to take me some work. When do you need it? By easy, I'm faster flies are actually not always the best etiquettes. Um, I think a good example of this is if you're on an email, which has been sent to a group of people, say it's been sent to your whole team. I used to be this person who at the beginning of my career I really wanted to show how keen I was and how ready to work and ego was to, uh, to get involved with everything. So if our boss would send an email to the whole team asking for input, I'd immediately jumped in with my 2 cents and I thought, you know, I was just showing how great I was, what a good worker actually. Obviously I was just being super annoying. Um, I think in that situation it's much better etiquette to sit back, wait awhile, see what other people say, see if your input is even needed. And if it is when you do respond to if they've got all the information that you need. And I think not only is that good etiquette, but there's actually a lot of power in being able to do that and give kind of one very well informed response.

Speaker 2:          16:37          All right, how to write an email. I promise I'm not patching eyes on you guys is I honestly think this is really hard. I get it wrong all the time. Um, I think everyone, it gets it wrong a lot. Um, everything of course goes back to thinking about your recipient and reducing the burden of email on them. So precision and concentrate in or both your friends. Um, and this is a quote from Merlin Mann. Does anyone know who he is? He's a speaker, a podcaster and a writer and he coined the term inbox zero. Have you guys heard of inbox zero. Okay. Quite a lot of recognition there. That's good. Um, I won't go through exactly what inbox zero is in this presentation, but it's basically a way to stay on top of your email so that you don't drown in unread messages. Um, I'm, I'm a huge kind of devoted to inbox zero.

Speaker 2:          17:31          Anyway, Merlin was kind enough to speak to me for this book and this is one thing he said, which I think really, um, really makes a good point when you're going to write an email. So he says assume that everyone you're communicating with is smarter than you and cares more than you and is busier than you. Sounds kind of obvious, but I feel like we all almost automatically do the opposite. You sort of think this is really important. Why haven't they responded? Um, and obviously it's better to just consider the other person if they're writing an email. Let's start from the top subject lines. I'm pretty simple. Keep it descriptive. Again, you're trying to make your email super easy to deal with. So you need something that helps people categorize it and so they can see at a glance what it's going to be about and what probably the adaptations on them we're going to be.

Speaker 2:          18:25          I've got a few examples of how not to do it. Um, and I've used it a scenario that I think everyone who works in an office will be familiar with. So here's our email. Hi all feeds. Can everyone remember that? If you use a mug from the kitchen, it is your responsibility to wash it up. Has anyone ever received an email like that? Yeah. Now, you'll notice in this email, there is no subject line. The subject line has been left blank. Don't do that. It's super annoying. When you go to check your email, you just see who's who it's sent from and there's no subject and you immediately assume the worst, right? You're like, Oh God, I'm in trouble. I mean, you could argue you're in trouble there, but yeah. Um, so don't do that.

Speaker 3:          19:08          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          19:08          Don't put the whole message in the subject line. I've seen people do this. I often see, actually I'm quite senior people have a habit of doing this. And again, it's super annoying, especially if you check your email on mobile, you only get the first few words and it's like, what am I supposed to be doing with that? The clickbait headline. Uh, yeah, I've seen quite a few of these in my time, usually from pos trying to get my attention. Um, yeah, obviously it's dismissed eating. It's not very useful and you probably think you're being really funny, but you're not.

Speaker 3:          19:47          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          19:48          Okay. Oh, Jen. Kitchen mess. Um, yeah. So it's okay to play the urgent card every now and then. If it truly is urgent, if you need a fast response, uh, but every time you play that card, you are devaluing it. I don't think many people would consider this an actual emergency. Uh, so be very judicious with urgents and going back to the whole point of email etiquette as well. If it wasn't at least a bit important, you probably shouldn't be sending the email in the first place. Uh, so yeah,

Speaker 2:          20:21          so this is what I've gone for. Kitchen mass. Um, yeah, it's totally boring, completely bland and therefore absolutely perfect for professional situation. Um, so that's subject mines. How to start the email. This is pretty easy, so I won't spend too long on that. Um, you don't need to greet someone every time, especially if you have back and forth thread. Um, so, you know, obviously you might first day high, uh, but it's like if you're having a conversation, if you're having a quick back and forth email thread, you wouldn't say like, hi, how are you? Hi, I'm great. Hi. That's good. Hi. And what about yourself? Hi. Yeah, good too. Thanks. You just wouldn't do it and you don't have to do on email either one, established the back and forth conversation, fine to omit it. Um, I usually just as like a rule of thumb, if a day has passed so you slept on it, I'll then kind of do a greeting again.

Speaker 2:          21:19          Um, dare someone is not usually necessary unless the email is taking the place of sort of a formal letter. So fits a cover letter for a job application or an official invitation of some sort. Then you might want to use dare it's 2019. You can probably use someone's first name. The exception I make is if they have a title that is not ms Mr Ms. Mrs. Um, so if it's something like doctor, professor, Lord Lady Madam Sir, I would use the title the first time around just because some people are quite picky about that. Um, and then when they respond they'll probably sign off with their first name. You're on a first name basis, that's fine, but they're not usually necessary. Hi. It's probably fine striking the right tone. Um, I mentioned kind of several times already that this is truly difficult. Um, email is terrible for communicating emotion for this reason.

Speaker 2:          22:22          I actually am totally pro things like Emoji using lots of exclamation marks. Um, whatever it is that helps you to express your emotional meaning, um, and get your view across more clearly I think is totally fine. Obviously that's going to be a bit dependent on where you work and what your position is. Uh, if you're sort of a lawyer, smiley faces might not be appropriate. Um, but you know, in the media world usually totally fine. Um, so anything that you can do to kind of be clear is a good thing. Um, and again, striking the right tone is going to depend a lot on context. Um, so you do have to kind of make a lot of judgment calls there, but there are a few stereotypical ways that people email that I've observed and I think that everyone in this room will probably be able to recognize at least one person they know who does each of these, the boss emailer.

Speaker 2:          23:21          Um, so this is the concept of emailing like a CEO, uh, and Katie and a topless, uh, American digital journalist. She wrote this great piece about emailing like a CEO. What is that? It's when you respond right away, but just as like one or two words, like just okay. Um, and she noticed that her boss did this and it's also kind of, um, a thing that a lot of tech CEOs are quite well known for. You probably know Amazon's Jeff Bezos, he's renowned for forwarding emails from customers to Amazon staff with not even a word, just a character, a question mark. Can you imagine receiving that? The horror? Um, so yeah, emailing like a CEO, I spoke to Katie about this cause she kind of did an experiment where she tried it for a week. Um, and she said it was actually really great. It made her feel so much more productive.

Speaker 2:          24:16          She really stayed on top of things and she told me, you know, she never realized before how much email hung over her, like a little black cloud. So it definitely has its advantages. Um, you know, it helps you be able to kind of maintain your inbox zero if that's what you're working towards. But you have to exercise caution because there's a very fine line between being concise and being brusque and being brusque and being rude. So it's a really difficult one to judge. Um, and there's a certain thing to be said about who is able to do this is called emailing like a CEO and it tends to be people in senior positions. So if you do it and when you get higher up the pecking order, you know, maybe you have a bit more licensed to actually just be a bit rude. Uh, so it really depends kind of where you are on whether you can get away with it or not.

Speaker 2:          25:10          And if you work in something like customer relations or HR, there's a certain expectation on you that you have to be a bit sort of more gentle in your email tone. So that's the boss emailer, the corporate jog on Waffler. Um, this is almost the opposite of the boss emailer, yet they have the same aspirations, right? So this is someone who sort of sees every email as an official missive to be carefully crafted. Um, yeah, they're probably read a lot of business books and there were always into the latest sort of trends in thought he to ship and they try and use that in their writing. So they end up with things like this sort of stuff. Uh, you can probably tell from this, I've never actually worked in a really corporate environment, but my partner who's a management consultant tells me that it's not that far off. Um, so yeah, you've probably all received something like that, which means obviously absolutely nothing at all. Definitely want to avoid third type of emailer.

Speaker 2:          26:13          I couldn't think of a name for this one. Um, that's the best thing I could come up with to describe it. Um, and I now realize, obviously this, that headline right next to me, and probably everyone could just take a picture and put it on social media, but that would obviously be terrible digital etiquette. So I'm sure you wouldn't do that. Um, but yeah, so this I think is actually a really, it's a, it's a big phenomenon and I think I have definitely been guilty of this in the past. I'm sure it will be guilty of doing it in the future. I think it's actually a very British thing where especially if you get a little bit annoyed or a little bit worked up instead of being rude, you kind of go overly formal in a way that looks extensively plight. But is that she's just super passive aggressive. So instead of saying something like, um, kind of get back to me soon, perfectly normal and acceptable, you'd say something like, I would be much obliged if you could kindly respond to this message or earliest convenience. Yeah. Has anyone ever done that?

Speaker 2:          27:21          Yeah, we've got that. A few, a few people are confessing that one. So that's another one to be aware of. Um, before we move on, a few common email translations, I find it really funny that we will have these set phrases that we seem to use an email and we wouldn't consider saying them anywhere else. It's just that kind of email language. And I think it's especially funny when I see the GML suggested automated responses because they're always so spot on because we all already just email like robots. Um, so we'll just go through a few apologies for the delayed response. Um, yeah, it's just the law that you have to start messages with that I think I've tried not to my hands just do it.

Speaker 3:          28:04          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          28:04          Hope you're well. Um, yeah. There's really no needs to ask after someone's health unless you have a reason to be concerned. We all know this is an authentic and you don't actually want to know.

Speaker 3:          28:17          Okay.

Speaker 2:          28:18          Not sure if you saw my last message. Yeah, you definitely saw my last message. I'm obviously what we, what you mean with that is that hey, why haven't you responded just following up? Um, yeah, we're always just following up for me. Um, no, you're never just following up, you know, if you're just following up, why you send sending me email and just ask the question that you need to be answered. Does that make sense? Um, of course it makes sense. You wouldn't be sending the email if it didn't make sense. If you would, you need to go back and start redrafting.

Speaker 2:          29:01          Thanks in advance. Um, yeah, I'm going to talk about thanks in advance a bit more, uh, in the next slide. Um, but yeah, obviously it's the, again, going back to that kind of passive aggressive thing, it doesn't really mean what it seems to you on the surface. So facts of what I asked at the beginning and email sign offs. Um, these are the ones I'll accept basically best wishes or any variations on them. Why do I think there a good email fine off, um, that inoffensive the formal enough without being overly formal. Um, the totally boring again, which makes them just perfect for at least 90% of workplace communication. So you're not going to offend anyone with a best wishes. What do I not like that? Has anyone seen that one? I've seen that in the wild. I, yeah, you've obviously taken a perfectly good sign off, best wishes and turned it into an utter abomination kind of Gods. A lot of people use this one. Does anyone use kind regards? You're going to admit to it. We've got one over there. Yeah, yeah, we've got a few, you know, it's fine. It's probably okay. I just think it's a bit overly formal for most situations in the modern workplace. And I think when you do that and you go a bit too formal, it can come off as standoffish and a bit stuffy and maybe it's maybe not giving the impression that you quite want to give.

Speaker 3:          30:36          Okay.

Speaker 2:          30:37          Cheers. I used it as all the time with my colleagues and I'm also friends with, and I think that's fine in an informal situation, but as your default sign off is probably not appropriate. It's a little bit too informal. So it's just striking that balance. Ah, thanks in advance again, this is, and I've saved the west the last because I really hate thanks in advance. Why do I hate it so much? Because it's, sorry, let me gather my thoughts. Okay. Does, I mean it's just so presumptuous, um, because that's not how gratitude works. You don't think someone before they've agreed to do something right. It's just saying like, Oh yeah, you realize that you have no way of getting out of this. Um, say I hate thanks in advance. Um, definitely want to avoid thanks someone after doing something. Oh, right. So email sign offs. Um, great. So we've gone through pretty much all the main parts of doing an email. So you're ready to send it. One last thing, um, and actually I think this is, if you take one thing from this talk, let it be this. Let's all agree on how to use SI. Si.

Speaker 2:          31:57          I'm serious. So when should you cc on an email? So obviously this is when you're sending an email to all recipients. It's a very simple rule. There is a strict rule for this. The two field is for primary recipients of an email who are expected to respond. The CC field is for people who need to see the email for reference only and who are not expected to respond. Now, I didn't come up for this. I'm not reinventing the wheel. Do you know the um, the big old fashioned etiquette guide, the brats, the edition I have at home, it's got two pages in the whole thing dedicated to the whole of digital communications. That's about the same as it has for how to address a bishop. But even it's includes this cc rule. That's how important it is. Um, why is it useful? You're just making very clear what your expect expectations on your recipients.

Speaker 2:          32:51          Ah, and so that is again, reducing the burden of email stress on the world. Uh, if people are on CC, they know they don't need to respond. If they're in the to field, they know they have to. Obviously the problem here is that not everyone may be aware of this rule. So what you can do to help kind of establish good email hygiene is if you send an email, you could just say, so you can just put something like a to those on cc, no need to respond. This is just an Fyi. And then you don't end up in that kind of awkward situation where you've got people who you just included as a kind of courtesy responding and turning it into this whole thread from hell. Actually that's another point on CC. Like when should you include people on cc? Obviously the kind of top level rule of reducing email, uh, means you should only include people when it's necessary.

Speaker 2:          33:46          However, people's feelings kind of Trump that productivity. I'm so good at ACAP means taking peep other people into consideration. So if you're, for example, emailing a whole team of people, you really need to include the mall. You can't just include half of them, even if not everyone is on a need to know basis. And so I call that tossing a to CCC. It's like, ah, I'm including you even though I don't really care. Um, but yeah, just so everyone, no one feels left out. Um, cc, however, it isn't always a courtesy. Has anyone ever been in that position where someone emails you to ask you to do something or maybe even complain about something you've done and they so thoughtfully think to cc your boss? Yeah, that's, that's not a courtesy cc that should be avoided at all costs. It's very, it's not even passive aggressive.

Speaker 2:          34:42          It's just aggressive. Um, and the thing is if you genuinely need to complain about someone, you should be going through the correct channels, right? You shouldn't be sort of doing the snide like cc or superiors. Um, it's, it's, it's like blackmail. It's like saying, if you don't respond to this email how I want you to, you're going to be in trouble. So don't do that. Now that is of course an alternative to CC BCC a, it stands for blind carbon copy, as you will know. So if, um, if you send an email to someone and include someone on BCC, your original recipient can't tell that anyone else is privy to that conversation. That means it can be incredibly sneaky. And for that reason, it's usually very poor advocates. Um, and dabettes actually covers this as well. It says, if you need to loop someone in on an email conversation confidentially, you should forward the email to them with a note explaining why it's confidential. That way you don't get in one of those awkward situations where someone doesn't realize they were on BCC and not cc, et Cetera, et cetera. But the Rfu situations where BCC is not only acceptable but very necessary,

Speaker 3:          35:57          okay

Speaker 2:          35:57          to protect people's identities. So if you're emailing a whole group of people, you don't want to reveal their names and their email addresses to each other, email it to yourself and put everyone else on BCC. This is super important. Sometimes it can even be a legal requirement. In 2016, there was a linden NHS clinic, um, the accident, he revealed the identity of hundreds of people who do use an HIV clinic because someone forgot to put them on BCC. So they will all leave together. Uh, they will obviously find lots for that. Um, hopefully you guys aren't doing anything quite as sensitive as that, but it's still useful to use. So void of reply all apocalypse. Do you all know what I mean? If I say a reply or apocalypse? Yeah. When someone sends an email usually to like an office mailing list and they think it's just for their department, but it ends up being like the whole office and also all the global offices and someone replies back in, they're like, the classic, take me off this thread and then everyone else does and you end up with this huge pile up.

Speaker 2:          37:00          Um, so BCC, if you're emailing lots of people and you want to avoid that, it can be a useful tool because all the people who are on BCC on not able to reply all, they can only reply to the person who actually sent the email. Another example also from the NHS actually, which apparently has some work to do on its email skills. Um, they had, if you think, you know, reply or apocalypses that you've seen have been that they had one also in 2016 at the effected the entirety of Nhs Mail and it resulted and around 500 million emails being sent because they were all sent to every other person with an NF test mail address. Um, so yeah, it can be bad.

Speaker 3:          37:43          Okay.

Speaker 2:          37:43          To nobody saves someone else's inbox at, this is a quite specific situation, but it actually comes up all the time. Um, so this is when someone emails you and a colleague with a request and you say, Oh, you know what, actually I'm better placed to deal with this. Uh, no need for my colleague to be involved. So what you should do is respond to them.

Speaker 2:          38:11          Move your colleague to bcc and say in the email something to the effective, Hey, I'm best placed to deal with this, moving Sally to bcc to save her inbox. And that means that Sally, well then no longer receive any more emails on the thread. So you, you know, it's the ultimate act of email self sacrifice, right? You're taking on that thread and saying actually you didn't need be involved, don't worry about it. So that's some real, that's a really good thing to do. Um, okay, we're coming to the end now cause I think we've covered most of the major points. Um, oh just as I was talking about a reply or apocalypse and using the all all office email address, I thought I had to end. Um, obviously if you've been paying attention, you should be able to work out for now that you should never really be using an all office email address unless you really have to. The three circumstances under which it is acceptable, a genuine emergency, unofficial announcement and free food. Now one of those is a joke. Can you tell which one? Genuine emergency you shouldn't be emailing in a fire. Um, thank you very much everyone for listening. My Name's Victoria Tech digital ads to get the book it's out this week. Um, that's my Twitter handle. If you want to tweet abuse at me later. Um, and I think we're going to have some questions.

Speaker 4:          39:41          Thank you very much.

Speaker 5:          39:48          Sorry for questions. Please go to the microphone in the middle of the room so we can all hear you. Um, um, uh, yeah, while you're going there. The first question about me, um, you talked about, uh, business, email of Worki mo mostly. Um, do you see any general difference between a work email and uh, and personal email?

Speaker 2:          40:11          Um, I have to say I don't really know that many people who emailed in their personal lives that much anymore. Does anyone here email for fun? A couple? Um, yeah, obviously the rules are very different. Um, it all goes back to kind of that context of how far we need to be. If you're actually genuinely friends with people, you can be a lot more kind of free any spoken. Um, and you don't have to abide by the rules so much. Um, I think the really interesting thing about email actually is that it can kind of take the place of several different things. It used to be very much used like a snail mail letter. Now it's often used more like a text message. Um, and I think in your personal life you're probably going to be doing more of the latter. Yeah. Use laser were majors would be my advice. All right, so

Speaker 6:          41:05          let's, let's start with the assumption that all of the people in the room now are able to craft the perfect evening now at the right times and like, we're all going to be good. But how do we actually deal with receiving emails that are not appropriate? I mean, how do we actually respond to the thanks in advance at night? And how do we encourage people to like follow the digital etiquette?

Speaker 2:          41:32          Preston? Yeah. Mean obviously it would be quite poor etiquette if you went off at your colleague for using thanks in advance. Um, so there's not much you can do on that one except for kind of, you know, silently enjoy the feeling of self worth you get from doing it better. Um, for email sent at nights. I think workplaces on the whole should establish kind of better codes of conduct when it comes to email is so often this thing that it's assumed that everyone knows how to do it and how to do it correctly. And actually expectations just vary so widely that that's clearly not the case. So I think every workplace should have, I kind of standard set of rules on when you're supposed to be emailing a knots. It's really funny isn't it? Because we all seem to assume now that we have smartphones and that we are technically contactable most of the time that we need to always be on call. Like I'm a culture journalist. There's not many emergencies where I'm going to be the person that someone calls. And yet even I'm like, Oh gosh, I've got an email. I better check it just in case. Um, I don't think that's ever been super urgent. Um,

Speaker 2:          42:38          but it is hard to get out of that mentality. So I do think as send it, I send us, you have to, the kind of onus to fix that is on you if we receive, uh, obviously, um, if it's possible, just don't answer it. I think people get different expectations around different people based on your behavior as well. If they know that you're going to answer it 11:00 PM, because you always do, they're probably going to keep doing that. Whereas if you establish that kind of routine where actually I don't answer my emails until,

Speaker 3:          43:06          okay,

Speaker 2:          43:07          eight 30 in the morning or nine in the morning, then they may end up respecting that without you having to actually say anything.

Speaker 3:          43:15          Okay.

Speaker 7:          43:16          Oh, hi. Thanks for the talk on the subject of the email sign offs, uh, one option which you didn't mention is how about having no sign of a, all, there's something I do sometimes and take a picture plane to an existing conversation or a colleague I Novell faster.

Speaker 2:          43:31          Yeah. Um, I'd say that similar to the greeting at the beginning, if you're having a back and forth with someone you don't need to sign off. Um, and I often actually just sign off with the Letter v the first and it says letter of my name. Um, and I think in that context, that's fine. The first email you send, I think you do need to sign off. Um, again, I'm see if it's a more sort of acting more like a letter than a text message, then you need sign off. But I don't think there's anything rude about having no sign off if you're treating it like a back and forth conversation. I think that's fine.

Speaker 7:          44:06          Hey, thanks for coming. Thanks for coming. Um, you talked about email and professional environment. I'm sure that in the book you also talk about personal relationships as you said. Can you, can we hear your thoughts on what we call the dictatorship of the blue tick? You know, like when you send a message, someone sees that you sold, I have sex, you want someone's story on Instagram and they're like, I know that you've walked through it and you didn't see anything. And then there's like, oh, am I supposed to do? Yeah, being

Speaker 2:          44:32          left on red is excruciating, right? When you can see someone's read your whatsapp and they haven't bothered to respond and you're like, but you had time to check in. Um, what do I think about that? I think you shouldn't leave people on red. Um, I think we've probably shouldn't be so neurotic about it, but I don't know how to fix that. Um, I'm terrible for this. I read so much into those little boutiques. Um, so I think if I relate it back to inbox zero, which I mentioned earlier, part of the rules of inbox zero is if you check your inbox, if you check an email, you have to have time to do something about it. There's no point looking at it. If you know you're not gonna be able to do anything about it cause then you're just going to have to read it twice and you've kind of doubled the amount of time spent on it.

Speaker 2:          45:19          I think it would be good to apply a kind of similar idea to your whatsapp messages if you're checking them, you should have time to answer. Um, and that way you don't end up leaving people on red. And again, it could be the same where, you know, if, if it's someone kind of trying to organize a dinner and asking you lots of dates and you need to check your calendar, you can just respond like, oh, check this later. Um, but that way they at least know that you've seen that message. Because that's the thing about the blue ticks is we used to, you know, before you had them, someone could see your message and not respond to it, but you wouldn't be so bothered about it because you just, you could invent all these myths about why they hadn't responded. Like, oh, they haven't dead their phone. Oh, they're probably really busy. Oh, you know, maybe they died in a ditch. Um, but when you see the blue ticks, you know, they've actually seen it and that's what's so irritating.

Speaker 8:          46:17          Do you acknowledge that most of us don't use email for personal stuff anymore? Do you think that it's entirely a good thing? Or there's cases for example, like planning a holiday or something. Would a whatsapp group or an email thread to be better for that?

Speaker 2:          46:32          That's an interesting question cause I just tried to hop to plan a holiday with my family over whatsapp and like we all fell out. Um, it was a disaster. Would email have been better, you know, for something like that where it involves lots of discussion. I think the best thing is an actual conversation. Obviously that isn't always possible. I suppose the advantage of emails, you can include more information, you can put links to stuff and things like that. Um, yeah, I mean I just think, I don't even know most of my friends email addresses. Um, so I just think it's not the kind of go to communication for those more sort of friendly situations these days. Maybe it should be. Maybe we should just try to revive it. I think maybe everyone's so put off email just from work email and it just being so terrible. Um, that I'm, I'm kind of loath to try to that into my private life. Thanks.

Speaker 7:          47:34          Well transfer questions. Um, thanks. Good Talk. Um, having sent email for decades, I'm from a very nerdy, um, sort of area. The majority of males I dealt with were reply in line with the Chevron invitation. Moving the thread was he as a follow up,

Speaker 2:          47:57          oh my God,

Speaker 7:          47:59          look came up, came along and the curse of flushed at the top and sort of new generation of non tech started just replying top posting and a, it's a different style of email arrived and then you can't mix the two at all. Google, I thought I'd given up and the second sale. But at Google it's surprising there's a good 40%. Males are replying lines. Lists like this is still survived as a, as a thing. And I, I just wanted to know what your, your take on that was. You know, should I just give up and I'm just an old timer and I should just, or is this really, it can lead to quite a nice thread, a very good easy way to follow what's going on. You're applying to specific bits or discuss.

Speaker 2:          48:37          Yeah, that's a really good point actually, because that I think is when things can go really wrong is when, is when you mix the two. Right? And so the thread goes completely out of control and it's kind of part chronological and then it skipped something and you're like, whoa. Um, I'd say, I think most people don't even think about this and they rely on the technology to do it for them. Um, I don't, I'm not sure if I have a particular preference for one or the other. I think the problem is if you're mixing, so as soon as the threat is established in a certain way, you should just follow suit. That's probably the best answer I have on that one. Which do you prefer and line? Yeah.

Speaker 7:          49:17          All right. Oh, we are at the end. Oh. So once again, thank you very much, Victoria.

Speaker 4:          49:22          Thank you.
