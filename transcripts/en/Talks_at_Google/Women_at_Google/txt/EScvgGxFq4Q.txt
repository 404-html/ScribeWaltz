So when I started my video for the first time in 2007 I was working as a family counselor in Toronto, Canada.

Speaker 2:          02:56          My mom said, mom, I'm BGD today's and I'm doing some youtube, a video of my mum said, what about your job? My mom is kind of bleeding, you know, reluctant to encourage me. But now I was the mice 40 about me was a New York Times, a huge, you know article. Recently. My book was published, the May 19th is a year and then a New York Times in her. The article about me, huge in a story. And then my mom is a living in La Korea town. She just said that she doesn't understand the English, her friends all speaking Korean. How friends, Hey, your daughter is on the Korean Hangul Guilbeau he's a hunger boys, the Korean newspaper in La, in all America. They translate basically. Oh Monkey. He's a Korean born. This is the New York Times and New York Times reporter said Blah, blah, blah. And then now my mom is so proud of me. She said, Oh, I'm a monkey mom.

Speaker 2:          03:58          So she's a so proud of me. These days things are changing. They're like this. So, um, and today I tasted that the recipes from my cookbook, the food made Korean black bean noodles. You know, did you taste black bean noodles? Black sauce. I knew there was on tap, kind of black noodles. All my God, I gave blood the blood of accompaniment this to your, you know, shep because so tasty. And they said, oh, that's easy, easy to follow. Because you made a really nice copper, you know, and also your tap j stuff, right? The noodles with vegetables. So good. Um, also multigrain rice, that's my cookbook or a recipe. Oh my God. And it was all the dishes I tasted. This is a awesome, and you know how much I'm honored to be here. You know, think about this four years ago, not many people trusted my recipe and, but I'm here that with as a cookbook author and the mainstream and in the mainstream, you know, people acknowledge my ability and then I'm just sitting here.

Speaker 2:          05:06          Okay. I just to talk about my, the story, you know what I did in Korea? I was born, raised, lived in Korea and also I cooked for my family for years and years. I'm, I'm I just the typical Korean housewife who loves cooking. And when I was young, ever since I was young, I was very, very interested in delicious of food. You guys, uh, interest in delicious food. I met the, some guys, uh, I met in New York a few years ago. He said, I don't like a food. So kind of rare, you know, so I don't like a food, but you know, I just thought, okay, you shouldn't be hungry. Maybe you love it. Anyway. Uh, when I was in Korea, I never went to any culinary school. I never learned actually recipe for a mini Cooper. All the recipe side, just a naturally cooking home, cooking. And from my mom, my grandmother's two grandmothers are two sides of both sides of my aunts and relatives, even marketplace.

Speaker 2:          06:10          And then when I taste something good and then I gotta learn how to make it, that's the difference. A lot of my friends that they love, they love that it's delicious, the food, but they don't want to learn how to make it. But in my case, I want to learn my eyes. I just own Valio who, how can I make it? And then if I tasted it really tasty, I come home, try to recreate, and then luckily I can taste some food. And then I know the how it's made. Hmm. What's inside? I can figure it out easily. So when ever since I was young, like my old families, my mom's side, the ends. And then when I tasted like a, who is the best version of each dish, I can just acquire TDT coming. And then for example, there is a Korean, some kind of soup every day, every [inaudible], everybody loves this kind of subsoil even sprout.

Speaker 2:          07:05          So, you know, 30 sounds good, very healthy in a soybean Sprouse who, but uh, my uh, id to the, my, uh, I visited my aunt house, my aunt, my mom's younger sisters house, two hours, you know, the distance from where I used to live. And then my aunt gave me this suit, Korean soybeans [inaudible] different, I taste it and she added try the anchovies and to make, they're like really Umami, full taste, you know, Sabre, they make it savory. And also she added some hot pepper flakes there and some onion chopped onion plus and ships cooked that ground, the toasted toasted sesame seeds on top. And then I was going to eat, you know, my, uh, my meal, my, my Auntie said a week. And with this, right? You needed this, the radish, Kimchi. So ready. She GMT coming ready. She Kimchi wasn't, I read a fermented, so cases painting, cringe, crunchy.

Speaker 2:          08:11          So I added my, my aunt asked me how to eat this. Oh my God. Unbelievable. This is a soul. So tasty, much better than my mom's version. So ever since that I just there my call number coke, soya bean sprouts soup is that, that's my recipe. But I'm, I may change my mind maybe tomorrow if I tasted someone else's, you know, soybean spousal better than this recipe I got alone. And then I gotta share this recipe with my readers, my audience. And these recipes are all posted on my website. So my old readers, they love, love my, some kind of an authentic way. My recipes, they love, you know, they just tested my recipe and they trusted my recipe. So I told you I never studied it at any [inaudible] school. I actually, I am, I'm, uh, I have a master degree in education. I studied the philosophy of education and I used to teach at a university where I studied.

Speaker 2:          09:13          And also when I was in Korea, I used to be English teacher later and translator interpreter and uh, later, uh, I had the chance in from 1992 to [inaudible] 95 and for three years I uh, with my family, we went to, uh, we came to Missouri, Columbia, you know, the Columbia, Missouri, small, small city. I met Columbia, Missouri. Anybody was a Kansas, there's a middle meat, uh, like a miserable America. So I uh, when I was there and I met a lot of Korean pet, so Korea, next pet Korean housewives and then they were mostly, they are students at the Columbia University and then they, we met that, you know, almost every weekend we at the park and Pat Latish. So this potluck issue, I have to bring the one dish, like today you had the Jap chair. I bring jobs. So usually we do, you know, at the park Korean barbecue and somebody bring the Kimchi, somebody bring their, you know, some of the side of the show you a vegetable dish.

Speaker 2:          10:28          And then we make it all nice, nice, nice paddle party and some dishes that I never tasted there because I was growing up. Uh, I grew up in the reader's southern southern park cds, southern food, even if a small country but still they are like, you know, some the area, you know, so uh, different provinces. So I came from really south, you know, the CD and named the Ohsu in a harbor CD so that when I was in Missouri and some food they like chicken Friday stick each skin. It's called the [inaudible]. I had never tasted it before, but somebody came from different region, from the, where I lived, she just talked to me. I had to learn because a so tasty crunchy like a candy. So and this kind of things all my life long, like a recipes are coming this region from that region.

Speaker 2:          11:25          Even, I just moving around though until junior high school. I lived in southern party in my city, but from high school my parents sent me to soul your bit to be successful you got to go to so, so from Seoul and then university graduate school and then you know, so I had the chance to taste all different division and food and then I collect my some recipes and like one by one for myself, I had never thought about that. You know, youtube was someday I will be a youtube or cook. Yeah. I never expected at the time probably if I had known that I wouldn't have learned the more, more passionately. So some and then two, uh, 2002 I immigrate to Canada. So Canada, Toronto, I did all kinds of job. First I studied with in a cashier, cashier, my next door I went there to manager who is manager and the manager came.

Speaker 2:          12:25          So I, I want to work here, can I work here? So what, what can you do? He asked me. So I said I can do computer, you know, so typing. And he says, what we need is that person who can carry heavy stuff, loading or no odor. So I said, okay. Anyway, so my, my resume is a kind of book nine useful, you know, because McCray j school, who cares, immigrant, even my English is not perfect. So anyway, I came home and about, he called me in one week, he said, Oh, you're gonna become a cashier. Sure. And then I did a cashier. I learned a lot. I mean whatever I did in my life, I learned that there are a lot of with them. One example I learned when I was in a cash working education is there like a water, water is a small battle is tons of tons of a charging, but large butter don't charge tax.

Speaker 2:          13:25          So I don't know why, I think we make sense a little bit. Some people, you know, kind of boarded a pretentious person, you know, I, I'm willing to pay for small batter. Okay, you deserve to pay more for large battery. Probably family members are waiting for this. You know, a world, you know, I don't know. This is just only my theory. So kind of was more thing. How to make a sandwich or American, you know, the North American style sandwich. I just all the time learning and I tried to sell my chicken. Wow. I have, I'm so ambitious. Right? So the guy named, I never forget that the manager, because he, he helped with me. You know, one day I asked them, hey frank, I can make some Korean fried chicken. Everybody knocked down when they taste my chicken, so can I bring some my chicken?

Speaker 2:          14:09          You can taste. And they sure I brought here, I made it all kinds of, I just work hard and then, but he couldn't eat any one piece because there is a peanuts, he has a peanut allergy and then, but all my other cashiers, you know, my coworkers, they love it, they love it. And then they ask me, Oh, can I older, can I order some Korean? See with Rice roll, Kim Papp, you know, so it's what I used to sell a few people, you know, later. But, and when I work with, there's also, I was working as a, you know, the movie movie extra and movie extra in the movie names, the how to deal have, will have ever seen the movie. Yes. Um, I came home and then, you know, memorizing English is a very difficult for me, sometimes a bit backward. I, I, uh, memorize it.

Speaker 2:          15:02          People are asking me who was in, you know, Oh, I just, uh, I got a job and today I went there and then, you know, so, uh, I did the movie and how to deer, they ask the me who was in, you know, who's in there. So I don't remember, like, you know, the guy named a Galliger Pete, you know that Pirogue oliger what happened to you guys? So He's, uh, he's name is [inaudible]. I always like a, forget his name or people asking me, his name is a penal Galliger, you know, also the, the girl name, I forgot the total. He, she's a more famous than Peter Valeo. And then you been truly, how I never forget it. Stay about a pirogue. Our LIGO isn't, sounds like a galley, so. Okay Peter plus a galley and then never forget. And then, uh, Inco in Canada. I was working also, I used to teach English to Korean immigrants and also later I got a good job at nonprofit organization as a family counselor.

Speaker 2:          16:03          I work there for three years and then before I came to America and then I become Canadian citizen. And then, uh, now just to the 2000 when he's eight, I came to America to labor more adventurous life. And this is my making video and also making BDO and running my website is my full time job. So this is a very fascinating story. People are asking me, where are you from? And then I know what it means. They see my face, right? So even though I'm a legally Canadian, I always say I'm Korean, but legally Canadian, but waiting for my green card in America. So like, uh, um, so this is, uh, like a, you know, this is my life journey, so I'm always interested in learning something new and also his pastry food. Food is a, no matter where I live, no matter what I did for these, always in my heart, some delicious food I find, I gotta learn how to make it.

Speaker 2:          17:12          So this is, this is where I am now. So I made this a cookbook. So you guys found my cookbook. This is, uh, I'm, let me tell you how I got imbibe. Imbibe with do with it is making Coppo my uh, my website, my website, um, 2000, the two. Oh, I didn't talk about this. You know how I made a youtube video? I have a, my son, my son was a computer at the time, computer science student. He asked, could me, ma'am, have you ever heard about youtube? So yes, I have. He says, why don't you, why don't you share your recipes on Youtube? Probably, you know, you'll be so popular because of your food is delicious. And also neighbor, you are content. We'll never runs out. That's true. The content or never runs out, you know, I see the lateral youtube creators like at the beginning or they did it and then later or there is nothing to show anymore.

Speaker 2:          18:14          Right? So cooking is just my lifetime, like a really passion. So that's why like I was very interested in his idea, but I was not sure how, I mean just the only, I have a small camera, really cheap camera and we just, the little digital camera with a video function. But how can I do, how can I edit, how can I film, you know, no idea. But like around, you know, a few weeks later I decided that sounds like really fun. So let's do, and in April, 2007 I posted my first video. Spicy stuff, right, is queen. I just, I wanted to surprise my reader, my audience, I just brought it from Korean, uh, China, China town or Korean grocery store, huge frozen squid. And then in front of the camera I just cut it in half and then take the guts out. And then in the meanwhile, just so I was washing and stuff, right and spicy.

Speaker 2:          19:16          And then my gas detected gas detector, so England wing and then behind the me background with, I did this, I see this, I know, oh my God. [inaudible] behind me and the Kimchi I was going to make a Kimchi is salty. The cabbages is just there. And they even, I didn't think about background background and the music, even just the, without any permission, even I didn't know that's illegal, like Amaury say music and then put this merger because at the time that's my favorite museum. And then I made it. Okay, sounds good. Looks good. And then I went to bed next to the day I walk when, oh, so I was really doubting, you know, who is going to watch this? So how can they find me naturally next a day. Many people subscribed, subscribe to me and then they said, oh my God, it looks good.

Speaker 2:          20:02          Someone already made it this. And he imagined someone already followed my recipe. And then they also said all kinds of book, good encouragement in a nice comments. A plus next to request. Can you make a Korean bean paste this to Korean, Kimchi, Korean. Bulgogi so Whoa, this is so fun. People just, these guys are real, my friends, you know. And uh, before doing this, I had another hobby. It is a kind of a internet like my, that's why I got my name, monkey monkey is the hammer in Korean. It's my idea or Korean names. Kim Guangzhou, Guangzhou, nobody pronounced very correctly. So a Mountie I got his name because the uh, the CDO but heroes, the o nine game, I was like, you know, wielding some hammer and then this old throw away my stress, you know, by playing my game or nine game. So and then around it even I made some good friends still we keep in contact.

Speaker 2:          21:03          So people from Montreal and people from, you know, La and Singapore, you know, sometimes we'll use the play a game, like some task force, you know, task force and means that you can't to go to bathroom even for three hours until you finish it. It's a cable mission. You can't get out of there. And then I used to do this, but the uh, these are cooking. Bdo is a kind of a more fun for me because of this. People are real people who cook, follow my recipe and then okay, I at first I kind of a handful of my hour, the leftover, my hour is that for my game, half is for this. So I couldn't sleep much. Sometimes they're like I said all day, all day play game plus making video. So anyway, as soon why later I was like a chosen as a youtube, a pattern at that time, all day you become a pattern and then you can get paid.

Speaker 2:          22:01          But not digitally is everybody. I think I they are usual pattern. So, and then they gave me pattern or some kind of metal. So mother mother was probably, you guys are heard about this mother is a right next to my channel. So really motivated me to work a hard more and more. And then, uh, so ever since that time I keep posting my video and then a few months later my, I made my website because I really need a home on the Internet because some of my, uh, youtube audience, he said, Oh, I, how can I find it? It's the Korean ingredients. So what is it, you know, and also like, uh, what so a lot with things to talk about in a, like a keeps when you make a specialist, especially this thing is 20 minutes, like a sizzling things or why something like I needed this.

Speaker 2:          22:52          So I really needed to make them my website. So I made it this monkey.com and then uh, ingredient to follow and then kitchenware follow and where to find Korean cooking, uh, grocery stores. Where can you find, and then my readers a day they submit, okay, this is my favorite Korean store. And then they just submitted the information. So, and then all this, my website is a gradually increase, keep getting bigger and bigger. And then eventually some people send me forum monkey. I made you a chicken, my chicken and I, it was a big hit. I went to the patty, everybody asking me where I learned, I talk about you and then Oh my God, that's, you saved my life. So many touching stories that, you know, some, someone married the Co, uh, Korean, the Korean husband, the American lady who married a Korean husband. And then recently, some they don't get along where kind of a path of the food to our cultural thing.

Speaker 2:          24:00          So the lady found my recipe, she made the Korean bean paste, the sue for husband, husband said, oh my God, this is my mom's food. Where did you get this? And then you know, the food by not only food by itself but also like the wife is a working harder to, you know, to get along well to get a better relationship. You know, that's the kind of uh, uh, make the husband, they really like feel better so they get along. So anyway, now could this kind of a story is a tones and tones of a story. Every morning I wake up, I read the email and the through the old my social media and all the time, yeah, I'm encouraged them then I am empowered. So, uh, this thing is that, you know, so my website is getting bigger and bigger and and sense I just made another section as a Korean food.

Speaker 2:          24:53          The photo you guys would make their, because they sent him email. This is the noodle soup that I made. Would you recipe and then they show me, you know, to send to me, it takes time and effort. You know, they have to use a four o Chav, you know, so they have to do some something and then they send me and then I just said, wow, this one I got to share with more people. So I made it a Korean food, the photo section. So this is for you make my recipe and then you pray have a story or it does matter and no story, just the poster directly from your computer posted. And now so fattoush and stout on the photos or my website, this is my treasure, this is my treasure. And then later my readers that they become friends. They are these guys like a Korean Padilla leaves, you guys know about Korean Padilla leaves is called the Kenyon.

Speaker 2:          25:48          So anyway, so Padilla leaves and I make a Padilla, labor, Kimchi, Padilla pickle. And then somebody said that, you know, oh, I found it that you know, my uh, my yard, I thought that this is like weed all the time. Every year I got rid of this. [inaudible] these guys are so, so be alive next year again coming alive, you know, so they will really get tired of all this kind of a precious vegetable curry for Koreans. I pay, I pay to the lottery de la Porte. Really smart packaging, right in Korean store. But some people are just, you know, parallel lives at a throwaway and like we talk about perilla leaves, you know, and then some people say, oh, I don't know, I'm the living in middle of nowhere. I cannot find in a Korean store. How can I find the Padilla leaves? Oh my God, I like to taste.

Speaker 2:          26:42          And then my reader, another reader, okay, I will send you the packages seat. So he sent it to her. So they guide these guys that became friends. So I thought that maybe it's a time for me to make a day meeting place, you know, sort of my website. So I made a forum. So through the forum they talk with each other and then they share. They all their know how you know, so some people are making Kimchi at the beginning. Seven years ago when she started him, she asks for them, is she bugging me? Hey you, you made a 10 10 pounds of beginner. How about the one pounding him? Chill. Can you give me a recipe or knee? Small. One pound of Kimchi recipe. This is unbelievable for me. It's as a Korean, we make a Kimchi like a 2010 year heads of Napa cabbage.

Speaker 2:          27:30          I make even, I never know that. What's the pound? That was a big deal. You know? Usually the Korean cabbage is a huge Chinatown. Cabbages are so small. I don't know where they find that. This Korean Napa cabbage is a huge, like I saw some people were asking me, please cut down the recipe and give me so one cabby, Napa cabbage here. I don't know from what to say, you know? Okay. It, you know, Kevin Sizes are different. Anyway. One of my readers say he's a she or here many people they studied the like the only one cabbage, but now they make a tiny pounds of Kimchi because Kimchi snotty, rejected only one side of dish. With the guilty you can make a soup stew, pancake and steam that you can add edit chapter this in the to the dumpling everywhere you can make all kinds of dishes you can make here. So like an like a Korean housewives. When I lived in misery Columbia, I had a friend, you know she's from China and the Miss Uie and Mr Youi came to my house and then opened my winter refrigerator. Her eyes are like, Ooh, this is a kid.

Speaker 2:          28:42          Yes. [inaudible] she couldn't believe that this a has a eating laudable Kimchi. Kim, this is a usual thing for making cheese or wreck a huge container, this amount of a container and then, but these days, my readers, my audience, they love GIM today, make that amount. Some people are selling him to Monte am I said, Corey, you're guilty to Koreans years. So my Brazilian reader let me know. She is a selling Kimchi. At the Korean church to Korean. So really fascinating stories every day. I've just always hear that. Yeah. So this, um, and then some people are asking me, hey, Matea even though you just, uh, give, give us the recipe, I need a book. I like to give it to somebody who is not access to computer. And then I like to give them the real written recipe. So can you make a book? But I never thought about like this kind of old I said, okay, sure.

Speaker 2:          29:38          And then I made the pdf pdf and didn't have Carla with last, have a Carla and then sold on Amazon also. First I studied it, I could give away for free. So Steve, you guys that can get, you know, a thousand nodes for free, you know, book one book two W two, three, four, one, two, three. Even I never thought about the making we are book at the time, just the people to ask me, okay, sure, I will do that. And then, uh, the book was a download. The millions of people download it for free. So actually when I pitch my Bible, I just, that was a really cool, so I asked my agent to see, this is evidence of my book is a millions of people download it even though that's a free number. But the book we are book people who want to get the real book in their hands is that we made it as a pdf file and then nice to kind of uh, uh, small sizes are really small, but full price is so expensive.

Speaker 2:          30:36          But it shouldn't be because I use the caliphate book. Should it be colorful? This, my theory about Cooper, I might theory about cookbook is that you should have a laudable California nice photos and step by step photos, you know, and saw that I'm a visual person, you know, youtube, a video, why I making video, right? So, and then I, but problem is they're expensive. $30 for discipline. I don't make much money from this. I'm imagine, imagine, you know, because otherwise I need to make a black and white. So I don't like the idea of black and white. The Cooper, no matter what happened. So anyway, someday I, I was uh, thinking there may be some day I shouldn't make a rear Cooper because of real cookbook. This a book is a much cheaper and also prices are cheap plus La [inaudible] people something like a recipes of almost the same but like a make you guys understand better.

Speaker 2:          31:35          For example, my uh, my co writer, her name is Lauren, she's um, I make a recipe and I send her and then she make a kind of, basically I gave her my chore and then she makes Jewelry. Right. And then she's a okay multi then you say that that this or you cover, uh, the cover or uncover you cook the 50 minutes of where cover or uncover I was a first grader. What does he mean? Of course cover it inside. I just thought their cover and then yes, cover as a swallow, you know, my frustration and then sometimes [inaudible] it means that sesame oil is a toasty. You are on toasted, toasted in Korean cuisine over your toasted toasted sesame oil. It is always, always a sesame seeds toasted on toast here. Always a toasty. Right. And then like a, and also I was so shocked when she, when another editor rolly he's name is later, he joined our team and my book is made with tones of what people were only, he's a really tuffle editor.

Speaker 2:          32:45          He asked me all Monte, you made the, you made a decider. Uh, the beef Jerky, you know, people Jerky, you guys are, she didn't follow you. If you get the today, you both make a few eating a beef people, you're keep making this is, everybody loves that. My beef jerky people get, he asked me how many pieces there, I mean I don't remember. And also he said this is a how many servings? It depends on how much you like that. Right? I mean if we were just like, uh, three pounds of beef brisket, I made it this. And then you know, some people, five of people it just to in one time or just a one person like, okay, I see, but it's a for one year and then you can either, I mean, so make them so frustrating. But you know, I was always a lack of swallow.

Speaker 2:          33:37          Yeah. Right. My cookbook buyer later coupled by are those guys who will have a same question, may have the same question. So that's right. I shouldn't feel frustrated. I sure do appreciate this. And then actually eventually I had to make my people jerky again if exactly the follow my recipe, cut it then okay, this resume, this is Raleigh. And then this is my 30 [inaudible] or something or like a pieces and then the exactly. And then I just made the three d divided and then one portion for Roy, the one portion for my cookbook writer, core rider for one third is a for myself. And then I divided it right the knee. And then I sent them, I sent them an Ambula Roy, next day he got here. Holy Delicious. Oh my God. Has He emailed me and my other, you know, cove right. Also. So this is when I make this a cookbook.

Speaker 2:          34:41          I have a lot of, a lot of funny stories and you know, stay, I don't remember or, and then sometimes I should write down. Otherwise, you know, I get older, I always forget some, uh, this is like a long journey. But, uh, around the full four or five years ago, uh, eventually I met Bestival best agent. So this agent made, made it possible to make my cookbook. She found the, so all the, you know, uh, best, the publishing company and also call rider and also, you know, the food, uh, food for designer and all. Everybody's so kind of a set. So I'm so lucky. I'm so lucky. First why I'm lucky I've got involved with the youtube and Google guys so you could already sense to pay me money. So I'm, this is my full time job. And then also my readers, my reader audience, they, me, they love me, right? And I'm lucky n now I'm just invited this, they may, they may the you a chap made it there. My recipe. How fascinating. Disease. You know, the stories I can keep going in on you. So, but I think that there's enough that you guys ask me questions.

Speaker 1:          35:57          Question. I mean, do you think it's, it was, became so popular so quickly because there's a lack of knowledge or a lack of authority about Korean cooking in America and you're filling that void?

Speaker 2:          36:06          I think the first, the food is delicious. Food is delicious. Amanda, like a, I didn't know about even I used to go back, pack travel. I have a lot of hobbies, you know, so, but I traveled to many countries, different countries, but always, I believe they're like a foodie. You know, you've got Korea, especially Korean travelers, you traveling on other country, you got to taste the other cultural food, a tool. And if they say, oh, we dial two Korean Kimchi, I can, I survive. And then I kind of criticize them. Oh my God, come on just a two day, three days. You know, I was thinking like that, but, but you know, later maybe there's those guys or say the same thing they said, you know, my uh, Netherlands, you know, is um, the guy named Dick Urania, he makes all kinds of Korean dishes. He's a cooking is a better than Korean housewives cookie.

Speaker 2:          37:01          She, he's sending me forum and he said he traveling crease and then for one week he said, oh my God, I miss my GMT. So I think they are kind of audit addictive, you know. So kimchis uh, and also Korean food is all vegetables, like all kinds of vegetables, a mountain, vegetables and Tofu, you know, some the way of a cooking not crazy and some way like a people really, it must be appealing to people. So please d and second, I think. So Korean food, as you know, the Korean barbecue people think about that. You make a Korean barbecue at home. You can share with tons of people. Recently I blog about this and one of my readers, he married, he's in Ma, he's a on the wedding day reception, he made Korean pork belly, [inaudible] belly. He followed my recipe or the poker belly and you know, the of the plate and also the Bono guessable no, just only $20 in Korea, Korean grocery store.

Speaker 2:          38:03          And he prepared each table, people receiving 10 people proceeding and then he put this in a greedy plate. Everything, let them cool them Airbus. And then pork belly and the leathers. Samsung, you had the Samsung today dipping sauce and then everybody just the wrap this and then they, they was so, so happy and then do this. Let me know. So I was a very uh, impressed us. So I just blog about his story. So this is like a Korean food is that you can share with many, many people. Is this supposed to be shared? You know, so I think maybe that's the reason. Where did you learn this recipe? Oh, this mountain.com. You know, that's why I think people come to my website and it was also Korean fried chicken. Everybody loves Korean Fried Chicken because, because why? Mm, that's delicious. How double fry. Yeah, he, that he was acting in.

Speaker 2:          38:58          My editor gave me a hard time when I do this. Oh this is so delicious a soup. And she asked me how delicious you should explain. Americans don't know how delicious it is. Ah, squeeze squid. Okay. It's like a truly irresistible is the one not enough. We say something Korean Fried Chicken and I is, I know really we always make the coating is a coating is the maiden reading in a statue, like a starch potato starch I use and then making really crunchy and a little sticky. So because there's some juicy sauce, I mixed the in the last minute and they make you kind of a little sticky and Lucas oil tastes like a rice cake or Gigabit, but very, very crunchy, crunchy, crunchy. So and also it depends on how much you like spicy food. You can add the spiciness spicy, you know the Chili pepper flakes. So I think that that's why in all crunchy and delicious. Yeah. Yeah. That's why

Speaker 1:          40:04          I recently read an article saying that Americanize Korean cooking is too spicy and actual Korean cooking is not as spicy as we like it. Is that true?

Speaker 2:          40:12          No, we're good. Yeah. I see the old tons of, we are the, you know, some theories from where he coming. You see the Koreans. When I go to Korea, like the, I sometimes visit Korea, Koreans or loves spicy food and it was all we Koreans believe with spicy food is a make your body really, you know there is some researchers or research spicy food they make you always awake and then so it's the Ntis a Highmark. So you, it's just the, you are always likely some make always a smart, you know, so I see food is very good for your health or the researchers are working harder but real Koreans are like early morning TV from early morning TV. I have to see this people, Koreans love food, all spicy sauce mixed with the spicy sauce. Eating even, you know, Medica, nobody, I even, I don't feel like eating spicy food from early morning. I skipped breakfast, I always drink or your large be huge comes over me, know black coffee, that's my breakfast. But maybe there's a surpriser I felt that you love game til the time, you know? No Way. And I stopped and then, and then and, and then you know, that's not true. Yeah. So Korea is a more spicy food. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          41:29          I think it's funny that you mentioned the New York Times article and they kind of called you the Julia of Korean cooking. How do you feel about that?

Speaker 2:          41:36          Even that terminology, Julia Child, these there came from 2007 when I studied them. Just not long after. I'm already sorry. You know, my video was sorry. And then I was living in Canada as Canada, New York Times version cannot Canadian newspaper on all nationwide. The biggest, the newspaper is the glow. We May, it's a globe and Mail interview me and then she asked me, she wrote to them, uh, Korea, Julia, Julia Child, right. So I, I even, I didn't know who the Julia Child is. I embarrassing it. I searched, oh, Julia child, the French cuisine to you know, America. Uh, but anyway, ever since that time, many people call me Korean Julia Child, you know, but one day, uh, I just, the Korean newspaper Guy, a radio guy, Wa I was interviewed after my article on global may, was on lap as usual, Korean reporters, a key bombarded with Amy, can I interview, can I interview?

Speaker 2:          42:41          You know, they don't find the me, but always everyone, when I'm near times, they just have kept a calling me when I'm in youtube and then did some cooking demo. They just come to me. So when I'm on the main stream newspaper, they want to interview me. So there is some that one day there or Korean interview I asked, I mean, how do you feel about Julia Child? I know. So I say, uh, and also somebody asked the mayor about that. Martha Stewart. Oh Ho Ho Youtube, youtube. We know the subscribers and numbers. I'm bigger than Martha Stewart. So they ask the meal about the Martha Stewart. So I said, Martha Stewart, it doesn't have a youtube. Well that's why you know that you don't have to compare me with a Martha Stewart. Martha Stewart is such a wonderful, you know, chef in the world. Right. So just to add,

Speaker 1:          43:32          are you going to have your own TV show one day?

Speaker 2:          43:34          Um, I would just think about already some, you know, TV show people contacted me. Uh, but I was very BG doing my Cooper, so I can't do this at the multi work murky Casco like this because when I do this, like I have to focus on this, but my, I don't want to skip my video every 10 day. This is, my readers are waiting, waiting, waiting, you know, so I don't want to disappoint my readers, a youtube audience. So when I have a more time, uh, let me think about TV show. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          44:06          Yeah. I think it's a good time to see if the audience has any questions. Does anyone, here we go? I know for me I think it's very bitter. It is your personality and it really makes you a very interesting chef to watch a youtube and even listen to your talk. Um, can I get the two questions? Um, one is what is your, not your favorite non Korean food at second, who made your logo? Cause I think that's what it also cute things that you may have on your site then. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          44:32          Uh, the logo, um, my daughter made dot. Yeah. My daughter is a, she's a dentist. Yeah. She made it easy. But I gave her her idea. I gave up because I cannot, I cannot the role where, but I know when she was young she can do better way. So I said, okay, I want to do this and kind of boy, you know, sign. They're like dead, you know, some, you know, some big fish and the big knife. And then I like to do that. And then she made it this. And also, what is your first request? Oh No. Oh, Spaghetti. Spaghetti meatball. Yeah. I love it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          45:11          Hi Monkey. So I'm, I know that sometimes you travel to a new location and use the local, you know, produce, et Cetera to cook. I saw an f when you went to Maine. I, yeah, some bad new England. Do you have any experience with you can relate where you found something unusual and tried to use that in good? In cooking?

Speaker 2:          45:29          Yeah. He must have read my website, you know, so like a very deep question. And whenever like, uh, uh, before I started my youtube video and when I traveled in no other country, for example, when I went to France, I love crazy about the front French cheese seeking to cheese it from Normandy and yet, and there is, I kept eating and then I gained weight when I came home. I didn't mind that, you know, because of delicious food. But at the time I, even though I love, love with their, you know, their cuisine, uh, but like around three days after I thought about something spicy kick, oh my god, I cannot swallow very well. I, you know, I cannot swallow French food aware of because I like that. So I needed something spicy so that I took that, you know, some Korean hot pepper paste and it look like some toothpaste, like a, like the smart paste.

Speaker 2:          46:29          And then just in case I might see you use this guy and then I took it and then you, okay, time for me to use this. I went out in a grocery store, you can buy the cucumber everywhere. I took it and washed it this and then just one bite. And then there's the, I could do some like a pepper paste up one, you know, one drop and then he's good. He's good. Now My, I calm my stomach and I can't swallow where I'm ready to eat French cuisine again. And then ever since I studied my cooking video and before in the case I'm more serious to cooking. And also whenever I travel, like more than one week, I need to make a video. So we did the roll call, uh, vegetable roll call, you know, some of the ingredients. So I have like a, some Cybera ingredients, like a Corian, a soy sauce, Korean had pepper paste, the bean paste and the fish sauce, garlic.

Speaker 2:          47:30          These things you can get everywhere, right? So this thing, so you cannot find easily plus Korean rice, Korean rises. Um, you may, you may know about Korean rice is a, like we same rice as Sushi rice. So they did a stickier, stickier then some Mexican or long grain rice. Some people are asking me, Oh, monkey, you know, is that the can, is it working with a normal rice nola rising for me? It's a short grain rice Sushi rice there. All my life, I'm eating this, but I know what they mean. So I always, uh, I take them my rice also, and then I arrived there. I make a Kimchi and then I go to their broker, a Roku or grocery store and the market. And then I find that if I don't find a napa cabbage, I just find that any green, any greens, even spinach, I bring it and then make just Kimchi or I just use your cabbage.

Speaker 2:          48:28          Ugo KBG game chores. I posted the recipe when I traveled in Mexico at the time. And then we, the cabbage, half of cabbage, I made a Kimchi. Oh yeah. It was a delicious, and my, I made with this too. We did this. Yeah. So all the time I carry Korean ingredients. Yeah. Is there anything you really just hate to eat that you just don't like? Uh, yeah, of course. I like a real person. Warm first. The first ever food. I don't like key, like a bug, you know, I don't need it now. Some people are just asking me, Oh, can you cook dog though? And also, um, yeah, pretty much. I love all kinds of food. Yeah. Oh, one one, one recipe. My readers ask me, chicken feet monkey please. Uh, make the chicken feet recipe, but for some reason, chicken feet high, I don't think I can handle, you know, I can handle a live fish.

Speaker 2:          49:30          I can handle live crab, you know, and then also live lobster. All the recipes are videos on my channel, but for some reason I don't think I can handle, you know, some chicken feet and I especially she can Tony. And then, you know, I was thinking about, oh, this a little thing. So just the jumping around, you know, how can I do this? Oh, I cannot, but I don't know my readers. I love my readers. Maybe someday I may change my mind. And also blood sausage, blood associated people love the Korean sooner. He called the Sunday, but the blood associated, okay. I love to eat soon there. But one day I tried to find it there. You know, blood, I need to buy blood. Right? So when the Chinatown I buy, I bought some blood. But, uh, it turned out to jester and also smells not good, you know, and then I hate that. So I couldn't make it, but maybe I may change my mind again. You know, who knows. Yeah. You got a question over here.

Speaker 4:          50:28          Yeah. Whenever you want to figure out how to pay for yourself, what's the hardest thing that you could try to like replicate

Speaker 2:          50:43          something like a, when I go to the fusion restaurant, my fusion restaurant, relapse catered restaurant and then, oh, this guy made really Kimchi, Brian. I can smell him to Brian and some, uh, social studies or like a pinkie pinkish and then maybe sour cream. But something that I don't know about. I never went to culinary school. Hi. Only I know about Korean food there. So sometimes I cannot figure it out. And also I don't want to know about that. Right. So, but Korean food when it comes to Korean food is almost, so, I know when I tasted this, I know that, you know how even people were asking me, Monte, I went to the, um, restaurant Korean restaurant. They gave me something like a sweet and really salty and they're kind of, Mikaila is Brown. It is like of some potato buddies, not exactly potato.

Speaker 2:          51:33          Oh there's the, that's the fish cake, you know, cause I know that. Right. So kind of the things that I know that exactly about Korean dishes and also Korean restaurants, you know, North American, Korean Nestor on what they saw. But usually, and then I know they're all decided, is she so the list so easily I can figure it out. But like a Korean fusion restaurant, upscale restaurant, you know those guys alone. Uh, Corey Enoch Culinary, you know our Tina. So maybe in like a secret, did they use a some, you know, spice. Dot. I don't know, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          52:06          So I'm, I'm curious, do you have many followers in Korea?

Speaker 2:          52:09          Yeah. Did you base labral Koreans are coming extra like, uh, uh, most of the people coming North America, American USA is, USDA is around the 70% over my readers are coming. How much be who you defense. But Koreans are lady almost none until last year. But like all over one year. These days. More and more people coming and the label Korean comment in Korea, what should I do? I have to answer in Korea. And also I was thinking there may maybe these guys is a total understanding of English, you know, so I just studied the Korean caption. So I did the English caption. Uh, I pay for English caption because I cannot trust the Google, Google translation in the pool with the youtube of trends in the auto translation. All My, my eh, and then, but I hire, you know, translation and also the Korean translation is done by me. So I do this. Yeah, that'd be have time for one more question.

Speaker 5:          53:17          Um, thank you for being here. I actually go to your website. I'm creating myself, but I go to your website all the time to see what else is out there. I just was, I have two questions. One is if I was thinking about why it took a while for Korean food to become so big in the states, and I feel like there's this term called [inaudible], which you know, in Korean it's, it means you just do it by the feel of things. You don't really measure things. You think that that's the reason why it might have taken so long for it to become big in the states. And then my second question is, would you ever consider doing mock bang, which is a big Korean? Um, you just eat on the show and it's like, it's huge in Korea right now. If I think,

Speaker 2:          54:00          yeah, there's a reminded me over my, the, another reporter from Korea, she a KBS accordion broadcasting a day. That'd be [inaudible]. Same question about Mark Bank, but uh, they, uh, a mock bong I saw the one time. They're kind of, that's not my nice tie. Yeah. I mean, I went to teach Korean cooking, just the authentic recipes, but I, in the always at the end, over my video, I show them how passionate did I eat. You know, sometimes the people say you look like a crocodile, but I don't care more. People love that. You know, the, when I enjoy my food, they know so because I know dossier, you know, so who cares? Like something is, it became my teeth, you know, so everybody, I mean those guys are following me all. We are the same group community know who love food. So, uh, I can answer and then Korean food or why, why Korean food was not popular I think were Korean food is popular.

Speaker 2:          54:58          I'm going, no, we don't have to worry about this because like Japan is a four digit is popular, you know that all new Chinese food, you know, Korean, a Japanese food in me even think about Chinese food. Chinese, China's a huge country, NBI, huge country to Mexico. Huge country. They are not the huge bay here nowadays. I think with the Japanese food is a very big Djs, you know about food is delicious and healthy, right? So, uh, but Korean food is like a trend, but I'm surrounded by the people who love Korean food. So I'm almost a like, uh, I think that everybody loves Korean food, which is natural, which is natural. Then I meet, sometimes I'm interviewed by in a radio host. Uh, when I talk then I feel that, oh, they don't know about Korean food. A lot of people don't know about Korean Kimchi.

Speaker 2:          55:51          Not yet. So is study, study. But I'm very positive and because maybe there's a trust my recipe, they share the food that they make. Share this. We did their family and friends and Djs, they make lunchbox. Corey, we'll call this Japanese in Bento, they call this a Bento in Korean, Toshiba. I used to make my Toshiba for my children. Sometimes I used to make a lunchbox and president of barks and for, for lunch Pasadena box and I used to wake up 5:00 AM to make the fresh a fresh meal for my family. So, so these days and my readers Mountie I took Toshiba Korean nunchucks or to my work. All of my coworkers, they envious of me. So those guys are spreading Korean food, I think. Yeah. With your cookbook, that's our hour. And there's cookbooks in the back for sale. I think we all want to say thank you so much for being.

Speaker 6:          56:46          Thank you so [inaudible].
