Speaker 1:          00:00:06       All right. Good morning. Thank you all for coming. My name is Bradley Horowitz. I'm vice president of photos and sharing here at Google and it's my pleasure to welcome lovee a gie with us this morning. You all know love it.

Speaker 2:          00:00:22       Yeah, I'm going to do this

Speaker 1:          00:00:25       super brief introduction because I actually want her to tell her story. Um, you all know lovey. I have to confess a week ago I didn't, but a good mutual friend Lisa Stone and invited me to host this talk and so I went into a crash course on learning about lovey and uh, why she is so prominent in the blogging space. And so I've spent that last week getting to know her work and I'm super excited and as I shared in the invite, somewhat nervous to be up here cause she tells it like it is and it's pretty clear I'm part of the problem

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       that

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       lovey please. Let's welcome,

Speaker 2:          00:01:08       that's hilarious.

Speaker 3:          00:01:13       Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       well thank you. Thank you for coming. I know you're bouncing around the whole country and we're glad you had a chance to stop at Google. Had to do it. Have you ever been here before?

Speaker 3:          00:01:22       No, this is my first time on Google's campus.

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       Well, I hope you get a chance to meet people and look around.

Speaker 3:          00:01:28       I heard about the epic slides you guys have.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       We, we have slides. We have a weird bikes. We have food, you know, we'll, we'll treat you right. It's going to have fun. Okay. Um, so I want to start, I think most people here know it, but for posterity and, uh, for the, the videotape, um, tell us your story. I mean, who are you, how did you get to this chair?

Speaker 3:          00:01:49       By being a professional, a trouble maker. And that's how I got to this chair. Um, I'm a writer. I'm a speaker. I'm a techie and I have been blogging for 13 years. I started blogging in 2003. I was in college and I was peer pressured into doing it because my friends were like, you should start a web blog. And I was like, okay. So I went to zango.com and start a web. And I started a long ago that Sangha Sangha, okay. Remember Sangha like next to Friendster and everything. Right. And I started blogging. I was talking about college life and all my randomness and Shenanigans and, uh, who I was beefing with that day. Nothing interesting. And I kept basically I have my college career, chronic board, which for good in our bed, I just, I read it and I was like, this is awful. Um, when I graduated from college, I deleted that blog and I was like, I'm going to start something new. And I go to blog spot, fire up this new blog called the lovies random rants. And I was talking about all things, pop culture, television, anything I felt like talking about, but not myself anymore. So that's how blogging for me started. And uh, it basically took on a life of its own.

Speaker 1:          00:02:52       And you were born in Africa, grew up in Chicago.

Speaker 3:          00:02:56       Yeah. So I was born in Nigeria and uh, when I was nine,

Speaker 1:          00:03:01       you guys shouting from Nigeria,

Speaker 3:          00:03:04       right? Nigeria. So, um, we moved to Chicago when I was nine and nobody told me we were moving. I thought we were going on vacation. And then I started school and I was like, oh, this means we're staying. Oh. Um, and it was a big culture shock for me because I went from never having to be the new girl. Like my best friend was the niece of the person who owned the private school. I went to add, been going to high school since I was two. So walking in the room and see people who didn't look like me and having to reintroduce myself and basically take on a new persona was a huge shock to my system. But yeah, I had this accent too. Well, no, not this accident actually. I had a major Nigerian accent and uh, I ended up having to, I lost it consciously by mimicking my classmates. Right. And like trying to repeat what they were saying and how they were saying it. And then by high school my accident was mostly gone.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       Right. Yeah. She thinks it's gone anyway.

Speaker 3:          00:04:06       Right. You're like, I'm, no, I hear it. I just said we're Nigerian. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:10       So do you think that experience of sort of being a transplant at nine years old and uh, being different, um, informs some of who you are and, and your ability to sort of stand outside of things and you know, tell it like it is, is that, is that part of why you, you

Speaker 3:          00:04:29       well yeah. So the tell it like it is in this, that is me is my Nigerian is and its true essence. Like Nigerians were not a great filter and people, okay we're not the ones who were like, Oh let me like make sure I coded in all types of Nice things. We just say, well we did, we feel like if you come to like my family dinner, we spent the whole time laughing at each other. Like somebody would walk in wearing a sweater that's not cute. It's about, and somebody will always be like, why do you have that online? It's just how we function. And I'm in my writing. My writing is essentially who I am in real life in, in Prince and because I want people who know me to read my work and be like, okay, I actually hear her voice. That's exactly her. So how I write very much translates to who I am.

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       That's interesting. And uh, in your youth from like nine through high school and things like that, did you, were you extroverted class clown? Like do you feel like, you know, before in the pre blogging, pre college years, like what was that like for you?

Speaker 3:          00:05:31       I have been the class clown forever. Um, this person that you see is who I was in high school. Like my, I still have the same friends that did in high school and we were just a goofy group of people will be in the hallway just acting the fool or you know, I'm playing spades in the lunchroom and just spend all time laughing and basically my group of friends are a really good reflection who I am. Like, you think I'm funny? You come to Brunch with us and you'll be in tears because none of them have behavior or sense. So it's just how I've been and being able to have it translate to my writing has been great because literally I, um, have these friends who've known me for 20 years and people were like, oh, how did you find your voice? And I was like, do you see them? That's me. Hmm. So it's not even a matter of me having to find my voice. Um, it's me just grown it up. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:25       So you went to University of Illinois? Yes. And I love how she drops like 13 years. Like that's a long time in tech and stuff like that. But you know, way before you got there, uh, the web browser was invented there. Internet explorer. Yes. Yeah. Most of them were very proud of that. Knowing. Yeah. My wife went to school there too. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:06:46       It's, it's one of the things they tell you, what are you going to orientation? And they were like, at Illinois we invented, I was like, impressive. I will come here. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       Cool. This has changed everything for me. I must be here. Yes. And did you got into blogging Wallet College and so yeah, like do you think that's how you had access? Like how did you even come to do that?

Speaker 3:          00:07:09       Um, so I, I've always liked just computers. I took my computer type classes in school. I was the person who actually took an excel class for fun. Um, so for me, I've always kind of seen the value of computers and um, all of these types of software. But I was also the person who started infusing social media into the work that I was doing. Like I've been an early adopter of most platforms and I'm, blogging was just another thing that I was kind of an early adopter. I, because when I started blogging it was just playing on the Internet. Um, so, but I was doing it because I thought it was fine. Um, how I've been approaching technology since I had to go to the library to go to, to get my email. My first email account was a hotmail account and I think it was like vet bet at hotmail, but then when we had AOL and you know, so I've been through, I've seen the evolution of the Internet grow and has been really cool, but I've always found it valuable. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       So that first phase you said you were sort of blogging your college experience, but then you deleted the whole thing. Yeah. Um, do you still have a copy or? I do. Okay. And so many fans and Google cache. No, I'm just kidding. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:08:27       Oh yeah, no. Like I had Comic Sans Font and everything and it was like, it was just awful.

Speaker 1:          00:08:31       And it's not up online right now?

Speaker 3:          00:08:33       No. Okay. I think I like, I actually was like, okay, legit deleted. But before I deleted the blog, I like copied and paste every single, every single post. It's a word document in the word document was giant because it's three years of me in college being a fool, being like, oh, this is my roommate. I didn't really like her that time.

Speaker 1:          00:08:50       So That's interesting because you're so out there and so vulnerable, honest about things. Have you posted things that you regret or go back and delete or edit? Like what's it like having that out there? Cause these days, once you put something out there, it's out there. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:09:07       Um, well so here's the thing is my blogging for so long. Um, the good and the bad thing is it chronicles your growth as a human being and as a thought. It's somebody who thinks about the world and so things that there are things that I wrote in 2009, but I would never write today cause I vehemently disagree with myself. I'm done. I'm like, no, that was wrong. You shouldn't. But some of those things, I keep it up to remind myself where I came from and who I was in that moment. And the like, even thinking about high school essays that I won, I won like two major essay contest in high school writing an essay on, um, whether people should receive reparations. And my stance was, no, you didn't do that. Why do you get reparations and I one essay contest and I read the essay and I was like, God, that's terrible. No. So, but it's, it's really good to still have the record of who you were because you see how you've grown, how you've changed, how your thought has changed. College changed everything about my politics and, and how I look at the world at large. So who I was before college is completely different from who I am now in terms of my beliefs.

Speaker 1:          00:10:12       And I guess how much of what you do do you do for yourself and how much do you do for others? You know, it sounds like

Speaker 3:          00:10:20       bit of both. A little bit of both. I try to do most of it for myself. I think that's why you're so appealing. Well, because my whole thing is, okay, I'm one, I'm not writing an echo chamber. So the idea that I'm just writing for myself is false, but I am writer because if I don't write the words kind of stay with me. So like I'm the person who's, who's taken a nap on the plane writing blog posts too at the same time, which is completely weird. But I wake up with an entire post in my head already and I'm just like, ah, okay, cool. Um, so in that way I'm writing for myself but also I'm writing for people to consume it and um, hopefully change hearts and minds cause I'm also not trying to write, um, to preach to the choir all the time cause it's like at that point what's the point? So it's a combination.

Speaker 1:          00:11:06       So you're an early technology adopter. Yeah. Early on. Blogspot early with blogging. Um, are you keeping up? Like where are you at on vlogging? Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, you know, like is it, are there enough hours in the day? Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:11:22       No, there are not enough hours in the day and I'm, I'm officially getting filling like the Odi and tech because

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       13 years,

Speaker 3:          00:11:29       14 years come on veteran. But, um, there are certain platforms I cannot get with even though I've tried and I'm a digital strategist and I can see the value in them, but me personally, me, myself, and I personally, I have a trouble, I'm infusing it into my daily snapchat is one of them. I have tried you guys snapchat. Here's the thing that I have a problem with generation in millennials and generation social media, which I'm a very firm part of is we feel like everything we do is interesting and it's not, it's not like people all spend all day on snapchat tell you exactly what they did in every moment of their day. And I, I'll log in to snapshot and I was black. You know what? Today's the day I'm going to give it a try and I'm going to scroll through and people are walking to the bus like, yes, I'm walking to the bus.

Speaker 3:          00:12:18       Dot. Okay. And, and, and the filters are killing me softly. You guys like the filters, the flower filter, the face. I'm just like, why does everybody look like a cartoon right now? So I have a snapchat account, but I log into it like once a month and I think I've snapchat at twice total. And I do actually have on snapchat double life because I'm in these random rooms that I call myself Forrest Gump. I do all of these interesting things. That's you totally right. Like can you believe it? But it's like, you know what, catch me on Instagram, catch me on Twitter. I'm on there. Catch me on Facebook to add snapchat towards a catch a moment by moment. Thing of my day is just a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       Yeah. And what about vlogging or youtube or

Speaker 3:          00:13:04       I have actively rejected you to why I have job. I said it had Google. Um, I've, I've, I've made it a point not to be on youtube because I did. I don't like the community.

Speaker 1:          00:13:21       Well, this is something I wanted to talk about because social media has tons of upside. It is part of why you're here today and part of why we know about you, but it's also a place where there's a lot of hate and a lot of misinformation. Yep. And filter bubble. And I want to talk about that experience. So, you know, we're heartbroken. You've rejected youtube wholesale. Most of the people who aren't here today are working on that and fixing it as we speak. So we'd like you to give it a try, uh, tomorrow or next week. Um, but you know, what a, is your experience both good and bad if you've been trolled, have you been doxed have you been, you know, harmed by social media personally, and how do we, how should we as owners of, uh, some of the services that people use, think about what we can do to, without getting into censorship and sort of, you know, repressing people's feelings. How do we create safe environments for, for people?

Speaker 3:          00:14:18       So, okay. So my decision to not do youtube has been one because I hate editing stuff. And again, I don't want to just meet me talk. You're lazy is the easiest part of it. Oh, absolutely. But then the second part is I hate the community on there because that community is so full of hate because at one point it was where you can actually comment anonymously. Yup. And what that spurs his keyboard courage of people who decide that since they are a number in a system, they can say whatever they want as opposed to be, it'd being attached to their name. So a lot of my friends are youtube stars and like people who've their following on youtube, like Francesca Ramsey. Um, and I used to see the comments they would get all day, every day and to avoid the comments they would have to sit there and moderating it either themselves, which of course triggers all types of like trauma and um, or they just actively just be like, I threw up a video.

Speaker 3:          00:15:09       I just never go back into my comments section. And for me, the power of the Internet is connecting with people and I think that's really important. So I was like, you know what, I'm a writer. I prefer to write, I'll be riding. Y'all catch me there. I don't want to do videos yet. Um, and I know youtube started fixing some of that. I was never really recruited to come back into the fold. Um, consider this an invitation, an invitation, come back into the fall. Like I was using my Vimeo channel because I was like, you know what, I need store some video somewhere. So I just didn't feel like youtube is a place now in terms of the hate online in trolling. So as a black woman, as a woman is one as a black person is another, as a black woman is another. Um, the type of feedback that we get on social media is completely different from everyone else.

Speaker 3:          00:15:55       So this was tested out by, people aren't on Twitter actually, where they did like a week where they change. They exchanged uh, avatars. So black women and white men decides to do this experiment and exchange avatars and see how the difference in your Avatar affects how the responses you get are. And the white men who had the black woman avatars for the week were stunned by the type of vitriol they got for simple stuff that they were saying. For me as, um, aside I sources and the professional shader, I am lucky to not receive some of the hate that a lot of people get. Cause here's the thing, I can beat you at that game. Like, I've spent all my life being shady, I could do this. But um, I've been fortunate with the trolls are afraid of you is the trolls don't come at me as much as they come in to other people.

Speaker 3:          00:16:46       I will say that. Um, but one thing that I've loved about my social media platforms is people saying that my community was reflects me, which is king compliment. Um, on no matter where I am on the Internet, I like to keep my spaces clear, full of hate and free of hate and as safe as a space that you can get in a public domain. So my audience is also very protective of the spaces that I've created. So if any type of hate creeps through, they handle it before I even get there because they understand that this is one of the few places you can go and actually read the comments. So how everyone else tells you never read the comments. You want to read the comments on my post, on my Facebook or my Twitter on anywhere that I am, because my audience is super smart, super thoughtful, and they've managed to maintain a space that is actually good and it shows the best of humanity as opposed to the rest of the Internet, which kind of shows awfulness. So I want to talk about filter bubble. This contract you mentioned you don't just like to preach to the choir,

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       right? That's part of what you do, but you also want to reach people and um, change people's minds. Um, this morning my wife showed me a site called friends who like trump.com. I don't know if you've seen this, but it actually exposes your Facebook friends who've actually liked Trump. So I did a bit of unfriending this morning. I can only, I'm proud to say out of a thousand or so friends I had eight. And um, you know, most of whom I either didn't know who they were or, uh, hadn't spoken to them in 30 years. I did grow up in Michigan, which can have little pockets of, you know, purple state sort of. Um, but uh, I did ask myself, you know, um, am I perpetuating this filter bubble? Is My feed now going to be filled with stuff that I already believe and uh, am I not getting exposure? Should I be, should I have had more curiosity? Is like why on earth would people I know support a candidate who I, let's just say I can't get behind who was a walking Cheetos. You can say

Speaker 3:          00:18:58       the worst. Um, okay, so here's the thing. I tell people off jump like my social media platforms are not democracies there. Dictatorships, I will delete our block, our report as spam, as at, at will. Okay. And feel no guilt about it because here's the thing is that's not a filter I really even want to be a part of, to be like clearing your space of Trump supporters who, that was one of the few things that I draw the line. It's like, oh, we can't be friends off jump. Okay. Like there's no conversation here. You support him because supporting him means you support and tolerate hate and misogyny and Islamophobia and antisemitism and anti woman. And it's just anti every thing that is not straight white male and it's a problem. So you deleted those people. I don't think it's necessarily creating a filter bubble because here's the thing, what do you learn from them besides what you already know, which is that hate does exist in the world. And even educated people who are somewhat sensible and logical can still tolerate awful things and people who perpetuate that. And I don't have the capacity to even do that. Like I don't, I am not a, um, mediator. I'm not the person you walk up to just like, oh my God, let me see both sides. Oh No. I'm very much biased about everything. So yeah. I've

Speaker 1:          00:20:22       heard you talk about the difference between journalism and writing. Yeah. You consider yourself a writer and it sort of speaks to this a biased and proud sort of attitude you have. Can you talk a little bit, you know, uh, we, we at Google we have things like Google news and even our search results, we work very hard to make them fair and uh, talk about journalism versus writing and not only the role you have in that spectrum, but where should Google said it? Should we be opinionated or,

Speaker 3:          00:20:54       um, so I do call myself a writer and not a journalist because I feel like as a journalist you do have to maintain some level of like what objectivity and just be like, you know what, I'm not always going to choose sides. I don't know how to do that. I'm the person who can't write. I can't write anything but op eds I can give you, but there'll be fact base. So for me, I give myself the responsibility of making sure I'm double checking to make sure I'm not passing on fake news, making sure that my opinion is based on some fact that I heard. So that is important. Um, as a company, I understand if Google wants to maintain like neutral ground, so it shows both sides. But then as a person of opinion, and I think as a leader in all things, Google might need to one day step up and say, actually this is the, this is the lane that we pick.

Speaker 3:          00:21:49       Like if somebody goes into Google and, um, wants to find a way to join a hate group, I feel like it should be a little bit more difficult for them to find it, you know, to find that type of information because essentially you can serve up the information to them on a platter and be like, just because we're being impartial, but what does that do for the world? And how does that impact, um, what the betterness of the world. And I think Google is a company that cares about that in some way. Sort of make it that easy. I feel like it would be a mistake.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       Yup. The people that aren't working on youtube or thinking about that, right. But it is, I mean, you look at Google, it's pretty clear we have a very diverse workforce. Um, just looking out at the audience. Um, I'm kidding.

Speaker 2:          00:22:34       He was like, I'm shit.

Speaker 1:          00:22:39       I wish this was representative of our workforce. Unfortunately this is a

Speaker 2:          00:22:44       virus.

Speaker 1:          00:22:47       So, um, but we are working on it. Uh, I think, you know, we have, we're very much in a listening and learning mode and as we try to address this, like any, uh, any advice on that front, how do we actually create the people who are creating these products? How can they more represent the world and the audiences?

Speaker 3:          00:23:10       Google and other tech companies have got to start trying harder, even harder than you are now.

Speaker 2:          00:23:17       Because here's the thing is I think, I feel

Speaker 3:          00:23:19       like every company needs to reflect the world as it is for the greater good of that company too. Because more diverse voices in the room, your product is going to be even better because you're getting all types of, you would be like, have you thought about this? That doesn't work. What about this? And I think it's in your best interest to get you some more color, get you some more people of different backgrounds who can be in a room and be like, okay, this is what I think. And then get shut out by their coworkers who are white. Um, you know, like even recently I was reading an article about how the women in the White House and the Obama administration have, have formed like this bold tron when, when they're in meetings, if one woman says an idea, another woman repeats it and then somebody else repeats it, who's a woman, just so the idea is not given to a man.

Speaker 3:          00:24:07       Cause we'd been enough rooms where we say something and everyone's like, eh. And then the dude says it and they were like, great idea. You like word. Like I didn't just say that four times. So in that type of a way, I think I'm tech companies need to one, if not even necessarily, um, them having a conscious bias to be like, I'm just only going to hire white people. That's not it. We tend to engage with people who are in close proximity with us. People who look like us, who are like in our immediate circles. So those are the people we end up, uh, tell him they have job opportunities and those people end up, I'm basically applying what needs to happen is the very pointed and focused attempt to go outside of that proximity. Like go to places where you haven't been asked people who don't look like Doug's executive team and honestly get some black void, your executive team to y'all need that.

Speaker 3:          00:24:56       Um, but I think it's a, it's a process that needs to start now and people need to be very, uh, very prioritizing the about it. Like it shouldn't be one of the things I was like, if it happens, it happens. It needs to be like a focus. Yeah. Because in what, 2030 or 2040, there's going to be no ethic majority in the, in the country. So it behooves Google and Facebook and Twitter and all of them. Apple, like everybody needs to start making it a point to fine. And it's not a quarter system. It's not you being like, well we need more black people. We need for Latinos, for Asians. No, you want to find people who qualify and they're out there. Like people say, I can't find black techies, I can't find Latino techies. There are Twitter lists of people who have 500 best says black techies at the top. So we're out here where we exist and be,

Speaker 1:          00:25:46       we do have some competence in search, so we ought to be,

Speaker 3:          00:25:50       oh, okay. Like Google is like the search Kane of the entire universe. Okay. Not even an earth. They're probably aliens is using Google. Um, so you have no excuse not to be able to find and find the people who are good. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:26:05       Cool. Um, so you have the spirit of uh, putting us on the spot. Yeah. Me In particular, I want to share something you recently wrote another day, another Hashtag white people, you gotta get to work now about the killings of black people by law enforcement. You say white people, I'm talking to you. This is your problem to fix. Y'All got some work to do because the system that y'all keep on privileging from, you've got to help us dismantle it because those of us who are black and Brown, we have tried, you created this robot in it is yours to deactivate my skin. Folk don't have the passcode. This is your monster to slay word. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:26:51       So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:26:53       for those of us that agree, where do we start? How do we become better at helping slay the monster?

Speaker 3:          00:27:02       Yeah, you got to slay the dragon man. Um, it's a multistep process and I think it comes from we can change policy all day everyday, but if policy is changed, but the hearts of the people who are in these spaces when force it don't, nothing happens. So the, the, the real deep belief that it is the job of white people to fix racism. Because if we could have fixed it by now, we would have done it. And we have tried. So one listening, um, I've seen enough conversations where people are like, here's how I felt when this issue happened. And somebody walks in and be like, well, maybe you're just looking at it the wrong way. I was telling you how I thought about it, but here you are trying to argue me down about my opinion and my feelings, which feelings are valid. So one, listening to when these things happen, a lot of times people will say, you know, I don't know what else to say at this point is getting even worse if you don't know what to say.

Speaker 3:          00:28:01       Amplify the voices of those who do. So you know, lending your platform to people who are able to say, you know what, this is how it's affected me. This is what I think we need to do. So Linda, your platforms, the black and brown voices, I also think people need to put their money where their hearts are. People have money. Silicone valley has money at the minimum. Help donate to antiracist organisations and people who are actively doing the work to fix it. People who need the resources and you will need to get in the room. Um, that's important. And then some of us have all these platforms to speak up, speak up. Um, use it. Cause here's the thing, I don't have a job. Okay. Have them say something. Nobody's going to be like love you, you're fired. So it is in my best interest to use my voice because I don't have anything to lose there.

Speaker 3:          00:28:51       Um, and also one thing that we need to do because it's like right here it's lowest common denominator is our friends and our family members when they say hateful things about people who are not in our group who are marginalized, it is, we have to say something and you know, you know what we do when we see some stupid stuff and Facebook will like scroll and we'll like scroll past and roll eyes and be like, Oh I hate the fact that they just said that but we never confronted. So that person thinks it's okay. So even across the dinner table when somebody is saying something hateful, it is in that moment. You have to let them know you can't tolerate it because that means if you let it happen and you say nothing, you are saying it is fine, it should happen. Just like that huffing and puffing is not enough actively being like, hey, that's actually not an okay statement, here's why you're wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:29:40       Um, and I wrote that piece a lot of actually got a lot of notes and in the two weeks afterwards from people who've been like, I've actually taken that on. One of my friends emailed me and said, um, her husband's father always says something racist every time. And he just scrolls past it and shakes his head and Facebook and he's like, ah. That irritates me. After I wrote that piece, his father puts him like racist joke up and he sends him a three paragraph email about how that was not okay. And she was like, I just want to say thank you because he told me to let you know that the reason he did he did that was because he read your piece. And he realized that he can't be quiet anymore about it. So even small things, we don't all have to start a nonprofit organizations. We don't have to be the ones marching, but we can do stuff in our everyday lives that actually can move the needle just a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:30:27       Yeah, I really, that was, that was some amazing practical advice. I wasn't actually expecting, expecting that much actionable stuff that I think all of us can do in this room, in this company and in this world. Um, I know for me one of the challenges was sort of, um, coming to grips with how much I had to learn. And for me, a lot of it was really in taking this unconscious bias training where I sort of walked in their sleepwalking walking, like, you know, uh, not expecting to be rattled or shaken by what happened. But what was really revealed was a lot of the societal conditioning that had sort of, even me, a good guy who's trying, you know, to be part of the solution. There's a lot of deep work we have to do. Right. Um, that, you know, it was very humbling in a lot of ways.

Speaker 1:          00:31:19       It sort of like the last thing I wanted to do once that part of me was out there was sort of um, get up and pretend to be part of the solution when I understood I was part of the problem. Right. And I think the answer is sort of both. You know, like, um, when I first started really concentrating my team on some issues around diversity and inclusion, um, I reached out to a friend of mine who's been doing this work for really 30 plus years and she was sort of like, welcome to the conversation, you know, it was um, um, people, there are professionals, you know, there are people who have spent careers and lifetimes thinking about these problems and you know, I know a lot of us are waking up for the moment, for the first time, but it's important to sort of plug in. And I think your suggestion even didn't just give resource, whether that's money, time, technology platforms to those people who are professionals and have actually spent a lifetime thinking about some of these things. Is really important for those of us that are quickly catching up. So

Speaker 3:          00:32:24       I mean, I think part of the thing is, you know, when you start talking about race and you start talking about like responsibility of white people, a lot of times people feel accused like they're personally the ones who are being racist. But here's thing that people have to understand is privilege. No matter what it is your privilege is, you know, like I have a bunch of privileges, I have class privilege, I have a sexual orientation privilege, I have gender identity, privilege, um, religion, privileged. So I, there's certain things that I need to understand that in all of these systems because I am a part of it and I benefit from it, I am a part of the problem. And it's not a loving, you did this one thing that was wrong to this person. It's, you are part of the system that even though you might not have contributed personally to, you still have to help fix it because you're in a position where you can influence stuff and you can, I can be in a room where, um, I am one of the, um, I'm going to assume that most people knew are Christians and that gives me a safe space to talk about my religion.

Speaker 3:          00:33:29       But if somebody is there who's Muslim and they feel like they're, they're not safe because they're in this space, it's my job as somebody who is of the majority group to make them feel comfortable and welcome. Like I can't just be like, well, it's not my fault cause I don't really, I ain't say nothing bad about Muslims today. So last night I ain't got nothing to do with me know, like, so I think it's really important to use it privileges, um, to basically help marginalized people. And also part of what we start learning about privilege and our space and the space that we take up in the world, um, is that we are lucky one, we've done nothing to be in these spaces a lot of times. Like I was born Christian, I was, I've never been poor. Um, so for me it's like, okay, I can't take credit for that.

Speaker 3:          00:34:13       I can't do like, well, you know, I earned it. I didn't, I didn't, it gave me a lot of things that I worked for him. But also you have to unlearn a lot of things like you, you realize that we've been programmed so well. Then in the process of fixing it means you have to unlearn stuff as in dump that out your head. That is not what the world is really about. And that's the really hard part of unlearning everything you've known for the right way for how many years you've been on this earth. So you just kinda gotta commit to it. It's not going to be easy. It's an ego is a drop kick to your ego when you realize you're part of the problem. It is, it's like damn, I didn't know I was that person. You are now, now that you know that you are that person, how do you not become that person? How do you make sure somebody else would not hurt by your personhood? And uh, once the night she wrote about in my book was um, has, I want to hear it. You heard about the privilege exercise.

Speaker 3:          00:35:05       I feel like every company in Silicone Valley, actually every company in general needs to make this happen. So the privilege exercise changed my life and how I looked at the world and I was a counseling center paraprofessional when I was in college, trained, um, to be a peer counselor. But the whole first semester was us learning about who we are and the space we take up. And literally we spent a whole six months talking about ourselves and who we are unpacking them. So one thing we did with the privilege exercise, so everyone starts in the same line. Okay, you started the same line and they make a statement, you the step forward, a step back. So a statement would be something like step forward. If you've never had to worry about somebody in mispronouncing your name, people step forward, step back if you've never worried about, if you've, if you sometimes worried about where your next meal is coming from, somebody steps back, you know, step up if you can marry the person you love.

Speaker 3:          00:36:00       So it's a series of questions. Sometimes it's like 20 questions, sometimes it's 50 at the end of the privilege exercise they say stop and look around the room and see where you are in relation to other people. So sometimes I found myself for more higher to the front than I actually imagined I would be and some of my classmates in the back. And I was like, wow, you're behind me. And it gives you the perspective of understanding like, okay, so the privilege exercise, you get to actually get to figure out, wow, I'm behind a lot of people. I never would have thought that or I'm actually way luckier than I thought I was. And it teaches you about who the people you're around are and also some of their struggles because some of my classmates who are white girls were behind me. And I was like, I wonder why.

Speaker 3:          00:36:48       So we got to unpack it. I feel like it's really important for companies to do this cause give your employees a chance to understand where they are in the world and what they fit in. Because sometimes in these rooms, the people of color, the people who are different January to LGBT people might not feel like they have room to even step up and say something to you because they might get shut down. And the people who were saying things never understand that they take up a lot of room all the time and don't give them for other people. So it's a way to kind of recalibrate and get folks to understand that I might need to either shut up more, wanting to step up more, or I need to like advocate for more people or I need to be the one that's like advocating for myself more. I think it will be good for Google to do it for a couple of people. Wow,

Speaker 1:          00:37:34       that's a great exercise. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:37:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:37:39       What I want to do. We've got a couple of mics up here and we do want to make this interactive. So as you think of your questions, while you're doing that, I want to invite lovey too. If you're willing and open to it. Maybe read a section of your book, do a little reading for us. Yes,

Speaker 3:          00:37:54       I can do a reading and I'm trying to figure out, should I do one for, okay. So my, my book is, is a broken up into four sections. Live culture, social media and fame. Now each section, so the life is like full of shenanigans. The culture section I talk about like racism, homophobia, religion, social media section. I'm talking about Hashtag I hate your hashtag abuse. Uh, Facebook is my favorite soap opera. A dumbed down news. How does succeed in business failure? Real g's move in silence. So what section would you like me to read from? Okay, Gotcha. All right, let's do it. That was pretty unanimous. All right. So I actually just basically give you a run down in the, uh, let's see. I think I'll do religion.

Speaker 2:          00:38:49       Uh, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:38:54       I have a chapter on rape culture and here I'd just be, I went in, uh, I'm trying to see what I haven't touched on. Privilege. Racism. Okay. So

Speaker 2:          00:39:10       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:39:11       I wrote my, a piece of my racism sec chapter while I was, while it was like a week after the Charleston shooting and it was that night a church had been set on fire in South Carolina and I was, uh, moved to right cause I was just like so angry.

Speaker 2:          00:39:32       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:39:36       In Charleston, South Carolina, a small Bible study group was praying to the Lord and otherwise uneventful. Wednesday at Emanuel Ame Church, the oldest black church in the south, a white supremacist walked in and pretending to want to pray with them and then pull the gun out and murdered nine black worshipers in cold blood. It an invasion of a place of refuge, of violation of a little safe space and definitive proof that there is still a war on black people in America. Nowhere is safe for us and the work that has been done over half a century to get us closer to equality has regressed. And it feels like we're back to where we started and now another one of our churches is burning and this was 2005 Americans treat and black people like vermin and it's hard not to feel like we're unwanted, unsafe. It's open season on black people in that was not some lone gunman who walked into manual Amie.

Speaker 3:          00:40:21       He represents the ongoing commitment to keep us in our place of violent reminder that we are not safe, we're not safe in the streets, in our homes at the park or at church, and I'm fucked up about it because this was supposed to be history, not the present. And I feel the anger from the top of my head is reverberates down to my toes. This rage makes my skin burn. I feel the fire in my bones. This is racist men. It's worse, it's ugly, demented and vile. It's also permeates every fiber of what the United States is made of and it's what's build the foundation of this country.

Speaker 2:          00:40:51       Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:40:52       It's truly exhausted and I'm not sure if I'm thankful for the undeniable proof that racism is still around us or wishful for the days when we could be tricked into thinking things were not so bad, but racism is not just random individuals burning churches and black people being gunned down the street is a system of oppression that is so deep and omnipresent that it seeps into every single aspect of our lives and it is as American as Apple Pie. Drizzle with canned cheese, top of French fries, the red stripes on the flag. I really the blood of black and brown people in many centuries after the country's creation, these stains still have not faded. And let's pause here to say the racism in America is a stupid as hell. Racism and prejudice anywhere is dumber, but it makes no sense because it's just absurd. The United States of America is a country founded on the labor and literal bodies of black and brown people who are minding their own business.

Speaker 3:          00:41:42       Well, white folks came forth to kill an exploit them. This is a place that was discovered by a dude who didn't know how to read a map. So he just showed up on some short thought. He was in India and then proceeds a plant a flag and go, Tada. Know what Christopher Columbus needed was a compass and a clue for being aggressively mediocre. But he has a federal holiday in his honor. He showed up on someone else's property and claimed it as his because he didn't know what it was. This country started off all the way wrong and continued in the same fashion. Okay. I feel like Chris need a Google maps. Okay, like you in the wrong place or this is not India hot mess and we celebrate hill. We celebrate him. This is the, this is so American.

Speaker 3:          00:42:30       And then Chris, lot of native Americans wiping out a whole, whole tries. Pillaging the people in called the Thanksgiving and then to add to the mess, the Dude Bros realized that he didn't have the ability to build dope shit on their own. So they went to African capture. Black people are them, brought them here to be their slaves after killing millions on the journey here. Because if you want to out terrible yourself, you stuck millions of human beings inside ships, refuse to feed them, let them lie in their home field and then let them die in droves. So not only did you steal someone else's home and then killed them when they showed you kindness, you went elsewhere and then did some more steel in this time of actual people, you forced them to come to your stolen has to do your work for you. I mean, you're welcome for this too long.

Speaker 3:          00:43:12       Didn't read version of parallelism in America, but this is why I should teach. Okay? I wouldn't do any worse than current textbooks like the ones in Texas. They use the words workers instead of slaves in the section about the transatlantic slave trade, they call them workers as if black people were at a career fair in Africa where we submitted resumes and asked to be beaten and starved and have our families broken in exchange for a journey across the ocean with no money. Like this is not linkedin. Why we're not workers. Okay. So my point is that the United States does not have a legitimate history of integrity and fairness. It's been run by villains that make Disney's look like saints. Racism is not a byproduct as much as it's the foundational stock in the American soup. And this is why black people are still fighting to be recognized in our food for humanity is success of the country has been based on our oppression. So of course it is forever fresh out of dam to give it by black lives and we are left agree for those. We've lost the grubby hands of white supremacy. We rage about the perpetual cycle of mourning we find ourselves in and we wonder what we need to do to be secure in our own skins.

Speaker 4:          00:44:18       Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:44:27       Powerful ideas but also powerful writing. I was really, thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       Okay. Questions from you? We have to mix up there. Googlers aren't shy usually, right? Don't be shy. I have a lot of practice. We have this event called Tgi F, which we hold on Thursday. Of course. Um, and uh, we, we have these mics up there and people are always asking, our founders in leadership are pretty much anything calling, telling it like it is. It is a great tradition. So questions.

Speaker 3:          00:44:57       Thank you. So first queen, just want to honor you and thank you for existing and being here. Jay, share and help lift us all up. Also on acknowledge. I wish this room was completely full because you deserve all of the 60,000 Googlers listening to you. Um, so there's that. But actually do have a question. My question is as Google works on trying to continue to diversify, so we actually have people working here that reflect the people we serve around the world. How can we also change the culture so people are allowing us to be ourselves? I feel like what you said earlier about speaking straight, not padding things, a lot of sugar, it really resonated with me. I think one of the things I find hardest to be here is that I need to put so much sugar on the front and the backend. I can't even call it a sticker sandwich.

Speaker 3:          00:45:48       It's like a cake. So how can we as a people and as allies help people understand that it's not the same lens. You can't bring in all these different cultures, Africans, African Americans, Latinos, Filipinos, um, anyone who's not white and expect us to act white and a company that is majorily white. So communication is cultural. That's one thing that I think a lot of people of color struggle with and companies like this communication is cultural for me. I'm a very direct person. If I need to send you an email, I'm going to be like, Hey, what's up? So here's what I need from you. People prefer, hey, so I hope your day was going well. I was wondering if you could possibly do this for me. Who has that time? Why gotta like layered it with 1500 can I just get to the point? And then people were like, well, you were kind of short and email because I asked you a question as opposed to like went through a three paragraph diatribe about how you doing girl wandering or how was your weekend?

Speaker 3:          00:46:54       Honestly, people need to understand that different communications, um, skills and different ways people talk. And email is not an affront to you as a person. Like if I was to send you a two paragraph email because I am on the go, that's not me being short with you. That's me being on the go. And I think a lot of black will end up being the on the go type style and their coworkers and the bean. Like I felt like that was very short of you. Honestly, there needs to be a little bit more um, people, he's got their feelings. That's important. Get out your feelings as a coworker. Like somebody sends you an email in the, you're like, you know what? I felt kind of short. You can ask him, be like, hey are you okay? As opposed to like I hear a lot of passive aggressive stuff happening.

Speaker 3:          00:47:37       People get out your feelings. If I sent you a two paragraph, two sentence email cause I need something, it doesn't mean I don't want to know how well you're doing. It means in that moment it's quick. So I think Google might want to do some more, a different communication styles. Oh, you know the one thing that helps, okay, so this is website called 16 personalities.com that allows you to do a personality test and if you work closely with any team, have everybody on the team do this personality test, it'll break it down and be like, okay, so you'll tell you exactly how that person who sits next to you communicates their, the person who is always on the go, they're very direct there. Like it'll, it'll even break it down to the commander did the command at the diplomat of the mediator. That helps too for you to understand how your coworkers like to receive information, how they pass it on to. It is not a front to you learn who you're like working next to and then as opposed to people having, it's like temporary and they put them in sugar cakes. Who has time? You guys, come on, let's do my work and send less emails. That's also important. Stop email people for everything. Jesus.

Speaker 5:          00:48:40       I think part of the problem, we're all commanders.

Speaker 3:          00:48:44       What happens if one commander is like, Oh man, I just got commanded too hard.

Speaker 5:          00:48:50       Okay. Another question. Uh, so lovey again, just to mimic a Sarah, uh, her, some of her comments, uh, just thank you for coming here and making time for us. I'm not playing here, so my name's Howard and I think, um, I'd be really curious to hear about. So there's various domains of types of work that we could be doing right to kind of fight institutionalized racism and, um, kind of address the racial climate in general in this country. And you know, so you can send emails, you can protest, you can strategize about policy change, you can mentor, you can kind of just be a, even just a shoulder for folks to crying, you know, cry on and mourn. And so there's all this diversity, different things that we could be doing right. And I think society kind of, um, conditions us to, to maybe want to do some things more than others because maybe some of these things might be more risky or challenging, for instance.

Speaker 5:          00:49:40       So, for example, for many of us maybe protesting and getting pepper sprayed in the eyes, it's kind of like, ah, I don't want to do that. Um, but like maybe if you say like, I can volunteer at, you know, an Oakland impact hub. Sure. I'll do that. That sounds reasonable. Right. Um, given the problems that we have given how minimal amount of, uh, of the workers there are for us, you know, to address the problems, what would you say is like the, the most, the, the most important, I guess prioritize domain of type of work that we really need to focus on in order to get shit done, right? Like there's, there's tiny different things we can do and I love the approach of like, oh, just like way your talents and gifts and whatever. Like you're really good at it. That's what she's doing,

Speaker 3:          00:50:23       I think. I think there's no one thing to do. It needs to be a mortal layered approach. Knowing what you're good at and where you can fit in though makes a difference. So I already know I'm not going to be the person on the front line getting pepper sprayed out. I'm not about that life. I give props to the people who are my job in this movement. If anything is to tell the stories and right. I'm just not built for that. And which means like the people who do that are actively putting their bodies on the line and for them it is. We owe them to make sure they're supported and the work that they're doing is not in vain because if their stand on these front lines getting pepper sprayed, it better be for a reason and we better be working to make sure that doesn't keep happening to them.

Speaker 3:          00:51:04       So it means if your job is to write policy, you are the policy person. Yes. Make sure that people who are the who are in Capitol Hill are changing laws. If your job is to tell stories, tell these stories and make sure people are understanding what's happening in these streets. What's really happening now with the media is reporting. If your job is, if you just have so much money, you don't know what to do with it, give it to some of these people who can then turn that money into something concrete. So it really comes down to you don't have to force yourself to do something that's outside the realm of your interest, your passion, what you're good at, whatever that is, you could find a way that's going to help. So again, find what it is, where you fit in that place and do it and kick ass in that way.

Speaker 3:          00:51:45       So I already know I'm not built for the life of being on the front lines little, okay. I know I wouldn't even make it. I am not built for it. So yeah, like you have to support in whatever way, you know how as opposed to you being like, well I have to be the person that that no you don't. They're amazing people. Like uh, black youth project 100 which I have to give a shout out too. If you want to know some organizations who are doing amazing work, who are making sure the Chicago Police Department is actually been held accountable. There's black youth project 100 there's dream defenders. There is Assata's daughters, so these are people who you can be giving your money to, who will show where the money's going. Yeah. Okay. Yes, please. Good morning. Thank you so much for being here today. When I saw it on the calendar, you're going to be here.

Speaker 3:          00:52:33       I got super excited because my book clubs when talking about your book for the last month, so thank you for being here. Yeah. My question to you is how do you get over that first step of fear? I feel like people will have voices, they want to say something. But as you alluded to earlier, maybe you don't want to say it at work, we're losing your job or changing in your world and your friends becoming different, and how do you get over that, that sense of fear that you have, that you feel like you should be saying something you want to, but you're worried that you're going to let go of in the process. Um, fears, one of those things that fear itself will cripple you from doing whatever it is. And then when you do it and push past it, you understand that you were more afraid of the theme then how it really was.

Speaker 3:          00:53:13       So here's the thing. There are oftentimes when I write a piece that I'll be like, oh my gosh, am I sure I want to publish this? And I'll sit on it. I hesitate on it. But every single time I press publish, the response I get, lets me know, yes, you're supposed to do that. Because here's the thing, as a person who was thinking about that thing that you want to talk about, that scary, you're probably not the only person thinking about it. You are probably amongst people who are also afraid to say the same thing, but sometimes all it needs is that one person to cut through to be like, Hey, I feel like this is wrong, or I feel like this is, and then you'll see the people who buy. Finally somebody said it, okay, I come back her up now. I think it just comes down to push it past and if it's important enough for you, say it, you know you can, you can put it in the sugar cake if that makes it fine in that meeting, but making sure that point is made because a lot of times people do the things that they don't even realize a harp harmful or they don't understand what damage is doing and they just need to be called on it to be like, oh, I didn't even know.

Speaker 3:          00:54:13       Okay, you right. You might have to be the scape goat. You just be like, I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it because this is how I feel. This is a valid thing to do and I feel like it would actually push this conversation forward. She's got to do it. It's not going to be like less scary. You don't have to like, ah, I'm scared shitless, but I'm doing anyway. Okay guys, I don't think this is a good idea and even just doing that, you just have to power through it. Like it. Thank you. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:38       Okay. I can see we have more questions. I think this is the way we're going to do this. I'm unfortunately, we're out of time and I know that there are people who need to set up this for lunch. This is also our lunch room. Um, so, uh, we'll take one more question and she's here. That's what I was going to say is we're going to feed her and show her a Google bike and a little bit of a tour. So, um, those of you who want to, I think it's okay with you if a, we have a little private time with you by the side of the stage afterwards, but we'll do one more formal question and then, uh, we'll hand this room back over. So, uh, one more question please.

Speaker 6:          00:55:15       Hi. I first wanted to say thank you. I'm not quite sure what I'm thanking you for it, but thank you. Um, and then I'm not sure if I have a question or a statement that's two quick things. Um, first you talked about diversity and Google. Um, I received a question from a friend of mine who said, you work at Google. How did you get that job? And I was just absolutely amazed because I said I applied. Um, and um, I will say that I'm a high school dropout, never been to college, never taken any technical courses, left high school in 11th grade. But I have enough confidence to say I'm good, I'm intelligent. I applied. But I think it's a statement is that I think Google needs to give people permission to apply. I think we need to do more reaching out to people and say, Hey, I don't care if you're this, I don't care if you're that applied.

Speaker 6:          00:56:11       We can't just wait for people to come to us. Um, because they'll say, that's Google. They don't want me, I'm not good enough. Um, so any advice that you have for Google and all the people who are working on diversity, I think that would be great because everybody goes, how did you get a job there? And I would love for people that feel that they are confident enough to at least look at least try because all you can be told is no. Um, and the other thing is you were talking about racism and I have been just feeling helpless, um, and watching all of the protests and getting excited about the Justice Department saying, um, we're going to take this, uh, shooting of this innocent or not so innocent black person. And then it turns out that the Justice Department doesn't, you know, the case doesn't go through. They're not charged.

Speaker 6:          00:56:57       And I'm a ranter, which I'm doing now instead of asking a question. Um, but I had been posting on Facebook about the fact that people sit on the courthouse steps and say, this is not gonna work. We have to do something about it. And we see Beyonce and we see snoop Dogg and we see, I'll sharpen all of these activists and they're saying, this is not good. We have to stop this. But then they step back and then they go back to their everyday lives because they have this feeling of helplessness and they don't know what to do next. So a couple of weeks ago, I gathered a bunch of friends that I work with from a design company and we did this great big, um, like ideation, brainstorm on what we could do because in my eyes, it has to start within the police department, right? It can't be the police, it can't be the lawyers that can't be the district attorneys.

Speaker 6:          00:57:43       It has to be the police department to Pat, you know, to go pass that Blue Line of silence and start telling the other police officers, you know what? I'm not going to testify on your behalf. You are wrong. You shouldn't have done that. And I feel like it has to start with from within, but I don't know what to do next. We've got a bunch of ideations. We talked about redesigning the s, the, um, pullover and all of these things, but we're now trying to figure out how to reach other people and how to use our voices and making this great big movement that says it has to start from within the police department. Right. I watched this up an episode of, um, God, I can't remember the show. Tay Diggs is in it. Um, I can't remember the name of it, but he shot a black guy.

Speaker 6:          00:58:32       They couldn't find the gun, but his partner told him the next day, you know what? I talked to the captain and I backed you up. And it wasn't true. And that was just an example of what happens instead of them saying, no, he was wrong and I'm not going to stand by him. So we're trying to figure out ways to do that in any advice so that I can take it to the next step where it's not just a meeting of people who go back to their normal lives and say, oh, we met but I don't know what to do next.

Speaker 3:          00:59:00       Um, the first question of how, so there's is something that feels very inaccessible about working at Google. It feels like aspiration as opposed to a reachable thing. So a lot of people don't even know it's an option for them because they use think people who work at Google happened to get it like a magic golden ticket and they showed up. They, they're like, oh my god, work at Google. It sounds like a legend. Like, Oh man, it's like Charlie Wonka's chocolate factory. Cause I mean this place is a mess. What gas slides? Um, I think Google needs to do a better job of making sure that people understand that they actually have a chance to work at Google. And they're not just like engineers who are, who get coding things and they're like, oh, you can be a coder. You actually have people do social things at Google.

Speaker 3:          00:59:46       I think Google needs to actually make it more accessible so whether you have people go into more colleges who were like, Yo, you don't have to be a hyper geek engineer to work at Google. You can actually apply for like the events coordinator job or the admin assistant in job or if you are in stem you can apply for a job in strategy in coding, so I'm not sure why what you guys are doing but you might want to do that. I know y'all don't throw a post on indeed or linkedin but that might help but it actually would help if people knew that they could get a job at Google and it wasn't some like pie in the sky thing mission to apply.

Speaker 1:          01:00:23       We are doing a lot of that. I want to just give a shout out to the team. I actually met with them yesterday and we have a lot of work to do but there are people at Google. Part of it is just making sure we are aware, people are right, like mountain view is a little bit like Disneyland in a lot of ways. And you know, we have a great big world out there and Google, uh, is fortunate enough to have offices in a lot of places and we have to do a lot more outreach, a lot more inviting, a lot more welcoming. And I know that there are teams of people at Google working on that. So,

Speaker 3:          01:00:57       and I also have to like give Google props because here's the thing, like I know you're constantly being told to do better because you should, but the fact that your leadership is taking it on as an actual thing, not just because you are getting your week's gnashed about it matters. I think it's really good to see people at the top who are saying like, okay, help us figure out what to do. We realized we need to do better so we are we going to do better? So I have to say props for that because the trickle effect is real, right? Because the leadership didn't care. Nothing's going to change. So I just want to say perhaps you you for that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:34       Red. Okay. On that note,

Speaker 2:          01:01:37       did he just blocks? So no,

Speaker 1:          01:01:42       behalf of everyone here and Google. Thank you. Not only for coming and visiting us, but the work you do everyday, putting yourself out there, it makes a difference. Whom we're very grateful. Thank you. Okay.
