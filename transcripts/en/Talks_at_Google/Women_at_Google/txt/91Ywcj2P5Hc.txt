Speaker 1:          00:05          So my name is Vanessa Foxo Lockin. Um, but I write under the pen name Sam Blake. Um, and that's with a very good reason that it's, Natalia is just discovered, oh, Lochlan is quite hard name to pronounce. Um, and obviously it's a very long name and to fit it onto the cover of a book would be a bit of a challenge. Um, so when I started writing my agent and I sat down and we had a little think about it, um, we wanted to work at a name that would work internationally. Um, so now I'm Sam Blake, but I'm here today as both with both hats on. I'm here as Vanessa and I'm here a sound like, um, because I started writing, I'm originally in 1999. Um, I don't know how many of you guys maybe have always felt like maybe you wanted to write a book. I think a lot of people do.

Speaker 1:          00:44          And I was one of those people and I really had that sort of, always had that feeling since I was quite small load. Really. I'd write, I read, I read huge amount. And, um, I sat down, my husband won't say literally went sailing across the Atlantic in 1999 for eight weeks, and I was at home and my own, um, long, dark winter evenings cause it was November. And, um, I had an idea for a book and I sat down and started writing yet, and this is back a long time ago before I could even use a computer. So I was writing it out longhand. Um, and I've just started really working in a job where I was starting to learn to use a computer. It makes me sound like a total dinosaur. I know, and I were in here and Google of all places. Um, but uh, started writing long hands.

Speaker 1:          01:24          It was going into the office, the evenings on the weekends to write it up. And, um, it was a book called the poison tree. Um, and it features a detective. Um, I'm quite lucky that my husband and fat works the Guardian, so I have an access into sort of the police side of things, um, and how that whole world works. And, um, I had this idea, so I literally just started writing and obviously thought cause you do when it's your first book and I've actually all your books that it was amazing because you just, you'll, I think, I think one of the key things about writing is that you need to be optimistic and you need to be positive. Um, and you have to believe in your book because if you don't believe in your book, who else is going to believe in it. Um, and so obviously thought it was fantastic, finished it and sent it out.

Speaker 1:          02:06          Made the first absolute cardinal error when it comes to writing a book. Literally put the last full stop down and then started sending it out. And I sent it everywhere. I sent it to agents and publishers all over the world and it was rejected by everybody all over the world. Um, and I, but I didn't, it didn't really put me off. I kept going. Um, I had an idea for a second book and so while it was out there being rejected, um, I kept going, okay. Writing, I'm Stephen King talks about in his book on writing about his rejection because rejection is one of those things that happens in writing. Um, it happens a lot in life obviously, but it particularly happens in writing. Um, and Steve Martin King talks about putting all his rejection slips on a nail above his desk in his book. I didn't click keep mine, I didn't collect them.

Speaker 1:          02:50          I didn't want to keep that negative energy in one place. Um, so I have them scattered all around the house and I remember doing a workshop a few years later and somebody held up a slip at the firm. One of the Irish publishing has, I've got one of those, just one of those add to the collection. Um, but I kept going, kept writing. Um, and I suppose one of the things I knew I needed to do was improve and get better and learn the techniques of fiction writing, which are really, really important. Um, I don't think I really knew that there were techniques when I started writing. Um, I knew we all learn English in school. I did a degree in history. You know, I've written creatively for school essays and my a levels, I think my a level essay was about bees. Um, and so, you know, you think you can do it and you read, obviously everybody reads.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Um, so you keep on going. But I didn't really realize that actually there were things that will actually make the fiction better. And I did a workshop down in dingle with a lady called Judy Parsons. And that workshop really helped me hugely because it really proved to me that I could write and people, you know, my peers and other writers. So yeah, actually you do know what you're doing. Um, but it also showed me what I didn't know and how much I needed to improve and how much I needed to learn. Um, and that's really how inkwell came about and probably how I got to where I am now. Um, so I set up, I wanted to do workshops, I wanted to do on, to do more workshops. The weekend the Judy Parsons, as I say, was down in dingle. And to get there I had to fly.

Speaker 1:          04:14          My parents are from the UK. I had two small children, then I had to do, you know, frozen stuff in the fridge. I had still the notes, the whole lot. So it was a major operation getting away and that really wasn't an option. And with my husband working shifts, I couldn't get out to an evening class. So I was looking at this problem, you know, I need you to learn how to write. Could 20 classes, what would I do? I decided I'd start my own. So I got in touch with a friend of mine who's a writer and said, look, I've had this idea, you know, there must be other people out there that want to do one day intensive fiction writing workshops. And um, she put me in touch with some authors. Um, and cause I was working in event management at the time.

Speaker 1:          04:50          I was able to sort of bring all those skills into play and I set up something called Inkwell, which started off literally as one day workshops. Um, and my original plan was to do workshops on a Saturday because that's when you're free and almost people are free and uh, all day. And they would just be once a month and they would be just once a month during the winter because my kids are off during summer. And obviously, and analogy, we have very long school holidays. So I wanted to make sure these, I mean, these workshops were absolutely, completely geared to me that will gear to me learning how to, to write better. Um, and it turned out once I got them up and running and I found a hotel and I got my, my methods sorted out. Um, because I think it's really important when you are learning anything and when you're doing that type, you're in that type of environment, um, that you bond with the person who is speaking.

Speaker 1:          05:34          So I always made sure that I had two speakers at every workshop. Um, because if you don't bond with one of those people, it can ruin the day for you. And so for me, it's very important to get that mix. So I, I got my mix working and it turned out that I wasn't the only person in this situation, but actually an awful lot of other people wanted to do the same thing. Um, and inkwell became hugely successful. I bought a huge network. I had people coming from Switzerland and India. I had people coming from the UK obviously cause it's nice and close, um, to come to these workshops. Um, I used always use bestselling authors because I'm a great believer that, you know, you don't, you don't lick it off of stone. If you get to be best seller, there's a good reason for it.

Speaker 1:          06:10          Um, and so that's really how inkwell started. Um, and all the while I was doing the workshops, obviously I was learning how to write that in myself. I think I've probably sat through more workshops and most people living because I've been to the mall and I sit in the back taking notes. Um, I kept going and then I discovered that the writing dot I eat domain was available. And um, I thought this is great. I have this newsletter that I was sending out to my inquiry people, main core writers, and in each newsletter that went out, I talk about competitions and festivals and different things that are happening and what was going on in the writing world. And every single time I sent it, literally I press send somebody, get it, and they go, oh, did you know about this one? Did you know about this?

Speaker 1:          06:48          I'd literally get three or four emails straight back saying, well, did you know about these? And I didn't. And I thought, well, if I'm the person who's supposed to be trying to coordinate this information and I don't know what's going on, then how's anybody else out in the country know what's going on? Um, and there was really, at that point, there was no central point for literary information in Ireland. Even though we are this amazing, literally nation, we've got Mann Booker winners. We've got Nobel laureates where a fantastic story telling nation. Um, but the wasn't that central point. So I've discovered the writing dot age and was available and literally put ink on newsletter into a website and created writing dot. A um, it's still going. It's an online magazine. We update daily with information. It's got features in it. It's got, um, competitions. Just everything really, me as an aspiring writer wanted to learn and wants to know about, has gone into writing.

Speaker 1:          07:35          Dot. Hey you now. Um, and I, I love meeting writers and then saying, you know, I read writing a tie. It still amazes me. Um, maze may amaze me. We don't know. Ryan told me that he was, he goes there every morning and his wife has to tell them to get off it. That's, that's real reward. Um, so while all these things are going on, um, one of the things that was happening with inkwell was that obviously the recession hit island, um, and literally the bottom fell out of my business overnight. So the workshop side of the business completely collapsed. Um, there were quite a high end. They weren't cheap. And, um, you know, it was one of those moments for anybody who's worked in a small business will know that you, you're, there are moments when I think in venture capitalism they call it pivoting, but it's that moment where you go, it's not working.

Speaker 1:          08:18          We need to think, rethink this. And so one of the things that happened literally that night when I realized there was no more business, um, was that I looked at all the things I'd been doing. Um, and the works or something, giving him the things that we're really working in the company. Um, and one of the things that was working was the scouting side of bit. Um, I had built lots of relationships with publishers, lots of relationships with the editors. Um, and all the way along the line I was meeting new authors and we had new manuscripts and I was really enjoying reading them, but I also discovered the most quite good at spotting the successful ones. And so I was sending them out to the publishers and they were getting published. I will send them out to agents and they were getting picked up. And so basically I formalized that side of the business.

Speaker 1:          08:57          I could see that's where we needed to go. So, um, I became literally scout. I formalized the arrangements with various agents that I work with in the UK. Um, I bought on board a whole load of different authors from different genres, um, who were able to give people, readers reports. One of the things that happened to me through this process was that I'd met an editor and um, she quite liked like the work that I was, the book that I was writing all the time and it was probably a book number three at that stage. And um, I, she'd given, she sent it out to her readers and those readers had given me feedback on my work and that there was enormously useful. Um, one of the problems of being a writer, it's very easy as a scout to read somebody's work and be able to see exactly what you need to do with it.

Speaker 1:          09:37          There was an editor at that, I say easy. It isn't easy, but you know, you're, you can see what needs fixing with your own work. You can't see it at all. You can't see it. It's so bizarre. I think it's because when you write, you have the images in your head and my job is to take the images from my head and turn them into words and the page, they were forming images in your head. But because I can see the picture, I might have forgotten to tell you that, you know, Fred blogs that just walked in the back door, then you've got one leg, cause I know he's only got one leg, but if I haven't put it on the page, you can't see it. So that from a writer's perspective, um, is a tricky one. Um, so raw writers need is people to help is to people to read their work.

Speaker 1:          10:15          And so I have a lot of authors now who worked for me who do what we call readers reports. So they will read a finished book and they will look at the plot development and the character development, all of those important things and help an author move it along and bring up to the next level. Um, so that's sort of the, how the publishing consultancy side grew literally as a result of the, of the bottom falling out of the business. Um, and is now very successful. Um, and really the literary scouting side is what brought me on. So while I'm building the businesses, um, and doing these various bits and pieces, I kept writing. Um, and I think it's absolutely essential for people. Um, or for everybody. I mean, the literal, the best advice I was ever given was just keep writing. Um, signing Beckett said, you know, fail, fail better, just keep on failing.

Speaker 1:          10:56          And that's, and I think that's what it's all about. It's that it's, it's improving and improving, improving. Malcolm Gladwell talks about 10,000 hours, you know, that you need to hit that 10,000 hours in order to reach the tipping point. Um, and that is so true and it's true in writing as much as it is in everything else. Um, so I kept going, I was busy writing away and I, one morning I had coffee or something, coffee with one of the agents I work with in London and um, he just, we found a book, I'd found a book, sent it to him and he sold it for a lot of money. And, um, he was very successful agent and we were sitting down having a little cup of coffee and common garden and I had a book with me on the counter and was put by a friend of mine.

Speaker 1:          11:38          Could Alex Barclay, it was proof copy of one of her books and he saw, you know, you're reading Alex Barky. I said, well, yeah, she's been really influential on my writing because in fact this is a trade secret. I completely stolen. I'm Alex [inaudible] system of plotting and planning because she hasn't worked out and I literally have taken, she taught me how to do it and like that's what I use. So, um, he said, oh, you know, you're, you're, you're eating her. And I said, yeah, very inflection. And he went, Oh, do you? Right. And somewhere in the midst of things, one of the things I think certainly for me, um, and probably for the people that wear lots of different hats and different businesses is that it's quite difficult field to understand what you do. Um, so sometimes I'm industry consultants, sometimes I'm a website managing person, sometimes I'm an author and I'm also the chair of Irish pen and I'm, I do lots of different things.

Speaker 1:          12:24          And this Simon Cohen, who is my agent now hadn't grasped obviously the bit, the most important bit, which was the writing. So he said to me, what you're working on? And I said, well, I'm working on this book. It's called, uh, it wasn't called the, the little bones, then it's called the dressmaker. And, um, it's about the bones were baby turning up in the, of her wedding dress and the detector who has to find out what happens. And he went, oh, I'd like to see that. And I had one of those moments, the total paralysis, because this is this massive agent in London. He's works for a huge company. There are Hollywood talent agency. And, um, he wants to see my writing, which sounds amazing, brilliant opportunity. But then as a scout, I'm thinking if I sent him my work and he absolutely hates it, I completely shot myself in the foot.

Speaker 1:          13:09          I mean, it's, you know, what happens if it's a disaster? It's like, okay, yes, I can find on people's advice. You can't write myself a, but I'm under this illusion that perhaps I can. So I had one of those moments of like, oh my God, literally. But fortunately there was, we had a happy ending. Um, because when you did like it, I read it, the book right the way through the next day. And I'm getting emails saying, you know, when you're sending it, when you're sending it. And then she did send it and thank God he did like it. And even better, he was able to sell it, which is also a bonus. So the first book came out in, I've now forgotten the year 2016 I think, um, little bones. Um, and that is the story of the baby's bones in the head with a hammer wedding dress.

Speaker 1:          13:46          Um, and that story really came about because I'm, Stephen came towards him, his book on writing, which for anybody who is interested in writing and, um, you know, wants to go that way. It's absolutely the Bible. It is the best book possibly ever written on writing. It's fantastic. And every single published author I know has it on their shelf. Um, so in, in that book he talks about great story being the collision of two unrelated ideas, how he talks about how with books, how to completely separate ideas came together and creates the new idea created story. Um, and that's really what happened to me with little bones. I'd seen an rt documentary years ago, um, about, um, a serving girl or girl who, who I thought was a serving girl has turned out she works in a rubber factory. And I went to go do the investigation who had left Ireland in the 1930s and she'd gone to the UK because she was pregnant and she wants to hide the pregnancy.

Speaker 1:          14:37          And um, she found herself we're living in the landlady's house or working in a factory and you know, unable to cope the situation. And what happened to her was that she actually had the baby in the middle of the night in a room that she shared with the 12 year old daughter if her landlady. Um, and obviously you can imagine the state she was in. Um, she went to the bathroom, sort herself out and when she came back, the baby wasn't breathing. So she wrapped the baby up. I now know in a blue dress, cause I went to find all the, the court details and she put the baby into a suitcase and put it in under her bed and went back to Ireland a Christmas. It was just before Christmas, went back to Ireland or Christmas to talk to her priest. And in that time that she was away, the baby's body was discovered and she was one of the last people to be convicted of infanticide in the UK.

Speaker 1:          15:23          And for some reason this just, I call them light bulb moments when you are, when you see something or you hear something or you know, you can be as TESCO's looking at some of these basket or overhear something on the train and you get this little light bulb moment thinking that's really interesting and that this thing stuck with me, the baby, the suitcase under the bed. And then I was driving back from the airports. Then a few 10 years later, I think possibly, and I was put on the radio and Artie has documentary about, um, a chap who had written a play called the country, a dressmaker. And his play was one of the, one of the places saved the Abbey Theater from, from, um, total disaster. And he had died. He was a very, very successful playwright, but he died destitute, um, in an apartment, a little room up in cable street in Dublin.

Speaker 1:          16:08          Um, and what he'd done is he'd left all his plays in a suitcase on his bed and there was a suitcase as the connection in my mind. Um, and this is a few years ago now when I started working on it before they built the m 50, and they were, I think, 32 sets of traffic lights between my house in the airport. So it was a long drive. And on that long drive, by the time I got home, I had been thinking about dresses, had been thinking about dressmakers, been thinking about unplanned pregnancies, and I'd come up with the idea that perhaps, um, the girl, Mable, Agnes Regan, I think her name was in, uh, in England. The one thing she wanted was that was a wedding dress. And so by the time I arrived home, the bones were in the hem of the wedding dress. Now I didn't know until I was two thirds the way through that book, how they actually got there.

Speaker 1:          16:53          I knew they were in there, had a really clear impression of it. I had the people starting to map sketch, sketch out in my head. Um, but I didn't really know how they got there at all. And it wasn't until I started writing a piece of witness testimony in the book, um, that I realized and I remember emailing it's Barkley Pet Dallas market, I know why the bones are in the wedding dress. And she's like, yes. And it's funny when you write crime you have to plot to a certain extent, you have to plan to a certain extent because of all the things that you know, plots are quite twisted for any of you have read no turning back, which is the most recent sand lake. Um, it's quite a complex plot. There's two or three different storylines going on in there and making sure that those things dovetail together and that the right bits, the left and the right places as part of that plotting process.

Speaker 1:          17:37          Um, and as I say, I've stolen Alix, Barclays system of plotting. So I use this columns across the page and make my notes in it as I go along. But often with writing and most importantly with writing is allowing the characters to breed on age and allowing them to speak to you. And when they do, when they take over the story and when they start to do things that you don't necessarily expect that some stories really, really happening. And that's what happens in little bones. And I found out about the bones and in fact to no turning back the ending of know Talia bridger lending know no turning back. There's totally different, there was a different, everything was different about it and um, it doesn't feel quite right. Um, I'm a great believer that your, when you write, you're using your subconscious mind. And I remember Joseph icon over at an event I was at was talking about, um, how the character sort of float in the ether above your head a bit.

Speaker 1:          18:28          And as a writer you're sort of channeling them. It's a very strange process. Um, but it is a bit like that. It's like they're all actually out there that every book, every character and every book is actually floating around out there somewhere and they're just waiting to find the person to channel through to tell their story. Um, and so certainly was finding when you find cat colony, the detective, um, she came to me pretty much fully formed kickboxing detective and with the various stories, you, your subconscious mind is the thing that really works and if you're going wrong or, um, people talk about writer's block a lot, I really believe that writer's block is your subconscious mind putting the brakes on. Um, and certainly in my second book, which is got in deep water, I got stuck writing that about two thirds of the way through, even though I had my plot, worked out, my plans and all the rest of it.

Speaker 1:          19:16          And, um, I realized I had gone wrong. And then when I went back to fix the bit that got where I'd gone wrong, I realized I'd actually gone wrong earlier than that even. So there were two twists in it, the were wrong. Um, and I think it's understanding that is really important. So for anybody who is writing, um, and does find that they get stuck, um, there's usually a very good reason for it. As I was coming in here on the dark this morning, I've just started a new book and it's about Sentara stuff happening in London and I've just realized that the, um, the reason that's not working as us as something a bit offer, I haven't been able to work out what it was. And I think I've got my chemistry wrong. So I was texting my daughter on the train coming in and saying, do you know anybody who's good at chemistry?

Speaker 1:          19:54          I need to check on me chemicals. Um, so that's that. I think that's really, really important element to understand. But at one of the key things, one of the key things with writing I suppose with anything in life, um, is to just embrace it, enjoy it and try and try certainly for new writers to get to the end of the manuscript, it's, it's really, really important to try and write that first draft right the way through to the end. Because very often, and this is sort of I suppose the scouts end of things speaking, um, the first three chapters of the manuscript on really the first three chapters of the book. They're not the first two chapters. The, you, the reader will necessarily see, um, because it takes a while to get into the story. And so it can quite often it can be, especially with a new writer, it can take a while for you to get into the store.

Speaker 1:          20:36          And I know certainly little bones, um, had a whole long prologue. There's a bit, it's now, there's one paragraph in the, in the start, a little bones in the first chapter. Uh, we're an artist called [inaudible]. He talks about this piece of work that she's working on and her family and things like that. And that was the prologue, but that was two and a half thousand words. Um, but it was something I needed to write to find my way into the story. Um, but it wasn't something that you necessarily all needed to read. So that has ended up now down as one paragraph, but it's just very interesting. One of the absolute crucial things I suppose to understand but also to know as a writer is that it's the reshaping and the rewriting of the manuscript, which is the bit that makes it happen. Um, once you get the story down, you lay it down, it can be a bit of a muddle.

Speaker 1:          21:19          It can be a mess, bits cannot work. Um, but it's really, um, it's that reshaping, it's the editing. It's the, the rewriting that is absolutely crucial to making it into something that people want to read. So how are we doing for time in Italia that we were good. We, um, so I suppose one of the key things as well, um, in terms of crime writing it's plot. Um, but at the same time, this character, which is absolutely essential unless you have good characters, why would you want to read on? Um, so plot plot is very, very important. Coming. Those two unrelated ideas, um, are, are absolutely essential to try and bring them together. Um, but, but story is all about character and you need to be able to empathize and really love that character in order to want to read the story. Because as an author, I'm asking you not only as part with your cash to buy my book, but I'm asking you to part with that sort of six or seven hours of your time.

Speaker 1:          22:14          Um, and that's an important contract. So in order to deliver a story and to deliver, um, something that makes you want to keep turning those pages, um, character is absolutely vital. And understanding your characters and knowing them as really, really important. Um, and characters change, they develop, they can develop while you're writing the book. Um, I was blessed with cat colony because she came fully formed. And one of the things about writing theories is that it's, when you go back to the next story, it's a bit like going to meet your friends in the pub because you know them so well, you know what they're going to say and sort of the, the cost if you like, is already there. So it's a bit like writing a Sitcom, isn't it, where you know everybody already and then you just have to apply the story. Um, so writing a series is fantastic from a writer's point of view because you couldn't really get into the sort of the plotting end of things.

Speaker 1:          22:58          And I think, I'm hoping I get better with each book and I think no turning back is probably one of the best so far. Um, but literally book I've just written, um, and hopefully will be coming out towards the end of this year or early next year. Um, it's a whole new cast as a standalone. And, um, so that meant a whole new set of characters, a whole new story. Um, it's about two women who meet our plane, um, and discover that they have men in their lives who aren't doing everything they should for them, um, and that they can help each other out a bit, um, to right the wrongs. Um, and that's a whole new, whole new set of people. Um, and again, it's, it's, it's developing those people. It's getting to know them. It's knowing their background and names where they come from, all of the things that make you, you.

Speaker 1:          23:40          Um, and I think for anybody who's writing, I always think one of those, you know, when you meet somebody for the first time and you form where we talk about psychologists, so it's about where do you form an opinion in the first 30 seconds of meeting somebody, what does it do you see? You maybe see the, hey, you see what color jumper they're wearing. You might make assumptions about them from their footwear, Sherlock Holmes fanatic, but he was always looking at people's shoes. Um, and they're the impressions that you form with character. So it's very important when certainly for me as a writer, um, to get a feel for those characters, to know what they look like. I use storyboards and, um, I go around the Internet and I go to magazines. I find pictures of the characters, the people who look like the people who are in my head.

Speaker 1:          24:19          Um, and they can come from all sorts of strange places. The sample poor guy from New York who's on Tinder and I not, not where I used to enter subsea. I'm happily married, but I'm who I found on the search who is the spirit of one of my characters in the next book. So he's up there too, so they can come from anywhere and they're just, there's just like a private reference point for me. Um, and I find that really useful. Particular, I suppose, cause I'm busy because I'm working and I'm doing the various bits and pieces with the, um, running quell and helping you rice all the time. Um, and moving around a lot. Um, I don't, I, I don't get to write every single day. I mean biters talk about writing every day and that that's really important, but it's not always feasible. Um, I try and write as often as I can and try and stay in the story, but I find storyboards are really useful for me because I've got a visual representation of who everybody is and I stick that I have make up a big a three one.

Speaker 1:          25:06          And it's partly as procrastination because I think as an author, when you start off with a story and you've got this big blank thing in front of you, you spend a lot of time not actually writing anything and just knowing that you should be doing something. But anyway, I spent a lot of time at historicals and I put them on my desk and that means that those characters are calling out to me. So whenever, wherever else I'm doing that, those people are there looking at me and I'm literally saying, come tell my story. Um, and I really, really, I find those that are really, really useful part of the process. Um, so we've, where we go to questions

Speaker 2:          25:38          perspective or an unpublished writer, everything looks really, really bad. Uh, so the first question is like, how do you actually stop writing? Because every time you're finished vizio draft it Kinda looks good, but then you read a book, like you read a really good book and you look at your draft and it's awful. You start writing again, it never stops. You sent it to an editor at Detroit, gives you back the comments you've worked on Samhsa trust looks good, but then you look again at it in a month's time. It's awful again. And the second question is, uh, given first, right and like everyone a thrust frightened is soft. It's, it's fine. Like y'all need to improve and work on what, what do you do with your first trust to just touch them off to you? Like is there any reason to self publish those? Is there any uh, reason to send them to magazines or whatever? Like what do you do? Visit first draft that you know, there are like in your head like, so sorry, your children, you've walked in down force such a long time. What do we do with them? How do you give them up?

Speaker 1:          26:40          I think the first thing is to try and work on your book, um, until you can't see anything else wrong with that. So you got to a point, yes, because that is the whole point. The whole process is that every time you go back and you see something else you want to fix, so keep working on it. And it might be a long process. I mean, I said I started writing in 1999. Um, it took me 15 years now to actually get a deal. Now it was five bucks later. Um, but um, it was a long time. Um, and the best advice I was ever given was just keep writing and you only get better. Going back to Malcolm Gladwell, you only get better through writing and you only find your voice through writing. Writing, I'm also publishing is always looking for what's called voice unique voice.

Speaker 1:          27:19          Um, we don't need another J K Rowling. It doesn't mean we don't need another swab. We'd love to have another deck here early and a lot of the Stephen King but didn't, I mean we've already got one so we don't need another one. So finding your voice and your unique voice is really important and you only do that literally through putting words on the page. Um, so in terms of drafts, the rewriting is vital. That polishing process is vital. I think you have to just keep on going until you cannot see anything else that needs to be changed. When you get to the point where you just don't know what else you can do to it to make it better. And that can be a long, long time. It could be 10 drafts later. I mean I'm, I'm on what book published book for now. I'm just, I've just finished, I'm onto the next one.

Speaker 1:          27:57          I've written probably four or five complete books before that. So I'm looking at having written nine books of 100,000 words each and I still on the book I have to sent in its draft six. So it's, so that drafting process is vital all the way through. Um, so when you get to the point where you can't say anymore, you don't know what else to do to it, then then the opportunity then as an option to get professional help and see if you can get somebody like an editor to read it and try and improve it. If you get to the point then where you think it's, it's done, it's ready to go, it's at that point, then send it out. Absolute is publishers to agents and see how you get on with it. The thing with self publishing, self publishing is wonderful because you can actually find, you can get out there, you can get books out there, those drafts.

Speaker 1:          28:41          At the end of the day, there's an awful lot of writers in the world and there are only so many books that can be published. Um, and so there's always going to be more writers than there are people with the capacity to publish. So I think self publishing is amazing. I know some people who have been incredibly successful at it. The key is that you need to see it as a job, um, and approach it very professionally and understand that the marketing and the editing and the cover needs to be to professional standards because you're competing with, you know, published books out there on the shelf. So it's all about learning that whole process. Um, so self publishing is great. Yes, absolutely. If you send it out and you can't land an agent and you can't land a publishing deal with it necessarily, absolutely self published, I sell probably one of my books, I wrote a romance and in Romancey there wasn't really crime, sort of dark romancey thing called true colors.

Speaker 1:          29:26          And um, I'd had that had another agent long, long time ago and she sent it out and I got what we call rave rejections. Self published the wall, everybody, cause I'm ready for rejections where somebody, they love your book. Um, but nobody can find a place fresh or they can't, they're not actually quite in a position to buy it even though they love it. And, um, I felt that that was a great book and I decided and I'll get out there and to see, you know, absolutely self publish it too. Um, so there's, and there's different these days, there are different routes for writers, so you can be a hybrid, right? You can do both. Um, so absolutely send it out, work on it till you can not see any more things that can be improved then get professional help, then send it out. If it's still not jelling with that particular book, then absolutely look at self publishing it.

Speaker 1:          30:11          The key was self publishing is that again, as I say, you're, you're competing with the publish books that are out there. So it needs to be of the highest possible standard that you can get it. Um, and you can't take back negative reviews. You know, if it goes out on Amazon and you know, there's, we haven't had a proof read and there's masters of Typos in it, somebody's going to tell you and you can't change that. So it's really important to be as professional as you can about it. Um, but it's an exciting world. I think as, as one of the most exciting things about writing is the fact that, you know, you can do anything, you don't know where it's going to take you. Um, publishing's always looking for something original that's looking for a new voice. It's looking for a new concept. Um, they're looking for authors, Debbie authors that they can build, they can put marketing behind.

Speaker 1:          30:54          Um, and you know, to break you out. So they're looking at was for what's called a breakout book, which is a big story if you can, if you can do that. And sometimes I think it's important for people to understand it. Sometimes it isn't your first book that gets published quite often. Your first book is that learning ground. You know, it's, you know, if we started, um, the back to the 10,000 hours, I'm, a friend of mine has a great analogy when she talks about playing football and how you guys all learned, we all learned football in school and, you know, people go out, you know, kids go out and they kick a ball around on the green, outside the house, put the jumpers down for goalposts. Um, but none of those people expect to go and play out play for AC Milan and the next morning. You know, and I think one of the things with writing, certainly all the things I did with that first book way back when, was that when you write, you think it's going to be the book, it's fantastic and it's amazing and that you're going to be out there playing for AC Milan.

Speaker 1:          31:42          But it's that learning process that takes time and you're doing all the right things if you're keeping redrafting and you're doing absolutely all the right things. So just have to keep on going. Just keep writing the best advice. I have a quick question about your writing process. Um, would you usually write every day for force yourself to write everyday or would you perhaps wait for when you're inspired and would you also wrote in the right order or would you maybe write a random dialogue for example? I think that's a really good question actually because I'm, I'm a really organized person and I need to write in a linear fashion. So I have to start at the beginning of the book. And end at the end. Um, other friends of mine don't write that at that at all. I don't know how they do rich, but they are obviously their minds work in a completely different way.

Speaker 1:          32:28          And they would write like a scene. Like if they suddenly want to write a fight scene, they'd write that from the end and then something else from the beginning and then they put it all together. Um, I, I use tool called scrivener and quite a lot of authors use scrubbing up and to collect the bits together. I actually just use it for my research so that I can put stuff into files and then find them again. Um, and um, so if you do write in that out of order way, then that can be a really useful tool. Um, personally I write in a very linear fashion, um, and I do try and write every day, but it doesn't always happen. Um, I think about, I think you think about your book all the time when you're working on it. So, like I was saying, coming out in the dark, I wasn't actually writing, but I was doing some, I was plotting in my head, I was thinking trying to work out where I was going with the story.

Speaker 1:          33:11          Um, and I think as a writer it's always there with you and it needs to be always there with you. I remember somebody emailed me once and, um, long, long time ago, and she said, Oh yeah, I'm going on holiday so I'm going to take, you know, I won't be taking the book. I won't be able to work on that because I'm going on holiday. And I thought, well, if you're a writer, you write all the time. I drive my family marriage cause I write on holiday and I, it's my thing. I love, it's the thing I love to do most. And um, so I, yeah, so I sit there, I get up at six o'clock in the morning when I'm on holiday and that to me it's a couple of hours typing away as the thing to do. Um, yeah. So I try and write everyday. If I'm not writing every day, I um, I'm thinking about it when you're under deadline is different and should, one of the key, I suppose one of the crucial things is that when you don't have a contract, when you're an unpublished writer as I was, you have the luxury of time and it's really difficult to recognize that because you're desperate to get published in a desperate to get the deal.

Speaker 1:          34:01          But you have the absolute luxury of time you can spend as long as it takes and make that book the best that it can be. If it's not that book, it might be the next book or the next book, the next book, but that, that you've got all the time in the world to do that. When you get under contract and you something get deadlines and you suddenly find that actually your, your you've written book won. Cause that was fine that you have that written and then all of a sudden you've got to write book too. Um, and then you've got to come up with an idea for book three and then you might be launching. What happened to me was I was launching book too, and trying to finish book three at the same time. Um, and suddenly you might have to write, I had to write 30,000 words in nine days, wants to get book three finishers as partly what they end and had to be completely rewritten.

Speaker 1:          34:40          But, um, you, you just, it's a whole different world. So I think enjoy that time. And um, yeah, so when I'm under contract and when, when you're an entrepreneur, you're under deadline. It's much more every day it's like this is the thing I've got to do. Um, and it actually, it helps if you're in the zone and you can stay and it's much more than trying to write bits and pieces, but you do train yourself. I think you train yourself to write, to suit your lifestyle. So, um, I wrote at least 2000 words and one of the books on plane to Frankfurt Book Fair, um, leaves here at what, seven o'clock in the morning. So it was, it was an early start. And, um, you know, I've written on trains, I write and cafes, I write everywhere and noise doesn't bother me. One of the things I do do is I have a sour, tend to have a soundtrack for each book.

Speaker 1:          35:25          So Cat Conley is obviously 24 a lot younger than me. She listens to pop music. She's, she's 24 year olds. So I have a, like whatever's in the charts is her soundtrack at the time. So I would make a soundtrack for each book and I plug my earphones in and stick them in and they, that helps drown out everything else that's going on in my head as well as the noise around me. Um, so that, it means I can really focus on the book and when I hear that sound than I know I'm in the zone for writing. This book is about a woman who was an ex ballerina, so it's the Moscow symphony and I'm, and I'm using that for, for this one, for the soundtrack, for this one. The next book I done all of that soundtracks going to be, I know you're just starting it, so we'll wait and see.

Speaker 1:          36:02          But I find that enormously useful because it just, it helps. Helps. Yeah. Look out, look out the sound at wherever you are, but also what's going on in your head. Um, yeah, so I think in one of the things about writing is that it's really worth listening to writers, lots of different writers because we all do, we all do the same thing and we all use bits of the same technique, but we all have developed them in our own way. And there's no right or wrong way to, right. So some people write bits all over the place, some people write organically and they don't plot. Some friends of mine, Monica Mcinerney wrote and her telling me she about 40,000 words of a book and in totally the wrong direction, it was complete a complete like bull wrong cause you had to literally delete 40,000 that's half a book.

Speaker 1:          36:46          Right? But in that for staff and words, there were a couple of paragraphs which are absolutely crucial to the progression of the plot. And she wouldn't have found if she hadn't written the 40,000 words. So nothing is ever wasted in writing. You know, it might be that you write a book and it never sees the light of day, but it's not what not wasted because you've used that time and you'll create, mine has been working on it. Um, and you know, it's, it's really, really, really vital. So, yeah, so technique listened to writers, find out how everybody else does it, find out what works for you, and then you can, um, you can draw in and devise your own way of doing things. Um, that works with your lifestyle. Some people have little kids and they can't, you know, they can only write. I used to, I mean, right, Jim, my daughter's nap time and my daughter would only sleep for 20 minutes at a time. So I think I learned quite early on to 20 minutes. And when you've got, when you've only got 20 minutes, it's amazing what you can do. Um, you block everything else out. So, uh, yeah, everybody's different. But yeah. Find, find the way that works for you.

Speaker 3:          37:44          You mentioned the luxury of time and still young in my district for 13 years. So what's your advice for someone who just wants to get thing out there but it doesn't want to be dealing with loads and loads of details like cover design. Oh, ESPN this thing, that thing. Some other detail as most Googlers. Just want to get a tech out there. Dot. Not really interested in making a whole bunch of cash out of it. Okay. It's like got a day job.

Speaker 1:          38:06          You want people to read it. Yeah. Okay. So if you want people to read it, then you can't, there are lots of companies who do all that for you, so you don't have to worry about any of this. You just go to one of them and they will that professional. Um, I can give you the names as a couple, two or here in Ireland are very good. They come back from trade backgrounds and they understand the business. Um, but things like, um, yeah, getting a good cover. Um, it's crucial because that's how it reads, recognizes a book. You know yourself, when you go into a bookshop, you pick the book up, depending what the couple of sites turn over and lead the back to open it, read those first few paragraphs. So those things have only really, really important. Um, so yeah, if you, if you, you're at that point where you don't want to be bothered with it, the doings of the makings that, but you've done that, you've already done your best and making so, and I think I would probably just get a company to one of the companies to come who do that professionally to do it and they'll do it properly for you and they'll, they'll get your great cover, they'll help you with a blurb, um, and then, and then you can still self published.

Speaker 1:          38:57          So you're still doing it yourself. Um, but do send out to the trade first, you know, do get it again and there just to have a look at it. I'll get a reader's report done on it. So you know that what you've got there is the right bit. Um, and then, and do look at, think about another story too. You know, that the, I suppose that's really important is that if you are, um, everybody's different. I mean like maybe you only want to write one book and that's fantastic because you have obviously, um, and actually getting to the end is a massive achievement because there are lots of people who want to write books and not very many people actually finish them. Um, but, um, if you are writing and you finish one book can keep thinking, think about the second one because if you do get a contract, it won't be for one book, it be for a minimum of two. And um, you need to have that, that next idea really should go, it will make a huge difference. We'll help you with this awful contract deadline look. Um, so, um, yes, I do keep writing, but no, absolutely. People can help you out and get it out there for you. Um, but do you know, get, get. Yeah, it's hard when you've spent a lot time working on things to do starting today. If you enjoyed that process, start thinking about the next one, move on.

Speaker 4:          40:00          Hmm. You usually give really good advice as to those who are in the beginning of the process and they really like the idea about the storyboard. So how it usually works, for example, it's like a detectives in crime movies. Do this by thinking, searching, put in together, all the pieces for it. How, how you would recommend to use the storyboard.

Speaker 1:          40:21          Okay. Well I do, I, so I get the pictures of the people and then the locations. I spend a lot of time looking. I'm, I'm uh, cause I'm a detailed person. Um, I like to be in control of everything and I'm really into the whole getting everything right. Um, so I would go to find the locations. I try and visit the locations. If I writing about them. I try and use places I've been. So if it's inside of somebodies apartment, I've been to the apartment and I, but I do go onto these property websites and I get people's floor plans. Um, and I, you know, in the interior shops are different people's houses and I put those into my storyboard. So it just means then if I'm writing about somebody going into the living room, um, I don't forget that actually they can, what they can see out the window or I forget, don't forget that the kitchen's off this particular room as opposed to a different one.

Speaker 1:          41:05          Um, in theory, when you get to the point where when you're going to bring, you have a copy editor looking at your book and that sort of final editorial process, they'll notice like if eight people went into the left, only four people came out, but, um, or somebody is pregnant for nine for 14 months, I think one of my friends managed. Um, but, uh, those, those type of details, I think a great for a story board because particularly locations because then you can see where your people are. Um, I've got one character who I think might live on a houseboat. And so because we're very close to grand canal dock has spent a lot of time walking around Grand Canal dock, getting pictures of houseboats, trying to find the right layout for the house, both for the story that I wanted. And um, I've got, so I've got a whole houseboat lay out on my and pitches of Grand Canal and different places where they might have stayed on my storyboard.

Speaker 1:          41:48          Yeah. So, so I just find them really useful. I mean, in the film, obviously people plot out the actual story on storyboards and they use them for, you know, an animation stuff. You use them to actually tell the story. But I just tend to have a static one, which has like locations and sometimes the dressmaker had bits of lace on it from wedding dress and it had, um, a deck of cards. I think I had stuck on it and all sorts of bits of just bits that were just, I felt we were going to go into the stories pooling the, I suppose, the creator place. Yeah. So by phone renucell

Speaker 4:          42:18          thank you very much. Uh, I think, uh, that's all for today. I really appreciate it. It was, I think, very inspiring story. And the toe is good when you can talk to a person who has already a success Korea and who can also share some advices and does that give some tips and tricks and although small exercises that are quite useful for many people, thank you so much. Bye.

Speaker 5:          42:45          Okay.
