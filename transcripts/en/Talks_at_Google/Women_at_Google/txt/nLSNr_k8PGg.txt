Speaker 1:          00:00:06       I'm really excited today to introduce a new friend of mine, Korean mccanlis. She's the sister of literary icon, Christopher McCandless. Uh, and she consulted to closely with Jon Krakauer on his bestselling book into the wild, which came out in 1996. I'm sure a lot of you've heard of it or read it. Um, she also works as a direct advisor, writer and script contributor to Sean Penn on his film adaptation of end of the wild, which was released in 2007. Um, Korean wrote her own memoir about the experience called the wild truth, ah, that was released in November, 2014 and very quickly became both the New York Times and national bestseller, uh, and it was followed by international publications in seven countries and still counting the wild truth was selected for many best books of 2014 lists, including those chosen by readers and editors at Newsweek, vanity fair, Amazon and Indy. Next. So it's a pleasure to introduce Corinne

Speaker 2:          00:00:59       [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:01:04       Hi, thank you all for hosting me here today. I'll keep things pretty casual. I've got my journal. Everyone should always write in a journal every day.

Speaker 4:          00:01:15       I had to put a

Speaker 3:          00:01:19       markers and mine of the Google color, you know, in your logo to her. Remind me where in the journal I needed to go back to. So anyway, I'm gonna I, I'm used to doing very, very long and formal presentation. So I've got my journal here to help me stay on point because I really would like to get some time at the end of this to get into Q and a with you guys. Um, so when I was 21, I lost my best friend. He was awesome. My brother, um, he was 24 when he died and many of you know the story, his name was Chris McCandless. He had graduated with honors from Emory university

Speaker 4:          00:02:08       and

Speaker 3:          00:02:10       that was the last time that I had ever seen him alive. Just the last time I'd spoken with him, he had written me letters. Um, but I hadn't spoken to him since seeing him at graduation. Two years later, his body was found in this abandoned bus in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness.

Speaker 2:          00:02:34       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:02:34       There was a lot of mystery surrounding his death and everything that had happened during those two years. And the story of that time and all of the adventures that he had during that time became known as into the wild as such, um, summarized the incredible book written by Jon Krakauer

Speaker 4:          00:02:58       and it

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       was also developed into a film by Sean Penn. And Chris's story really became, I mean, John's book was so popular, it's published in over 30 languages. Um, Shawn's movie also, so beautiful. And Chris's story reached even more of a global audience, but it wasn't the whole story. So to give you a little backstory, this is Chris with the Shanandoah behind him. We used to hike a lot. This is my hiking hat, um, in that area. And he loves to be out in nature. Chris always said to me that nature may be harsh and it's honesty, but it never lies to you.

Speaker 2:          00:03:52       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:03:52       And he felt, I don't know, he felt whole, like he felt real when he was out in nature. And, um, I just remembered it was always his favorite place to be. It was an always an escape for him. Even at this young age, Chris and I were very close. He was always my protector. I heard it's a cute picture. Right? All right. This picture tells a story. This picture was taken on a typical morning. Our house was

Speaker 3:          00:04:37       on an everyday basis filled with domestic violence, and this day was not unlike any other. The violence had erupted over the breakfast table and continued on until my parents realized that it was time for church. It was Easter Sunday. So we were putting into our best suit and dress and we were marched into the backyard for pictures. And you know, pictures, they catch an image in time, right? But you don't really know what's going on. You don't know the whole story behind the image. And whenever we would have to pause for the perfect little family pictures.

Speaker 2:          00:05:27       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:05:31       Our Dad would be by hand a camera screaming at us. Smile, smile. So what we had just been through in the household, really not in the mood, but you had to do it. If you didn't. I knew what was coming next. Now look closely at our expressions in these pictures. So I'm being compliant. We've got a smile on my face, I've got my hand behind his back. I'm trying to convince Chris, you know, smile, let's get this done and look at the look on his face. If you really look closely, you know he's only about six years old here, but he's already over that he already understands. Now what's really important about this picture, I've got it on the cover of my book because people look at that and like, oh, that's such a sweet picture. But again, it's the point of the story behind the images that we see, right? That's what this whole talk is going to be about and

Speaker 2:          00:06:33       hm,

Speaker 3:          00:06:34       you know, I can remember like, like it was yesterday. It's, it's, you have this, this image that you're going to portray out to society, but sometimes it's so very different from what is actually going on. So Chris, just even at that age, he wasn't going to accept that he was already planning. He was already at that young age making a determination of what's right and what's wrong. When you grow up in a household of domestic violence, you become acclimated to it. You don't know at this age that every household isn't like that. You don't understand. So you know when, when your environment is saturated with that you become completely desensitized to it. Chris understood something was wrong. Now as

Speaker 3:          00:07:35       we grew up, you know, in a lot of ways Chris was your typical kid, but in other ways there was just something about him that, I don't know, you could say it was deeper than most people at that age and sometimes we would just have be having typical kid conversations or where we'd be fighting over, you know, that's my space or don't come in my room. But other times, you know, he, we'd be having these conversations about an author or something that he just read that he wanted me to read or you know, big questions and I was more interested in stuffed animals at that age or makeup at a later age. Chris was different. Um, at this age, he was already thinking a lot about

Speaker 2:          00:08:21       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:08:22       who he wanted to be and probably most importantly, who he would not become. So John's book became, were required reading into the wild, became required reading at about 3000 high schools and colleges across the United States. John doesn't like to do public speaking, so he would suggest me, and it took me a very, very, very long time to get to the point where I felt comfortable going and speaking to people about Chris's story.

Speaker 4:          00:08:59       And

Speaker 3:          00:09:02       when I did, I would be talking to students who are about the sage. This is Chris's typical senior picture in high school. Right. And when I came to the school, you would see a change in the students because it became real to them. You know, it was no longer just an assignment. It was this lesson because this is a real flesh and blood sister of this person.

Speaker 4:          00:09:26       And

Speaker 3:          00:09:29       it wasn't just that I could see that they were inspired by Chris. There's usually two camps. Some people admired him for what he did. Some people admonished him. That's part of the reason that it's something that's that's assigned, right? Because they want people to get into that critical kind of thinking and think outside of themselves. But what hit me more was that I never left one school. First of all, they would always ask about the backstory, right? Which at first I wasn't necessarily talking about, but in the Q and a, that's always what the questions were. Why was he so angry with your parents? Why did he leave the way he did? Why didn't he talk to anybody for those years after he left college and when I opened up, you know, and the safety of the intimate walls of a classroom where things weren't recorded yet. I saw this change come over the students and some in particular because I never left one school and still to this day, all the years that I've been speaking, I've never left one school, one university, a corporate event. I've never left anywhere where at least one person didn't come up. And in this case it was these high school students that didn't come up and ask for help for the very first time because they were going through a similar experience. And here was someone talking about it.

Speaker 3:          00:10:54       So after years of of doing this and seeing this everywhere I went, I realize what a disservice I had done to my brother and not just to Chris, but those who would read about him and be inspired by him because Chris always said there is nothing more important than the truth. And John did an incredible book, a incredible job writing into the wild and what was left out of it is my fault because I want to John to understand. But I wouldn't let him write that.

Speaker 4:          00:11:28       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:11:30       I wasn't ready. And I realized later on, wow, what did a service had been done to such an incredible writer and someone with that journalistic style of Jon Krakauer to give them information. But tell them beforehand, I'm going to tell you something, but my condition is, you're not allowed to reveal this. I just need you to know. I didn't think anybody was going to read into the wild. So it was kind of John's fault. Um, so anyway, I realize why a disservice I had done by not talking about this and here, 20 years has passed. So you know, as I mentioned earlier, I journal all the time. Chris is the one that taught me to journal and we'll get a little bit more into that. But I just started writing and all those journal entries turned into a book. And what I didn't expect was for my book to start a new conversation about domestic violence. There were all these blanks and Chris's story and people rightfully so had filled in those blanks with their own answers, you know, as to why he had left the way he did or what had happened with the family.

Speaker 4:          00:12:48       And

Speaker 3:          00:12:49       when my book came out, or long before the book came out, just when I was in these rooms of 50 people, 500 people, it didn't matter. When I would talk about the rest of the story, it forced people to take another look at Chris's story, not in defense of him because in all fairness, he, he didn't live his life worried about what anyone else was going to think about him. He was concerned about what he thought about himself, but now that people had the rest of the answers, a lot of their perspectives changed. And that was not something that I realized when I was 21 years old and he was gone and I was having to tell this journalist

Speaker 4:          00:13:39       why he left.

Speaker 3:          00:13:42       So

Speaker 3:          00:13:48       people not only would take another look at Chris's story, but they started taking another look at story in their own communities. And I started doing the same thing. So whenever I was, um, at these schools, and you know, for the most part, these are, if they're hiring a speaker to come, um, these schools are filled with kids who have a certain amount of privilege right there. Um, they're all wearing pretty nice clothes. When I pull up to speak, there's, you know, tons of cars in the parking lot. So pretty much all these kids have access to cars to drive for school. Um, they all have phones, right? Computers and tablets. So they all want to connect with me on social media. And I've never really been big on having a social media presence. My, um, my publisher is so incredibly kind and patient with me for not, you're really supposed to be on the lot and I'm not.

Speaker 3:          00:14:48       Um, but you know, I do try and make an effort and for the most part it's when I'm connecting with these students because I want to stay connected with them. I want to see what they're, what they're doing. I want to see what they're doing with their lives. I want to hear what they're doing next because they'll tell me their stories. They'll tell me how they were inspired by Chris and what they want to do. But as I am looking at the social media of these kids that I've connected with, and these are good kids, I'm also seeing all these other stories, right? That also good kids, but all these other pages and connections that populate, right? So I don't have to tell you I'm a Google, but you know, you're looking at social media and then someone else has commented and then that's curious. So I'm going to click on that. I'm gonna look on that. Oh, I think that kid might've been at the lecture. Let me look at that. So I started to connect more and more into the social media and with this age group and in paying more attention to what I saw through them, their friends, their classmates,

Speaker 3:          00:15:58       I really began to see something that concerned me. Um, there was a lot of good, but there was also a lot of bad. And to me it appeared that what I considered to be a negative influence and, uh, negative stimuli, it was quite out of whack. You know, if you look at the balance, um, and what I could see was, you know, there's so much stimuli and reality becomes a blur. There's just so much going on and that's what I want to get into. Um, some of the things that I started to see, so I just grabbed some screenshots. I, I would look at pages of students that I connected with across the country, but I also took a closer look in my own community. So I started looking at, you know, easy search, a name of your kid or your kids' friends or, um, all of these kids that go to the high schools around the area. And these are some of the things that I saw.

Speaker 3:          00:17:09       So here's one that's got a few pictures and it says, grab your girl like this, right? And it's got, I don't know what Emoji that is a funny crying face. And then it's got the hearts right. Smiley face with the hearts. It's got to have a name. I know what that emojis called, but now let's take a closer look at these four photos that they have. So it would be deal, right? Don't be an overprotective mom. That's not a big deal, right? It's just a little, nothing graphic. So there's three of these shots, I guess. It's cool that they have cigarettes, whatever. All right. And then this is the fourth one. When I saw that, I found that shocking. Grab your girl like this. What I found more shocking was, and let's go back, maybe it's on here. Okay, let's see. There's 14 now. This is, I'm watching these things in real time. So this goes up and then I'm watching it over a matter of, you know, that day there's 1400 kinda sucks getting old. I need my reading glasses. 1400 retweets. And what? 1372 likes. What is there to like about, about this? What is there to like about that? All right. So then I started looking and seeing, looking at more things and um, I saw this theme and this pattern that caused me a lot of concern. So here's just another one.

Speaker 3:          00:18:52       Okay? So this is a meme, right? They called mean. So here's a skeleton getting ready to punch a baby. And it says this, this is how infants are killed during an abortion. Now I'm not here to talk about abortion rights or anything like that. That's a whole nother topic, right? But I think it's fair to say that both sides of that issue could agree that this is inappropriate. This is a skeleton. Cold cocking a baby.

Speaker 2:          00:19:27       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:19:28       And again, you've got,

Speaker 3:          00:19:33       uh, let's see, 2100 retweets, almost 3,500 favorites. Now, the majority of what I'm seeing, these are school aged kids, right? These are teenagers. This meme, the mentality to me, it, they're so separated from reality. You know, it's like everything's a cartoon. It's not real, but that's a real issue. Right? And they don't know the intent of the person that drew this beam or posted it. Right. Are they saying that this is, are they, do they think abortion is, is fair? It's a writer day or they're against it. They don't know. I started to interview these kids, right? I started talking to the kids in groups and I started saying, and I'd show these things and I would say, why? Why? Why would you show this? And they literally would like, they know it's supposed to be bad, but they kind of have to cover their face or writers. I think it's just thought it was funny. What about that is funny? And I would say, uh, okay. And I would name the person that I blocked out that, that said this. Do you know who that person is? No.

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:20:50       So you don't know what their intent is behind this. Is this a real picture? I don't know. How would you like it if that was your sister? And they're horrified that someone sister, you don't know what the intent is of the person that posted this yet. You are readily reposting it. And that's what I mean by this. Just constant stimuli. They see something. Oh Haha. And there were, you know its peers. Everybody's retweeting, everybody's liking. So they do a two, they don't even know why they're doing it. They don't think about the effect. They don't think about the intent, the messages that society spreads are so important.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:21:37       And through social media we are willingly and incessantly spreading messages without knowing what the intent of that message is.

Speaker 2:          00:21:49       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:21:50       So you know, it's like that noise of society. And when you talk about

Speaker 2:          00:21:58       mmm

Speaker 3:          00:22:00       purpose and everything that you do, that intent is so important.

Speaker 2:          00:22:06       So

Speaker 3:          00:22:09       when you aren't listening to yourself and you lose that self awareness, you lose that accountability for what you're doing with your own actions. So up to this, it leads me to contradiction, right? A lot of times if you're not thinking about what you're doing, a lot of times you do contradictory things. This is a 17 year old girl that posted this, right? Am I just an overprotective mother? Right? Am I just like someone who think, oh my God, if that was my daughter, like it's not graphic, right? I mean, there's ads for underwear that aren't that different than that. But look what it says. If we date with the Emoji with the tongue,

Speaker 2:          00:22:52       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:22:52       But look at, this is her favorites. Look at the post right before it, the new Steven Universe episode, uh, was about sexual harassment. This show is so important. So she's telling people this is so important and let's see, there's five likes of that. Yet the very next thing she favorites is this photograph. And she writes, if we date and there's 349 retweets and 562 likes, it's completely contradictory. And I have to say that, um, you know, it's not, it's not that untypical. Here's another one. A, if she stuck your fingers keeper, she nasty.

Speaker 2:          00:23:43       I mean, oh

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       yeah, there's a hell of a Lada retweets and likes of that one. So these are just your typical teenage kids. These are not these trouble making kids. And all my kid would never do that. These, I know who these kids are, they're good kids, but it's just they become desensitized to this, right? And it leads to more and more and more problems. So, and while I'm picking on the kids, I got to say, adults too oftentimes are no better. So we will have, um, an NFL player that gets filmed in an elevator hitting a woman, right? We will have a politician that gets caught for sexual harassment. We will have, um, news anchors, celebrities, same thing happens, you know, and sometimes they get away with it. Sometimes the hammer falls, they lose their jobs, right? And so women, we as women stand up and we say, we are not going to accept this behavior. This is wrong. It is wrong for women to not be treated fairly, right? We want a demand fair treatment. We want an end to sexual harassment. We want an end to an abuse of power and control. Did you refixed shades of gray yet?

Speaker 2:          00:25:07       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:25:07       Oh, let's read it for a book club and then we'll go see the movie together. It's a total contradiction. It's a complete contradiction. This is the message that we're sending to our daughters and to the boys that they will date. So this leads me to anybody read this book yet? Jon Krakauer Missoula

Speaker 3:          00:25:39       heard of it before. Okay. How many of you have heard of 50 shades of grey? Okay. So, um, if you have a child going to college, you have got to make them read this book. This should be the Fye book for every student going into college. Um, John does not need my help selling ebooks and I'm not doing that for this. This was because I believe in this. My 18 year old will not go to college without reading this book, um, college or not wherever they go. So Missoula, um, John and his journalistic style investigates the campus rape culture. And I am not asked to go speak to any colleges anymore without addressing the issue of sexual violence. Every college I go to, they want me to, to merge that into my talk. It is a huge issue. But look at some of the things we just saw on social media and it goes back to self awareness and accountability in John's. The overwhelming majority of these cases are you have a young man in a young woman and in the overwhelming majority there were highly intoxicated when this event happened.

Speaker 3:          00:27:05       So there's interviews and you know, intercourse happened and somebody thought that it was consensual and the other person didn't think it is, but they know that they blacked out and the other person blacked out too. And so piecing that all together is difficult. And it goes back to what I tried to talk to students about is self awareness is not just what's my purpose in life and what am I going to do with my career? It's being aware of your space in your time right now, where you are, what you're doing, and if you have control of your intent and do others around, you have control of theirs. To me so much goes back to,

Speaker 2:          00:27:53       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:27:54       in an instance like this, there's this controversy of truth, right? What's the truth? And

Speaker 3:          00:28:03       there'll be controversy about that, but is it getting enough attention for the right reasons? It brings me back to the influences surrounding these students that are on their way to college. Um, let me give you a little bit of levity. As I was, uh, on my book tour, not long after John's book had come out. Um, I go into a bookstore and, um, I'm always looking to see what books are out there and I'm looking at John's books and John has several bestsellers and you usually see a few copies. And then I also happen to see Charles Krauthammer's book and I liked him and I picked it up. And, uh, I'm on a long layover in Chicago, so I'm reading the chapter that he entitles, uh, in defense of the f word, which is brilliant by the way. Um, so I'm looking at that, but as I'm reading, I'm standing there reading and I'm distracted. I'm like, what? You know, something that's catching my eye peripherally. And it was boobs. It was a big set of boobs.

Speaker 2:          00:29:07       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:29:08       Everyone knows who that is, right? So there's like three copies of John's book, Missoula. There's a few copies of Charles Commerce, like 50 copies of this book.

Speaker 2:          00:29:19       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:29:20       And this is Kim Kardashians book entitled it's her book of selfies. And No, I'm not trying to harp on Kim or anything. I'm just saying let's use this as an example cause she certainly doesn't mind putting it out there. Um, there's like 50 copies of this book on the shelf. The book's entitled, Selfish. And why does the bookstore have so many of her copies? It's a big book too. I mean, you're in an airport bookstore. It's heavy. Why are there so many copies and that shelf? Because they know they're going to sell them. It's society. And while I was looking up to find this cover, I found this one, which I thought was hilarious. Kim Kardashians. Shellfish. That's it. That was, that was a brilliant, um, all right, let me bring things back. Okay. So this, this just brings me back to the influence surrounding teenagers, right? Um, and not just kids of this age, but little kids because the little brothers and sisters have kids these age want to be just like them. They can't wait to get their, their iPhones, their androids. I can't wait to get their phones right. And that's what they see all the time. They are very aware of what the teenagers are doing. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:30:47       does anyone know this is someone in particular? Does anyone know who this is? Anybody recognize? Okay. And I take this around to, you know, I've taken this around to a lot of students in different schools all over the country. Almost nobody knows who this person is lately though, everybody knows who this person is.

Speaker 2:          00:31:11       Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:31:12       Right? I know some of you are, which is when, now what if I said, uh, cash me outside? How about dad? Right? You know who that is because it's all over the Internet. So I didn't know who it was, but when on Saturday I had my littlest girl, my daughter, my youngest daughter at a Ukulele lessons and he said, hey, you're speaking at Google on Tuesday, aren't you? And I said, yeah. And I told them what the title of my talk was going to be. Um, the socialization of domestic violence, um, diluting a devastating influence. And he says, Oh yeah, I was a, he teaches at the academy rock. And so he's got a group of students, he goes in one day and they're all joking saying, cash me outside. How about dad? He says, what are you speaking English? What are you saying? So then they tell them and they pull out their phones and they show him, look at this girl, this is hilarious. And He's thinking, oh my gosh. Well, so he starts telling me about this person and come to find out she's got, well, she was on Dr Phil and I watched the video on youtube and during the video she threatens to beat the audience up. That's what the cash me outside. How about that is she's going to beat the audience up. Her mother translated and um, and then she got up and she got up in her mother's face and she was threatening to beat up her mom.

Speaker 2:          00:32:35       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:32:36       This girl apparently now has endorsement. She's signed a contract for a reality show. Let's see how many views are on this five and a half million views.

Speaker 4:          00:32:49       Right. This is the other, it's a mixture.

Speaker 3:          00:32:56       This is Jack and Draka. I'm hoping I'm saying his last name right. I met him. Um, he probably won't remember me, but I definitely remembered him. I met him at an Fye conference. Both of our books were featured as books. Um, do we use it as required reading at colleges? And he presented, and this is a young teenage genius. He's now at Stanford class of 2019. Who invented an early did. He invented a, uh, I don't even have the time to explain it all properly, but he developed a test at a very economical tasks that's an early detector for pancreatic cancer cause he lost someone in his life to pancreatic cancer that was very dear to him. He's also invented a water bottle that, that these expensive ones that we buy at the sports stores, but something that can be manufactured for pennies on the dollar compared to others and can be sent to these third world countries where people don't have access to clean water and they can go and scoop up this water that's not drinkable and they can drink. So He's, he's saving lives. He's changing the world. None of the teenagers know who this is.

Speaker 3:          00:34:11       Here's Jack's Ted talk. It's got 304,000 views. That's pretty good.

Speaker 2:          00:34:17       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:34:17       She's got five and a half million views. Doesn't mean that they are approving of it, but that saturation, that's influential because whereas some of these kids might kind of laugh at her and talk about how she, you know, they also are thinking, wow, she's, she's made all that money. I mean, they're human. That's the kind of things that they think about. Kids think about shoes and they want the range rover like somebody else has. So let's see. Here's her Danielle or goalie, I guess her name. Here's her Twitter page. She's got 340 no, I'm sorry, 243,000 followers and she just joined February of 2017 so just a couple of months. She's got that many followers. Here's Jack's page. He joined in July of 2011

Speaker 2:          00:35:15       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:35:16       He's got just under 22,000 followers. Here's his Instagram page. He's got 3,400 followers. He's probably had it up for several years. Here's her Instagram page. 9.2 million, 9.2 million followers, which means when these kids go and scroll, the latest video that she posted bragging about bullying people and beating up kids and stealing cars.

Speaker 2:          00:35:48       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:35:49       there's only 3,400 that are learning about Jack's latest invention that's going to change this world. But what did we as a society, why? Why does everybody not know who this is? Why do they know who she is? You know? You don't have to be intentionally searching for something negative, but it's so saturated that that's what's out there.

Speaker 3:          00:36:17       Now, I'm not saying that there isn't also good that comes with the exposure, right? I mean, this is, technology has been a wonderful thing. So here's an organization, no more.org, right? They've been fantastic. I've spoken all around the country at groups and a lot of times they're related in some way to this group and support. I've spoken at New Beginnings and Seattle, a center for women in transition in Michigan. Um, the women's home in Texas Samaritan House where I live in Virginia, um, Shelter House, the barn outside of DC. There's, there's organizations all over the country that are working to prevent domestic and sexual violence and they're out there. But this group has 55,000 followers, 55,000 followers compared to nine Portola hills. See, let's be fair. Let's, that was her Instagram page. Instagram. They have 29 almost 30,000 followers compared to what was hers, 9.2 million. There's something wrong with that and I don't have all the answers, but I know there's something wrong with that. This is the kind of thing that concerns me because it's out of balance. I care about it because I'm worried for these kids who see domestic violence every day and have become acclimated to it and don't understand it's wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:38:03       I worry for these kids. These are my girls, Heather and Christiana. I love that picture. They're little. They're, or they're bigger now, so they don't like when I showed that picture, Heather thinks that she doesn't look good without makeup and that her hair's too curly. So here's another picture of Heather. So you know, I worry about this as a mom, I worry about this as an advocate. I worry about this as a community member, but I also worry about this as a sister because am desperate

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       to know that we have as a human race that we have learned something. Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:38:44       In the past 25 years, it's been 25 years,

Speaker 2:          00:38:55       but

Speaker 3:          00:38:57       I don't have the power and I don't have all the answers, right? I'm one person. There's a lot of advocates all over the country who does have the power. I think you guys have the power. We're at freaking Google. All right. What's a Google? Google is is like the highest number you can get. Right? 10 to the hundredth power. I'm not a mathematician. I googled it. These pages that populate these, these recommendations that come up, somebody is programming all that stuff. Somebody is creating that some of the most brilliant minds are in this a hundred plus set of buildings. Why can't we come up with a way that that helps with a better balance? I'm not talking about censorship, I'm talking about balance. I'm talking about educating these young people.

Speaker 2:          00:39:59       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:40:00       there's gotta be a way to do it and I challenge you guys to come up with those answers. So I think that can bring us into the Q and. A. You guys have everyone's attention every day. You and companies like yours have everyone's attention every day. So what can you do to help with this balance?

Speaker 2:          00:40:28       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:40:30       so what I take away from, from hearing you talk and reading your book is that in his own way, Chris and his time when he was coming of age, was frustrated by a lot of the things you've just mentioned. Maybe not Instagram and Twitter back then, but

Speaker 3:          00:40:45       that didn't exist back then. Exactly. That's one of my points. Like students will say to me, why don't you just pissed that he didn't send you a text? You didn't hear from him for two years. He didn't even send you an email and I hold up my phone and I say, we now have these back then and they think she looks amazing for being 200 years old. I mean, they don't. It's it's, they can't comprehend it. That's like trying to explain to someone that there no oxygen in the air. They can't comprehend that. That's why to me, these all these things aren't necessarily real to them. Right. They're clicking and favoriting and reposting without really thinking about what they're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:41:25       No. If I may, that's a great transition road. This is what I was getting at is in both John's book and in your book, you do a great job of about how Chris was just, you began to talk with how Chris was a little different even at age six. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:41:38       He was more aware than most.

Speaker 1:          00:41:40       Right. He, he cared about authenticity. He had principles and, and, and you described him as being unique in that way. You and your book, you say even even friends would say your brother is a little intense. Not in a bad way, but he's intense. It's what I wonder is if you fast forward to today, it is still the norm for people to click on cash me outside. How about that instead of the book here. Thank you. Uh, let's be fair enough. Fair enough. It's still the norm for people to be attracted to that and not to stand up in the way that Chris did. So what I wonder is, is is, is do you have thoughts free for students that you speak to around the how and why they can be more authentic?

Speaker 3:          00:42:17       Some of it's entertainment, right? You have students who are going through these, you know, calculus classes and did they necessarily want to think that much? And so part of it's entertainment, but there has to be some responsibility and accountability because you can't tell me that seeing that and that being so saturated and not just that it's being rewarded by adults. It's not other kids that gave her a reality show.

Speaker 2:          00:42:51       Right.

Speaker 3:          00:42:53       So kids see that that's, that's what I'm talking about is, is that kind of responsibility and accountability? I probably didn't answer your question.

Speaker 1:          00:43:03       No, no, no. There's, there's no easy answer to how do you solve this, this right truth of society. But I think one thing you talk a lot about is his parenting and how Christen you both, uh, it's beautiful. In your book, you described the lessons you learned about how you want to do things differently than your parents did, for example.

Speaker 3:          00:43:20       Yeah. My parents weren't all bad. I mean, they weren't. And I talk about that and I flush it out in, in my book, they taught us some, some hard work ethics and a lot of good things too. But you have to decide what you're going to emulate and what you're not. And, and specifically on the issue of domestic violence, breaking that cycle is very important thing and it's not easy to do.

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       And so in that same vein, it seems, you know, you talk about some examples with your own daughters of how you've tried to embody authenticity. Um, you know, positive thoughts around relationships and around relationship with the self. I know a lot of parents are either in this room or watching on live stream. Do you have any thoughts or tips or I how to embody these values and your own family for you?

Speaker 3:          00:44:03       Sure. And you know, Gosh, I'm not, I'm not standing up here like, Hey, I'm doing it right and everybody's got to get on board. No, no, no, no, no, no. My, my 18 year old, I love her. She is such a good kid. She is. I have an 18 year old daughter that's never rolled her eyes at me and my presence or slammed the door. Right. Miracle is it because I'm such an amazing parent. I'd like the thing. So she's probably not going to say that, you know, but let's take that for example, she, I know I take my kids to my events and sometimes things thinking and sometimes they don't. My oldest, she came up from the basement one night I was sitting working at the kitchen table and she came up and I might get off tangent, you can reel me back in. But she came up from watching a TV show, just blubber. I mean, she was crying so hard that she couldn't speak. And I get, I'm like, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:44:55       oh my God, I have her. What's the matter? What happened? What's wrong? I don't remember the name glow.

Speaker 3:          00:45:11       She just, I'm like, oh, she's watching the walking dead. I've never watched the show. Maybe I shouldn't be letting my cue watch that show. I don't, you know, but she is beyond herself with grief. Genuinely. She's a smart kid and I say, honey, first of all, he didn't die. Like I hear you talk about this guy all the time. I know people that write scripts. This guy didn't die. Okay, this is the last show of the season. Trust me. Oh, he didn't die. They just want you to think sober. So, but she could not connect. She's smart, but they're so disconnected from reality. Like it affected her so much and it's easier to connect the things like that. Now when I talked to her about real things that are happening in the world, in these terrible tragedies, she doesn't have the same reaction. I mean, maybe part of it is a defense mechanism.

Speaker 3:          00:46:11       You know, it's not that she doesn't concern about those things, but it's, that is, that's not good that that happened, you know, but it's not this and, and so, you know, it bewilders me sometimes, but when it comes to parents, right, I say maybe I shouldn't let her watch that show now I think it's okay for her to watch that show. Um, it's probably something I should have watched so I could make that determination. Um, but I, I, you know, I talk with other parents about these issues and I'll mention how I found Heather posting something inappropriate. And so I took her phone away for six months and I get this,

Speaker 3:          00:46:47       you took your daughter's phone. You know, I could never do that. Oh my God, she would hate me. My kid would hate me. Like, well, your kid's 12. I mean, and I'm not judging other parents. Everyone has their own things going on, but it goes back to this accountability and responsibility. I mean you have to be willing to, to my advice to parents, you have to be willing to not be their best friend because you have to be their parents first. Yeah. And later in life, hopefully they'll realize that you were their best friend and really looking out for them. But, but we all survived without phones and computers and we were that agent. So you have to, you know, and, and, and I, my advice to students, you know, every time I'm talking with, I always hold up my journal and I asked them how many people, how many people in this room journal?

Speaker 3:          00:47:36       Okay. I always say everybody should journal even if it's one or two sentences. And I, and I don't do it every night. Sometimes I'm too exhausted. But the good thing about journal, and I always say you do it with a real paper and a pen. Why do you think it's with a real paper and pen? They want to go to their devices, right? But if you go to your device, you're going to be bombarded by all this stuff. Some good, a lot bad. And that's the noise, this noise of society. What are your thoughts? What are you thinking? Get away from all the influence and figure out what your place is in this world. What you want to do.

Speaker 1:          00:48:12       For sure. You talk about your brother being your protector all the time in and you see it in the picture. Do you see it in the stories share in the book? And I wondered if, if his inclination to think about these deep things at a young age was in part because he was a protector for you. He was in a way, I think trying to self parents a bit and provide some positive influence in your life and help you as well. And so he was taking that responsibility at a young age, younger than most people are comfortable. And now you're encouraging kids to journal and do what Chris did in taking some accountability responsibility for their own selves. But you're also talking about parents and we're thinking, what, what I hear you saying is parents, it might suck if your daughter hates you for a day, but that's your kid fair a week, however long it takes. Right. But I hear you're saying to parents, take some responsibility to have that difficult conversation instead of just batting your eye or looking at looking at another way. We all need to be more responsible. Is that what you're saying?

Speaker 3:          00:49:09       Right. And I'm not, yeah, I don't, I'm not stellar at all of this myself. We, I put we in this and including me. Um, you know, it's tough for parents of, you know, my, I'm 45 years old and I updated some apps the other day. I have no clue how the hell they use these things now. But my 11 year old could pick up my phone and intuitively just figure it out, you know? So a lot of times when I talked to parents about social media, they, ah, I don't even understand how all that works. Some of them have the attitude of, you know what, you just got to trust your kid. You just got it. But they are aware of a lot of the things that are happening and the things that those kids are exposed to. Sure. Um, so you have to be willing to have the uncomfortable conversations. You have to be willing to take the phone. You have to be unfortunately willing to learn how snapchat works. Um, you do if you're going to give them the access to it. Right. You gotta be willing to say, but let me make a point here about Chris. You said that, that I encourage kids to do what Chris did. Chris died out in the middle of the wilderness.

Speaker 3:          00:50:14       So I encourage, you know, people tell me, I get messages from people all over the world and people say that your brother changed my life.

Speaker 2:          00:50:22       And

Speaker 3:          00:50:23       I see where Chris Inspires people

Speaker 2:          00:50:26       to, to make

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       positive changes in their lives. But when someone tells me and they come to me and they're in tears and they say, your brother saved my life, I say to them, Chris died in 1992 he couldn't do that for you. Now he can be a spark that lights a fuel in you to do that for yourself, but own it. You did that for yourself. Yeah. And that, you know, that's so, so yeah, I want people to be influenced by Chris's, his desire to have a purpose in life. Right? He died so young, but he's influenced so many people, um, without even trying to, um, and, and for the most part in very positive ways. But Chris was also accountable. He knew that he put himself in a very difficult situation and he didn't blame anybody else for it. You know, I talk a lot about our childhood and my parents in my book, but I don't blame them for his death. Chris put himself out in the wilderness unprepared. I do hold them accountable for his disappearance. And that's a very different thing. So one of the greatest lessons that people can learn from Chris and kids of that age is to be accountable and to have that self awareness. Because at the end, I don't know if we have time for it, but Chris, um, I put some more slides up here simply because there's a lot of things. That's me. I came to the US. It's Chris on the road.

Speaker 3:          00:52:16       So just very quickly at the end of the movie, they show this note. So this is the note that Chris wrote when he knew he was dying. I have had a happy life and thank the Lord Goodbye and may God bless all. So he had taken that page out of one of his books. And on the opposite was this excerpt from a poem by Robinson Jeffers, um, from Wiseman. In the bad hours, it reads deaths, a fierce meadow Lark, but to die. Having made something more equal to the centuries and muscle and bone is mostly to shed weakness.

Speaker 3:          00:53:03       The mountains are dead stone that people admire or hate their stature, their insulin quietness. The mountains are not soften nor troubled and a few dead men's thoughts of the same temper. Chris didn't do anything without a purpose. He didn't just randomly pull this one page and decide to write the last words that he's gonna write in his life and also didn't do it for us. He didn't do it for anybody else. He didn't know that anybody was ever going to find this or care. You know, w when, when these students take pictures, what's the first thing we all do now when we take a picture, upload it. The first, maybe you, since you worked for Google, I haven't uploaded pictures in a long time. I'm so behind. No, the first thing we do is we look at the picture. We look at the picture. Do we get the images that we're looking for?

Speaker 3:          00:53:51       Right? But Chris, these pictures that people see online of Chris, Chris never saw these pictures. That was back in the day where you had this thing called film on a roll and you had to take it to the drug store and get it developed and you don't even know what the image is. But Chris, there aren't five of these pictures. There's one, he didn't take it. Let me make sure I'm getting the right shot. And John John writes about, which was not a picture I have up here cause it's too difficult for me, but he, and I read it at the end of my ted talk I believe, but he writes about this photo of Chris, the last photo that Chris takes himself and he talks about how he's standing beneath the High Alaska sky and if he feels betrayed that his body has let them down. I'm, I'm totally John, right? It's so beautifully and I'm, I'm, I just, I have it here. Um, let me just do service to this. Just takes a minute. Sure.

Speaker 3:          00:54:56       So he talks about this and he, he quotes Jeffers Palm and he says, one of his last acts was to take a picture of himself standing near the bus under the High Alaska sky. One hand holding his final note toward the camera lens. The other raised in a braid be a terrific farewell. His hate, his face is horribly and [inaudible] almost skeletal. That if he picked it himself and those last difficult hours because he was so young because he was alone because his body had betrayed him and as well had let him down. It's not apparent from the photograph. He is smiling in the picture and there is no mistaking the look in his eyes. Chris McCandless was at peace. Serena's a monk gone to God. That picture that John's talking about, it's not. This one is both the hardest and the most wonderful picture for me to look at. It's a good pain. I call it because I see he's dying. He skeletal, but he does have this genuine smile and there's one shot. He didn't take a bunch hoping that, oh, am I going to get it right? Am I going to put the right thing across? He's not thinking about anybody else. That's just pure emotion coming out of him and it's real and it's genuine and it happens to be because of his faith.

Speaker 2:          00:56:21       But

Speaker 3:          00:56:22       for any of us, we live

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       a young number of years or whether we live into our eighties and nineties to have that piece at the end of our life. Whenever that time comes to me, that's what it's all about to, to be at peace with the past you've chosen in life and the way you've lived your life, what the purpose of your life was. And although Chris Chris's life was short

Speaker 3:          00:56:49       and although he was so devastated to be losing his life at such a young age, and I know this from reading his journal,

Speaker 3:          00:56:57       he was at peace, not because he was dying, but because he had lived and the way he had lived. And to me, that's my advice for students is, you know, use those journals, figure out who you are, figure out what you want to be and what you want to do and when that day comes for you and it's going to come for all of us. Unless you guys at Google here figure out, I mean, it'd be, might be common, I'm sure you're working on it better find us to some other planets because it's getting a little crowded. Um, talk to you on about, yeah, we talked a lot about it, but, um, but that's my point.

Speaker 1:          00:57:32       Do you see any of Chrysalis traits and your children?

Speaker 3:          00:57:38       Well, yes. So, um, so Heather isn't biologically my child. I adopted her.

Speaker 4:          00:57:50       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:57:52       So as far as traits, if you mean light have trials down biologically? Um, Christiana, my youngest, she is named after Chris. Um, she has down syndrome. Doesn't matter. Nothing is gonna stop this kid. Things that remind me of Chris and her are, why can't I go climb the hundred foot oak tree to play with the raccoons? I don't understand why that's a problem. I mean, but there's also just this purity in her, you know, obviously she doesn't know,

Speaker 4:          00:58:26       have, um,

Speaker 3:          00:58:29       I dunno, she's only 11. I guess we'll see what, but you know, it's, it's, I mean, her deep thoughts right now are about princesses, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:58:36       Um, but

Speaker 3:          00:58:41       there's a light and appearance and her that, that I definitely recognize. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:58:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:48       Three. Cool. Anybody else?

Speaker 3:          00:58:52       No. Did I talk so much that I answered all of your questions? Sure. I'll ask you a final one then we can go to a book signing. Are you guys going straight to like a conference room to figure out this whole issue after this? We've got it booked. How to populate good influences coming into people's pages.

Speaker 1:          00:59:07       This is one, you know, you and I have talked about a little bit, but um, uh, when I went and visited the bus in 2012, um, there was some supplies and things and, and, and notes and journals that people leave behind for future visitors. And what was amazing when I visited was there was a, in a plastic bag, one of Koreans journals, and I think it's the one that you would take in with you when you first visited the bus and you'd left it there for people, I think to write in. And uh, getting into the bus is not easy. It's 40 mile round trip. You have to cross two rivers. It's the middle of the mosquitoes are insane. Um, and you know, I remember we'd gotten there, we'd done a 20 mile day that day to get to the bus. And the first thing that I see on the cover of this journal is a Buddhist quote that said, there was no way to happiness. Happiness is the way. And it occurred to me that I'd taken this journey to find something. At this bus as did by the graffiti. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of people, um, all seeking something. But this quote talks about it being within us. Can you talk about it all that has resonated with you and in your life?

Speaker 3:          01:00:12       That's it. Self awareness. If you don't get away from that noises, society sometimes, and you don't have that self awareness. I mean, it breaks right down to kids going to college or they don't go to college. They go into a career or they're doing it they want to do, or they're doing what they were told to do. Are they following their own path or are they following a path that was laid out for them? It's not just academics, it's also socially. You know, it. All of these influences that are all over the internet are determining these paths and these choices that we all make all the time

Speaker 2:          01:00:51       and

Speaker 1:          01:00:52       the kids are watching it around. We'll cluster Corinne, thank you.
