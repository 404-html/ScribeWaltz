Speaker 1:          00:07          By welcoming a very special guest here today. [inaudible] editor in chief of the national, um, Mina, you've been a political journalist for a very, very, very long time. How did it all begin and what was the genesis of your career, if you will?

Speaker 2:          00:23          Right. So first of all, thank you so much for being here and thank you Joyce for not only hosting me but Google has been really kind to the national since we relaunched last July. So it's very nice to continue our relationship. Um, you know, I'm, I'm your rocky British and I think for many people who are from countries, um, the either suffer war dictatorship or whatever, it really dominates your life in different ways. Um, unfortunately I count myself as lucky because we left when I was a child. We left Iraq when I was a child, but still politics kind of has shaped who I am and where I came to. And in a way, I think that's what determined my getting involved in journalism. I want things to understand more, but also cast a light on certain issues. Um, so really I think it has to do with the fact that I'm Iraq key and I also love storytelling. So combining the two together.

Speaker 1:          01:14          So political journalism, I don't think there was ever a time when it was easy or risky. Would you say that being a political journalist today comes with an even higher set of risks and challenges then in the past or was there never an easy time?

Speaker 2:          01:29          I don't think there's ever an easy time, but again, I think if we're talking about the Middle East and North Africa at the moment, unfortunately half the time that people are thinking you're a journalist, you have to be a war correspondent and that's, that's really difficult. I remember the first journalism story I ever wrote in political Jerusalem was in 2002 and it was the 1 million person march in London against the upcoming war in Iraq. And I remember at the time thinking, I really should be going to Iraq to cover this, but I'll be really frank. My parents were like, there is no way on earth you're getting to Iraq and you know, you're staying here and you're safer here. And so forth. And to be fair, I remember thinking, I'm a less lesser journalist for not being out there on the front line. And I had a great mentor who's still a friend and who actually now writes for the, for the national, which I'm really proud of, but he was, you know, this big John List and I hadn't worked with him.

Speaker 2:          02:22          And he said to me, me now, not every journalist has to be a war correspondent and war correspondents do incredible work and credible stories, but you can still do, you know, the other, um, types of stories. And I said, well, what I really am interested in is the policy side and the thematic side. And sometimes, fortunately, especially with what we're seeing at the moment with UN failures and, um, other problems with the international community, you still want to write about those and explain those and also have the contacts and the sourcing and piecing together a story. So that's the field I went to. And you know, I studied history at university partly because I wanted to know how did we get here in order to frame anything that I'm going to bring writing about. Um, and so, so that's the difficulty of one. If you're, if you're a war correspondent, I think the dangers are so much more today than they were 15, 20, 30 years ago.

Speaker 2:          03:09          It's incredible. And I think that journalism is poorer for it, especially as we're trying to understand what's happening in different conflict zones around the world. And that suddenly, you know, having a flak jacket that says press, you're almost a target. Whereas before that would be your safety. So I think that's one concern. Um, but the local journalists of course also carry different types of risks. So you know, where do you cross the line that can get you the only in trouble who can get your organization in trouble and so forth. And of course now, you know, it's funny because before sensors, if you're working in a, in a newspaper and it just have to skim the newspaper and things could pass. Whereas now, you know, with one keyword alert search can unravel a whole host of things. So it's changed for sure. And do you feel that being a political journalist in the Middle East and also being a woman poses an extra set of challenges?

Speaker 2:          04:00          I think every job has its own challenges. And I think in journalism you have different challenges, especially as we see disruption that's happening in the media industry and trying to figure out how do you get the right story, the pressure now to get a story out even if you haven't double sourced or triple sourced for confirmation. Being a woman, yes, of course has its own sets of challenges. And I also think, especially in the Middle East, um, there's certain conceptions about women in media. And I remember when I first said I wanted to go into journalism, my mother was quite this approving, um, and not because of me, but she said, you know, you'll find so many challenges and how you'll be perceived as a woman and so forth. Um, she quickly changed her mind, which was good. And my father taught me, they were really encouraging, but they were concerned because they felt that in our societies there's a certain element of prejudice against women and in the media sector, I think that's changed.

Speaker 2:          04:53          I do think opening up of everything from the variety of outlets we now have, television has changed, but it's a bit of that perception remains. And do you feel there's a good representation? And we did journalism today of women. I'm very proud of the national there is. Um, but I think across the board, no, and we still, we still face, uh, challenges. I think there are still issues primarily to do with, um, gender gaps in pay for sure. That, I think that's one of the biggest challenges. And, um, compensation is really important because that's got to do with confidence, has got to do with how you feel that you're being valued as journalists irregular, you know, regardless of your gender or your sex. So it's still a huge issue and across the board, across the world. Okay. So if we were to dig in a bit more into your career, what was the hardest interview you've ever had to do and why?

Speaker 2:          05:46          So I was thinking about this, cause you said to me, you might ask about the hardest interview. So I was really thinking about this and there are so many different ones. One that was really difficult for me, but then I was really proud of was interviewing the daughters of the lady who was killed in the suit square, that famous black water incident in Baghdad when you had, um, suddenly these young girls were orphans. Their father had died previously. Their mother had worked as a driver to try to get some sort of income to come in and she was shot with several other civilians by black water. And so I went to interview them in Jordan. It was really difficult because there's three, it had to be told, but they were so emotional. And I was also getting emotional and I was trying not to because I felt like, but they also wanted to show them empathy and I felt it.

Speaker 2:          06:34          It was really difficult to, to interview them and took a long time. And I went to visit them several times before I could even write something or have them open up. And it's always difficult with these human interest stories because you want to tell their story, but you all, we also don't want to pry. And there's a sense of, you know what, right? Do I have a complete stranger? They've just met to say, how'd you feel about your mother? How do you feel about what's happening in rock? Where is your future going? So that, that, for me it was emotionally really difficult. And then there are difficult people, like the officials that you end up having to intervene. They're not really interested in giving an interview. So it's like you ask them a question, they'll give you a one word answer and you're like, why am I doing this? Um, but they're, you know, they're part of the job, but the one, the one that, the ones that are difficult or emotional ones actually for me.

Speaker 1:          07:13          And if you were to do one more interview again, was it that was a person you've interviewed, who would it be

Speaker 2:          07:19          with somebody I've already interviewed, flustered Nodi Maliki, former prime minister of Iraq. I answered him when he was prime minister and I do quite tempted to interview him again and see where we were. Um, I think that would be quite interesting. Great. Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:36          Um, so there are Gallup polls in the u s that show a significant drop in trust in mass media in America, but um, many, many would argue that this does not apply in the Middle East. And a lot of research shows that trust in mass media is still very high. What would you say about that? What are your thoughts on it? Is there a continuous trust in mass media and are part of the world?

Speaker 2:          08:02          I think there is more trust because the alternatives in especially the Arabic language had been so weak and are so untrustworthy. So I think that's why actually more legacy media, traditional media, mass media, um, trust is there because the alternatives and when we've seen that mount of really, um, shoddy fake news, like it's so obvious that this is fake, that people don't catch onto it in the same way that you've had in other places that more sophisticated. I also think there's, there's more trust because in some way we almost know the biases of different or editorial lines of different organizations. So people know that when they're coming to it, kind of what they're receiving and then they make their judgment call. Whereas, especially in the U S I find it fascinating when I speak with American journalists, there's this thing of you know, where objective and I genuinely don't believe that.

Speaker 2:          08:53          I think everything is subjective. The headline, we choose a subjective, the photo we choose to be on the front page or the top of your homepage is subjective. Everything's subjective. Whereas in the u s for the longest time, it was always, no, everything is objective and it's a level playing field and it's not, and it doesn't necessarily have to mean that you have a bias with ill intent, but I think you do have biases based on your knowledge, on your personal experience, on who's actually in the newsroom, who's making the shot. And so I think in the u s there's less trust now because people bought into this idea that everything's objective and suddenly they're like, oh no, it's actually not. And it's hard to be. Um, so I mean, now you are British Iraqi, you grew up in Sweden and you lived in Australia and the UK. What should we know about Mina that we won't find an a quick search on Google?

Speaker 2:          09:39          Um, I think one of the things that when, when I first speak, people are always like, oh, where did the accident come from? Um, and I first learned to speak English in Australia, so I had a proper Aussie accent, but I lost. But I was a child. We lived in Australia and then I left Australia and I lost my Aussie accent. So I guess that's one thing most people don't know about me. Well you can always get it again after living in the UAE with such a mixed community you can, well you know it's funny cause my, this accent is from years of living in Saudi Arabia and then they moved to the UK when I was 15 and I never picked up a British accent. Whereas my sister who's older picked up a British accent. I don't know, maybe I watch too much Hollywood.

Speaker 2:          10:21          Um, so you were appointed editor in chief last year of four, the national. And one of the things you said where you want to take a new and fresh approach to news. What did you mean by that? Well several things. I think the most important part of any news organization newsroom is the team and how you're putting together different teams and what capabilities and how you're equipping them and think what's, and this is a challenge and we still haven't cracked at the national. And the continued to work on it is how we make sure that you give each journalist the chance to, you know, whether they're editing, whether they're using multimedia with they're writing chance to develop different ideas because you need expertise, but you also need them to break out of it. So for example, um, we try to make sure that everybody has the chance to write about either of their favorite books or you know, and they could be genuinely writing usually or just a sub editor every day, but then they have the chance to write about sports or so forth.

Speaker 2:          11:16          So giving them a more rounded approach to telling stories. And that's what we hope to do with the nationals. That's one element of it. The second element also of it is getting that balance between, yes, we have to be up to date, but we're never going to be a newswire. So there's that and that's for many newspapers. There's that tension now, right? Because you want to be the first person to break something. But that's not really our, our raise on death death is to make sure that we're giving you and analysis why do you care about this? Why is this story important? And so getting that balance right of also how, where, and we have an integrated newsroom so people are working towards our digital outlets, but also the actual physical print newspaper. So taking that approach of one, it's integrated and two, how are we understanding reader behavior and therefore making sure that our stories are being updated and developed in a way that suits the reader to come back and have fresh stories but also not getting into this rat race of we have to update every two minutes or five minutes.

Speaker 1:          12:14          And I must say, I'm not being biased here, but the national's website is probably one of the, one of the greatest new sites out there today covering the region. And if you haven't listened to the nationals podcasts, you should definitely try it out. It's, it's, it's really good and it's a good chance to go deep and have, have long form conversations. Um, thank you for saying that. I mean, the thing with the podcasts and

Speaker 2:          12:35          other things, you know, we relaunched a July, 2017 and we had a very short time to turn things around. But one of the things is, for example, on the podcasting, there were people who never sat

Speaker 1:          12:45          behind the microphone before. And so we really nervous about it and we gave them basic training. I mean, it wasn't something

Speaker 2:          12:51          long over months. We didn't have the time, a few days of it, but giving them an, equipping them with skills and then seeing who wants to do it. So rather than assigning people say you have to do this, you have to, that it was people coming forward and say, actually, yes, I think I could do that. And seeing that they have the skills. So that's been actually one of the things that I'm really proud of, the national that we've tried new things and people have been, you know, great journalists want to tell stories in different ways. Nicknames.

Speaker 1:          13:14          So news consumption is becoming more fragmented and more, um, you know, um, digital than ever before. How does that, how are you guys receiving this at the national and what are you doing to, you know, to change it and to transform into digital? You know, that's the big question I think for all newspapers. And so part of it, like I said, is understanding what our readers actually want. And you will know this, um,

Speaker 2:          13:42          is your core loyal group of readers who will always come to the national and you know, they've downloaded our app when they wake up in the morning, they have to look at other, or they go to the website and there at the moment comprising about 50% of our readership and a little over 50% are coming through search. Um, and of course Google being the primary resource for that, but also coming through social media and sharing. And so, you know, you all know this, all these changes happening to what makes you read a story. Is it because someone you trust? Again, it goes back to I'll know if trust has sent it to you and therefore you think it's worth your time. So we're trying to develop way that we have our core readers and we grow our base of the loyal readers that will always come back.

Speaker 2:          14:23          And then also catering for those people that are finding us because of a certain topic we've written about through search or social media. So that's something that you never had to worry about in newspaper before. And um, it just 15 years ago you would, you would be, what's the front page? How are we making sure that we've got a good spread of news over 40 pages? And you're kind of, that was it. And now it's completely changed in terms of prioritization and also you can't control how you're going have that experience with a reader if they're coming to you only through search or social, but you want to keep them on the page in order to stay engaged and actually think, hey, yes, the national has more to offer me then this immediate story that I'm going to. So that's really part of our every day in terms of how were curating the homepage on the website, how we're creating a curating the APP, what we're putting out through our social media feeds.

Speaker 2:          15:13          And I always say we have five outlets now at the national we have the paper, which I'm very proud of, but it's only in the UAE. So I only see it if you're in the UAE, you've got the website, which again is the main source of our readership. Now you've got the APP and we have the Ereader, which is just the basic kind of readership and that's what people a people go for. But we have the more, you know, sophisticated app that actually is more curated. And then we've got our social media feeds and then we've got the fifth element, which is our very specific products like our newsletter that lands in your inbox every morning and our podcasts and our some at times we have videos that are purely video. There's no other story to go with it cause we're also expanding our multimedia. So though, so working across those five everyday is very challenging.

Speaker 2:          15:56          It's not easy, but it's also keeping that priority of saying that's how we're reaching a greater readership. Now do you envision a day where you will start distributing your print paper, Africa quests that you know, I don't want to, I don't want to stop distributing print paper but I have to envision it because if that's where the market will go, then you have to be prepared for. I don't think that's going to happen. Um, for various reasons. One, I think there is still something to be said about reading a newspaper. Now whether my niece is three years old and when I go visit my sister, I always take the paper with me and I put it in front of her so she can play with it because I'm thinking if we can get children to play with newspapers, they're going to enjoy reading it. Like we enjoy reading newspapers.

Speaker 2:          16:37          Now when I worry about is that most toddlers and young children now are always just holding a device so they won't even know what to do with the paper. So my niece and nephew are being indoctrinate. My nephew's a year and a half. So he's still got a year or two to go, but my niece is totally indoctrinated. And so I think that experience, as long as people find joy in and having that, you know, it's an experience having your coffee and your morning paper and all of that. So long as that exists, then we'll stay. We'll stay good because I think we're competitive newspaper and people want to read us. However, if with time people's behavior, it just no longer includes that little ritual, then it's very hard to keep up. It was, we have our very own homage of, of, of newspapers at our, at our reception.

Speaker 2:          17:16          You'll go in and you'll see lots of print papers decorating our reception. Um, so I'm going to, we can start to warm up with the questions from the room. Uh, I will ask my last question here and at somewhat of a, of an existential one with spread of misinformation that, you know, we're seeing around the world today. What, how do you see the future of journalism? Uh, I know you wrote a piece for the world economic forums that the future is credibility, right? But how do you see that rolling out the future of journalism in an age where there's more and more miserable

Speaker 3:          17:49          commission?

Speaker 2:          17:52          I think as awareness is raised about this issue of this information, I do think people are more aware today than they were maybe two years ago. Right? So I think as more and more of that becomes a problem, it actually works better for journalism because you go back to the basics of journalism, which is, you know, how did we get the story? What's her source? What's the credibility behind it? Um, you know, can I, can I tell all aspects of the story if I've missed something about the aspect story, am I making my reader aware and so forth. So I think that stays true. And if you get that right with time, people will come back to it. Now how you're competing with, you know, I say as a newspaper, we compete with everything from Twitter to Google news to the economist, which used to be, no, if you're a newspaper Nooyi who cares what the economist is writing, but now you know, they're distributing here.

Speaker 2:          18:39          And we're also trying to reach an audience that's sitting in the UK or the u s so that, um, that change means that you have to be strong in your journalism in order for people to come to you rather than fake news. That's just being shared around. So I think there's more awareness and I do think it's, it's a challenge now, but with time, people are beginning to know that if you take a screen grab of a tweet and you haven't sent me the actual team tweets, it means the screen grab is something that's photoshopped and fabricated. We're still not there, but I think more people are becoming aware of that. So it's also part of our job as journalists to raise awareness about that. And I do think that media literacy with time, we'll actually be part of people's education, like to be well rounded. You're going to have to understand just like we talk about financial literacy, I think we need to talk about media literacy and understanding information. And if that really kicks in, which I think it's beginning to in certain parts, then it holds realism. Good stuff. Great. That's a great final words. Um, questions from Davao.

Speaker 3:          19:35          Thank you for joining us today.

Speaker 2:          19:51          Wow. Um,

Speaker 3:          19:54          okay.

Speaker 4:          19:55          I guess it depends where here is. So I would probably first talk about your rock because I'm a single issue voter. If I was in the U S I'd say I'm a single issue voter cause everything goes back to Iraq, which was, you know, rightly or wrongly. Um, and I think with the rocket was just failed leadership. And I think unfortunately for rock I can say that with absolute certainty, knowing the ins and outs of it all. But I think also when you, as you said, you know, I studied history. When you look at history, the impact that leadership can have at taking you on the right course of the completely wrong course, especially when many of our societies are top down. So how the top goes can really impact that. I'd say that that's probably my immediate answer. My second answer of how did we get here is also a lack of vision.

Speaker 4:          20:37          Not knowing where we want to be in four years' time, five years' time, 20 years' time, rather everything was so immediate and reactionary. And I think that's been one of our pitfalls. But I hope that I can say to her where we got to here as women, um, as societies that there are some progressive elements that we don't necessarily always see because me as a political journalist always thinks of the current affairs status, which depresses mate. But when you think about also society and how we've been able to either build bridges or push back against stereotypes, then that's also showed the strength, the strength of people. And I think, um, we've been really lucky with immigration. Um, unfortunately now we're seeing a trend against, but I think with immigration both ways, um, people coming to the region, leaving from the region, so forth, we've seen some great dynamic, I think, you know, leaps and society. And so that I would say is also people movements and people's mobility has been a good thing when it's not forced, of course,

Speaker 3:          21:37          international women's Day with your audience. Nationals, a SPEC file. Sorry,

Speaker 4:          21:53          Eh, again, you know, I think we talk about the Middle East and it's so different from country to country. And so it is kind of incredible here. Cause I, you know, this is the first I moved to upper lobby on the 1st of March, 2017 is the first time I live in the Arab world as an adult. So I've been going back and forth. I've actually never lived here as an adult. And so I had friends, I had colleagues contacting, you know, are you going to struggle as a woman? They said, actually, it's been amazing because I'm actually in a country where I feel comfortable as a woman and I genuinely mean that this is not because the camera's rolling, I genuinely mean that. And that's amazing. And I'm not sure how many other places that could say that about. Right. And I, and I go into ruminate and I find that most times people are gender blind, which is really rare anywhere in the world.

Speaker 4:          22:32          Um, and you said that, you know, we're talking about Middle Eastern women and there is that stereotype of either, you know, it's like this curious, mysterious veiled oriental woman that still exists in today's world, which was crazy or the opposite that, you know, they're old trailblazers, but then there are women that are being left behind partly because of our wider societal and political problems, especially for example, um, you know, they always talk about the impact of war on society. So in some ways it forces women to go out and perhaps take jobs they wouldn't have taken before. You know, we saw that of course with World War II and the impact it had on Europe. And part of that is happening, but at the same time, war is actually making women's rights and certain parts of the Middle East really regress. So they're often, it's linked to, you know, fear, intimidation.

Speaker 4:          23:15          How can you eliminate women? And you know, I'm, my father's family's from Muslim in Iraq and you know, mostly it was subjected to horrific reign of terror under dash. And so the only difference between my cousin's and my father left and their father had been ends basically. And so the way that it was actually women and how they were forced to get completely covered up in their identity, stripped from them and they couldn't work and they can do all these things that that targeting of women as we're seeing is actually making them regrets because after a dash goes or you know, different extremist elements go, it's still really hard to break out of it. So it's really a mixed bag. But in terms of international perceptions of Middle Eastern woman, unfortunately it's still so stereotypical and quite shallow.

Speaker 3:          24:01          Thank you very much. I have a question around kind of being fidgety and in order to get the attention in order to capture the attention of the audience, what we're seeing now in my view is images and stories that are really shocked value. And I'm not talking about fake news, I'm talking about things that are really happening. Shocking images. What's your view of that? Is this valid?

Speaker 4:          24:32          Yeah. Um, I think probably the serious story is one that increasingly we're seeing shocking images, partly because of the brutality and how horrific the situation is there. But partly, and this term really frustrates me as a journalist. You get people saying, we have reader fatigue, so we need to shock people into caring. And I say, first of all, I'm sorry you're tired. Did that people are dying and their lives are being destroyed. I find that really offensive as a term. But anyway. Um, and then the second thing of actually, you know what those shocking images, if you don't already care, I honestly don't think that's gonna make you care. It may make you stop and say, okay, why do I, you know, make you stop and I don't think it's going to make you care or move you to act because it's more brutal or more shocking.

Speaker 4:          25:13          Um, so, so that's kind of the approach we've taken up the national at the national, we have really, you know, really strict guidelines in terms of what we're actually publishing in terms of photos, in terms of headlines. Um, you know, it's really difficult because you see this image. I think most of you will conjure up now, you know, the buddies of children wrapped in white shrouds and it's been really hard for us because people were like, oh, well, you know, it tells a story of course Palestine. We had these images for decades, we've seen them coming off Palestine and it's always been a thing of, okay, but when does the dignity of that child and their family, this isn't their choice to be published. And also the shock element should be about the fact that it's happening. We can't be so graphic that we desensitize. It's difficult because now everybody can be a publisher because if I don't publish it, somebody else's going to put it on, you know, whatever page it is, whether it's a Facebook page or their own website and so forth. So then do you lose out the, the attitude we take up nationals, fine, we can lose out, but I think we need to shake people from, from complacency. And it can't be done by abusing actually the victims. So, but it's, it's constantly a conversation that we have in our newsroom.

Speaker 4:          26:33          Sure. Um, so that's of course one topic that comes up a lot. Um, and I have to say every outlet that I've either worked for or been a guest of a panel of has its own guidelines and own issues that come up and they're different. You know, there are different, whether it's commercial, whether it's political, you know, we go back to the point of, uh, Isis, do you call them isis that I should [inaudible] state. You know, I used to go on the BBC many times to discuss it and they'd be so angered because they'd say Islamic state and like, it's not the Islamic state. And the anchor would be looking at me like, can you just like leave that discussion until later? Because we need to get to where we say late. So, you know, there are those, that's one thing. And then there is the issue of freedom of expression as such.

Speaker 4:          27:15          And I think freedom of expression as a, as a concept is, is different in different societies. And it's really interesting because recently I was speaking to an American official and the way she was speaking about freedom of expression is completely different from how, for example in the UK they'd speak about freedom of expression and the whole first amendment and so forth. And then in our region it's, it's much more about looking at journalism as being responsible journalism and that has its pluses and its minuses. Because again, going back to that point, I do actually think that there are certain constraints that we placed on ourselves that we have to, and then there are certain trip tricky topics and that it would be, I think wrong, a disingenuous to say. Yeah, it's absolutely the same whether you're in the Arab world or abroad. I think it's difference the, and China's the front and Russia, um, it's a constant juggle.

Speaker 4:          27:57          And one of the things that you have to think about is one, the safety of the people who work for you too. What is the longevity of your, uh, establishment? So for example, again, you'll have certain entities that are commercial entities that you want to stay on the right side off one way or the other to make sure that you can continue and that's not the national but for other enterprises. And then there's the politics and I think you have to be really careful about what you do and how you write about. But in all seriousness and honesty, it's not a constraint for us because actually there are clear editorial guidelines that I adhere to the I believe in. And then the newsroom also adheres to, um, and is happy with it in terms of the battle of ideas. Where do we stand in the Middle East?

Speaker 4:          28:37          And especially in the Arab world, the situation wherein the right now in terms of, you know, do we believe in enforcing religion into politics? Do we believe in the use of arms outside of state rule and all of that stuff. And so we have, again, clear lines on that and that's where we stick to. Um, so for us, that's how we approach it. I think for others it comes down to what's politically acceptable, what's politically unacceptable. And there are very few, you know, people always ask me what are the red lines? I'm like, honestly there are no red lines of such, but there's an understanding of our societies and where, where we're publishing. And this goes back to the digital element because sometimes you're writing something that will work for a reader that's in your immediate vicinity. They'll be completely different if they're Australian. Um, and so we think about who's our core audience and horror core readers and we, and we stick with that. So large. You choose to ask the questions.

Speaker 3:          29:30          I touched the party museum literacy, looking at your general Arabic speaking public in the Middle East, obviously I have my own opinion about the quality, the literacy we have. I'm wondering what do you think about it? Do you think there is high media literacy in the Middle East? Because we know that there's good quality, so there are many air journalists who are doing excellent work, but there was also a lot of journalists for doing horrible work. Yeah. So what do you think about Arab media literacy and if you can improve it or if you all, do you think it's, if you think it needs approvement, what would you do?

Speaker 4:          30:05          Yeah, so, so when I say media literacy, I mean like, so I'm just making sure we're, we're on the same page. When I say media literacy, it's basically all of us, how we understand news and how we're consuming it. So it's for the reader or the consumer or the viewer. Um, I don't, again, I think it's varied from country to country, but they don't think there is a high level of media literacy in the Arab world or internationally. But if we're sticking to just the Arab world, absolutely not. There isn't enough understanding or awareness. He, you still get people saying, I read it on the Internet. Okay, congratulations. Well and to that, um, and so, so that's, you know, that's partly because technological change has happened so quickly, but partly because it's not part of our school ethos to like, actually this is not something that you teach in schools.

Speaker 4:          30:48          Again, if people have strong history classes and they understand sourcing, then it gets ingrained with that. But most of it, unfortunately in most of the Arab world history curricula is not taught that way. It's not taught for critical thinking or questioning that this actually happened the way I'm being told it's happening. So it's completely different. Um, so we don't have high media literacy. What would they change about it? I would honestly bring in classes into schools. Um, I would open up for more journalists to go and speak. When I was living in the UK, I would often go to schools and you can't actually in the u s I did this, spoke at schools and so forth. It's much more difficult here to actually have the access to go and speak about them. So I would do a program where I would have schools partner up with journalists to go and speak about these.

Speaker 4:          31:25          And again, just simple things like sourcing. How do you see if a photo is photoshopped or otherwise? Because I think that's a life skill that's really important. Um, so I would start quite young, but then also older, just simple things like you can't say, I read that on the Internet. What does that mean? And sometimes people don't even realize, but when you have that conversation and be like, Oh yeah, I, you know, I wrote an article for a shuttle also at my former employer, still people call them with them. And I wrote an article that was really popular a few weeks ago cause I said, you the reader, have a responsibility for what you're sharing. You know, you get these, what's up messages that says in Arabic come out, we'll find a need. Come on. What I'd done. And it basically says as I received it, as I go there and it's like what you, and it's rubbish, right? What they're sending it makes no sense. And you're like, how can you send this and then just write back and say it's just what like, oh, you know, I held no responsibility because you actually do all the resources that you're sharing it. So then you know, to get it to, to tell people that they actually have a responsibility as publishers. But also distributors.

Speaker 3:          32:18          Wow. Lots of questions.

Speaker 4:          32:26          Oh, this was interesting.

Speaker 3:          32:28          Good.

Speaker 4:          32:30          Yeah. Oh my God. So many. Okay. So here was this, uh, wow. I should remember this. 2011, I want to say, yeah. 2011. Okay. So I, um, interviewed American officials during the Bush administration times and the Obama Times, the Bush administration people were so much more accessible. Right? And they had, they had no red lines. They would, the only thing they would have as you only have this site, this timeframe, um, I interviewed Obama and Kerry and they were so difficult because Obama, they wouldn't even let me go see him. So we did it actually by phone. Right? So they wouldn't, and I said, I'll fly, I'll come anytime they want. They said no. And they wanted to control it completely. And the same was true actually when I, although Carrie was more fun because he actually was like, he was trying to be like, we've known each other and I don't know him, but where's, or the wound that was really controlled.

Speaker 4:          33:16          It was absolutely controlled. The questions were controlled. Um, and it was really disappointing to be honest. Um, with the Bush administration, I did an interview, um, Bush or Cheney by interviewed many others and honestly, they would just, the only constraint would be the time. Like you have half an hour do you want you want. So they really control the message and they believed, you know, I worked in Washington from the beginning 2009, so end of 2011 they believed that all we need to do is tweet something out or send you an SMS of what saying we're going to send you a speech that he's, he's, he gave and that's it. I had only one background briefing with the White House the entire time I was there. And then I had a couple of other interviews like with Ben Rhodes and other people, but they really controlled the message and I think it was to their detriment internationally.

Speaker 3:          34:05          Wow.

Speaker 4:          34:15          Um, like I said, it's, it's the, um, the only difference between me and my cousins is that my cousins didn't leave and I did. Um, but it's also incredible how resilient they are and how much fun they are. You know, I saw them recently, a few of them for people from the Middle East. Like we say, I have a cousin and there's like 45 of them minimum, like genuine, I think I have like 47 cousins. Um, and so, so it's incredible how similar we are. And I think, you know, again, that's, you know, blood, it's incredible. You know, some of my cousins I hadn't seen, my family was an exile from 1990 to 2003 so I didn't seem family for that long and we went back to Baghdad at the end of 2003 and it was incredible. Like I'd seen them just last weekend. So that's amazing how like through inheritance in three or your, I don't know, your parents' upbringing and so forth, you're so similar, but life would have been so much more, so much more difficult.

Speaker 4:          35:04          I definitely wouldn't have had most of the opportunities that I've had. Um, but I would say in terms of confidence, I see that in my cousin's in terms of aspirations and so forth, it kind of hasn't beat them down. All that, the craziness that's happened in Iraq, you know, if you are from my generation, you were born at a time when there's the Iran Iraq war, you finish that, then you had the Kuwait invasion, you finished that, you had the years of sanctions, you finished the years of sanctions, you go into the 2003 more, you go into sectarian strife, you go into isis. And here we are today. So you know, people who of that generation, and especially actually for, for many men who were slightly older who actually had to be drafted into the army, it's heartbreaking because you know, the years that they spent being drafted into these senseless wars. Um, so I think if I had stayed in Iraq and if I was a man, that would have been actually that much worse. Um, but at the same time, I think I would probably be very similar in character because of what my parents have instilled in me

Speaker 3:          36:08          question that on texting would be, journalists will actually push the button. Yeah. Yeah. It costs them to being explosive.

Speaker 4:          36:36          Yeah. And we do on certain things. So again, it's a fine line and it's a negotiation. It's a negotiation with yourself, with your editor. It's not an ego. There's no external power that comes and tells you do, do not. You know, we don't, I mean, I definitely the Emirates, we don't live in that landscape. I think it's different depending on the country, your rent. So there's no, but it's one, it's an appreciation and understanding, um, of what would be acceptable, what isn't acceptable. Um, but, and I mean to political power is the only two to audiences, so, so it's your own understanding, socio negotiation. There are things that you choose and you say, no, I'm going to push on this. And we have had issues like that. And to be frank, I mean touch with, before I jinxed myself, um, since July 1st until now, there's not been one thing that you've had somebody turn around and say, no, you cannot write that.

Speaker 4:          37:21          Now. Does that mean that we're careful and therefore we haven't pushed? I think we have pushed on certain issues. I mean, I don't know how frequently read national, but we do try, especially on issues that we think are of public interest and, and that is, it's kind of like our guiding force. But again, I don't mean to belittle it, but I just don't, it really isn't that big a constraint once you know what you want to be out there saying I'm why you're working in the Middle East. I mean there is a joy to working from here to be able to say there's a publication coming out from the Arab world that is able to tackle issues, you know, social issues, but also political issues, question certain things. Again, no easy, we're not going to do it irresponsibly. But there a joy in being able to do that.

Speaker 3:          38:04          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          38:06          Any more questions? Okay. I guess last question. This is going to be a fun one. Oh good, good, good note to end up. Good positive note to end on. So we're having, you mentioned that media right now we access videos where our phones before we have to wait to wait by the newspaper and all that. So if you get to define one kind of like logical advancements or like something in the Internet of things that would basically either had people to reach out to India or to read the media or to be more informed and to get actual news instead of fake news. Um, what would be like your dream you device or you mentioned?

Speaker 4:          38:48          Okay. So, so I have to answer is because my first answer is, did you, did you guys ever see the movie minority report? Right. So that image of Tom Cruise, yeah, it was Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise, who's in Emirates. Um, some cruise holding the newspaper that gets updated automatically, which I guess is like the modern day tablet, but I wish it could be a newspaper that gets updated. So that's like kind of my crazy dream. If I could have anything, my newspaper would stay updating while still being in newspaper. Um, but if I can't have that, my second thing is, I guess is exactly the point that you said about fake news. So if there's a way that we can distinguish trusted news sources and not trusted, or even if they're trusted, kind of like, who's the ownership? Like let people know, what's the ownership, where is that coming from? What does that, but there's a way that we can signal that so people know what to take. I want us to take that would be

Speaker 2:          39:36          the dream. Great. Um, Amena on behalf of all Googlers, I thank you very much for sharing such candid thoughts and insights with us. Um, thank you again and please do stay around and have some great food at all healthy. We promise. And thank you again, thanks to Songo Dina and Maria
