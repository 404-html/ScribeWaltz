Speaker 1:          00:09          Thanks.

Speaker 2:          00:09          Thanks very much. And thanks for inviting me. I should say I'm no longer the chief has story and although I still do some work with the Foreign Office, but that is a bit relevant. So I'm just going to say a little bit about where I'm coming from on this before I talk about the subject of the book. Um, the Foreign Office these days is the only major department to state that employs a Kadra professional historians within it. And other departments used to have them, but they didn't have them anymore, which some of it I'm so sorry about. And the historians have two main roles. One is to publish a series of books, which are the official history of British foreign policy, but the other is something called historical advice to ministers and senior officials. Now that can be absolutely anything. It can be a very small thing. Like I'm in this to wanting a joke for a speech.

Speaker 2:          00:56          Not very often. They're not usually very funny. Um, or else they think they can make their own jokes, which is very dangerous, but it can be major pieces of research. And really the the principal role of the historian says that when there is a current policy issue that has some kind of historical controversy behind it and there are an awful lot of those as you would appreciate. That's when the historians come in. Now, I joined the phone office at very, very, very long time ago and even when I joined there's an obvious letter was all ready. One of those things that kept coming back and kept coming back and because it's one of those things that a lot of people have heard of, but very few people know what it is. I'm going to just say a little bit about it in a moment to just finish my own social did a bio graphical bit while I was working as chief historian, I got more and more drawn into intelligence history and that's not really what I special that was in various aspects of it.

Speaker 2:          01:59          So obviously isn't over yet is an intelligence story though these days it's better known as what they call a classic case of disinformation, which is something that I hope it's of interest to all of you here in the sorts of business who are in. So, um, let me say a little bit about the lecture itself. Now, this document was the letter supposedly written by a man called [inaudible] who was the head of the Bolshevik propaganda organization in Soviet Russia after the revolution in 1917. Uh, and it was written to the British Communist Party, basically telling them to up their game a bit in kind of agitation, uh, and to lobby on behalf of a treaty which had been negotiated, which would mean a for Soviet Union. We don't need to go into too much detail here, but the point about this latter is it normally if it was always sending letters to communist parties all over the world, um, exhorting them to greater revolutionary fervor.

Speaker 2:          02:58          I said there's nothing particularly special about the APP. What makes it, this is an you have letter of special is when it arrived, which is in 1924 or nine, 1924 saw the first ever Labour government in London took office in January, 1924. Uh, one of the first things it did was to recognize the Soviet Union. There you are as opposed to de facto said it was a, it was a big deal for the Soviet Union to have official recognition and then the government among other things was involved in negotiating these treaties with Russia, which by the summer of 1924 had been signed in draft but had not yet gone through parliament. Now the, the traditional ruling parties or Britain at the time, the Conservatives and the liberals on the other side, they both thought it would be a good idea to let labor take office for a while and basically bugger things up.

Speaker 2:          03:55          Perhaps I shouldn't say that on Youtube. I'm sure I can. Um, so that they could show that they were unfit to Gavin. Actually, they done far better than anybody expected. And by the summer of 1920 fourth, both the other parties were getting a bit restive and everything. It was about time to get rid of them and there was a scandal, uh, which involved a threat to prosecutor, a certain writer, and then they withdrew it. I mean, we won't go into all of that when we can talk about stuff. It was essentially during the summer of 1924 the evidence suggest that the Russians were not sending inflammatory letters because they didn't want the Labor government to fall. However, the Labor government did resign in October, the beginning of October, 1924 over a vote, losing a vote of no confidence. So you're going to have a general election.

Speaker 2:          04:45          It's at this point that the letter arrives. Now I should point out that one of the disinformation factors in this whole story is that nobody has ever seen what you might call an original of this document. There's no letter in any paper for the only text we really have is a text that was sent in a telegram from the Secret Intelligence Services Station in Riga in Latvia to secret intelligence headquarters in London at the beginning of October, 1924 and although a lot of people afterwards claiming to have alternative texts, the evidence all indicates that they are all read translations of that original telegram. Uh, as, as a complicated story, we don't need to have all the details, but the point is when it arrived, the government resigns and that the, uh, the wraps and Mcdonald, the prime minister asked the king to dissolve parliament and corn elections who called an election on the 8th of October, 1924 on the 9th of October.

Speaker 2:          05:53          This telegram comes in to the secret intelligence service, which is what book you now might think of as they're, my sex was called at that time. And my sex is the second world war termination. But it's sis is what it was in the usual way of these things. Any kind of report that it was taught, it was taught entailed. It was the, the things that could identify it as an intelligence report where it moved from it and then it was circulated to the Foreign Office and to certain other white taught apartments. At the same time rumors began circulating in London that there was some kind of inflammatory document around, nobody quite knew what it was. Certain people started claiming there. Got It even though they didn't have it, but essentially it one way or another it was leaked to the press a bit to the right wing press in particularly and to conservative central office.

Speaker 2:          06:47          So that during the general election campaign, the whole letter, uh, became a big labor bashing instrument. And the reason for that was that the right wing interest claimed that the letter showed clearly that Labour was in thrall to the reds in Moscow and that they could not be trusted. And therefore, uh, now, so all through the campaign, there are rumors about this letter and it was eventually published by the Daily Mail. Who else one might say on the 25th of October, the election was taking place on the 29th. Now, there are all sorts of complicating factors in this. One of which is the official response to the letter. As I said, it's an obvious, I've sent lots of documents like this and that. First nobody seemed to pay too much attention to it. They didn't think it was different to anything else, but then they started to worry about it in the foreign office because partly of there being a general election campaign and because they felt it was so outrageous, there had to be some kind of official response because if the letter where to believed and spread around and it looked as if they hadn't done anything about it, that would look reflect badly.

Speaker 2:          08:02          So our response was drafted in the Foreign Office and the draft, sorry, follow me on this cause this, this bit of it is important. That slightly obscure the draft note of protest from Britain to Soviet Russia was sent from the Foreign Office two ramps. We Mcdonald who was both foreign secretary and prime minister at this point. He's in Wales campaigning for the general election. So he's not in London. He's actually by himself. It's not like it is today. He was on his own with just a typist, no advisors, no secretaries know nothing. He gets the draft, he amends it quite extensively and he sends it back to the Foreign Office. At this point, the permanent under secretary, which is the top official in the Foreign Office, decides that the amended version must be what Mcdonald really wants to send, and he gives that version to the press and he also gives the text of it does not have left it to the press so that they are both published on that fateful 25th of October.

Speaker 2:          09:05          Now, McDonald claimed that he had lots of tall intended that his amended draft should be sent out and published. He wanted it to come back again so that he could sign off on the revision. This has never been satisfactory because later on there are some documents missing from the file. Good old stories and mystery stories says that it's impossible to be absolutely sure, but whatever happened, it's not actually the content of this document. It's what was done with it, which makes it important and which qualifies it as a a disinformation document. Now the difficulty is you can say, okay, is this information, but by whom, against whom and for what purpose is much more difficult gauge because it very soon began to be suspected that this document was not actually from synovium at all, that it had been forged. Some people said Labor, the believer party having lost the election, although this didn't lose the election for them, that they lost the election.

Speaker 2:          10:08          They then accused the, when everybody really the Conservative Party civil service, the intelligence services, everybody they regarded as the establishment, they accused them of concocting this document in order to damage Labor's prospects in the campaign then, but the question is who did actually forge it and we still absolute, you don't have a definitive answer there. There are lots of possible candidates, indeed it could conceivably have been concocted in this country. That is less likely I think, but there are very many different constituencies, all of whom had an interest in causing trouble in the British political establishment or indeed causing trouble in Moscow. Because it is possible that even if so, Navea didn't write it, it might've been forged, um, as part of a, at in trouble Shimik power struggle because at this point we knew that starling was trying to discredits and IVF who was one of his rivals.

Speaker 2:          11:11          And so there's a possibility that it was actually done to disrupt Bolshevik politics. It may have been forged by what we call white Russian interests. That is the people who were against the Bolsheviks, but who were Russians, a lot of whom were in exile and in Germany or in France, uh, and in the Baltic states, busily intriguing and trying to get rid of the Bolshevik regime in Russia. And then of course, you've got the whole convoluted state of British politics as well. So everybody was accusing everybody else without ever being able to quite get to the bottom of it. But it became known as a political dirty tricks, uh, example that was raised in successive elections time after time. In fact, there isn't a decade since the light to twenties when there's an Avia of letter has not been raised in the media or in politics or in the course of an election in 2017 during the election campaign in 2017 you may remember there were all kinds of things in the press about how some remarks made by European Commission officials might've been deliberately placed in water to interfere with the electoral process.

Speaker 2:          12:31          I mean, you know, uh, it was just like there's an Avia have led to this. It's one of those things that people bring up. The real truth of it is very difficult to ascertain because you know, it is a very long time ago now. I came into this story. Well, it, as I said, when I joined the Foreign Office, it was already one of those countries, cities that never quite went to bed. But then in the 1990s when the Labor government came in, when the Blair government came in, uh, it came up again with a vengeance. And in 1998 a book was published. This book was written by Nigel West, which is the pen name of a, a former Tory MP, Rupert Talison and a former KGB colonel called Alexander. Off this book was called the crown jewels. And the crown jewels was the codename for information given to the Russians by the so called Cambridge spies, you know, Philby Burgess and Clayton and lunch and so on.

Speaker 2:          13:30          And this book purported to have all sorts of stories about British history based on that information that was held in Russia having been transmitted by traitors. There was a chapter in this book on the [inaudible] of letter, which said it had definitely been written by a man called per Croskey, Yvan Procroft Ski, who was a former Cyrus officer. Uh, the, the book caused quite a stir in this country. There were questions in parliament on the lines of why do we have to read about our history on the basis of what traitors have given to Russia and the Foreign Secretary who was then Robin Cook. At first, he was absolutely astonished that anybody could get exercised about something that had happened in 1924 but then you soon realized that in the Labour party there's an obvious letter was still very much a sore point and a hot issue. And so he ordered an investigation.

Speaker 2:          14:31          Now the complicating factor of course is that the real evidence on all this lies in the archives of the UKS intelligence agencies. Um, and in particularly in sis archives which are not open to the public. And this is how I came into it because he stood up in the House of Commons over my, there have been a number of occasions when a minister has stood up in parliament and said, I have ordered investigation from my historians. They never tell you this beforehand. You just find out afterwards, however he said precisely this. And so my role was, cause I have privileged access to these archives, was to go in and to try and find out the truth. He still didn't really believe that anybody could be terribly exercise to pass something that happened so long ago. But he was sitting disabused of that. And when the official report at the end of my investigation was published in 1999, there were lots of messages that came in to the Foreign Office saying that their relations or somebody had been involved in it all.

Speaker 2:          15:35          They all wasn't it. There was one particular guy who was a very, uh, if you do read this book, there's a very strange guy called Donald in Thorne who despite his name was actually British conservative. Uh, his son got in touch with me after the report was published to say my father wouldn't never have been involved in anything like this. His grandson who was living in Italy at the time sent me a fax saying, I always knew my grandfather was involved in this. So, so even Robin Kolbe was convinced that you can't quite put this knob here of data to bed. Now we didn't manage to get to the bottom. Everything could. I did go to Moscow as part of this investigation, which was very interesting. This was actually in the fairly brief ish period between the end of the Cold War. And when things didn't go quite so well when actually relations with Russia were pretty good.

Speaker 2:          16:31          Uh, they cooperated in, in our investigations and they were very, uh, very helpful to me. And so, you know, it was all absolutely fine at the time because they have an interest too. And you are often, you know, ever since I did this, I keep an alert on my name on Google, on hold. You'll be glad to know part, not just to be being Darrious I showed you because you get particularly ration websites saying, Jill Bennett has said x or y. I mean, I never have, and there's nothing I can do about it, but I like to know that somebody said it, if you see what I mean, because you never know when you're going to be ambushed. It's part, it's just kind of the fixture. And it's partly to do with this particular story, which remains inflammatory nearly a hundred years later. There has, there were definite accusations that the British intelligence community were involved in this whole thing.

Speaker 2:          17:26          And that indeed they concocted the letter. I think the idea of them concocting their letter is unlikely. I think it's entirely possible that some members of the sis, including a man called Desmond Morton, whom I also wrote a book about who was a very, very secret squirrel, um, that he knew this letter was forged a and he and certain other people in the told you this community what absolutely have no time for the Labour party smooth just on its way into the public domain, shall we say. And we're not displeased at the way it was used, but it is, it is certainly a case of just information. It was smearing the Labour party in a way that was unfair because actually they were absolutely not in thrall. They were very anticommunist. Uh, they will not in thrall to Moscow, but of course, even in the 1920s, and this is actually one of the contemporary lessons of this episode today.

Speaker 2:          18:22          Everybody talks now about disinformation, fake news, whatever you want to call it, going around the world in seconds because of the Internet and digital communications generally. Of course that's true. But even in the 1920s as story could get around pretty damn quickly and it only had to be mentioned in the press and it had legs and those legs could run an offer on way. So it's not, there's no kind of enormous change it and how you might deal with disinformation is not that different. Um, the kind of techniques that were developed at the time to try and how do you counter this? How do you look at stories which you think might be false and the techniques that are used in the intelligence services. First of all, you look at the source, what do you think the source was, but also you tried to look at intent, you know, in the military parlance capability plus intent equals threat.

Speaker 2:          19:24          If you, you know, look at where your think the story is coming from and what interest, whoever it is you think it might be, might have. And that does help a to try and identify this information and be to try and think how you might be able to respond to it. And actually they perhaps didn't, we certainly didn't use those terms in the 1920s, but there were people who were trying to do that. Then, um, I just want to mention one, particularly a tricky character and all the story who illustrates the kind of problems that they were faced. There is a man called Vladimir all off. Now, all of how the distinction of having worked in the Cyrus to see police in the Bolshevik secret police and then for white trashing organizations in exile, he set up a forgery bureau in Berlin in the 1920s he was given accomodation and facilities by German intelligence.

Speaker 2:          20:21          He was paid money by French intelligence, by SIS, by Red Russians, and by white trash bins. And he and his colleagues manufactured documents to order. It doesn't mean they were all absolutely false, but they were expert. And so trying to find out whether a document like there's an Avia of letter really was true. It was almost impossible because after all, you know, Bolshevik Rachios is routed in, in a, it's my secret state. They're not going to tell you much about it and it's an Avia abs own reaction to it was why I didn't actually write that one, but then somebody put it in front of me, I would have signed it. It was not terribly reassuring. Wedding Orloff characters like all off and he was not the only one. Make the whole story pretty tricky and make it difficult to really get to the bottom of this and all through the decades it comes up, as I said in general elections, it came up during a Labour government, Harold Wilson's two governments when of course Harold Wilson already rather paranoid about the activities of the intelligence agencies.

Speaker 2:          21:33          You know in the background of labor is Nothi of letter is, it's very much something to come to you with. As I was just saying to one of you beforehand, Jack Straw, foreign secretary, former foreign secretary with whom I work quite closely when he was there, he says it's an OBF letter is mother's milk to him. His father who had been a plumber and who was a labor activist and a trade union is his father had taught him about the an you have letter when he was a little boy, as a classic example of the kind of things that the establishment does to do labor down. Well, you know, he's not the only one who takes that view. Another factor, the fact, I'll stop for a moment for questions, but another person I need to bring you to this story is Kim Philby, who I'm sure you all know about it.

Speaker 2:          22:21          Of course he's one of the Cambridge spies, but there was a major investigation across my tall investigation in the 60s that was done, um, as a direct result of the defection of Philby. Now, Philby of course, had been suspected in the 50s and indeed left eye size, but he'd been exonerated. He bluffed it out. Essentially they couldn't get the evidence and sis kept on defending him and saying they were sure he was not a traitor. So that when he did actually defect in 1963, it was an enormous shock and normal shop to the whole of the intelligence establishment. And they got together the different agencies and they said, look, if this can have happened and we didn't know what else might there be. So they formed a committee to try and go back through the history of operations of the intelligence services, to look at other cases where there might've been disinformation, uh, you know, something trip treachery that they have not detected.

Speaker 2:          23:23          And one of the cases they looked at was this is an awfully of letter. And they commissioned a formidable lady called Millicent Baggott, who just retired from her, my five to run this, uh, inter into departmental organization and inquiry. And she did very much what Jairus to do. 30 years later, she went, looked in all the intelligence archives and so on. But of course in the 1960 is you couldn't admit that, am I six or am I five or GCHQ actually existed. They were not yet on the legislative 14. They hadn't been allowed. You weren't allowed to talk about, you weren't allowed to release a document that referred to any of the agencies by name or that indeed referred to their activities. So everything that she did was under wraps and indeed her report has never been published. Although I was lucky enough to be able to draw on it extensively when I came out.

Speaker 2:          24:22          Now the camp I do mine, um, investigation, of course the whole legislative framework has changed and all the agencies were on a legislative 14. You were allowed to know that they existed. You are allowed even to mention their heads. And so it was much easier to then be able to talk about in our report to talk about what sis or am I five and really have been doing in the years beforehand. Now it's still hasn't gotten away. Um, I was asked if I would like to write a book about this because it kept coming back. I mean, we didn't put it to bed in 1999. It comes up again and again. It came up in the referendum campaign. Um, when there was a, an article, for example, criticizing the way that the daily mail were laying into David Cameron during the, um, during the referendum, the referendum campaign because of him, you know, obviously, um, campaigning that perhaps not very hard for remaining.

Speaker 2:          25:22          This is just like what they did to Ramsey Mcdonald's over this offering of letters said it comes back when I actually started looking for mentions of it, I found they were, they were everywhere. Um, and so it is literally the conspiracy that never dies. And although I've moved, I hope the debate on a bit in that, in the end, I do think that Perkowski who was fingered in the 1998 book, it's certainly a very credible candidate, but who asked him to do it, I don't know. And there are still any number of candidates, which means that although I've been able to bring a lot more stuff out into the open, it's not dead yet. And the message of the book really is that good conspiracies never die. How going to stop there and take questions. Okay.
