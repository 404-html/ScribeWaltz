Speaker 1:          00:08          [inaudible] I told you they would.

Speaker 2:          00:33          Tina, Tina Fey grew up in Pennsylvania. She spent a lot of time in Chicago, big fan of second city. She ultimately became the lead writer in Saturday night live. And from there architected one of the most successful shows on television and from there had a huge impact in the last few years on politics and media and so forth, and perhaps most important. She announced last week that she's pregnant with her second child.

Speaker 1:          01:12          Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:13          They'll Google. Thank you so much. It's so nice to be here

Speaker 2:          01:16          now. So I've been reading your book. I read it and I want to start with a, with a reading.

Speaker 1:          01:26          Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:26          I hope it's something about one of my periods are,

Speaker 1:          01:30          yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:31          here's a lot in the book about women things, which I'm not gonna I'm not gonna quote from, but now every girl is expected to have Caucasian Blue Eyes, full Spanish lips, a classic button nose hairless Asian skin with a California is Tan, a Jamaican dance hall, ass long, Swedish legs, small Japanese feats. The abs have a, and I'm going to omit the rest. The person closest to actually achieving this look as Kim Kardashian, who as we know was made by Russian scientist to sabotage our athletes. Everyone else is struggling. What does this mean?

Speaker 3:          02:09          This is a, uh, a little section in the book about the state of, of being a a woman in 2010. I was in the book, I talk about when I grew up in the seventies and eighties. You were good looking or not and if you weren't good looking you could just like learn a trade and just relaxing and um, there's this kind of feeling now that if you are not good luck, good looking, you are to Frankenstein yourself until you are, you are to buy new teeth and hair and other assets. And so that's, that's what we're living with now. Eric, that's a really,

Speaker 2:          02:43          so her, her book is, is wonderful. It's the funniest book you'll ever read and it's book not only about her growing up and all of the things that happened to her as a, as a young woman as well as a professional woman, but a lot about life. And so it has a lot of lessons. It. So for example,

Speaker 3:          03:01          stop, I've got a gun, the gun, the gun, I gave you five wedding anniversary. Eric, how could you, we're not married, we're not married. Is it denial? We've learned our first improv lesson.

Speaker 1:          03:19          It takes a long time to learn. This is the,

Speaker 3:          03:22          with an engineer trying to learn it. It's, it takes a long time, uh, to, to learn those basic rules of Improv or why don't you take us through them. And they were in the bus or they're in the book because I was an improviser at second city and at a place called the Improv Olympic, um, in Chicago. And, and I talk in the book about Improv having really kind of changed my professional life and even sort of my world view a little bit. Um, there are some basic rules of improvisation when you're creating something out of nothing. That's the first rule is to agree, which is to say yes, which we did do that successfully. You said freeze. I have a gun and I, I didn't say that's not a gun. That's your finger. Which is what a Google person would say. Yeah. Okay. Um, and uh, so we, we agreed and the next rule is, is yes. And which is to add on to what you've already agreed upon. So the gun, the gun I gave you for our wedding anniversary, how could you, and then we hit a brick wall,

Speaker 1:          04:20          Eric.

Speaker 3:          04:22          You know, it's funny cause it's very, some very famous comedians have, there's an old story about Joan Rivers was at the second city briefly in 1959, 1960. And, and they use this in class at second city. All the time that there was someone came in, you know, so that I want a divorce was the beginning of the scene. She said, I want a divorce. And whoever was with her on stage, she said, but what about the children? And she said, we don't have any children, which in the moment got a big laugh, which stops, it's killed the scene. Um, so that's, uh, it's a very, it's a, my response would be human instincts. We have children. I just didn't tell you. That's why we're getting divorced.

Speaker 1:          04:55          Yes. I have some other children. Yes, this is exactly what, yeah. Okay. Got It.

Speaker 3:          05:04          Hi. For me it was this a lot about um, being open, you have to be open to any possibility and you're being open to the fact that I did an idea that you stumble upon together is likely to be more interesting than the idea that you started with as individuals. And I thought all that stuff was very helpful as a writer. So, so when you, when you were growing up, did you, did you know that you would be funnier than everybody else? No. I will tell you this. When you were 13 no, people did not say like, Oh, you're so funny. I think you, I think mostly what comedian people in comedy, no, at a certain age is that they want to be funny. You know what I mean? I think that you know that you're really interested in it and you want to do it and then you don't know for a long time. I mean, I think at 13 year it's manifested itself as annoying and then you hone it for like 25 years

Speaker 1:          05:56          and sometimes still annoying.

Speaker 2:          06:01          One of the people who was, I think the biggest influence on you is, is Lauren Michaels. And you have in the book, you have a lot of discussion about, about Morgan and his rules. He has a rule for example, that don't work with people. You can't hang out with a three in the morning. Yeah. Rule, never hire anyone that you don't want to run into by the bathroom at three o'clock in the morning. And he has another rule about Harvard people and people who didn't go to college.

Speaker 3:          06:25          Yes. Um, some of these wheels are, you know, they're not necessarily some of the things that he's actually says out loud and some are things that I just sort of gathered from spending a lot of time with him. Um, but he, he's just somehow knew that there was a, um, the best mix for Saturday night live. And to me, I tried to apply it at 30 rock was to take a mix of Harvard people, uh, or Harvard style people. Um, very cerebral, very organized, um, well, and then to mix them with kind of visceral, um, fun sort of Chicago people. So you take,

Speaker 2:          06:59          these are two rather broad brushes,

Speaker 3:          07:01          but I've been mixing, you take like I'm, you know, I'm trying to give hard people, you went, you take Conan O'brien and you put him with Chris Farley. You know what I mean? And then that is a mix that makes for a good sketch comedy because when one gets too cerebral, the other one pulls, you know, pulls it, pulls it out, and it's, it actually does work in too much of one or the other usually is not good.

Speaker 2:          07:24          Yeah. You have another rule. Never tell a crazy person. He's crazy. What's prompted that rule?

Speaker 3:          07:32          It just, it, it, it doesn't never get you, uh, what you, you know, if someone comes to you in a workplace situation, what sort of a strange demand or, and confused like you, they've had a problem that you, yourself, you know, um, don't see as a problem. It, it's not really useful to say like, you're being crazy right now. It doesn't really solve the situation. Um, just makes them more upset, which, yeah, it just makes them not trust you. And it's something I, cause it's my instincts that I learned to kind of, to move away from lists to be like, stop being crazy. Just everybody, just be cool. Just really like a good management technique.

Speaker 1:          08:10          Okay. We'll try to just be cool.

Speaker 3:          08:12          Everyone does knock it off.

Speaker 1:          08:16          We

Speaker 2:          08:19          now, I think the most common question that you get of all is about gender differences in comedy, comedy writers, comedy shows and so forth. And alarmingly in your book, you actually do say that there's a difference.

Speaker 3:          08:34          I admit to the, the secret core difference that, um, that between male and female comedy writers usually, you know, I, I try to, he will ask me that question a lot. What's the difference between men and women comedy where they like, and, uh, usually I try to just be so boring that they lose interest, um, in the answer and walk away. Uh, but because I always say, you know, well, there's a tremendous amount of overlap in the middle of what men and women and all people find funny. And then at the outset, you know, men kind of maybe like sharks and robots doing things more than women. You know, the masturbating bear, it was over here and then serve. We're here. It's like absolutely fabulous, but some kind of detailed character study things. Um, but the truth is that, um, the, uh, the secret truth is that sometimes the men urinating cups.

Speaker 1:          09:28          Okay.

Speaker 3:          09:29          I don't know if that happens here

Speaker 2:          09:34          first. I've heard of it if it's true here.

Speaker 3:          09:36          Um, I think it was, and I said certainly not all of them, but just to see me, you know, you compare two zero of them.

Speaker 1:          09:45          Can you imagine the women trying to do that in their office?

Speaker 3:          09:47          This is really so much fun,

Speaker 1:          09:50          although not impossible. I think

Speaker 2:          09:52          maybe we should move to this section

Speaker 1:          09:54          of the book.

Speaker 3:          09:57          Also the way the men sometimes pretend to rape each other and the women never do that

Speaker 1:          10:04          ideal in generalizations, but never do it,

Speaker 2:          10:12          shall we? So we moved to the next section of the book.

Speaker 1:          10:15          Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:16          What did you want to add anymore?

Speaker 1:          10:17          No, that's it. Okay. Nope.

Speaker 2:          10:22          This book also has a lot of information. That's very helpful. As you become enormously famous and successful and one of them for yourself was how to pose. Yes. How do be photographed to be photographed and your photograph, you've been photographed on everything and you know, you're now widely, widely recognized. Can you tell the story of, as a comedy writer, nobody knew who you were and now you're recognized everywhere. Everywhere.

Speaker 3:          10:44          Yeah. It's a weird thing. Um, and I have actually been photographed in a lots of kind of formal model like settings kind of a lot of times now. And it's, uh, it is one of the most fun things you will ever do if you, uh, people like to pretend to complain about it and say it's hard. It is delightful. Um, okay. You are treated too. You know, like you're treated like a queen. You're riding like anything you want to eat. Do you want us to some kind of special coffee or do you, and it's like so some beautiful loft space and the um, and then they try to put clothes on you that are um, made for their doll clothes and they, um, and did you should know that he's, see anyone you ever see in a magazine, they're clothes are gaping open in the back with like large metal clamps holding it. I don't care who it is and what's the best way to pose that's my pose is um, uh, first to, uh, you have to let go of any rational understanding that what you're doing is ridiculous. And so you have to proceed as if it's the going very well. You need to make as many angles with your body as possible. It's just like that's how you look

Speaker 1:          11:55          really any kind of a left. Like you tried it,

Speaker 3:          12:03          try to look like you took a Benadryl.

Speaker 1:          12:06          That's 30 minutes ago. There are a lot of tricks,

Speaker 3:          12:15          but most of it is just pretending like you have to abandon your own sort of intelligence of like, this is insane.

Speaker 1:          12:23          Okay.

Speaker 2:          12:27          Well, your relationship, it's interesting that you chose Alec Baldwin and you didn't, you and Lauren tried to hire him. He, he initially was, it was not sure in the, he sort of said yes and you talk, what's in the book in an interview is about your view of him. Let me just read it. So I think it's actually worth hearing everything I learned about real acting, I learned from watching Alec Baldwin, I real acting, I mean an imitation of human behavior that is both emotionally natural and mechanically precise enough to us. It tears are laughing from humans. He's a master. He can play the emotion at the core of a scene. He's falling in love. His mother is torturing, his mentor has been reincarnated as a peacock while reciting long speaks his word for word, it hitting all the jokes with the right rhythm. You like Alec Baldwin,

Speaker 3:          13:10          he's very good at acting. Yeah, I do like him

Speaker 1:          13:14          and P and a law.

Speaker 2:          13:17          The two of you carry the show as best I can tell. I, yeah, we're sort of, and, and the, the, the, the sort of the, the interaction between the two of you. He, the, um, just say, uh, overly self confident executive and you the very, very well meaning writer. Uh, tell me about, tell me about how it actually works. Do you, the stuff is written for you guys. Do you guys invented funny by himself?

Speaker 3:          13:47          He is funny by himself, but this, the show is very much a written, it's, we shoot the show on film and a lot of um, shows, uh, are shot on high def video, but we shoot on film. Um, we sort of got in under the wire. Uh, they don't really let people do that very much. He works, it's more expensive, but it's also more kind of, yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:09          And as you can tell by that, it's time for another time for another one of those is Benadryl, those things. But um,

Speaker 3:          14:20          uh, and so we don't have time to alter very much during our shooting day. We shoot about 12, 14 hours a day. And so our, we have an excellent writing staff and they write for him. And we do a table reads of the scripts about a week before. So, um, we, you know, read the thing allowed for a group of about 25 people. Um, and we, um, and so, you know, we all have the chance to kind of respond to the script. Then a phallic has any thoughts. Then he gives them a, we do a rewrite of it and then by the, by the time we're rehearsing and shooting on the floor, things are pretty much locked down. Every now and then you do find something fun in the moment. That is that thing I'm talking about Harvard and humanity coming to meet. Um, it's sometimes you, you have to, you know, the, the Harvard brain, I still let them be like, okay, these, these humans think they've didn't found something in the moment. We'll let them do it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          15:11          MMM.

Speaker 3:          15:13          And uh, and that's sort of how it goes. So then we rehearsed and then we, and leave.

Speaker 2:          15:19          Yeah. B. I wanted to talk a little bit about, you know, you were, you were sort of pretty famous and then the Sarah Pailin maneuver came along and what really happened was she became a national Canada and people began to notice a resemblance. And for a six week period, you were number one topic in a national media of America. Let's talk about how that felt.

Speaker 3:          15:43          Yeah, it was very weird. I went from being what I would describe as kind of comfortably famous, which was if anyone knew me from Saturday night live or from 30 rock, it was because they hadn't really watched it. And you know, uh, um, and that, that jump, uh, of that kind of, uh, more just arbitrary, um, uh, fame that it's, it's, it's very strange. But

Speaker 2:          16:11          when you were originally opposed to doing it, well, I, you didn't want her on the show, right?

Speaker 3:          16:15          I was, I was talking to Laura about doing it cause it was this kind of thing where people just notice that we had a vague resemblance and brown hair and glasses. You know, I saved the, if she, if Sarah Palin had chosen contact lenses 10 years ago, I would not be with you right now. Cause it was that, that basic glasses, brown hair thing and people need, people somehow knew that I had been at SNL. No one, no one seemed to notice that I did not work there anymore.

Speaker 3:          16:46          That I had a new program that was done not for two years and a, and that even that when I did work there, I only did the news, but people were like brown hair glasses. And we get it, we want it. And I, but I knew that I, you know, that was, I had, I knew people who were real impressionists, people like Darrell Hammond and, um, and in Dana Carvey who really, this is truly a gift that they have. And that's why I was reluctant at first. But then once we ended up doing it, it was really fun. And then about six, seven weeks into it, um, so I wanted to come. Yeah. And I was again, reluctant because it was, um, it was, the election was getting sort of weird and, and there was ugly. Um,

Speaker 2:          17:28          well all of a sudden people are dealing with you. Yeah. Is that, did they think you are a sailor Sarah Pailin, right. Or they think you hate Sarah Pailin know and all of a sudden all of the bad starts to politics come out.

Speaker 3:          17:39          Yeah. And I did find that there was a, um, there was a weird gender difference in that people, uh, would, I would accidentally, you know, put on cable news during the day just to get ready to go to SNL too. And I would see someone and say, I saw a guy on there once I'm talking about, I was like, he was just thought that I had really conducted myself badly and she had been so gracious about this. I was like, I'm just doing sketches and people, you know, uh, I think there was a perception that it was, uh, mean, uh, so, and some parts of the media because, um, and I think that was because it was two women that that was the only way they could process it was what was mean. No one ever thought it was mean of welfare all to play George Bush. No one thought it was, you know, mean of Darrell Hammond to, to play Bill Clinton. It was a strange difference. Um,

Speaker 2:          18:27          and she was in fact gracious to you personally. We had a perfect, had a nice chat yet we later she said she complained about your role in her campaign.

Speaker 3:          18:35          Yeah, she did. Yeah, we had a perfectly lovely a day together. And then later in some documentary she felt that that Katie Kirk and I had, um, was that I have it a mess, had it exploited her family for profit or something. And I say, show me the receipt

Speaker 1:          18:56          you

Speaker 2:          18:57          so, so we're getting ready for, for the next season of 30 rock and you also have a movie you're going to work on. I do. Yes. What's your base side? Okay,

Speaker 1:          19:13          I wonder what that is.

Speaker 3:          19:16          A couple of movies I'm supposed to be working on.

Speaker 1:          19:19          Okay.

Speaker 2:          19:20          So what does, aside from from the, the new arrivals, what does the next few years are? I assume if Mrs Pailin runs, you'll be,

Speaker 3:          19:30          I hope so. I'm around, you know, it's tricky for them because I, like I said, I don't work there, so I, you know, if some point, if they want to switch it to an actual, uh, SNL employee so they can do it with the frequency they want, then I would understand that. But um, yeah, if I'm, I'm it would be available for that in 2012 if they, if they need that.

Speaker 1:          19:48          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          19:50          It's so fun to just go down on us, you know, just show up on Saturday and do one sketch and then start drinking.

Speaker 1:          19:56          Okay.

Speaker 2:          19:58          We have, we have lots of, lots of questions from, from you all. Uh, we also, I sent, did a series of tweets to, to get questions from people outside of, outside of Google as well. Let me, let me throw a few at you. Okay. And then after a few minutes, we'll also get some questions here from folks here in the audience. We have 47 video conferences going on in addition to the people in this room. So we have a lot of people watching. Um, this is from, um, Brianna who's a Googler up. Who is your favorite guest star on 30 rock favorite posts from your s SNL days? Why?

Speaker 3:          20:35          Okay. God, there's, so we've had so many guest stars on 30 rock that we've been so, so lucky. Um, um, my favorites, I mean we, there are people that just to meet them was a dream come true for me. We had Tim Conway who everyone here, maybe he's too young to remember who that is, but um, who, uh, who was on, he was a favorite of mine. Um, Jan hooks playing, uh, Janka Kowalski's dirt bag. Mother is a favorite of mine because I grew up watching her lesson. Al Loving her. Um, uh, I mean people like Jon Hamm who just now is like a, a member of the family and he's so funny. Yeah. With, there's like a million of them.

Speaker 2:          21:16          The, um, this is from Jenny also do, we're given a hilarious, everyone on the 30 rock cast is what's the average number of takes that you have to Redo because everyone is cracking up.

Speaker 3:          21:25          Oh cause everyone's laughing. Well we do want to take us because no one knows her lines.

Speaker 4:          21:33          But

Speaker 3:          21:34          I would say actual cracking up happens. I only like when there's also a lot of fatigue involved. Um, Jack Maguire, it gets the, gets the giggles every now and then. Um, Alec almost never ever breaks. Um, Jane Jane. If she's tired, I would say maybe once a month. There's the giggles.

Speaker 2:          21:54          Interesting. So this is professionals, right? Okay. Professor professionals. Um, this is from a fan of yours and Macedonia. Okay. Which is still a country. Uh, Hi Tina. One of the reasons I love 30 rock so much has the amazing chemistry between you and Alec Baldwin. Who Do you think is, was the actor, actress you've had the best chemistry with? Does it come naturally or does it require a lot of work?

Speaker 3:          22:18          Oh, that's a good question. Um, uh, well I think, I think it probably wouldn't be Alec Cause we've, I've never, well I guess at this point I've been on screen for more minutes and hours than I was with, with Amy Poehler or Jimmy Fallon. Um, but, uh, I think those things come naturally. I don't think you can take them, although maybe, maybe he might. Maybe he, he's good at faking it.

Speaker 2:          22:45          Oh my God. He's making a bit of, my favorite scene is the one with Alec Baldwin where he is, uh, he's obsessed about meetings and he has to go to the meeting about meetings. Yes.

Speaker 3:          22:55          Anyone to be on the cover of meetings magazine.

Speaker 4:          22:58          Gotcha.

Speaker 2:          22:58          My own ambition. Yeah. This is from a fan from all Auburn, Alabama. Hi Tina. Apart from comedy roles, will we ever see you in some serious roles in film or television? Do you also enjoy doing serious or dramatic roles if you can get them?

Speaker 3:          23:13          Um, I would, I would like my career to drift toward being a judge on law and order.

Speaker 4:          23:22          I feel like

Speaker 3:          23:24          the hours and the outfit appeal.

Speaker 4:          23:30          MMM.

Speaker 3:          23:31          I think it would be fun to do, but I think, I don't know that anyone ever let me do a holy serious role and I'll know.

Speaker 2:          23:38          Yeah. This is from a, a fan in Michigan. Uh, thanks for being such an inspiration. Young women. You're my hero. If you had one word of advice for aspiring twentysomething female writers and entrepreneurs, what would it be? Okay.

Speaker 3:          23:52          Ah, not literally one word now. Now you're in behaving like a Googler. Yeah. Uh, so literal. Uh, Gosh, I, I, I think my advice would be to trust your gut, trust your gut creatively. Um, and in any kind of workplace situation because it's a few times I look back on anything that I've like, ah, I wish I'd done this differently. It's what I had a, a reaction sensor that I didn't follow up on.

Speaker 2:          24:27          Yeah. That's interesting. Another question from a fan and Michigan, sorry, from different one from a fan, from a Google or her name is z. You said that you incorporate actual quotes from your daughter into 30 rock quote. I want to go there unquote. Are there other examples? How old is your daughter?

Speaker 3:          24:42          Ah, she's five and a half now. I was just, I want to go to, there was, um, something that Liz Lemon said that she said when she saw the website for Disney world.

Speaker 4:          24:51          Awesome.

Speaker 3:          24:52          And I mean your book, you, you raped activities

Speaker 2:          24:55          with your daughter roughly equal to everything else you've acquired.

Speaker 3:          24:57          Oh yeah, for sure. I look back, I, I go through my phone and there's this weird chunks of time where, uh, it's like it because I was like 4,000 pictures on my phone. Um, and it'll be like, um, pictures of us like at SNL, um, doing the Sarah Palin thing and then I'm taking her to her first day of Preschool, 25th that and then going to the Emmy's and there's, you know, things on the table and then coming back. The phone is a good way to see what is actually really doing in your life. Yep.

Speaker 2:          25:30          And we want you to use a more powerful phone.

Speaker 4:          25:32          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          25:36          And we have a lot of applications that can help you. Where you going to go? Do some of them. This is what we do. We're good at it. Um, was it, cause I did like that you could tell it wasn't a house. Her daughter gets older. You can keep track of your daughter with your phone. Trust me, you're going to want our phones. Subdermal chip you guys. Um, that's been proposed but we're not quite there yet. Um, but yes, I'm trying to think what are the lines. She's had a thing. She, one time she, when she sits, she sits like this when she, she calls this, I'm sitting on our knees. Yeah. But until we use that, makes sense. Tracy Jordan's and talking about his knees. But I mean it pretty much, it usually works out very well for, for Tracy. Jordan's care. They have a lot of similar interests. They both get really excited. Benihana they have to be told they can't have McDonald's every day. There's similar people. Uh, this question is too embarrassing. I'll let you read it. Okay. This is, I'm a Googler. Um, I don't know what these numbers and things are, but this is it. This is easy. When it's Eric Schmidt. Get a guest appearance on 30, I would say.

Speaker 1:          26:44          Absolutely. I just wanted to, I just wanted them

Speaker 2:          26:49          prove that I did not submit that question. So you could have typed this thing. We will give this. I did not type that will give this employee a raise, however.

Speaker 1:          27:00          MMM.

Speaker 2:          27:00          Her name is Julie.

Speaker 3:          27:01          Julie. Yes. Uh, this, uh, absolutely. Uh, in a, in a universe where our guest stars have been everyone from, um, Jack Welch's too. Um, which, um, you know, Bob Ballard, what? We tried to get the real Bob Ballard the explorer, but he was unavailable. You're just the kind of guest star that we keep our ratings blow.

Speaker 1:          27:21          Hello?

Speaker 2:          27:22          Yeah. Actually the question, next question. This is from a fan in Fresno, California. The entire question is pirates or a Ninja as question mark.

Speaker 3:          27:33          No, I've been asked this question before recently. I'm not making it up. Yes. Uh, Chaz and Melton. Who screening? Um, I think I said I said pirates the last time because I think, um, Yup. Is this strong hierarchy? I think you're by the water pirates and I like the outfits better.

Speaker 2:          27:56          Another question. This is a, uh, from a Googler in 30 rock flashbacks, you often do depict yourself as a geek in high school and you're a mean girl script, identifies more with the uncool crowd. What's your actual experience? Is it more sort of comedic value? Did you, were you sort of geeky where you sorta, because in the book you describe yourself as sort of a growing up, a little bit tentative, right?

Speaker 3:          28:18          I would say I was sort of Geeky. I think I also, I think that almost everyone perceives themselves as being on the outside in high school except for no insiders who kids. Yeah. And those two, if they don't look that great now, like when you go back, they peaked at 19. Um, uh, yeah. And I was, yeah, it was very revenge with revenge of the nerds are the nerds is look where we are.

Speaker 1:          28:48          Yeah. It was, it, you know,

Speaker 3:          28:49          AP student on, on the newspaper and in choir and, and typical overachiever. Yeah. I mean I was an achiever. I there were, there were better achievers.

Speaker 1:          28:59          Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          29:02          The, um, another question from a fan in Munich, Hi Tina. I know sometimes Google yourself.

Speaker 3:          29:11          No, no, it's, it's exceeded a level where no really, no good will come of it. I think my parents,

Speaker 2:          29:18          we encourage people to use Google.

Speaker 3:          29:20          Yeah. I use Google a lot, but I don't Google myself because inevitably it terrible, terrible things come up. And I've tried to explain to my parents too, they've had, I think they have a Google alert on my name and that's not a good thing for parents.

Speaker 2:          29:38          Wait Til your child does it. Oh, what's mommy up to?

Speaker 3:          29:42          Yeah, it's, yeah, me and John Goslin. That's what we're worried about.

Speaker 1:          29:46          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          29:50          Uh, a question from a fan and Mexico, what high tech gadgets do you use?

Speaker 3:          29:56          Um, uh, not so many. It's about my husband. She has her, I mean, I use an iPhone and an iPad. Is that bad? That's what I use.

Speaker 2:          30:05          Do you guys make it, come on guys. We have lots of Google services on these products.

Speaker 1:          30:09          Yeah, I have. Yeah. I have Google products on there.

Speaker 3:          30:13          Um, and uh, computers,

Speaker 1:          30:20          cute

Speaker 3:          30:21          to write scripts. Okay. And um, that's about it.

Speaker 2:          30:26          We're going to have fit you a little bit better now that you're, now that you've visited, visited Google, another question from a Googler, you know, and you've got, you're going to be a nerd. You might as well have all the right gear. Yeah. Right? Yes, that's true. In any advice for new or want to be sketch comedy writers?

Speaker 3:          30:41          Yes. I'm I a say go to, uh, either Chicago, New York or Los Angeles if you can. I mean, you can find a lot of improv comedy and other cities now, but I would just say try to get to a, an upright citizens brigade theater to take class if you can. And in New York or Los Angeles or an Improv Olympic Theater in Chicago, second city and just to, um, do it as much as you can do it, you know, five, six nights a week if you,

Speaker 2:          31:08          if you do believe a lot of this can be taught, Improv can be taught, the writing can be taught. The comedy. Comedy is both an art as a, as well as the science.

Speaker 3:          31:17          Yeah, the basic rules can be taught, but I have tight improv. At second city, I used to be a teacher there and you can teach the rules a certain point and then then about six months in it's, there's a, there's people who can truly, who truly fit that kind of work and people who don't. It's true of a lot of things. Correct. Why don't we get some folks, we have some folks here on the questions, so go ahead. Yes ma'am.

Speaker 5:          31:40          Um, Hi Tina. Hi. Actually, my question follows nicely to the last one we just had. Um, I was wondering if, um, I kind of assume that from that first day that you took a class at second city to maybe like that first day when you started at SNL. Imagine that was a bit of a long road, probably full of a lot of fun, but also a lot of challenges. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that experience and maybe share any advice for somebody who wants to go down a similar road.

Speaker 3:          32:08          Um, I started class, I moved to Chicago in 1992 on Halloween of Knights 92 and, um, started class at January. And it was, it was a very fun road. It was cult-like. The improv world is, it's all encompassing. Uh, like I said, we would go take cla. You all you did was take class, try to get on stage, watch other people on stage. I mean, I think, uh, immersing yourself in it like that is good. Um, and I do look back on things that, um, I took it all so seriously, even though it was nonsense kind of business. Um, I took it all very seriously. I remember my boyfriend at the time who's now my husband, he was, um, he was the piano player at the theater. And I was like, I think we should keep it a secret that we're dating because I think it'll look affect the team and people will feel it. And that's like an impromptu, like, we're now married for 10 years. I think we should tell them, no.

Speaker 5:          33:07          MMM.

Speaker 3:          33:09          But just find people who are as intuit as you are and just do it as much as possible. Um, things that were, it did seem like a big deal at the time. Ah, now I can barely remember, you know, sort of the politics within the, the touring company of whose piece is going to get in. I mean, all that stuff that seems super serious now. It is serious in the moment, but we'll also get easier as you go. Um, but yeah, anything with comedy I think just have to, you have to get in front of an audience as often as you can because it's the only way to know if you're doing it right.

Speaker 5:          33:41          We would prefer you stay as a Google employee. We have an office in Chicago, so very good. Yes ma'am. Um, so my friend Robin, she's like moved out to la. She's an aspiring TV slash movie screen writer, so it's not me. Okay. But basically I was just curious what differences there are in the process for writing for Tds, like say 30 rock versus writing for movies? Like I say, like mean girls.

Speaker 3:          34:12          Um, well, uh, let's see. I've only written the one movie of my own, so I have sort of limited experience. But um, with TV the differences, I think you could come into it and try to get a job as a staff writer and learn that way with movies. You're gonna maybe be writing scripts on Spec. You're going to be try to, you know, be a load a lot more. I think it's a TV is a great training ground. If you can even even break in as a writer's assistant as a great job to have as the person in the room who is taking all the notes constantly all day, you really can learn a lot doing that. We have some, uh, we have had two writer's assistants who now our staff writer, one at 30 rock, Tracey Wigfield and uh, uh, another guy who's Andrew guests who writes for the Shul community.

Speaker 3:          34:55          And so that is a really great way to, to learn TV writing and movies. It's, I think it's so tricky to break in. Um, cause I, I don't even know screenwriting. I don't know. I was only able to get into it because of Lorne Michaels and having come from Saranac live, I get into it through television. I don't, I guess you could write and try to make your own short films and build up that way would be the way to to, but that's going to, you're not that you're gonna have to give your friends money and stuff.

Speaker 5:          35:29          Go ahead. Thank you for being the Gilda Radner of our generation.

Speaker 3:          35:37          Oh my gosh. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          35:38          The world to us. I agree.

Speaker 6:          35:43          So I have a couple of quick questions for you. One is what's your best joke? Cause I want to steal it. Um, number two, what nickname does Tracy Morgan use for you? And number three, I'm a fortune teller told me that John Stewart was going to retire from the daily show in 2020 and that you were going to take over. So what are your thoughts on that?

Speaker 1:          36:02          Okay.

Speaker 3:          36:03          Fortune Teller told you that? Yes. Yes.

Speaker 1:          36:07          Okay.

Speaker 3:          36:07          Um, in 2012, uh, I think nine years. Nine years.

Speaker 1:          36:13          Thank you. Um,

Speaker 3:          36:18          I think I'll be in nine years. It will, I think it should be illegal for a woman my age to be on television.

Speaker 1:          36:25          MMM.

Speaker 3:          36:26          Uh, what was the second question?

Speaker 6:          36:29          Um, Tracy Morgan.

Speaker 3:          36:31          Oh, Jason Morgan. He calls me Tfa. Most of the TFA. Yeah. He doesn't have as many nicknames for me as he has for a, Oh, he's, sometimes he calls me, this is one here. You'll see fair. You know, you're the isis in the hood.

Speaker 1:          36:47          I don't know what that means.

Speaker 3:          36:49          I know, I know, I know. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          36:54          Okay.

Speaker 3:          36:54          And the, and you asked him, he lived, it was my best joke in terms of something that was actually on TV or something or something I use.

Speaker 6:          37:03          Is that something I could use to make people laugh?

Speaker 3:          37:05          Um, my honestly, uh, my favorite Joe, just a handy everyday jokes. Just put a little chocolate on your teeth and act like you don't know. Is there

Speaker 1:          37:17          good.

Speaker 5:          37:20          Hi there, Tina. Um, I know this, this season in 30 rock was the first time where you've actually been able to do a live show. And from my understanding that was a huge accomplishment and a real challenge for the show to be able to do. Um, my question is what other barriers are you hoping to break with 30 rock or what are your, like some of your upcoming on dreams that you're hoping to achieve with the show?

Speaker 3:          37:41          Um, uh, that's a good question. Yeah, we did the live show this year was, was a very exciting and challenging. We did it, it was to, it was too, right. We did two, we did one for the east coast and one for the west coast and um, and it was really, really fun to do because it was a, we did it in studio h where Saturday night live has done it. So it was a blending of the 30 rock crew at the SNL crew and it was, um, uh, and it was really challenging technically because with SNL you have 90 minutes and all these, um, kind of built in structures to the show to get for the show to come in at the right time. They have, you know, when you see the band playing does pop band bumpers, different things, commercial parodies, things they can can use to control the timing of the show. And we had about 22 minutes cause they gave us a little extra time and um, it was much, that was the biggest challenge was like would we get through the show before the, before the office just started, right.

Speaker 1:          38:37          Middle of the shot.

Speaker 3:          38:39          That was kind of thrilling. Um, we, and we did another thing we did this year that was a format changes. We did one episode, um, called the queen of Jordan, which was set entirely in a reality show. Yes.

Speaker 1:          38:51          You went to that, that can not get it.

Speaker 3:          38:53          That was Tracy. We filled it used to be right into the system. See, um, brought that up and uh, I'm trying to think what else would I think, you know, people sometimes ask if we ever would do like a musical episode, which I think we certainly, uh, would be fun to do. But other people have done that. I don't know. Uh, yeah. Claymation I don't know. The queer community did claymation and co I would like to do a, what I keep referring to it as a Bugsy Malone episode, which is, um, uh, has all movie before everyone here was born where it was a gang gangster movie. You remember this movie? Oh, the young Jodie foster it and it was all children. I would like to maybe do an episode where all our character just played by children.

Speaker 1:          39:38          Well, my suggestion, my suggestion is have a, have a real Christmas

Speaker 3:          39:41          party and invite all of us join your real Christmas party. I tell him is yeah.

Speaker 6:          39:46          Okay, go ahead. First of all, thanks for coming in. 30 rock is one of my favorite shows on television. I think. Uh, there was an episode last season where I just laugh for 15 minutes after the show was over and I literally had, couldn't stop to breathe. I think that was when Tracey was going, it's going on about the dogs running the Wendy's. But uh, but uh, but actual question was, uh, you also had an episode where you provided some much needed closure to night court. And as somebody who's an, and I was wondering if there are any other sitcoms that you've picked for the 80s to, to sort of provide that sort of culture for, I know it's difficult to plug it in, but, uh, and uh, if you, uh, obviously that might have been one shot thing, but if you couldn't answer that then sort of like growing up, did you watch a lot of television and you know, does that, it seems like that you're reading the writing on 30 rock. It seems like you were also a TV fan. Maybe that's not true, but I was wondering if you could have it on how that is.

Speaker 3:          40:36          No, I'm speaking to you think TV fan growing up. Um, no court chairs. I mean Mary Tyler Moore and Calvin, all those things when I was younger. Um, yeah, I mean I think we are, our staff has a generation of people who really grew up on half hour comedy. Um, good and bad. You know, there's the, uh, cause there's this sort of who's the boss saved by the bell era that I had full house. I've seen, I've seen a lot of full house and never, never on purpose.

Speaker 1:          41:07          I had a, um, had a summer job

Speaker 3:          41:10          once it, a summer theater where we would go work in the costume shop all day. And then my roommate and I had like 45 minutes to go home before going back to be dressers in the show. And we would go home every day from one of the only thing, almost full house. We wash it and we watched it every day. Um, uh, but yeah. Uh, is there any TV show or other show that you would like us to, to, uh, try to have on?

Speaker 6:          41:33          Ooh, that's tough. I mean, a teen teen, which was also a thing to think of one that really raw, satisfying, ending. Like, you know, I always felt that the new heart people thought it was more funny. I Dunno. Like, uh, no.

Speaker 1:          41:49          Uh, well let's go to our next question. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 6:          41:59          Hi Tina. My name is Kevin and uh, my question is, I recently watched Panio and I noticed that you were one of the voice actors in that movie. Yeah. How did you get into voice acting?

Speaker 3:          42:07          Um, well I was asked to, to we voice Ponyo um, cause I would say it was in Japanese at first and um, I was really excited to do it because I think that kind of stuff is really cool and fun to do. And it was, uh, I've since, uh, done, uh, just one other one that was from, from scratch. It's very different. This mega, my movie did it from scratch. Do you go into your kind of improvising and j dog? But the funny and sort of challenging thing with Panio was that the animation is done and use. You have to, and they've, they think too, it would just sink to the, to the lip flap as they call it. And also there were a lot of, um, fun, uh, this sort of nonverbal things in Japanese where we, you know, in English with something of us, we wake, we'll mix. Huh. Huh. Or just, you know, just weird little nonverbals in Japanese.

Speaker 1:          42:53          Wow.

Speaker 3:          42:56          What kind of a, um, an English language nonverbal.

Speaker 1:          43:01          Excellent. Next question.

Speaker 6:          43:06          Hey Tina, we're also excited you're here. Um, my question is in your book, you get through your list of different writers for 30 rock and your kind of favorite singers from each one of them. So what's your favorite one you were and was it or not the Subar line? Cause that's my favorite. Which, which was the smile when Alec Baldwin is talking about all the New York royalty, the Rockefeller's, Carnegie's,

Speaker 3:          43:29          all the, all the important New York families will be there. The Rockefellers were the Subar. Okay.

Speaker 1:          43:32          Yeah, that's not mine.

Speaker 3:          43:34          The one I actually meant to, I forgot to give myself one in the, in the book. And I was, I had, I had checked on the one that I was going to give myself and confirmed with, you know, cause sometimes you wouldn't make you very much make sure that it was a joke that you wrote. And um, uh, the one I was going to give myself what I forgot was in season one when I, I asked you Alec, um, why are you wearing a Tuxedo? And he says it's after six. What am I a farmer?

Speaker 1:          43:59          That's my favorite one.

Speaker 6:          44:02          Love the caricature of senior executives.

Speaker 1:          44:07          Yes. Hi.

Speaker 3:          44:11          Um, I'm actually really curious about your life as a parent, um, especially because you're a mother of a daughter and I'm wondering with all the messages of princesses and, yeah. Um, damsels in distress and whatnot, um, you know, you would think having Tina Fey is, her mom might make being intelligent and funny. Cool. But you know what I know about kids that isn't always the case, can still

Speaker 5:          44:32          be, you know, pressured and, and just soak it all up. So being five and a half, you know, looking at your daughter and how that's going. Um, what are your thoughts on parenting daughters?

Speaker 3:          44:44          Well, a silver, my, my, my, my take on the princess thing was, um, uh, and I wonder if I would be the same way if I had a son and he just really wanted guns cause my ticket, the princess is like, you know, I'm not going to fight it. I'm going to, let's, we can have these princess toys we can talk about and, uh, and then it'll, it'll kind of, but if I get my son and I gave him as many guns as my daughter has a princess dolls, I would be arrested,

Speaker 1:          45:12          not in Arizona. Um, but I do try to quite a question.

Speaker 3:          45:16          We play with all the printers and then we got into this when she was smaller, this real rhythm of she would always want to play barbies and say, and this, we're going to play barbies. And it's too, and the game that she coined was two girls fighting over the prince and they both want to marry the prince. And they, and they said it was this game with these two barbies, sabotage each other.

Speaker 1:          45:34          Allison was this natural. And I would try to question it as we play. I would say like, well, why did they want to marry the prince? They don't have to Meredith. And she'd be like, you're wrecking it. You know? So I'm just hoping if I don't force it to stop, it'll go away on its own

Speaker 5:          45:52          18 and thanks for coming today. Um, everything's been very thought provoking for me. I went to Harvard but grew up in Chicago. So having a little bit, right. You're pulling identities. I'm wearing flannel, but gophers, so something, something, something. Think about a question for you though, is what's inspiring you now? Like what are you reading?

Speaker 3:          46:13          Um, what am I reading now? I just, uh, I finished, um, I don't get to read for pleasure very often. So I finished a seed Martins novel about the art world, which I enjoyed very much an object of beauty and I just bought at the airport, but I haven't started yet. Um, Anne Lamott's latest novel. Um, and I'm reading a lot of baby name books. Google has an name suggested you. You do? I mean in baby girl baby names. Oh, I've done that. Yeah, I've typed, yeah, there's a lot of traces.

Speaker 1:          46:45          Yes.

Speaker 5:          46:47          Hi Tina. Um, I represent the human side of the employees that work here, so maybe not the Harvard side. Um, I went to a university called Salisbury and people confuse it with, um, chicken fried steak university. So, um, I have this run Robin and, uh, the same friend. Yeah, she works in La and she, it's a, she works at a tech company. Okay. Um, and she, uh, Eh, it's probably more of like self deprecating in terms of like her personality and Robin, uh, is concerned with how that's perceived in the workplace and how to balance that and actually getting respect from her, from her coworkers. So I know that that's a, a personality trait that you have as well, but you are so successful. So did you have any advice for Robin?

Speaker 3:          47:35          Um, for Robin? Robin is a mess by the way

Speaker 5:          47:41          to problems

Speaker 3:          47:41          is that Robin has, um, uh, um, but she's asked for help. Yeah, that's good. That's the first step. I think it's, you know, willing to have a self deprecating personality, but you don't want to be self deprecating about your work abilities, you know, and I, in the book I talk a little bit about, one of the rules of Improv that we is, uh, is to make statements as opposed to, uh, ask questions, which an Improv is just, you know, if I say like, who are you, why are you here? What should we do? Now that I'm putting all the burden on on you, my partner, and I say that sometimes also applies to two women, even just with, with our voices in the workplace to speak confidently and to try to avoid that kind of like, I have an idea and I think for like we were, I'm just like, I don't know if it's a good idea just to, just to make statements as much as you can, but I think it's, um, yeah, two too

Speaker 3:          48:36          to try to prevent yourself from prefacing, we work with any kind of apology. You know, I'm, I have friends, like I have a friend who's writing a pilot right now and I have another friend who was going to be working with her and I said, well here's a, her deal. She is going to s this is her routine. She'll say for 30 seconds. Like, I don't know. I don't think, I think it's really stinks. And then you said you just have to let her say that and then she does know and shit doesn't stink. And it's getting, so you know, if you can, if you can see that, if you have that behavior in yourself and you can just kind of,

Speaker 1:          49:07          okay,

Speaker 3:          49:08          skip that part. You know, if you can just kind of fast forward the, uh, the pre apology part. Sometimes I think, I do think like sometimes what would a man do in any given situation and they don't, they don't apologize so much.

Speaker 5:          49:22          Sorry. Apologize. Yes ma'am. Hey, we have this group be the last question. So go ahead. I'm stealing it. The mic here. I'm feeling shorter than usual, which is awesome. Um, so I'm a young mother myself and uh, for me, you know, the work life balance struggle hit me a lot harder than I anticipated. And I think that's a common experience across parenthood in general. And would love to hear your experience from the, from the comedy world and, uh, the Hollywood world about how your life changed after having kids and how you've structured your time to find that balance, if that's okay.

Speaker 3:          49:56          Oh, possible. Um, well I think the, the biggest change is that your, your priorities just shifted in that you, you want to go home. And in some ways I think it makes you a better employee because I was more efficient. You're more efficient and you, I would have spent a lot of time at SNL, you know, before I was married just to have hanging out in people's offices and, and some of that is valuable to the creative process, but you don't need nearly as much as you think. Um, and so that's the, the thing is you just, you're just managing your time better. You, you're going home as soon as you can, as soon as you can. Um, and I think, uh, someone was asking me about this recently, I was saying there, do you, I don't know if he find this to be true, but there's sometimes there's a um, oh, we have a reluctance to really admit the specific details that you may not even be like, it's hard.

Speaker 3:          50:44          But when people say like, wait, but what time where you really like, what time do you leave and what time did you get back? And you're like, don't worry about it. It's because you feel like people are gonna judge you. Um, and I, I don't, I think it's probably better if you know, for us to be honest with each other. But it is tricky sometimes to, to say like, yeah, these weren't very long hours. Um, and I just, you don't do much else. Right. You just kind of do your work and, and, and, and go home to see your kid. That's kind of it. Then you realize like, well, I haven't seen a movie and like four years except your own, right. Since I've been made to go to a premiere of one that I, yeah. Then I worked on. Um, but it's, it, and also the thing that I find that people don't tell you is that the amount of kind of energy that goes into the relationship you have with your child's caregiver, whoever that is. That was one where I was like, oh yeah, this is a person. This, this is a relationship. It's approximately, you get it right then. And that needs this relationship, uh, takes a lot of kind of time and energy. And that was one thing that now I feel like I've gotten better at it. When you're first doing it, you feel kind of trapped by that. Um, so that will, I don't know how old your child is, but that does get a little better. Go ahead.

Speaker 5:          52:02          Hi, I'm, Hi Tina. Thank you so much for coming. It's hard not to talk to screen. Tina.

Speaker 3:          52:07          You're so big, Huh?

Speaker 5:          52:10          All right. Um, so as a person who is such a big fan of TV all your life, you've probably seen shows that have wonderful actors and great concept, but horrible writing, like bleeding. Um,

Speaker 3:          52:21          and said that not me. I said that. Yeah, I know. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          52:25          And so as a writer, I was wondering if there's a TV show in either recent history or that's going on right now that you feel like maybe if I took this on, this would be, Huh?

Speaker 3:          52:36          Oh, did, I would, could fix it if you could. Um, I, uh, no, I think, um, no. I thought you were going to ask me what TV shows. I thought were well written cause I was getting ready to answer that it was going to say the Larry Sanders show. And um, I think mad men is really well written. Um, I hear, I don't get to watch it. I hear breaking bad is unbelievably grab is phenomenal. Yeah. I haven't actually seen it. Yes. Yes ma'am. Hi. I just wanted to see if you have any similarities to Liz lemon cause I love her. Oh, I do, I do it. What do you think? I do have a lot of similar as I feel like Liz Lemon is, if I sort of, uh, I would say it's a sliding kind of version of me. If I had stayed kind of, um, in the way I was when I first was head writer at SNL and was throwing myself entirely into that job.

Speaker 3:          53:34          Um, but I have a, uh, a different home life than she does, which is very different. And sad thing is people always say like, you know, she justice, why is she so suddenly and you, you let us be so ugly or they have kid. And I was like, she dresses so much better than I would go if I were going to to 30 rock to actually write for a day. Like was the wait Liz lemon is dressed as how I would be, like if I was like trying to pull it together to go to a friend's house for dinner. So we're pretty similar.

Speaker 2:          54:07          Hi, you mentioned a Tim Conway who I'm old enough to remember seeing in the Carol Burnett show and I was a kid and it made me think that one of the funniest bits that I remember seeing in comedy in general was when he interacted with Harvey Korman and they would crack in the middle and they would start laughing. And it was, it was an in the moment amount of, uh, type of comedy that is obviously lacking from TV. Uh, I suppose you experienced that in Improv and SNL was sketch comedy. How is it making the transition to television where you edit those scenes out?

Speaker 3:          54:38          Yeah, well those were, I mean those things, the Carol Burnett show was in front of a live studio audience. And so there is a kind of immediacy and that does happen every now and then, uh, it will happen on Saturday night live. Um, and it is, there's nothing more satisfying if you, there was a sketch when I was there called Debbie Downer that if I didn't write, I love it. I did write it, but it was really funny. Right. And they, um, they all genuinely truly broke, uh, and laughed in it. And it's one of the most joyful things you could ever watch. And the thing for comedy people as you've just, if it happens once in a while and it's real, it's okay, but you never want to be that person who's kind of like faking it a little bit. Um, and we had, so that's what you don't see it on shows like 30 rock because there's no audience there. So it would, I think it would seem pretty self indulgent if we left it just like us.

Speaker 2:          55:30          Thank you. What I, what I like about Tina is you see, and the arc of her life so far, someone, someone who really has started off with an exceptional talent, which she won't admit, but used it and used it and was disciplined in the way she approached everything. And she had her book. She talks about the confusion of where to go and what to do, but ultimately she found a path that has resulted now in the second week of number one book in the United States, which is pretty amazing for, I think at first, uh, first

Speaker 1:          56:05          [inaudible]. If you think about

Speaker 2:          56:09          writer, comedy writer, creator, producer, actress, now movie star mother, and she's managed to merge it all together and produce just an extraordinary outcome. I can only imagine what your next decade will be, and I'm looking forward to watching it to thank you. And thank you so much for

Speaker 1:          56:26          [inaudible].
