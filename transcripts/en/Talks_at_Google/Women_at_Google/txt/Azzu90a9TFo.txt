Speaker 1:          00:05          Good afternoon. Welcome to talks at Google. My name is Rebecca Moore. I'm director of Google Earth and I'm very pleased to welcome my dear friend, Dr. Victoria Sweet, who just published a new book called slow medicine, the way to healing. I've known Victoria for several decades since nearly the start of her journey as a physician, including her 20 years practicing at Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco and taking time to get her phd in the history of medicine during this period. She's been on the front lines of dramatic change in her profession as practicing medicine has transformed into delivering healthcare and not always for the better. Her first book, God's hotel, one widespread or awards in a claim leading to a Guggenheim fellowship and the time, pay attention to that word because you will hear it today a lot. The time for her to synthesize and develop our ideas further around what she called slow medicine and fast medicine and how these two approaches are both complimentary and necessary. Googlers will particularly appreciate that Victoria got her undergraduate degree in mathematics from Stanford. Go to Stanford and a so please join me in welcoming

Speaker 2:          01:26          Dr Victoria. Sweet. Thank you. Uh, thank you very much Rebecca for that introduction and thank you all for being here today and thanks to Google for doing something this really unusual for a big for profit company to be willing to sponsor, uh, books and speeches by authors. It's, it's a really wonderful thing and special. I think it tells a lot about Google. Um, I would like to add that, I know I do. I get my mathematics degree at Stanford. It was my major, but my minor was classics and that is a stream. This two things have, have woven their way through through my life. So what I would like to do this afternoon, I'll speak for about 40 minutes and all be, um, explaining kind of how I actually got right here. Uh, that's the first part of the talk. In the second part, they're going to want to talk about what's going on with medicine and, uh, in, during my career and what I think we can do to make it better. So I'm going to start with my,

Speaker 1:          02:34          yes. So the first one, first

Speaker 2:          02:38          thing you should know about me is that I don't consider myself a natural born doctrine. And by that I mean growing up I never watched doctor shows or went to a volunteered in the hospital and if somebody was sick, I didn't want to hear about it or have anything to do with them. And in fact, the first time I had to draw blood medical school, I passed out. So definitely not a natural born doctor. But what happened was at the end of college I was looking for a way to synthesize these two parts of myself, the mathematics, the classics, the history, the humanities and the sciences. And I ran into the writings of Carl Jung, the psychiatrist. He'd written a memoir called memories, dreams and reflections. And I ran into it by accident in the library and I found myself and thrawled. I wasn't enthralled first of all by the meaning he expected from his own life and also by the kind of life he set up for himself.

Speaker 2:          03:33          This is a stone house he had built for himself and the Lake Zurich. And this is where he saw patients in the morning and neurotic, well paying patients in the morning and illuminated manuscripts and studied alchemy in the afternoon. I thought this was a great life and that's what I wanted to do when I grew up and that's how I got to medical school because I was going to be a union psychiatrist. Then it turned out I liked medical school a lot more than I thought it would, especially the last two years of medical school. When you finally get a chance to see real patients. I, I loved what's called the workup. I loved the history taking the history tied to figure out the patient's story because there was so much psychology to it. Hearing what the patient said and didn't say, sing what the way he said or he, she said what?

Speaker 2:          04:22          What the answer to the question and then there was examining the patient. It turns out I actually liked touching people. I particularly like the physical exam because there was so much I could learn from it about with the patient had and didn't have, and then there was putting it all together in a diagnosis and the treatment and the plant. It was a logical, brilliant method. Nevertheless, I continued my first idea and I went into a psychiatric residency that was a little bit naive. So my psychiatric residency took place in the only locked psychiatric ward in our county. So consequently the patients were not humans, well paying neurotic articulated patients. They were severely psychotic and they responded a lot more to the medicines we use and they did to the talk therapy. I tried, so after I got my license, after that first year of internship, I just went out and practiced medicine for several years in various clinics and it was fascinating because the county clinics in the community clinics would get waves of immigrants every time there was a war or a rumor of war and they would bring with them their diseases and also their different way of looking at the body.

Speaker 2:          05:36          I saw everything in those clinics. I saw three cases of leprosy, and this is right around here when I, when I did this, I saw almost every parasite there was and saw many unusual diseases and it was also interested in these different ways of looking at the body. And so after a while I decided that I might as well bit that I liked medicine. I went back and did a three years of a regular medical residency and then I went back to the community clinics. The longer I practice medicine, the more impressed I was by the logical method of writing at a diagnosis and a treatment. But it was also more and more impressed by what this medicine, modern medicine left out, which was of course anything that wasn't a logical. So after a while I started reading, uh, alternative medicines, natural apathy, homeopathy, Chinese medicine, and Ayurvedic Medicine.

Speaker 2:          06:29          And for a while, uh, I even thought about learning Chinese so I could understand Chinese medicine from the inside or Sanskrit. So I could understand Indian medicine from the inside. But eventually I decided that even if I did get to that point that I could understand them, that their cultures were still two different from my own to understand their different ways of looking at the body. It was just rather discouraging moment that I discovered the writings of uh, a very, uh, unusual 12th century woman. Her name was Hildegard of Bingen and she was a mystic. She was a composer. Uh, she was an artist. She was a, she was a field login, but she also has a turned out, it was a medical practitioner that you written a book on her medicine. And as I stood there and read her book in the library again, I was impressed by the medicine that she was recounting cause it wasn't the medieval medicine that expected tongue of new to, I have frog medicine expected from a medieval medical texts.

Speaker 2:          07:32          It was a real medicine for real patients with real diseases I could recognize. But it was based on a completely different model of the body from our modern medical model. I couldn't quite put my finger on how it was different, but I decided then and there that I was gonna go back to school and get a phd in medical history with Hildegard of, of my focus. But I didn't want to stop practicing medicine. I wanted to do this half time and I spent a couple of months looking around for halftime position, which was rather difficult at the time until finally I discovered I was offered a position at a very unusual hospital in San Francisco, which is called Laguna Honda Hospital attempt disco. And when I drove over for the first time and saw it high on that hill, I wasn't taken aback. There's about 20 years ago now, it looked like a medieval monastery.

Speaker 2:          08:24          They had had red tile roof, senate cream colored walls and it turned in a bell tower where patients I turned out, used to go up in smoke and uh, I went to my interview and the medical director took me around and I had never seen a hospital like this need was on 62 acres of land in the middle of San Francisco. It had 1200 patients. It was is he enormous grounds. The patients were all got taken care of on these old fashion a wards, those open wards you see in the old movies from the 1930s he had had an x ray department where we could take our own x rays and a lab with a microscope where we could look at our own slides. It had a a chapel, a little small chapel that was run by the county. It had a chapel that actually looked more like a church with stained glass windows and I'm Polish wooden pews and a very politically incorrect stations of the cross along the walls.

Speaker 2:          09:26          And then we went out and the medical director showed me the grounds, which were enormous. There was an aviary so that patients could watch chickens hatch from eggs. There was a green house so that patients could pop plants and there was even a barnyard for the patients could see animals even if they were bed bound. And we walked back to her office and she offered me the job. Well, I didn't know, I wasn't sure. I had never seen a place like that before in my life. But I was the only place that would let me practice medicine part time. So I said I would stay for two months and they ended up staying for 20 years cause it turned out to be a fascinating place to practice. And that was for one specific reason. It had originally been called the San Francisco almost south. This was the first rendition of Laguna Honda in an 1860s and the aunt's house was actually how we used to take care of just sick poor.

Speaker 2:          10:18          Before there was health insurance, we had a way of taking care of the sick poor. And that was this system that was the big old county hospital where anybody could show up and get taken care of. And then if they need more care than that, we had some place to send them. So this was where in the old days we could send people who were mentally ill who needed more care, who were unemployed or just been let out of prison. We actually had a system and Laguna Honda was the San Francisco [inaudible] and it's how I got the title for my last book because this is the system that we have came from France and Europe in general. And in French, the word for alms house is hotel. Gm is God's hotel. So that's why I got the name. And the reason I ended up staying so long is because typically the Almshouse would get the bottom one 10th of 1% of patients.

Speaker 2:          11:13          So my patients were all three standard deviations from the mean, any meat, they were the tallest, they were the shortest, the fattest. And they were the dentist. They were the oldest and the youngest and the nicest and the immune system. Any patients I ever had. And because the whole catchment area was San Francisco, it's time with 600,000 people. Uh, if a disease would occur in one in 100,000, I'd say couple. So it was fascinating place medically. I just went through the rare diseases in Harrison's textbook of medicine and check them off as they would come up. So it was a fascinating place to practice. And an ended up staying for 20 years. There's also a wonderful place to practice because healthcare efficiency had not yet arrived. We were over the hill to the poor house literally and people kind of left us alone. I mean we had standards and things people paid attention to what we did, but mostly I had something that doctors today mostly don't have.

Speaker 2:          12:12          That is the time to take care of my patients, to properly examine them, to figure out what was actually wrong with them, to get the right diagnosis and the right treatment. And the longer I was there, the more impressed I was by not only how, um, how, um, satisfying that was for me as a dog, but how efficient it was even from a healthcare efficiency point of view. Then I'll give you an example. The typical patient at Laguna Honda would arrive with on between 15 and 26 medications of which they only needed about four or five. But no other doctor had had the time to go through the chart, go through the patient, figure out whether they actually needed that medicine, maybe even try and taking them off that medication to see how they did. I found that most of the patients could be handled very well in five medications.

Speaker 2:          13:08          So I was taking them off between 10 and 15 medications, which if you figure it out, um, economically is incredibly cost effective for the extra few hours of time it took me. So I was quite happy there. And then I, meanwhile of course, I'd gone back to study, um, this is actually what I call the efficiency of inefficiency. Meanwhile, I'd gone back as I decided to do to get my phd in medical history with Hildegard of Bingen as my focus. And what I decided to do was to really learn Hildegard's medicine as if I were a student by reading her medical text in its original language and by understanding what people were doing around her. Uh, so I took classes in learned Latin cause she wrote in Latin and I learned medieval Latin cause she read actually in medieval Latin. I learned medieval German and German because that's what the secondary literature was in and learn paleography and code ecology.

Speaker 2:          14:06          So I could actually read the handwritten texts, which they had back then. And he also experimented because I figured if I had been her student in the Middle Ages, I'd sort of have a sense of using her different recipes and prescriptions. So I planted a medieval or garden and I brewed up some of her potions and Syrup's I uh, tried her medicinal beers and I baked some of her antidepressant cookies. And what I've found over time I got more and more interested in the difference between Hildegard's model of the body and our model of the body because they were clearly very different. Our model of the body is fundamentally based on the idea that the body is a machine and the doctor is a mechanic looking for what's broken and trying to fix it, repair it or replace it. Hildegard's model was very different. I gradually learned over the years the guards model was much more of the body as a plant rather than as a machine.

Speaker 2:          15:09          And then doctor, more like a gardener. And a mechanic. What's the difference? The difference is that someone has to fix a broken machine, but a plant can heal itself. Hildegard had a name for uh, the power of a plant deal itself and she called it Verdad toss from the Latin Veritus that means green. So it was the greening power of a plant to grow, to produce seeds and to repair itself when it was injured. And she believed that uh, human beings also have this power. And then the job of the doctor was more to remove what was in the way of the patients for at a task and to support it with the basics then to do something to the patient. So this was a very interesting model and it took me years to understand how a plot to apply it to the patients I had at Laguna Honda.

Speaker 2:          16:02          But gradually I began to see that not only could I help a patient by figuring out what diagnosis they actually had, once I had the diagnosis to step back and see what was in the way of [inaudible] and what could I do to support it. The longer I practice medicine within a Honda, the more I realized that this was a very helpful way of looking at patients and I began to think of it as sort of that slow medicine as opposed to the fast medicine I also use, which is so effective for what I considered Beth disease. So for instance, if you get to come to the hospital because you have appendicitis and you need an appendectomy or you come to the hospital in you had or having a heart attack and you need an angioplasty, or even if you have cancer, this is when what I would call by contrast, fast medicine, our modern medicine based on the model of the body as a machine works great, but after your appendectomy, after angioplasty and after your chemotherapy, this is when modern medicine with this idea of coming in, fixing what's broken falls down.

Speaker 2:          17:07          And what I learned at Laguna Honda is when I used both models together first fast and then slow medicine, the patients did the best. They did remarkably well. Many of them were actually able to go home sort of unexpectedly during the 20 years I practiced medicine while he was practicing medicine at Laguna Honda, we eventually got discovered a and are Alison days of having enough time began to disappear and uh, first by health care efficiency experts who showed up one day walking through the place and horrified to discover the aviary and the greenhouse and particularly the open wards. And the Department of Justice finally eventually showed up and told Laguna Honda that they were going to have to tear the place down and rebuild a new healthcare facility that had private rooms for all the patients rather than keep the patients on the open wards. Um, and at that point I decided to take some time off and write a book about what I'd seen there.

Speaker 2:          18:09          That was my first book and also to think about, uh, what I've seen so far in my life as a physician. It seemed to me when I thought about that in my life as a physician, um, the pendulum of healthcare is swung from the personal to the efficient. And I've been more and more impressed by what, uh, that leaves out. So for instance, the results of the kind of health care efficiency we've had over the last 20 years as you can see, is that healthcare costs have kept rising no matter what healthcare economists have tried to do. They've tried to do all kinds of screens for getting a coat of healthcare. And this is not true just in the United States, but across the world, healthcare costs keep rising every year despite DRGs and h emos and manage health care systems, everything. We've tried trying to understand what was going on in the system as a whole.

Speaker 2:          19:03          I decided to look at Laguna Honda specifically and asked myself what was had gone on there in the last 20 years. So, so I figured out that in the last 20 years as a cost cutting measure, the patients we had had gone from about 1,178 down to 780 this was as a cost cutting measure. So we were taking care of a lot fewer patients. Of course, correspondingly, the number of doctors we had went down was cut from 32 to a nine and correspondingly also the clinical stuff that's the nurses and the therapists and the social workers was also cut as a cost cutting measure, cost cutting measure from um, about 1500 to 1200. And yet at Laguna Honda every year to budget had increased.

Speaker 2:          19:54          So I asked me what accounted for that and I realized that even though the patients were fewer and the doctors were considerably fewer and the clinical staff had been cut, the total staff was actually the same. There were more and more administrators every year. What did all those administrators do? I asked myself, well, what I realized was that when I thought about it that the one thing we had more of at Laguna Honda, uh, at the time, at the end of my time there, then at the beginning of the time we're forms. So when I first got there, we had paper charts and we had two single page forms in the chart. And the day before I left Laguna Honda, I pulled out one of the paper charts just randomly and I started looking through it and I counted how many forms there were. And there were 43 forms in that chart and none of them were single page forms. They were 10 page, 20 page. There were so many forms that the charts would explode from the forms and medical records had to show up and thin out the doctor's notes.

Speaker 3:          21:02          Okay.

Speaker 2:          21:02          And this to sort of clarify things because I do have someone have a mathematical mind. I created this chart at the time when I was figuring this out. Okay, now this is working. So this is a try to create it at the time on a Napkin as Becca pointed out the other day. Um, so these are the patients going down. I was trying to figure out, understand the system. They're the doctors going down. There's the, uh, budget going up, the clinical staff, the, the total staff saying about the same. And this was the number of forms. What I realized is is that if current trends continued by 2024 there would be no patients at Laguna Honda, there'd be two doctors there. It'd be a staff of 1400 a budget of $275 million and an infinite number of forms. And I decided this is, I began to think of this as doing this with more. And the thing that's interesting about it is and crucial that it is exactly the same as being the thing has been happening in the country as a whole. Let me give you a show. You what I mean. So this was the country as a whole. So if you look at the growth of its physicians and administrators, here's what you find.

Speaker 3:          22:17          Okay,

Speaker 2:          22:17          so I'll interpret this a little bit for you. These are the number of docs, percentage growth. So it's about double. So the dots about doubled in, in tandem with the population is about double. So those are about the same number of dots per patient and vice versa as there always have been. The yellow is a number of administrators there, 35 times as many administrators as there used to be.

Speaker 2:          22:43          And as you can see, just like [inaudible] to the budget is continued to go up every year. And what do all those docs do? What of all those administrators do, I should say, well, this just is an interesting, this was HHS paperwork. Really. They should take the electronic computer work and millions of hours, millions of hours. Just in the last 10 years, it has doubled from 350 million hours. It has doubled to almost 700 million hours. Why? Well, what's happened is, is that because of all of this paperwork that the administrators have generated for various reasons, we've ended up in a situation where your doctor doesn't have enough time to look at, uh, patients anymore. This is a sentence I've heard over and over again in the last five years as I've gone around and spoken about the book, and I put it, I don't know if you can see when you're sitting here, but this was a rather scandalous.

Speaker 2:          23:42          I'm drawing that appeared in the Journal of American Medical Association a few years ago. Uh, a doc had it published. It was a mother who brought it to him. It was a drawing by her five year old daughter, uh, about my visit to the doctor and uh, can't see it too well, but this is the daughter sitting on the exam table behind it as mom holding a little baby and at friend I believe. And this is the doctor who's looking at the computer. This is where we're spending our time. And um, from experience in general and experience, particularly at Laguna Honda, I believed in order to have a good healthcare system, we actually need to put inefficiency that is unregulated free time for the doctors and the nurses to have the time to look the patients and to get off the computer. And the question then becomes, how can we get that time back? Because as you've just seen, we have actually the same number of doctors and patients as we've always had, but the doctors are spending a bunch of time not with the patients so that the patient doesn't feel lifted anymore.

Speaker 2:          24:48          And isn't looked at it anymore. So when I was thinking about this, trying to figure out, okay, so how could we get the time back? I asked myself, well, what do we spend our time on in a way time is the Verint Atossa healthcare. So I can do a written toss analysis and ask myself, well, what are, what is in the way of doctors having enough time with patients? What do doctors spend their time on? So I came up with three fundamental things. Doctor spend their time on forms when I called fast administration as opposed to slow administration and lousy electronic health records. By forms, I mean this whole contraption that has come upon us with electronic health records and administration screens, logins, alerts, email scripts and this that are based on this whole idea that if it's not documented, it did, it didn't happen. And if it is documented, it did happen.

Speaker 2:          25:45          And we can talk about that a little bit. Um, and fecund what I'm thinking of is fast administration, which I consider a problem with style. This idea by administrators that if they come up with a form, they're done, they come up with a paradigm, a script for us to follow. The problem is solved and last and really mainly the easiest thing to fix to get doctors back their time. Electronic health records that take all our time. And this is what I'd like to sort of zero in now and the the for for a little bit about the problem with electronic health records and how I think we can actually get back to doctors back some of our time with patients, some of our free time, some of our inefficient time. So we can sit down with patients and look at them and actually examine it.

Speaker 2:          26:33          So what's happened in the past about 10 years is electronic health records. We used to use the paper charts, right, which had their biggest flaw with paper charts was that if you went to the emergency room and having happened and then you came back to your doctor, they couldn't tell you what, nobody knew what was going on. We had to get them to send us to xerox things and send the papers. So what 10 more than about 10 years ago they do was that if we had electronic health records on the computer and you went to the emergency room and had something done, it would magically appear in your doctor's office and the doctor's computer. And so that's kind of was the way that electronic health records were, um, envision. But that's not what happened because, because there's so much money in healthcare these days and so much money in electronic health records at this point, the last time I checked, there were 1000, 104 profit electronic health record companies and they're engineered so that they don't talk to each other.

Speaker 2:          27:29          So it's actually even worse than it used to be. So how bad is it? Well, um, doctors have ended up, so first of all, electronic health records haven't done what they should've done, but in addition had been used to acquire big data for the pharmaceuticals, marketing and advertising. And the doctor has been right in the middle of that doctor has been plumped in front of the electronic health records, which are based on a model of based on an old billing model that comes back from the 1970s and is incredibly clumsy. So clumsy that in a Stanford study doctors were actually spending 70% of their time on the computer. But in a more sort of shocking study, Kaiser got tired of hearing how whiny their doctors were about how much time you spend in the computer. So they actually decided to see how much time do our doctor spin on the computer and they picked two hospitals and they spend two months, uh, actually keeping track of all the stroke doctor, all the keystrokes. And then they added all that time up and they divided by the number of doctors. This was in two separate hospitals over two months and they discovered that the doctors out of an eight hour day, we're spending 10 hours on the computer.

Speaker 2:          28:49          So this is where our time is going. And we could get it back if we had electronic health records that only took as much time as the paper records, which were, which would take about 15% of our time. So in a 15 minute visit, they take two and a half minutes of time rather than, uh, taking more than 15 minutes of that 50 minute time, we could get the doctors off the computer back to doing the kind of care that I was able to give a Laguna Honda where we can actually get the right diagnosis and the right treatment. So that's actually what I'm focusing on now. And one of the reasons I wanted to speak to, uh, to this particular audience, cause I think it's very possible to create an electronic health records that's simple, that's cheap, that takes like two and a half minutes instead of 15 minutes and that everybody could use and would want to use.

Speaker 2:          29:38          So, um, some of my rather larger ideas for getting control would be to have the opposite of the three things I had before about what we spend our time on. So we could start in terms of forms with a lock for the conservation of forms. So my experiences that we have enough forms already and that we don't need any new forms. And I think in most hospitals situations that when an administrator comes up with a new form, they should find at least one form of equal length to get rid of second of all, uh, slow administration. I think that if administrators would think and would realize that every time they send an email, organize a meeting or come up with a new form, they are directly taking time away from the dock. And last we need the electronic health records, that preserve story. Because the problem with electronic health records based on the billing platform, I don't know if anybody hears ever seen them, but they make it literally impossible to s to understand what's actually going on with your patient.

Speaker 2:          30:42          And the last thing that I think we need to do in our healthcare system is to also start some experiments with being slow. And some of the ideas I've come up with for that is to just in a hospital situation to have a slow medicine clinic where the doctor would get as much time as they need it with patients. That's a novel idea, a slow medicine beds so that we had a few beds in the hospital where patients could be admitted when they needed to work up instead of getting piecemeal being sent all over town when they get sick and finally a slim at us and consult service. That would be the equivalent of an oncology consult service or a cardiology consult service, but it would be for slow medicine for the patients that we end up as doctors getting in the hospital that are so sick and complicated and we know we can not figure it out what's going on with him and we have to discharge them.

Speaker 2:          31:33          Instead. We could call it the slow medicine consult service and have them arrive and figure the patient out because in the end, I'm not a complete pessimist about healthcare. I'm a pessimist and an optimist. I think that healthcare is with healthcare, the glass is half full and half empty in this way. That in a lot of ways, uh, we've done a fantastic job with fast medicine. That this model of the body as a machine and the doctors, a mechanic has been incredibly powerful. Uh, if you look at what's happened over the last hundred and 50 years in medical history and nobody would ever want to go back to, um, to practicing medicine the way we did even 20 or 30 years ago. But on our way to fast medicine this, I did, the doctors would have enough time to get the right diagnosis to examine the patient to get the right treatment has sort of disappeared. And I think we need to go back and re institute this second way of looking at a patient for more on my book, which some of you have. And last, uh, I always like to remember who in the end won that race. So thank you very much for your time. We'll have some questions.

Speaker 1:          32:48          Thank you. I do have a question to start with, but people please think of questions for Dr Suite. So you're here at Google and a big focus for us now is machine learning and AI, which is being applied to all facets of human endeavor and actually creating a lot of breakthroughs. Um, do you have any thoughts on how machine learning and AI could in fact play a role in solving this problem with electronic medical health records that lose the story? Dr Spending too much time as data entry clerks in thoughts on that?

Speaker 2:          33:29          Yeah, I do. So, so that's really the issue of the hour, right? There's 1100 different electronic health records systems, but they all look exactly the same. They're all fundamentally the same. And um, they all lose the story there. Little bits of information. They're boxes that the docs have filled out. The old paper charts, we're basically books. They were basically books and they preserve the story of that patient. They were books because they had pages and they went through time that a beginning and a middle and an end. And this was incredibly useful as a doc because you could go through and you could read about how the patient first come in and the things that were done and with the nurse thought and with the social worker didn't what meds they were on, what labs. It was very useful for preserving the story and then what happened when electronic health records came in because they were built on this buidling platform, electronic health or as a, we look at today with the doctors all looking at a screen and it's a screen with boxes and alerts and Login, so the dog is sitting there logging things in.

Speaker 2:          34:32          Pharmacies got a whole different section, nursing as a different section and these are all little boxes and you cannot figure out from the electronic health records what's gone wrong with the person. I know this because my own father got sick a couple of years ago and was admitted to a hospital with the wrong diagnosis and this particular hospital at the time, the doctors and nurses were actually reading God's hotel and their book club, so I was a bit of a VIP. Nevertheless, I could not get those docs to change his diagnosis. They'd thought he'd had a stroke, but he hadn't had a stroke. He has a seizure and he had a history of seizures and we all knew he had seizures. I couldn't get them to focus. They even tried to change the, the, the, the diagnosis and the electronic health record, but they couldn't change it. So every time a new shift of doctors and nurses came down, they continued to treat my dad with, uh, the treatment for a stroke.

Speaker 2:          35:29          And eventually he was on so much medicine, medicine for the stroke and then medicine for the side effects of the medicine for the stroke and the medicine to the blood, kind of this sort of thing that he was clearly going to die in the hospital. So I was rather worried about him and I realized the only way I could really get them out of the hospital was to convince the doctors that we thought we had decided he was a hospice level, uh, patient. And we were wanting to just let him die. So once they accepted that, they let us take him home. And I took him off all the medicines that he was on and he had his 95th birthday last about two months ago and cut his own cake with a very large knife. I might add. He did it on purpose. Um, so I thought perhaps I'd missed something, right because I couldn't, there was no chart for me to look at and I was worried, well, maybe did have a stroke.

Speaker 2:          36:18          I mean, maybe I'm wrong. So I asked for those electronic health records, his electronic records from 10 days and I got them and it was amazing. I took me four hours to go through those electronic health records of my dad's. There were 810 pages. I had two questions I was trying to answer. What medications was he on at any particular time and why had they made the diagnosis of stroke? And I could not figure it out. I couldn't figure out anything. It was just page after page of, it was just, there was no way, and I spent four hours and I knew what I was looking for. So nobody who came to see him when they looked at those electronic health records could possibly a figured out what was wrong with him. So when you compare these beautiful old fashioned paper charts, it would have been easy.

Speaker 2:          37:09          I would have just gone through and looked at as original diagnosis how we got it. I would have turned back and looked at the labs, which would have been in a section, I would have looked at the x rays, I could have seen the nurse's notes, I could have followed the doctor's narrative. I could have followed this story would have been a snap. So my idea is that we take this model, this old fashioned model that's made out of paper and we just turned it into electronics, right? So we have an electronic paper chart, um, that preserves the story. And how would we do that? Well, so my imagination is that we have, we already had this technology, right? It's called an Ebook, right? So why not just use this idea of an ebook for our electronic health record? So if you, for instance, came into my office, you're a new patient.

Speaker 2:          37:56          We have some Hipaa privacy protected cloud that I can take a new chart out of it. That's your chart and it looks like a book like look books. It's on the computer, but it looks like a book. Right. And I should be able to, I think I should be able to, if I want, if I like to write, how come I can't like handwrite a note or if I like to dictate why can't, if I like to type, I should be able to do that. If I want to write in French, I should be able to do that. Right? I should be able to write the narrative of what happens and my physical exam, I should be able to turn that chart around, go look at fluffy the chart. Right? Why can't we do that? And then that would mean that if we did it this way, then when I'm done with your chart, I put it back in the cloud.

Speaker 2:          38:35          Let's suppose you have to go to the emergency room. They can just go take that chart out of the cloud. Right. And and write right it with themselves. I'm sure we can do that. Um, and so then the problem becomes, well, what do we do? Because these electric, one of the reasons electronic health records have been used this ways for billing. And the second reason is because of big data, right? Big Debt is very valuable. This idea that you can figure out instantly how many patients have hypertension or what, how many patients this, this kind of information is very valuable. Uh, just financially it's very valuable. Twilio, the marketing is valuable, but pharmaceuticals, it's value in the healthcare industry as a whole to right now what we have is we have the docs acting fundamentally as data care providers. That's what we do. We had a care provider, that's a new one, right?

Speaker 2:          39:26          We put, that's our job. We spend 110% of our time in front of the electronic health records simply entering data so that big data can be produced so that big data can be sold and used by these companies. And so what I don't seem to me, Becca and I have actually talked about this, is with art. If, if artificial intelligence can do all these marvelous things, why can't they take my handwritten notes and all this stuff and just stick artificial intelligence between the unnecessary big data and my electronic paper chart. And if artificial intelligence turned my chart into all the big data you want, why do I have to do it works for me. So that is a, that is a your challenge. Yes. That's why I challenge Google. Okay. But the gauntlet is now thrown. Yes. I think we should do that because if we could do that, it would be phenomenal. We could have doctors who could spend two and a half minutes, we'd have our 12 and a half minutes back with patients to examine them. The big data people who like all that stuff, they'd still be happy and you guys could do something fantastic. And I think it would be very interesting for artificial intelligence to look at that as a problem. Right.

Speaker 1:          40:40          So I have one more question, but then I want to want to let other people do it too. So in the news this week, um, I think it was just like yesterday, the day before was suddenly now announced that some of the health, you know, policy setters are, have changed the standard for hypertension and they've lowered the level of your blood pressure at which they consider that you have a problem and should go on medication. And I think I saw yesterday that now 50% of the adult population is now considered hypertensive. And in fact then I heard on NPR last night something about someone who was sort of an apologist for this was saying, but it's okay. We've determined that it's safe to medicate people at these lower levels of blood pressure. So it's fine. I that alarming

Speaker 2:          41:34          and I just wondered if you had any thoughts on this.

Speaker 4:          41:37          Okay.

Speaker 2:          41:38          Yes, I do have thoughts. Well, well, so my first thought actually was, so they've been doing this for decades and decades, so long ago when I was in medical school and they had actually,

Speaker 4:          41:54          okay.

Speaker 2:          41:55          So the way the docs determine what's, what's, uh, what's high and what's low is we don't really know. Actually, it's mostly statistical. We basically decide one standard deviation from the mean or two standard deviations from the mean by definition. That's that's what we do because we don't a priori, we wouldn't know what a normal sodium is though we didn't even know in normal sodium as we do billions of sodiums and people and then we declare these to be normal within let's say one standard deviation and everything else to be abnormal and then sometimes we'll be able to connect up a disease state or a symptom with those abnormalities. Yes, so with hypertension, that was done in around the 60s and seventies and the original definition of hypertension was actually, I may be one of the only people that remember this was actually about 180 over 110 I was two standard deviations from the mean.

Speaker 4:          42:50          Okay,

Speaker 2:          42:50          so that, and that was correlated with significant kidney problems when you have the high blood pressure, heart problems and extra strokes. So that actually was actually shown is evidence then over the years. But that doesn't, that's two standard deviations. What do you get? 7% of the people who are taking your medications, right? That's not very much. Right. That's not very good. So about about 20 years ago that they lowered the, they just randomly lowered and said, well now it's going to be one standard deviation from the mean, which is 160 over 90 which nobody has ever, ever correlated with actual damage, but they just assumed if really high blood pressure was bad, then kind of this, this was still high. It was one standard deviation mean well. So then we had an an epidemic of high blood pressure because suddenly we had 15% of people had rights.

Speaker 2:          43:41          Touristically you guys are all mathematicians. Once you go from two standard deviations to one standard deviation, you have 15% so you, oh my God, we have this epidemic because he used to be 7% of people that hypertension, now 15% of hypertension. So, but then we have 15% more people taking medications, which is very useful. So then about think you're being sarcastic. 15 years ago we declared that 140 over 90 was a hypertension. So then we had about 20% of people were now hypertensive. About 20% of people and then the cardiologist got together and decided that any amount of blood pressure was bad for you. They did. Did remember they did do that. Um, but this is that they didn't really officially declare it into this last week where they've lowered it once again down to one 30, which falls actually with way within the mean, right? The mean of a blood pressure. So consequently 50% of it's not surprising that 50% of people now have hypertension with a definition. How would they not? Right. Just statistically, and that means 50% of people are going to be on medications and um, do these medications have side effects? Yes, they all have side effects. Okay. Anyway, I, I'm asking too many questions. Anyone else have a question for Dr Suite or comment? Comment, comment? I have a microphone. Okay, great. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah. Actually

Speaker 5:          45:11          how much does that mean shifting over time though, since the 60s. What do you mean what you said it's so many standard deviations from the mean. That's right now

Speaker 2:          45:20          is that the itself over time? So the main I switched you're saying? That's a really interesting question. That's actually a very good question. As far as I know the mean is still the average ish is still about one 20 over 70 as far as I know. I mean that's actually a real interesting question. I don't know the answer to that. I don't know if anybody does. Do you know what you mean offhand? I think it's still one 20 over 70 it's just they keep coming down just like they've done with statens. It's exactly the same model. I mean status you're, you're elevated cholesterol was two standard deviations from the mean which was going to be an Ldl, the bad cholesterol of like 180 right and then they went to 160 and then they went to 130 which again meant that 50% of the people, not surprising where hypercholesterolemic because that was like within 50% of the people had an Ldl of one 30 and then the cardiologist declared that it doesn't really matter and we should have as low cholesterol as possible. Even though the white matter of your brain is white because it's made out of cholesterol and okay. You want me puts in and your sex hormones are made out of cholesterol. Vitamin D is actually, you know, d one d hydroxy cholesterol, so, okay. Yes. All right. Um, mescaline. Yup. I get your name right. It's selling

Speaker 5:          46:40          Selene. Yes, correct. So I will say my question about forms and administrators for later maybe, um, but I'm, I'm more curious, but maybe, maybe I'll start with the preface that, you know, we're a part of a technology company and it certainly feels like the world is moving faster and faster and we want to, you know, whether it's multitasking or enabling people to move faster, you put a lot of onus on the medical system and doctors to slow the system down. It seems like to not treat the body like a machine yet. What, what are your thoughts from a patient's perspective? Um, the, the, the ability to take some ibuprofens when I have a headache and solve the problem is, you know, it's nice to hand that off to the doctor and say, why are you prescribing me? I prefer orphans, but I can get this off the shelf. How do patients approach medicine differently and slow things down and look for longer solutions, more holistic solutions? Okay.

Speaker 2:          47:36          That's a really thoughtful question. Thank you. Um, well, you know what I would say is this, I think there's actually two flavors of patients to believers or people really. Some people really like medications. They like manZ , like labs. They like going to the doctor, they like, they just like it, they like meds. And then there's a whole other group that don't like meds of which I happen to belong to them. And what usually happens with docs in an open system is the docs like to prescribe meds and just naturally practice this way. Collect patients who liked to have medications. There's, there's a whole lot of people believe in meds, right? But I'm not one of them either as a doctor or as a patient. And I would tend to collect patients who think like me. So I don't think it's, you know, just one or the other. I think for the people who are reluctant to take meds, um, they don't usually take meds you very much. And if they can get away with just taking something off the shelf, sort of why not? Um, so,

Speaker 3:          48:36          okay.

Speaker 2:          48:36          I think that's how we would answer that question. I'm not sure if I get, if I got to the nub of it, which, cause you started out with talking about, you know, everything moving faster and faster and that is a patient, how can you get things to slow down in an [inaudible]? He thinks his patient, it says a person. I mean, I think, so. This is again, maybe a little off from me talking about, but you know, I think as far as our health goes, we couldn't live in a society that was more difficult to be sane and centered and enjoy your life then the society we live in right now.

Speaker 3:          49:15          Okay.

Speaker 2:          49:16          And I think, you know, sane actually is from Sonos, which means healthy inland and health, which has solos actually is connected to salvation. Then I like the one that's hello, which actually means health to you. Cause the old English hall was held and they're all related to this idea of wholeness. So Paul and how and how health and wealth, I think I could looked that up your, but I decided the other day, I think wealth fits into this wholeness model. We're fragmented, our attention is fragmented. Our, our, we're just in this kind of piecemeal sort of state and I think it's not a good state to be in.

Speaker 5:          50:04          Another question, building on sleeves thing. I think he says, you know, I think it's separating symptom from the source. So if you have a headache and that's a symptom, you said I can take an Advil and that will go away and you can just keep doing that for awhile, but you're not addressing the root cause. So if I can treat a symptom I'll do with myself, but if I can't get past that, then that's where I go to. The doctor helped me figure out what's going on. Great answer. Thank you. Won't you're supposed to comment on,

Speaker 2:          50:31          oh, I'm totally good with it. It's exactly right. That's exactly it is. If you can make it go away on your own and that's, you know, then I don't have a problem with that actually. I think that's a good way to go.

Speaker 5:          50:44          That's your measure of efficiency though. Are you looking at church and efficiencies through that headache? Headache today? It took a bill and went away. I looks like it's extremely efficient, but if every single day I'm taking this pill and I'm constantly dealing with that over the longterm, that's extremely inefficient and if I treat the source of that, it takes me longer to treat the source, but it solves it for much longer duration and therefore it's much more efficient in the loan.

Speaker 2:          51:07          Could answer. I just, it's super thank you. Two so means point. I think it's very hard for certain segment of patients to get over that. They want the quick fix. So in some ways many physicians respond to that by prescribing. You know, I think many of, and I speak as a physician myself, many of us would like to sit down, talk to our patients, spend time, and sometimes patients like me, you know, talk, I don't have time for this. I'm not gonna invest in my health care. I just want, you know, give me the antidepressant and I'll feel better. And I have time for therapy later, but I don't have time for that right now. So I think there's this whole sea change that has to also start from paint the patient point of view, actually wanting to invest time in there and themselves. So if you ever see a thousand patients, you don't have time. Correct. Anyone else? One last question maybe. Um, do you feel that you as a clinician that a, you are alone in this or as you go around and you're talking with other doctors and nurses and so on around the country, is this message of slow Madison resonating?

Speaker 4:          52:14          Okay.

Speaker 2:          52:14          Yeah, it sure is. And I, I sometimes wish I was a lot more about the general rather than a philosopher because there's a whole movement that is brewing out there is, there's so much frustration among doctors and nurses especially, I mean as much nurses, doctors that were just stuck in front of the computer. It's just maddening. So there's a huge, I I've spoken to like thousands of people by now. I mean personally in all these different talks and everybody wants something done about it, which is one of the things I thought about the electronic health records and getting, because that would at least get us off the computer. It's not complicated. I don't think it's as complicated as solution as it looks like at first. If we can just get back the time.

Speaker 2:          53:04          Okay. Yeah, sure. Since we're at Google, um, be curious about your comment on the use of Google glass in the doctor patient setting. So clinic that I will not name has now gone to using Google glasses. So you walk into the clinic room, your doctor has a Google glass on and on the other side of the Google glass is a transcriptionist probably in India, somewhere outsourced. That is documenting every single word that it occurs between you and your position during that encounter. So it's some ways its off sitting, it's taking more time. The doctor doesn't have to do the data entry, but there's this third person in the room through the Google glass that you're wonderful. An amazing company has enabled doctors to use this technology, but it has affected the doctor patient interaction. Many of my colleagues who are using it claim that it's given back their lives, that they're now completing all of their charting within the course of the day. They're going home and they're not taking their charts home with them because they don't have to because everything is transcribed for them. But I'm wondering, you know from all of you and from you what your perspective on this as a possible solution would be.

Speaker 2:          54:15          That seems to me, not a solution but impossible problem. I mean, I just, you know, it's like I was just horrified when I, when I heard about that. I mean, I can't imagine anything worse than going into my patient like this. Hi, I'm doctor [inaudible] and trying to look at the Google glass in their records out of the corner of my eye, it just seems whacked. Um, there is something called the scribe, which gives me the same feeling, which is doctors, so they don't have to sit in front of computer. Now there's an actual physical third person who follows you in the room and fills out your electronic health records while you supposedly are talking with a patient, which is a lot better solution, I think, than the Google glass where at least you're physically looking at the person. But Rebecca, do you have any thoughts on Google?

Speaker 1:          55:04          Well, actually I, I had a clinician who wanted to do that and I was uncomfortable and she did give me an option that you didn't mention, which is what I was uncomfortable with was Google glass is about looking at things. It's not just about audio transcription and so it could be beaming images. Right. Which feels like it could be a violation of the page and patients' privacy. So there were two modes. So the mode that I allowed her to use was just recording audio. But even so that I where I felt as an imposition in that trust relationship.

Speaker 3:          55:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          55:46          Personal anyway. Anything else? Oh yes please. That you have to have a paper trial, absolutely everything and that that's part of what's inhibiting your efficiency.

Speaker 2:          55:58          Can you say that a little bit? How much of it is driven by legal reasons and not like big data and collecting? Oh, I see what you're having in paper towel and yes, he says, well we have, you know, we do like to document things for, you know, for malpractice reasons, but if you just handwrite it, it's perfectly fine. Doesn't have to be in a computer per se at all. Um, so there's no reason that we have to have a clumsy electronic health record. It takes all our time and produces big data in order to document. It's actually a much better documentation if I actually write the story about you. You know, this 32 year old woman came in with chronic headaches and I thought this and we did this and this is what I think it is kind of story than it is to have what I found with my father, which was incomprehensible.

Speaker 2:          56:48          So it's not, that's not the legal thing. There is a legal piece that the United States, the one reason we've gone to having electronic health records was then in 2009 there was hidden in the reconstructing America Act. This little infant, they called it, sorry, uh, this, this little sub La thingy that every doctor that has anything to do with the federal government I think has to have their electronic health records. That's how it happened. It didn't happen gradually. It was like 2009 then they would start taking money out of your practice if you didn't have electronic records. So it was one of the reasons that suddenly they took this billing platform and just immediately tried to add things on so they could sell it. The doctors and the doctors can do that. So there is some legal piece of that, but it isn't so much like getting Sudi kind of thing. It's more like government. I do want to point out that Dr Suite has one of the few people on the planet who's actually read the entire affordable care act, 922 single spaced pages. It's as long as Harrison's principles of internal medicine. Okay. On that note, thank you very much. Thank you very much for having me.
