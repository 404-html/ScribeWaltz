Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Welcome everyone and thank you all for coming to today's talk. Uh, my name is Mike Diamond and I'm a manager in the Google advertiser platforms division focusing on programmatic strategy. Um, and I'm really excited and honored to be moderating today's talk. Um, I've been a member of the Leadership Council for an organization called upwardly global, uh, for the past nine or so years. The organization, um, helps refugees and immigrants find meaningful work in the u s that's requisite with their skills and experience. And when I think about, um, when I first got involved with the organization, it's amazing because there was really very little coverage of refugees and immigrants. Um, it took me a matter of five, 10 minutes to truly explain the organization's mission. Um, but over the past year, uh, with the dailies of media attention, there's been an increasing focus on refugees and immigrants, not only in the US but around the world.

Speaker 1:          00:01:10       Um, and it's been quite a tumultuous time for both of those groups. And refugees in particular have been in the spotlight both here and abroad and for good reason. Uh, worldwide displacement is that an absolute all time high with simply record numbers. They're staggering. Um, one in nearly every hundred and 22 people around the globe is either refugee internally displaced or seeking asylum. 65 and a half million people have been forcibly displaced, which is a 60% increase from just a decade ago. And over 22 million of those are refugees. So today we welcome two guests who can help us better contextualize and understand emerging stories in the media as well as our country is rhetoric and policies towards newcomers. Really New Americans. Our discussion today is going to be focused on both refugees and immigrants, really who they are, the workforce issues that surround them and our country's policies, um, towards them.

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       We're going to hope to cover US policy as well as practices with regards to resettlement of both refugees and immigrants will talk about the difference between differences between refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and immigrants. As we often don't talk about the nuance between those different groups. Um, and finally talk about some of the support systems that are here in America to support these communities. So without further ado, let me introduce you to our two. Uh, our two guests. First, Suzanne, cause Ori is the senior director of philanthropy and partnerships at the American Jewish joint distribution committee, also known as the JDC. She's had over 25 years of experience working in the refugee humanitarian field and in the course of her career has worked for three of the nine resettlement agencies in the u s um, Maine and managing various aspects of their resettlement programs. She attended Wellesley college and, uh, also received her degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University St.

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       Next to me as Nikki says, Ronnie, who I've known for many years and as the CEO of upwardly global, um, where she's worked for the, for the past eight plus years, as we'll hear later, uh, upclose work grew out of the resettlement system and as the first and longest serving organization to support the integration of skilled refugees and immigrants into the u s workforce. Um, Nikki has her, uh, received her MBA from Columbia, uh, and has a bachelor's degree in policy analysis from Cornell. So to kick things off, um, I like to just baseline a little bit on resettlement as a topic in general and it turned to Suzanne. Um, we'd love you to kind of help us get an understanding of the refugee situation both globally and here in the u s and start to understand why displacement has grown so much over the past, particularly 10 years or so.

Speaker 2:          00:04:28       Okay. Um, hello everybody. So, um, I'll focus on resettlement in the u s but just for perspective, the situation right now in Syria is definitely the thing that has turned the pendulum and really ramped up the, the desperation and the situation for refugees worldwide. But really we live in a world where there's much less peacebuilding. There's so much more persecution than ever before, but also we don't address the root causes so that people can go back. I mean, many of us remember situations in Vietnam, in Bosnia, in Rwanda where refugees returned to their homes. There is less and less of that today. So today we still see millions of refugees that have left Afghanistan. How many of you even remember when Afghanistan happened? That was way back in the 1980s some of you weren't even born Sudan, Somalia, all these things, these refugee crisis, we're so protracted and we haven't dealt with the peace building side of it.

Speaker 2:          00:05:37       And so refugees are just basically some of my colleagues call it warehouse in refugee camps or in cities around the world in poor countries and neighboring countries. And that's just persisted for so long. So there's a been a buildup, but very few solutions at, at the root causes. Um, very few refugees are resettled. So if the numbers, you mentioned Mike, maybe 1% only get resettled and it's like a lottery in a sense. If you get out of your country and have a chance at third country resettlement, many refugees, most of them, the bulk of them are in neighboring countries where really it's hard to welcome them because the neighboring countries are poor and it's just such millions and millions of people who need jobs, need livelihoods, need food, clothing, et cetera. And refugees don't want to be recipients of welfare. They want to be able to have a chance at continuing their lives.

Speaker 2:          00:06:40       That's why organizations like yours are so important. But all of our work is so important. So in the US, the US resettlement program traditionally has been different than other countries because our focus is employment almost to our detriment. Um, so the agencies, there's nine resettlement agencies in America, there were more before the fall of communism, but now there's nine. Most of them are faith based and three of them are not. So their church World Service, um, Hebrew immigrant aid society, Lutheran Immigration Refugee Services, US Catholic conference, world's relief. The Evangelical Group, they don't proselytize. But the reason they're important is that there are churches and constituents all over the country that welcome refugees. And the other three that are nondenominational are they international rescue committee, US Conference for Refugees. And there's an Ethiopian group, Ethiopian community and Development Group that does the same work committee. So all of them have sponsors around the country that help with the resettlement.

Speaker 2:          00:07:56       So they are professional staff and sponsor because the resettlement program in America is a private public partnership. The idea is it's so important to welcome refugees in your community and you don't want to impact any one community in the country. Usually if refugees had their choices, they'd all go to Florida, California cause they're warm in their minds and maybe New York because it's so receptive, but welfare is such in some of these states that it's so generous that really the system is geared in such a way that refugees who don't have family members usually have to go to states where they have hospitable communities to welcome them and to work with the professional staff like these nine agencies. And what we're responsible for doing is refugees are recognized as refugees by State Department overseas. They don't, it's asylum seekers that come to the u s borders, but refugees are recognize it's part of the u s foreign policy to recognize people of humanitarian concern to the u s so it's usually countries that America realizes are persecuting its own populations.

Speaker 2:          00:09:14       The president of the United States and congress set the ceilings, the numbers of people who get to come in and basically they're processed overseas. It's a long, long, long process. All of you have heard that screening people for um, admissions to the u s is very complicated because you have to go through a lot of security clearances. Basically you go through a UN agency called the UN High Commissioner for refugees who then refers you for resettlement to one of many countries in the world. Your papers go through. Some refugees have been there 10 2030 years before they even arrived to America, especially those coming in from Africa. Some come in about two, three years, which is considered very fast after waiting and they come here, we receive them. The resettlement agencies basically received them with sponsors in America. The responsibilities are to get people employed as soon as possible.

Speaker 2:          00:10:16       And for that reason they usually take very low paying jobs. The bar is to try and get jobs that will help people become self sufficient enough money to pay for your rent. And basically over a longer timeframe, a longer arc in your life. You start learning the English, you start doing all those other things and you slowly, slowly move up the ladder. So it's, it's, it's a difficult thing, but that's the emphasis of the u s program and some of the countries in Europe, they would rather a refugee, go on welfare then get the job of a local person. But in the states, that's not the way we do it. We do it with a real emphasis on early self-sufficiency. Um, so that basically, and so when refugees come in, the resettlement agencies within 90 to 120 days have to get you a job, help you with an apartment.

Speaker 2:          00:11:13       And remember it's not just through State Department money, it's a lot of the goodwill of American people and neighbors and communities get you jobs, social security numbers, help enroll kids in school help connect you to your community because nobody wants refugees to live in isolation. You both want a host community and the community that might be existing like an ethnic community that can speak the same language so they can have access to food that's familiar to them. So basically the program runs for the most part really beautifully. But with the idea that you give the minimum over the long term, there are other social services that refugees can access, state employment programs, ESL programs, et cetera. And that goes on for a long time. But it takes organizations like upwardly global that have that specific understanding of what kind of support system. Somebody trying to get a new job and move up in the market really requires. And so organizations like this are more and more important to make sure that refugees are not an underclass. Cause as Mike said, there are new Americans, they're not refugees when they arrive here. We've selected them as people who will be part of our communities and many, many contribute immediately to, sorry, it was a long, long

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       response, but it's a big issue. Yeah. Can you tell us a little bit more about the profile of refugees? So are they families, individuals? Like what does that, what does that look like? Okay, so in general,

Speaker 2:          00:12:59       um, it's a difficult question to answer it. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees used to have these posters and said, says these are refugees and there would be these little puppets, pictures of anybody you can imagine. So because basically when you have a refugee crisis, it's everybody. So it, it could be anyone who's a Moslem. Anyone who's a Christian, anyone who's a Jew and from all classes, it doesn't discriminate. Governments don't discriminate just by class. So it's basically everyone. Um, more than half are probably children. Um, most coming to the u s are families. There are situations and places where single people are coming primarily because of maybe specific persecution that had government has inflicted on a certain group. But genuinely it's mostly families, but it's everybody. It's carpenters, it's journalists, it's everybody. It's anybody.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       We started mentioning, I know you've worked for a number of the resettlement organizations. Can you tell us a little bit about the process that those ordination go through to, to help families? To help individuals?

Speaker 2:          00:14:15       Okay. So most important is having volunteers, having people to support refugees. That's one of the most important things. We usually realize it. Again, another aspect of the American program at Visa VI refugees is priority's given to people who have family members in the u s because they're obviously the biggest support system and then your community and volunteers are the other support system. So for church based organizations you can have many churches helping with sponsorship. So mentoring kids in school, um, uh, mentoring families, helping families. There's a lot of psychosocial issues that maybe people are suffering from isolation, depression. So it really helps to be integrated. Um, the church based agencies I've worked for often have used church sponsors or community connections, but a church agency, we'll also work with a mosque if you have, um, you bring in a lot of interfaith groups because you don't want people to just be labeled and just be ghettoized when they come.

Speaker 2:          00:15:25       It's really so important as many more people as you can bring in. The more important it is, and maybe the single most important aspect is financial, which is helping people get jobs, helping women with maybe five children, find childcare. So they really, the agencies help with all of that very much. In the beginning the expectations of the organizations are all the same. So whether I worked for a church based agency or the international rescue committee, the basic factors, we all have to give a certain standard of service to make sure that people are self sufficient or know where to go and get services so they're not on their own because there's a lot of support systems from the state that also are available to people. And just a quick follow up, how long do those support systems last? It's very short in terms of the contract with which, let's say the resettlement agencies have with State Department, so it's between 90 to 120 days that the relationship really is there. And then the rest of it is referrals and passing things on to state and city actors or private actors like upwardly global who come in and help out and pick people up to the next step and next level. And some of the organizations have longer term contracts. They may have employment contracts from the state or from the city because there is an understanding by many states and cities that you require a specific kind of understanding and language experience and cultural experience to help with these things.

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       In your experience, what do you think some of the biggest challenges that the organizations face as they're trying to help some of these groups? Okay, so, so today and I, I bet everyone would have the same response is it's just this feeling of fear and feeling that you're not welcome. I should also tell you that refugees when they're fleeing their countries very often don't want to go to a western country. And most people think they do know they want to be right by their homes so they can go back home tomorrow. And the fact is after 10 20 years, five years, you stop thinking that even with the Syrian refugees was very, very difficult for the Western world to convince them that you have been so persecuted, you're unlikely to go back home. You know, resettlement might be the right thing for you. You have a chance at a new life.

Speaker 2:          00:18:07       And most people make those decisions for their children because they know that going back is not an option. Um, so the challenges to me are isolating people fear. Um, which is part of what's happening in today's rhetoric about refugees. I mean, the idea that you can have a bag of skittles and one of them can, can be dangerous is that that creates fear. And that's not been the history of America. So we talk about refugees, but in America there have been so many groups that have come in for hundreds and hundreds of years. Even before there was an official enactment of refugee law, we've had immigrants and refugees coming since this country started. And there's been backlash, backlash against the Chinese backlash against the Irish backlash against the Italians. I mean, hatred and vitriol like we hear today. So actually I'm very positive. I feel this is part of a trend that will change, but I feel that there are moments in our history that this happens. But I really believe in what I've seen everywhere is there is something unbelievable in America in terms of how America welcomes the stranger. Because so many Americans have had the experience of being a stranger themselves and it's unbelievable. We, so many of us in our family members have been recipients of that kind of kindness.

Speaker 1:          00:19:41       It's nice to hear some of that optimism.

Speaker 2:          00:19:43       Yeah, I believe that genuine,

Speaker 1:          00:19:46       one of the things that's really struck me through my experience with upwardly global was how many refugees and immigrants are highly educated and are coming to this country with years and years of experience and university degrees. Um, a stat that I've learned is roughly 28% of that community has bachelor's degrees or higher, which is compared to roughly 29% of the u s population. Um, the interesting thing is that despite that expertise, despite that experience, so many of these immigrants and refugees are either unemployed or as, um, uh, Susana lit it or under employed, which is a term that we don't really talk about a lot. Uh, and so, um, many of them end up being very poor and that is certainly not a situation that they deserve. Um, and so when I think about upwardly global, I want to kind of transition over to Nikki, um, to, to talk about, you know, why that problem exists and how do you think you have addressed it and can other organizations kind

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       of addressed that? Sure, sure. Um, so I think it's easiest to talk about the founding of upwardly global because our founder and I'm not, the founder of the organization was working in refugee resettlement and while resettlement happens through nine different volunteer agencies throughout the country, the government also has some national services that help all of those volunteer agencies do their jobs, particularly with respect to us. Husan said employment. Um, our founder was working and that employment technical assistance to the volunteer agencies when the first wave of Bosnians came over. Now the Bosnian refugee cohort was relatively highly educated, um, and it was in seeing that the system was set up to do what Susan said, rapid attachment jobs. Those jobs tend to be low wage, low skill work. And it was her experience watching literally surgeons and engineers wind up in the front lines of chicken processing plants where they were considered the best employees in the organization, but there was nothing left in the system to help them get back into their trained fields.

Speaker 3:          00:21:51       And our founder was sort of spinning the narrative on its head, which is not only is it an old romanticize narrative that the first generation comes and sacrifices so that the next generation can enjoy the opportunities that this country and that that's a detriment to the individual, but that that's also a detriment to the country. So this was really at the beginning in which, I mean we've talked more and more certainly over the last decade when I've been with upwardly global about a skills gap in the country. But the vision of our founder was exactly that, that this is, this is we're losing out on two sides when we accept under employment and when the narrative we build is encouraging those who are coming with skills to accept sort of their new station in life. And that was part of what happened in the system. That there was a bit of a narrative that says, look, your education from your home country may just not count here or the the sort of quicker you sort of accept your new station in life, the better your integration is going to go.

Speaker 3:          00:22:40       And upwardly global was founded for that niche of the population where we were trying to change that narrative by proving that better outcomes were possible for refugees. And then as we sort of grew as an organization, realizing that the problem existed for a much broader swath of the immigrant population. Um, so we exist because despite the media having you believe that every immigrant in the country might be undocumented or coming through the h one B process, most people don't know. We legally allow about a million people into the country every year through our regular immigration channels. And so our primary immigration policy in the country is family reunification. We also of course have a policy of refugee resettlement where you're getting a skilled population coming through and then also the diversity card lottery. So through those three channels alone, you get a million people coming in a year. And of the adult population of that larger group, you've got 48% who have a bachelor's or better and you have drastic underemployment.

Speaker 3:          00:23:38       So the, the, on the whole, if you look at everybody coming in about one in four windup, under or unemployed. Um, and then if you look at subgroups like refugees, those coming from Africa, Latin America, Middle East, it's much more drastic than that. Why does that happen? So if you start to think about your own sort of trajectory as a professional and you start to think about what you needed in order to get where you're going, some of those things will not be there for somebody coming to the country after they've been educated and started their career. So the biggest thing that could possibly be missing, of course, his English language skills, and that's true for about half the population that wind up under or unemployed, is that their English is simply not sufficient. Now that doesn't mean that they're not fluent. It means that actually there's a big difference between being good at English and what they call very good.

Speaker 3:          00:24:30       And I promise you, these are technical terms, good is where you can actually be very conversant. Somebody understands what you need, understands how to give it to you because you can make yourself understood being very good actually trans aggresses that and it means you've actually achieved a level of English where years likely to speak it in the home as you are your home, your, your, your home country language. And it also means that you understand the contextualized English of your field. And so when you have English barriers, I don't want everybody to think that you have people who don't speak English at all. That part of the problem is that English is not moving people from that good to very good. Um, in addition to that, one of the biggest barriers that newcomers face is a lack of a professional network. Think about how you found your job here at Google.

Speaker 3:          00:25:14       Um, it could be that a recruiter saw you on linkedin and called you. It could be that they found that profile on linkedin through somebody else. They were looking at it on linkedin. Um, but in most cases, as we progress through our careers, we use our network to find our next job or an opening in that job. When you come to resettlement, when you come through family reunification, you, you're less likely to have that professional network. And then there's other barriers. Um, a culturation, uh, the job search is very different here in the u s than it may be another countries. So a very classic example. I don't know if we have anybody who was educated outside the u s experience outside the u s but your resume may have its picture on it, marital status, religious affiliation. Um, it's not atypical to have a five, six, seven, even eight page resume and from certain parts of the world.

Speaker 3:          00:25:59       And then if you just start to think about the nuance of American culture, we are typically self promoting. Um, meaning that we don't, we don't shy away from talking about accomplishments of yourself or your team. Um, but that you have to actually do that. We express enthusiasm about a job. We tend not to be as hierarchical as other cultures. So our interview processes require that we ask the interviewer questions, things that may feel odd coming from other types of, um, cultures where that's just not done in the job search. And so what you have is this no network, uh, resume and set of job search skills that are not working here. And then finally, what you have is you have a misunderstanding of foreign education. Foreign degree simply in most cases is not as highly prized and or understood as a US degree. And so when you're coming with a Middle Eastern name and the University of Baghdad on your resume, an employer may see that and simply not know what to do with it. And that's the kind of innocuous, uh, version. And then the non innocuous one is his subconscious and even conscious bias. We're here in New York City. Sometimes it's hard for us to really grasp that that happens. Uh, but I can tell you we worked throughout the country, upwardly global, and we see routinely, um, simply bias in the hiring process. Um, so that's why the problem exists. And, uh, and who would exist for, so refugees in America are we settled in some 300 communities across the country. So you can imagine where some of this plays out.

Speaker 1:          00:27:31       Um, so one of the interesting things is there's, there's been a big focus in, in previous administrations, particularly Obama administration around, uh, employment and economic opportunity and placing refugees into, into, uh, into their fields program called Partnership for refugees with nearly 6 million open jobs in the country. Why do you think, you know, what are some more of the reasons why you feel like it's so difficult for refugees to get placed both on the, and we've talked a lot about the refugee side, but even more so potentially on the corporate side from your experience working with some of the biggest, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:28:07       yeah, yeah. Um, so yeah, so just to sort of juxtapose, the Obama Administration was very interested in immigrant integration and in the workforce. And so there was a larger effort broadly for immigrants and then very specifically to bring companies to the refugee crisis, a corporate response called Partnership for Refugees. Um, I think largely companies don't necessarily find this population as readily, particularly the refugees for a number of reasons. One is they tend to have a gap at the top of their resume. It could be a handful of months, it could be a number of years. Um, uh, and so if their most recent job is actually the stocking shoes at Payless, um, when in fact they are an engineer of some sort and we see all kinds, um, it's unlikely that a, an uh, somebody reviewing a resume pool is going to understand why that gap exists and we may make certain assumptions about that gap.

Speaker 3:          00:29:01       And simply we're in competitive markets, right? How do we screen lots of resumes? The second is as again, I think a very large misunderstanding about the work authorization of certain immigrant classes. Refugees have a green card, they work without visa sponsorship as do a number of immigrant classes. So I can't tell you how many times we've worked with big companies, fortune 15 companies that have said to me, we can only hire citizens. And I have to delicately say that's actually an EEO violation. Unless the position require a security clearance, where citizenship is necessary for most positions in the economy, you are not allowed to discriminate between green card and citizenship. And so the misunderstanding when they see a foreign name and a foreign degree, you know, is that this person will needs sponsorship and we don't do that. Um, so I think, and then the other thing is where the channels, where are, where are our companies going for their talent?

Speaker 3:          00:29:58       And you know, so you work within networks. Um, I'm sure he even here at Google, right? They're strong referral culture. Refer your friends if you're smart and motivated and they're coming again. So what helps refugees in the beginning, our ethnic enclaves that support them in language acquisition, getting their kids in school, ethnic groceries can also become isolating when they're not connected to the mainstream. Um, and so you do find this gap between where they are and companies saying that they want talent, uh, but not necessarily knowing where and how and how to evaluate within the existing processes, the talent pool that lies within these 2 million highly skilled but under employed immigrants and refugees in the country. So I guess as a followup to that, what are some of the ways in which, you know, to, at a policy level, we're educating corporate leaders to be able to understand those groups better?

Speaker 3:          00:30:47       Right. Um, I, I mean, I think the larger conversation right now is about finding talent, period, right? So I think you see a couple of things. I think you see a larger movement to understanding that diversity and inclusion happens, right? In a lot of ways that we have to source talent from, from a lot of venues. Um, and in addition to that, it's, I think really about the companies embracing bias as we see them trying to do, um, and really understanding where they may have that bias. Um, and then I think it's really about understanding recruiting processes and how often are we really creating diversity through our processes versus screening it out. Um, but from a policy standpoint, it's still at an individual company level. This administration has not sought to catalyze the corporate sector and maybe the same way that the last administration did.

Speaker 3:          00:31:36       And so it's still at a very individual company level. I think it's still under the broader umbrella of companies seeking talent and being in a moment where, how do you assess that? Could it come from foreign degrees? Can it come from no degree? Right? And we're seeing this broader sort of idea that maybe we don't need a degree for certain jobs in the economy and we're just sort of inflating what is necessary in educational attainment to achieve certain, um, in demand jobs. So I think that we're, we're just trying to thread our ourselves and the population into the larger narrative right now that where talent is and how we access it, the things we have to do to get at it. I would just say that at a really basic level, the fear that's going on right now, this,

Speaker 4:          00:32:18       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:32:19       vilifying immigrant communities, this sense that they're pariahs rather than looking at people as assets, bringing in assets, bringing in degrees, bringing in diversity, bringing in diversity in, in ethnicity, but

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       bringing in diversity. Even in age. You know, America has been very, very lucky because we're a young country because of this influx of a million new people every year where not Japan, we're not Italy. We're not suffering from a workforce to retirement ratio like other countries because of this. There's so many and in many, many places. I don't know where you are all from, but there are many cities in America that can talk about being revitalized because of new ethnic communities that have come in and are working and have brought work and have invested in private businesses. And so all of that's not part of the conversation now. And really I hear even from people I, I met recently with a couple of people who are from Google and whose husbands and wives don't have jobs, but people are afraid to go out now and look for jobs. Everyone is so afraid of discrimination.

Speaker 3:          00:33:40       Eh, we, um, I'm not going to overstate this statistic understanding that I'm at Google, but we did start to track, we partner with employers in our program. Our program focuses largely on the soft skills that immigrants need, job search skills, resume interviewing, networking. Um, and we've, we've made those things, um, such that they can do them in a self paced way or that they can have one on one advisory through our program. And then on the employer side, we engage employers. We do training for them on who the population is. We do some anti bias training, but we also engage employers and volunteer opportunities. Um, we've done it with Google where employees actually work as mock interviewers to newcomers and they teach them really what was good in the interview, what wasn't. They get formalized feedback. It goes into their advisory process. Um, but we do also believe in contact theory and even in these major markets, upwardly global has a footprint of about seven cities throughout the u s some like New York and some like Boise, Idaho.

Speaker 3:          00:34:36       And what's incredible is that uniformly across that contact theory holds that people will change their minds and their attitudes about a certain population after having had a personal experience interacting with them. And what we have found is that some companies come to us and say, we don't want to do any of this employee engagement, show his talent. And we've actually measured how many times we present a candidate to how many times they then interview a candidate presented. And we've then later gone on to have employee engagement with that company and measured the present to interview ratio and seen enormous growth in the present to interview ratio once we have employee engagement, meaning their employees or are interacting with our job seekers in a meaningful way.

Speaker 5:          00:35:24       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:35:25       One last question before we open it up. And I think one of the, one of the amazing things has been watching over the globals growth over the past 10 plus years, just in terms of the amount of job seekers they've supported from hundreds, thousands,

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       uh, in, in individual year. Right. But I know that you've done a lot of thinking about how to scale the program beyond that contact specific piece. Sure. How have you done that? And you know, with a Google audience, we always think about bringing our product to, to a wider audience. So yeah. Have you done that?

Speaker 3:          00:35:54       Yeah. Great. Um, we, we did it as any 21st century companies doing it. We used more technology. So a program that was started out being very much in person with training. We realized we have a population that is very inclined to use technology. They are highly skilled in their home countries. I mean 30 anywhere between 30 and 40% of them in any given year have a masters or better that work with us. Um, and so we didn't have to do trainings in person. We could absolutely use the best of online learning and the best of technology. So we've really tried to take everything we were doing that we knew were critical elements of the program and do as much of what didn't need a human to do through a automation technology, robust platforms and robust online learning management functionality. I mean, to the point where we actually now we were spending hours of human time taking foreign resumes and making them look like us resumes.

Speaker 3:          00:36:46       And now we just built a resume builder tool. It just pulls it into a US style format, like drop the picture and then interactive trainings that teach you what information goes where so that at least you can compete for the job. Our job is not to get anybody a job is to give them the tools to compete for the job, which I think is very inherently American. Um, and we're now doing that with a technology platform and a portal that we can license to partners like the resettlement system. So if you are our IRC and you have x number of organizations on the ground, some of those wolverine receiving higher volume of refugees that are highly skilled, but the system's not really set up as we heard from Susan to to that work. But some of them are coming ready to go today. The Iraqis are all been educated in English.

Speaker 3:          00:37:33       They speak English very well. If they went to university, they don't need necessarily to take a survival job. Some of them are coming because they serve the u s military forces. They know us culture relatively well. Um, so you can have tools that now you can just embed in the existing system. Community colleges, libraries, even the federal workforce system is really geared towards helping people get really low wage, low word, uh, low skilled work or mid skill work. Now, um, you can actually offer it through the system. They licensed the portal, they licensed the resources and we're scaling our growth that way through productizing what we've done. And I just want to say this, keeping data on all of it since day one. So the most fun, right of what we do, um, and that I'm really excited about for the future is that it's, it's like these mini pathways for those who come to the u s and the more data you have, the more time you can help them avoid pathways that didn't work.

Speaker 3:          00:38:31       A doctor who comes to the u s of a certain age with a certain background, a certain specialty may have decision points in their journey in the u s should they relicense as a physician. So did they find an alternate degree that may take less time and fewer resources? I have had a higher degree of success and we're going to start to have enough data to look at where are they in the u s where, where were they educated, how long ago to give them some analysis of what are the best ways for them to pathway back into professional careers that use their, their skills and their experience and their, we are doing a little test with a, with a Google big data product. So, so I would say that data that, that distinguishes upwardly global is incredible. And it's the only way to counter those stories that keep circulating. I mean, I'm a huge fan because of this. I mean it's really distinguishes upwardly global from any other service provider in this field. I think in this niche.

Speaker 2:          00:39:30       Really exciting stuff. So I do want to open it up for audience questions and feel free to please come to the mic because we are recording this talk. Um, so we'll open it up to you guys.

Speaker 2:          00:39:46       I, uh, that was so great. So my question is, do you guys have a, a clear sort of end goal that you're trying to achieve for any given sort of refugee or immigrant? Like what would be considered a success? Like would it be a success if, say this doctor who came over became like a lab tech, would it be only a success if he became like was was still working in the medical profession or maybe would it be considered as success if maybe his kids eventually like went to a really great college and you know, eventually went on to medical school? And what is sort of, how are you measuring sort of your progress?

Speaker 3:          00:40:19       Great question. Um, so we've thought about this problem a number of ways and you know, I'm sort of trained right with an economics France. So mine is like optimization, right? When, when are we optimized? We have decided as upwardly global that we're sort of in a turn of the wheel where our goal is at least creating a high quality system of non vulnerable support. And that's a fancy way of saying no matter where you land in the u s you should not be without a resource that can support you understanding where and how to rebuild your professional career. And so this is sort of the phase we're in. While we've done that though, and because of the data, what we have is a large body of information on licensing and relicensing. What are the barriers? Whose relicensing? How easily? Because remember for professions like doctors, dentists, lawyers, civil engineers, there's, and it's governed by state.

Speaker 3:          00:41:10       It's not even a national policy that where you land in the u s may predict the ease with which you can relicense. And so I think for us, this first turn of the wheel is about getting what we have into the system in a way that is not vulnerable and ubiquitous and to be able to collect the data on it. And the second turn of the wheel, it would be optimizing for understanding the policies around um, certification. So who's getting jobs, who needs to recertify and if they are an in demand fields where certification is necessary, what and how is most helping them obtain those certifications? In some cases it's financial support. They don't have the $800 to take a Coursera course. Again, we're being supported by Google to sort of fix that gap. In some cases it's a little more sophisticated. It's just simply a very long arduous process to recertify.

Speaker 3:          00:42:03       And there's not necessarily a benefit to the recertification is that the professional bodies that govern these industries stand in the way. So a very classic example, not to throw the physician's assistants under the bus, but a doctor could easily apply their training in their home country to become a physician assistant in the u s where the four years that somebody with no medical training would need should, could be shortened. But the physician assistant, um, professional industry group holds tight that none of that previous medical experience training or experience can apply towards efficiency physician assistant degree. And they're hopefully over time our data, we'll help if there's a movement in the advocacy world, um, to be pushing for, for relicensing barriers, um, to be lowered. For me, it would be that wherever somebody has a skill that can contribute to the economy, we're not letting an issue of their ability to compete stand in the way and we're not letting an issue of financial resources to obtain the proper licensing stand in the way.

Speaker 3:          00:43:02       If, if I could just respond to, I would respond to it a little bit more broadly about resettlement. Right. It's also about integration and I can't emphasize that enough. So what Nikki's addressing is something much more as a systematic response overall. Right. The resettlement agencies may get some people certified because some of the volunteers or support groups may have that extra money to do this, but she doesn't want it to be something ad hoc. She wants us to be something systematic that people have. But the arc, the, the trajectory that the resettlement agencies have is the longterm, which is, we've seen refugees and immigrant communities over a longterm. So I always say to refugees yesterday was bad. Today may be bad, but tomorrow will be better is that idea of the improvement is gradual, but it happens and they definitely see it with their families. But not letting people be isolated is so critical because America will suffer if we make people afraid and isolated and we're seeing back and countries in Europe and the reason we don't have those problems is we have absorbed people well for hundreds of years. We shouldn't be afraid of absorbing people. Well, thank you. Thanks.

Speaker 3:          00:44:30       I would guess that like,

Speaker 6:          00:44:32       okay,

Speaker 7:          00:44:32       the more time people spend languishing in refugee camps, like probably the worst it is for their eventual outcomes. Is that, is that something you've seen from the evidence?

Speaker 3:          00:44:40       Yeah. Particularly the older they are when their journey starts. So young people do better. We've seen young folks complete university pre or during even refugee camp, um, time in a refugee camp and then come out. And because there is still young companies will take a chance on them. Those, our experience and our data, I'm talking, you can probably talking about the field in general is that we've seen the older they are, when they get in a refugee camp in the longer they stay there. It is indeed harder when they get out. That's what we've experienced. Is that the question? Where are you going to add something else?

Speaker 2:          00:45:11       So, so, um, there are more and more programs overseas that we call livelihoods programs. I mean, people need, people are so anxious even psychologically. So imagine if you're in a, not just a camp, but even a city where you're just a welfare recipient and you just want to be in control of your life and your family. You want a chance at a skill, at a job, at something. And Actually Google supports a lot of workforce livelihood programs all around the world. Um, my organization, even in a program in Israel for minorities in that country has a Google support. But it's so important for people even psychologically to feel they have a skill to have a chance, but the need is so much greater than the resources out there to give people either the skills or the jobs that they need. But you're right. And adolescence are particularly vulnerable, right? Because they're growing up in this vacuum. And that's so scary because idle adolescence, even in our own homes aren't a good thing. Can you imagine in that kind of environment? Yeah. Thank you for that. They're right. Or young adults. Hmm.

Speaker 7:          00:46:32       I just want to say thank you because your outlook on this is very positive and that's a great narrative that actually as someone who's worked with adolescent refugees, that's pretty dire. Um, obviously there's like a lot that can be done with the data and technology and sort of the idea of building resumes and all of this. But I wanted to touch a little bit more again on what you're talking about in terms of networking and stuff because I feel like even for people born here and everything, that's a huge issue and barrier to getting jobs. And if you could go a little bit more into the work that you do and potentially the more work that could be done in terms of working with the refugees, integrating, creating networking opportunities for them. Because yeah, you can be the best qualified person and to have a spic and span resume and if you don't know the right people, it's just not going to happen.

Speaker 2:          00:47:15       Yeah. Yeah. I mean I'll, I'll talk about two things there. One is just teaching

Speaker 3:          00:47:25       again, the gap in the system is helping newcomers understand networking is necessary. That it's a part of how we look for jobs and we do it outside of our family or our immediate community. So in other cultures, networking might happen, but it might happen in a little bit more of a its family or its immediate community. So education is a piece of the puzzle, just that it's done getting people comfortable with doing it. Any U s with us expectations. Um, two is the use of linkedin from an educational standpoint. So again, I mean we just do training on how to use linkedin. How did you your profile, how to optimize your profile. Linkedin helps us with that. Um, I think the third about networks is um, a little bit more of the systematic too when we see sort of like how are you going to get people hooked in?

Speaker 3:          00:48:13       And so I think two things. I think that there's a systematic response and I think there's a community or movement response. The systematic response would be, wouldn't it be great if the resettlement system could get everybody on linkedin profile as they're starting? Right. And I think the badging movement might start to help similarly, but in the same way you have to have communities that are opening their arms and saying, we're here to help. It's got to be a community or movement type response. And I actually do think you see that response companies were very engaged after the refugee crisis here and in some cases internationally about saying how can we help? And I think that idea that you're actually extending a hand specifically as social capital, um, first and helping them understand what's expected, but then in extending social capital, um, and I know it's exactly as you say, it's not technology. Um, it is the part of the work that still has to be done because it's values based. It's what we believe is sort of right to do. And because we're acting as communities that are better being compassionate as well as sort of a thoughtful about economic integration and its benefits. I don't know if you want to add to that.

Speaker 2:          00:49:21       So, so tell me the emphasis of your question again.

Speaker 7:          00:49:25       Um, just the idea of how you can take this. It's, it's almost the most ephemeral part of getting someone to jog in the u s and you can't just figure, there's no specific process to it. But when you, even no matter how you try in terms of networking and helping people with jobs that way, given so much of success in terms of hiring and all of that is driven by that very element.

Speaker 2:          00:49:46       So I think maybe Nicki was alluding to it when she said the community response. But living in New York, you really see these themes of different communities that have specific jobs. So the superintendents are, I don't want to say these things, but are from a certain ethnic group or the people who work in places that you know, might be in the, um, gas places or from a soap. People talk to each other. Um, technology, social media has helped. WHATSAPP really helps, you know, an organization's humanitarian organizations, resettlement agencies like IRC, trying to work very hard and using technology to really help people in terms of locating jobs, helping people in many, many creative ways. But I think people really, so the, the really neat things is refugees and immigrants are resourceful and they're so smart and they know how to survive and succeed. We just have to be careful that they're not so afraid to be here. Right. Like and so that they don't turn inward, but that they go ahead and embrace the challenges that are out there. I don't know if I answered you, but I think

Speaker 7:          00:51:01       they create dairy. There's a whole other question about empathy from non from the existing communities here, but that's for a huge though. I have to say it.

Speaker 2:          00:51:10       Yes. I would say on the positive side, so all the agencies that do this work and definitely the resettlement agencies, but I'm guessing even the agencies that go beyond resettlement, the the, the amount of support that the American people gave with their hands and feet in terms of volunteers and with their pockets in terms of money, when the rhetoric is ramping up, the support systems for refugees really are amazing. They're just not aware of it because it doesn't get pressed. They just keep hearing all the bad stuff. But in America, the protections, the support systems, the, it's, it's incredible. The goodwill of of America towards these individuals I think.

Speaker 7:          00:51:58       Thank you. I hope you're at

Speaker 8:          00:52:02       hi. Hi. Hi. Do you have hard or soft data on what employers find are the challenges in terms of considering refugees or immigrants into bringing them into their organizations? And is that something that you've been able to kind of write down or you know, is that found in a certain location in terms of what challenges on the employer side. Yeah. Um, and do you have any denial? Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:52:26       sure. Yeah, I mean on the, and to your question about harder stuff, data, it's been soft until now. We just did the first sort of official report. Oliver Wyman actually did like a third party report on it first. That's embargoed for a couple more weeks. But I can give you some headlines to what we, we thought was going to be there and that we've heard over the years. One is that it's very hard to take an alternative candidate and advocate for them. There's risk involved in that as an HR manager and even sometimes as an employee who's advocating for a candidate. So that gap at the top of the resume, that education, there's no us professional experience on the resume. So making a case for that candidate feels risky. And in fact, one of the things that we've experimented with significantly over the years is pushing for contract work and measuring how much of our contract work turns into full time work for our job seekers.

Speaker 3:          00:53:18       And so we've seen about a 69% conversion rate over the years from contract to full time. And that's because people perceive lower risk with timebound contract work. And so that risk perception is very high. And getting somebody who feels safe bringing an alternative candidate and, and making a case for them and probably feels, say failing right at having somebody fully integrate. Then the practical challenge of it after that I think really has to do with a culturation and mentorship. So, um, is there a culture of mentorship within a company? We've found where there's a real culture of mentorship, they do a lot better. We've also found that companies that have a lot of internationally trained people at the top, just, it's not, the accent's not a problem. The fact that like they're in there, it gets spelled wrong and emails is not a problem. Like, what may be my mother's an English teacher.

Speaker 3:          00:54:11       I mean, even when I say confusing there with their, I'm like, my anxiety rises. Right? Um, but you know, we work with a major bank, they're an international bank and they hire, they hire folks like crazy. The crazy, um, because it's just not, those things are different. And the culture of mentorship is very strong there. I think on the true side, communication and acculturation is a long and in some cases, slow process. And so I think where we've seen employers tell us they're struggling is like the job seekers in, but they're not doing particularly well, right. In advancing their staying right there. And so it's because they don't understand the nuance of managing up or they don't understand the nuance of communications or because more communications have to be done remotely and it's just not been a long enough time or they're not coming along fast enough.

Speaker 3:          00:55:01       And that's just a reality. Um, so, you know, part of, as we've grown, what we've done is to put more in our resources for both companies and for the immigrants once they have their job. Right. Okay, great. So there are resources for now what we're trying, right? Yeah. So we're a smaller organization, so it was worth, exactly. Well, you know, we've got 5,000 alumni now. Um, and we're like adding them at a clip about a thousand a year. And that's when we were sort of like, oh, we have a new problem. We've got, we've got alumni who have to succeed in order to

Speaker 2:          00:55:31       for uh, you know, make way for the those coming in. Okay. Yeah. Um, I, I think some of what Nicky talked about, it's also true for American born correct. People who are struggling in, in these survival jobs. I would just say from a resettlement perspective, I think the mentoring is very important, but many resettlement agencies try to work with companies or employers that will accept a liaison for a period to make sure there aren't any problems. And a lot of employers would like to have somebody to go to and talk about these things. And then you bring in people who may be somebodies wearing hijab or somebody wants to go to pray. And for these communities, it's nice to have other, you know, people from their parts of the world at that same place so that they're not the only ones there. But

Speaker 3:          00:56:22       are there resources to help up those liaisons between the four companies and stuff like that or, or is that something that companies define for themselves? How does that, go ahead. We do that in a very bespoke way right now. So like that is part of, so as we've, as we've evolved our model to kind of be technology enabled and scalable, we focus first on the job seeker side of this and then we still sort of do custom custom stuff like that with our companies. Whereas like the second turn the wheels about enabling companies to have a playbook and or resources that would do training internally like cross cultural training for those who are going to play that kind of a liaison for all. So then the newcomers and refugees in particular the resettlement agencies, very often we'll try to do this. And also the whole push for take your first job so you'd have some record of having that job. Showing up to work to us is so important in the beginning. Right. It's a very different place than by the time Nikki may see them.

Speaker 9:          00:57:20       I guess just kind of allude to what we were just talking about when you were mentioning the a page resume with the details that then interviewer cannot legally ask about it. It makes me wonder because I am the child of Italian immigrants and either now I sometimes have a difficult time explaining to them how certain things work here even as opposed to my previous job. Google. Huh. Slow ramp up in comparison. Other software firms that I've worked for the past. So my question is how difficult is it to teach the people that the job seekers, how different America American customs about regarding employment are and how difficult is it for that information to be retained? I'm not sure how else to explain it.

Speaker 3:          00:58:28       Yeah, well adults are experiential learners. Um, and so when we said, you know, we tried to make as much available online that they can be self paced in and use the time that we have with the humans that we have to raise money for pay to practice. Um, and in fact, many of the things that we practice are the things that feel unnatural. Um, so like you said, Italians and I'm speaking as one. Um, right. Like if we were coming over from Italy, perhaps the ways in which we would approach your job search, we would have to tell him some things down and some things up. And those are the things that we spend time practicing because we found, and it is largely documented that adults learn by doing. Um, so where we, we did a lot of information sharing, you know, through online learning.

Speaker 3:          00:59:15       We spend a lot of our in-person, human resource time on the practice in order to ingrain those behaviors. And in fact we continue to try to use and are looking forward to using more technology that gives positive feedback when the right behaviors are demonstrated. Um, so when you say how hard is it, it does also become a very individual thing. I've seen 67 year old engineers come to the u s and just decide they get it and they're going to do it. Um, and, and they have job. Um, and I've seen younger, I've seen a 30 year old or rocking man, you know, just, he's not in his face as he's, he's, uh, you know, usually a refugee and, and they're struggling. They're struggling with the culturation. It's not their moment. And I've seen them take a very long time in the program. They're simply not ready yet to sort of accept that this is the way it is or something like that. So I would hate to make generalizations based on age. Um, I tend to think it's about where we need people in their journey or in their process, but that it is always, for me, what I've seen is practice and time on task rentals, yields, results.

Speaker 9:          01:00:22       And then when, when you, uh, you are also talking about automated tools, you're building work. The rest of my builder, like somebody give some arrests made with their religious affiliation on it. You have to say you can't have that on American resume and you got some different because now you're not really doing anything personal with them directly. How do you deal with that scenario?

Speaker 3:          01:00:57       Best of online learning is my response and then an advisor. So they do have like a horn, like online learning can really know it's interactive. They see a person come on and they say, look, in the U s we tend not to share personal information, you know are, this is what a a US resume would look like. And then we have like a help line. So if somebody is not progressing in their training, we get a notification they stopped and we then use part of our helpline capacity to understand why they stopped. And if it's that, you know, again, they're not trusting, they need to hear human voice for a second. We've had that happen. I had somebody who, he told me, he was like, you guys don't know what you're talking about. I even remember his summary. There was a he, he wrote, and I don't know where it went wrong in a translation, but his lead in was, I'm an awkward leader. Um, and I tried desperately to say, you know, the pictures got to come off and awkward. I think we're going for a different word here. Any of, you know, if he didn't get a response in the job market and he came back a couple of weeks later and few successful.

Speaker 9:          01:01:59       Thank you.

Speaker 6:          01:02:05       Are there any more questions, if not, just one of the things. Okay. [inaudible].
