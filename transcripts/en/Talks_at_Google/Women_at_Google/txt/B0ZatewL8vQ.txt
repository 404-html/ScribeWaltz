Speaker 1:          00:01          Uh, so thank you guys for joining us. For our first Google talks, a Ad in the Birmingham office. Uh, I want to, um, I have the great pleasure today to introduce Bridget Russo, the Cmo of Shinola before I do, for those of you who don't have a deep background, uh, uh, on the company itself, I wanted to give you a little bit, um, it was conceived in 2011. So when we think about our own brand, Shinola is only about five years old. Um, it is the maker of modern handcraft watches, bicycles, leather goods, journals, and pet accessories, of which it sounds like they're expanding into even more products. So we'll hear from Bridget about that. Um, they're really focused on, and again, you think about those of you who work in the automotive industry, some of the importance of handcrafting leather. Um, some of the more upscaled ways that we try and convey a, um, important elements of our auto manufacturers background.

Speaker 1:          00:57          A lot of that is in the messages that Shinola brings into the market. So really interesting there. Um, as far as their locations, uh, those you'd be probably know they're headquartered here in Detroit, um, in the college for creative studies building, which was a former re automotive, uh, research lab. Um, and then since the company's founding, uh, they have I think about seven stores now that they've opened up. Um, as Bridget herself. A little bit of background on Bridget, her background started in PR, which is coming in handy. Obviously as a CMO you have to deal with a lot of things, particularly in social media nowadays. Um, with her background in PR, she started on the agency side, very familiar to some of you and then moved over onto the client side working, um, with diesel and the fashion industry. Uh, from there she moved in, um, started to work with Eden, which is a company that, um, final started with his wife to support, um, some of the team to drive industry in a, in Africa. Um, and that moved her into her own consultancy, which is a lot of our Googlers do, uh, is to start their own businesses. And from there it led her to Shinola and two from New York to Detroit. And so with that, um, we welcome her and want to hear her story and, and learn about a bit more about Shinola. So with that, I'll fucking bridge it.

Speaker 2:          02:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:24          um, well thank you for taking the time out of your day to hear the Shinola story. Um, can you, can everybody hear me okay? Yeah, that's okay. Yeah. Cool. Um, so I'm going to take you through quickly since we do have the fireside chat and I don't do want to give you guys the opportunity to ask questions afterwards. So I'll kind of whizzed through this a little bit, give you a little background as to why we started the company and what's up next in terms of new categories. Um, so we started with building a watch factory in Detroit back in 2011. People thought our founder Tom Card service was crazy. Uh, why not accept that manufacturing has gone from this country? Why not let the rest and weeds finish what they started? Why not just embrace the era of disposability and why didn't we buy a warmer coat before we moved to, there were three Detroit winters. We've asked ourselves these questions and work not to find our answers, but to build it. So really, you know, from the beginning the intention was always to not only be in a city where manufacturing was in its in its history and its lifeblood, but also to be in a city where we could have a positive impact on the community in our case, and creating jobs.

Speaker 4:          03:31          Um, here's a little video. So this is

Speaker 3:          03:36          where it all began.

Speaker 5:          03:37          Yeah, the question isn't why you build a watch factory in Detroit. It's why you built one anywhere else. This is the city that made this country with its steel, with its skill, with a slight reestablish some trays that hadn't been seen in this country in a generation or more. It's a tall order to return to full, but it's what hundreds of Shinola employees work towards every day here in Troy where we believe in the beauty of industry, the glory of manufacturer. I know where American is mate.

Speaker 3:          04:09          So it started with watches. Uh, we launched our first product in 2013. Uh, the factory opened in 2012, which is when I started with the company, uh, alongside watches. We also had bicycles, leather goods, journals. Um, but really our messaging from the beginning was watches built in Detroit, um, of quality. And so we started, there are first watch was the run. Well, um, if you guys were around at that time paying attention to some of the marketing. Um, we had launched the Runwell watch before we actually had product and market. So that was March, 2013. Um, the previous year we had a brand website up where we were speaking directly to the consumer through social, primarily at the time, Twitter and Facebook and really telling people about our story directly, not going through the trades and sort of the normal, uh, you know, where you would launch a brand showing product before it was finished sewing swatches of leather, talking about our relationship with the college for creative studies where we're based, uh, to the degree that some people were confused as to what we were, you know, they would be like, are you a watch company?

Speaker 3:          05:17          Are you a bike company? Are you a school? Um, but that really helped lead us to the launch of the Runwell. Fast forward to march of 2013, um, we had about 10,000 people on our email list at that point and about the same number of followers on Facebook and Twitter. And we launched the watch. We hadn't actually made the watch yet. $550 price point. We had 2,500 units by the end of that week. So eight days we sold out of the watch. Um, which was pretty incredible. We really didn't know in the beginning there was some thought that Shinola would actually be more of a company to make watches for other brands. But then when we saw the strength of the run well and the Shinola brand, we decided to go full force. Subsequently, we've launched these other, what we call platforms and most recently the Canfield, which is a refined Runwell bicycles.

Speaker 3:          06:12          So bicycles going back to the 80s, really that production went off shore. The U s primarily, um, you know, the, one of the biggest names, Schwinn, uh, you might know the brand still out there, but it's not owned by the family anymore. They were one of the last to move their manufacturing overseas. So they lost the right, it was sold the rights to their name, but they did hold on to one piece of their business called Waterford precision cycles. So they were making custom bicycles, $10,000 and up that people would wait months for. So we met sky Yeager. How we approach all of our categories is really finding leaders within that category. So in the case of bikes that was sky, um, sky said, I know the guy we need to go to. Richard Schwinn up there in the corner is a great grandson of the man who started a Schwinn bicycles.

Speaker 3:          07:01          And we approached them and said, what would it take for you to make bicycles for Shinola? And we said, we'll probably make about a thousand a year and is I need to hire more people. So we're like, great, right in line with our, with our messaging. So, you know, some people ask, well, why are the bikes so pricey? Runwell is $3,000. The Bixby that you see, there's $2,000, and it's because of the quality and the craftsmanship that goes into it. Um, so we make the frame and fork with Waterford, uh, and then we assemble the bikes. As you see there in our Detroit store paper, we work with, um, a bindery in Ann Arbor or close to Ann Arbor, um, called, um, Malloy brothers, sorry, brain fart there for a minute. Um, and again, we really saw the market. So with all of our categories, we really look at them in two ways as brand builders or as volume drivers.

Speaker 3:          07:55          So bicycles, leather and soon to be audio, which I'll tell you about in a little bit. Um, are really the volume drivers. And then things like the journals, bicycles, pet accessories are the brand builders. They're equally as important, but it really helps us not only kind of, um, continue to provide products that are relevant to the lifestyle of our consumer, but also to add a point of difference in the marketplace. So if you go into a Neiman's or Nordstrom in the watch department, you might see a Shinola bike hanging. Um, we actually made all of the buyers of the big department stores come to Detroit before they wanted to buy the line. Um, so that definitely was helpful in helping them show the full breadth of the brand in their stores. Leather, we recently signed on a few years ago now, uh, John and Richard, they had a brand called Lambertson and true x that we did very well. Um, they're highly regarded in the fashion industry. Then they moved on to Tiffany's where they built their leather business to a $50 million business. And we're kind of in semi retirement when we approached them to run our leather business. So we started with small leather goods and have expanded now into bags, wallets, belts, um, come this fall. We're really have a full representation for women. Um, so again, looking at leaders within the categories to, to lead the design and production

Speaker 3:          09:22          and then pet accessories. So these are these fun categories, just as much work. Um, but ones that really help create the buzz around the brand because it's not every day that you launch a new watch or a new bicycle or a new range of journals, but this is an opportunity to get that PR earned media value

Speaker 3:          09:42          and then the marketing. So it all started, this was the ad that we ran going back March, 2013. Um, we at first we weren't going to advertise. We were like, no, we're not that kind of brand. We're not going to do it. Um, right about when I came on board, we hired an agency called partners and spade based out of New York. They really helped us, um, design the next version of the site, which is pretty much what you see today and really put a stake in the ground around Detroit. Built watches a quality. And we, we decided to take this ad out and we ran it in the New York Times, USA Today, Detroit free press in the Wall Street Journal, um, sort of mid week in the process of selling the watch. And by the time the New York Times Sunday Times style ran on Sunday, they were sold out already.

Speaker 4:          10:31          Hm.

Speaker 3:          10:33          Um, you might remember this when Detroit announced bankruptcy a few days later, we ran this in the New York Times to those who have written off Detroit. We give you the Birdie. Birdie happened to be a watch that we were releasing at that same time. And again, the P PR value on this was amazing. Um, and again, you know, for me, uh, if you guys are familiar with PR newswire, that's where you would put your press releases. I really saw the New York Times as our PR newswire. I found that when you had something relevant that was had culturally relevant impact, um, the New York Times was a great vehicle when it came to mother's Day and father's Day. And we were just announcing the run well on a different color. That was probably not the best ROI to run a full page ad in the New York Times.

Speaker 4:          11:18          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          11:20          And then the second year we worked with Bruce Weber. So Bruce Weber, you guys might know a famous fashion photographer. Um, I like to say the first year we showed people what was behind our doors, highlighting the people that work in the factory and establishing ourselves as a leader within the industry. And then the next year with our work with Bruce, we really, it was a love letter to Detroit celebrating the people outside of our doors and why we came to Detroit in the first place.

Speaker 4:          11:45          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          11:47          Um, last year you might remember the launch in April of the Apple Watch, uh, call the agency, I think a week before and said, hey, can you guys come up with something that would kind of just, you know, get us in the conversation of this major launch. And so they came up with this a watch, so smart that it can tell you the time just by looking at it run well, just smart enough. Um, so we ran these ads again, you know, sprinkle here and there. Wall Street Journal, New York Times ran some digital around it too. And again, the buzz that we created off of it was really tremendous. Um, in a time when, and we, we all know how much apple spends on advertising. So at a few friends that work there, and I got a text from one saying cheeky, which it was.

Speaker 3:          12:33          And then this year, um, in an election year, we knew jobs was going to be a hot topic. Um, and we really wanted to celebrate the fact that we created over 500 jobs since we launched. And so we came out with this campaign. There's a funny thing that happens when you build factories in this country. It's called jobs. And again, really highlighting the people behind the products. We are a true manufacturing company built not by the things we make, but by the people who make them. Um, this year in the past we were, um, primarily our media plan was primarily print and we started to see some diminishing returns, I would say mid last year. So we really did a shift towards digital this year working with premium partners like Vanity Fair, l Harper's bizarre vice to create content. Um, so some of that you guys might have seen, um, we'll continue with that for a second half of the year around big product launches.

Speaker 3:          13:26          So continuing to talk about our leather, our watches, and expand our reach outside of our immediate consumers. Uh, our big push for second half of the year we'll be around women's. The challenge that we do have is that talking about jobs is great, but when you're trying to sell a hobo bag, talking about jobs, it doesn't really help. It doesn't mean that, you know, women don't care about creating jobs, but when you're trying to sell someone this great leather bag, that messaging doesn't always link up together. So that's something that we're working through now to understand. Probably around September around the debates, the jobs messaging will come up again, but then we'll make a shift towards really focusing on celebrating our women's product and, and showing people that we're serious about our, our women's products retail. So our retail environments are really, in my view, part of our marketing.

Speaker 3:          14:20          Um, we look at them as living, breathing things there. They're not museums for products, but really community spaces. So we activate our stores quite frequently, two to three times a month. Um, we not only throw our own events, but we opened them up to the community. So the local Pr Association might hold their annual meeting in the morning. Uh, we, we work with creative mornings to hold talks in our stores. Uh, we're currently working with a local barber shop in Detroit called Social Club too. They do a series called shoptalk where they actually cut people's hair while they're participating in a talk. It sounds weird, but it works. If anybody has attended there, they're pretty interesting. So we're doing that, uh, not only in Detroit and Ann Arbor, but across cities, DC, New York, La, um, and each door is really unique. Taking on the personality, not only of the building that we're in, but also the city that we're in. And there's a few. We're now at 15, 16 stores. By the end of this year we'll have 20 and aim to open eight to 10 every year.

Speaker 3:          15:31          What's next? The fun part. Audio. So come October, November, we'll start with turntables. Working with this gentlemen, gentlemen here. Alex Rawson, who again is a leader within the category. He started a headphone brand that he's got on right? They're called Odyssey. It looks like he has waffles on his ears, but a highly regarded within the audio file community. So again, we saw an opportunity, if you look at what beats did, um, beats charges a lot of money for a product that doesn't really warrant that price point. And everyone you walk around and you see I'm sure by people in the office might have a beats headphones, but our audio file friends tell us that it is not of the quality that that should be for the price point we, so we saw an opportunity to bring value into the category with good design and audio file quality and then jewelry. So a, some of you may recognize Pamela Love. Uh, she's a designer out of New York. We're partnering with her to launch jewelry come mid October. Uh, this will be part of a larger Shinola women's launch. So not only jewelry but expanding our watch offering a and a new collection called Gomelsky. We do have a style right now called Gomelsky, but this is sort of an offshoot of that.

Speaker 3:          16:47          And this is one of my favorite films that we did with Bruce Weber.

Speaker 6:          16:52          You know what? Um, I think that when it comes to to Detroit, I view it just how I view love. Like I feel like in everything you have like a soulmate, right? If I had to just give like one line about the city of Detroit, I would most definitely say that. Uh, I belong here. Native is definitely a soul mate of mine. I was working on his poem a few days ago. It's about the city of Detroit, but it's how it breeds like great, great guest, grandkids, great boys, great girls. How we grow up to be great men and women. I don't want it to read it to you. Okay, that's fine. Somewhere in the projects there's a kid working on a project to project to the world. He lives in a city that grows boys and girls into lions and tigers. The city, it takes the fire in the ashes, bills, rebuilds, turns, abandoned houses, empty fields and to things. We're looking at a place that never looks back the center stage of a nation, the heartbeat, the patients, the music, the Motown, the midtown and downtown. The always come back around and we fight for reputation, walk, ride bikes. Our destination practice. Patient knows they can't forget about this [inaudible] the city that continues to call the world's bluff somewhere. There's a kid working on a project to project from a city that's rebuilding, that we built in from the ashes together. So the everywhere there can be Detroit gamblers, they

Speaker 2:          18:30          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          18:37          Yeah, that was really powerful. You can see why you like it now. Two years old. And I think still totally relevant. Yeah. So you mentioned, I've heard you say in some of your discussions, this idea of conscious consumerism and how a brand is basically responsible for being a really good brand. And so when you look at some of this, um, and you can see how you're investing in having the best people build the brands that you want, the product you want to present. Can you talk a little bit about, yeah, so it's, it's a concept that I was first introduced to when working for [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          19:14          Urbano anally back in 2004 when we launched the brand Eden. And they were really pioneers in the space, especially in fashion. The idea of, you know, conscious fashion people didn't understand, you know, the green movement was happening. There was some organic brands out there and none of them were all that fashionable. Um, so this idea that you could have quality product out there, but by the nature of your business practices, your production practices who were also helping to build communities and have a positive impact, um, coming from the fashion industry where you never talked about your production in part because you didn't want to let your competitors know where you were manufacturing. But also, you know, now we know so many things have happened since then. You guys probably weren't even born yet. Kathy Lee, Gifford, Nike and every step, everything subsequently that happened from there.

Speaker 7:          20:06          It wasn't pretty, you know, the fashion industry, um, can be a pretty ugly industry or has been in the past. Not intentionally. I think as things went offshore that control and understanding how things were being manufactured in other places, they weren't up to the same standards as the US. Um, so, you know, a lot of people early on got burned. I don't think Nike set out intentionally, you know, to have children making their clothes. But unfortunately it's hard to have that control when you're doing things overseas. A lot has changed. Um, but this idea of buying products and supporting products that have a positive impact, whether that's on the environment, whether that's on the community. I think now for millennials and anyone that's under 30, I think that's a big part of that purchase decision. Um, you know, certainly is for me, I'm not under 30,

Speaker 1:          20:59          but you know, it,

Speaker 7:          21:00          I think if all other things are equal, I'm willing to pay a little bit more to know that this product is having some sort of positive impact. At the end of the day, it still has to be strong product and we'll learn that Eden the hard way, you know, we really put the mission in front of the brand and butter product second and at Shinola, what I really loved when I met them, I was like, wow, this product is amazing. The fact that, you know, we were creating jobs to me was the cherry on top, but that product needs to stand on its own.

Speaker 1:          21:29          Yeah. Do you see that as being, uh, increasingly challenging as the demand for the product increases and the scale and the volume that you need to fulfill that demand increases? As we think of other brands who have, maybe you mentioned even Nike in this case. Do you see that as a challenge for Shinola? No.

Speaker 7:          21:48          As you, as you grow, and we really look at everything we do from, you know, in the beginning we looked at where to source her shopping bags and we said, well, we can source them in the states but we and spend $12 on them. Or we could take the savings of sourcing that the bag overseas and put it towards r and d to doing what we're doing in Detroit and helping to grow that. And since then we started with the watch factory. I didn't mention, but we opened a leather factory two years ago, um, where we're producing the majority of our Leather Watch straps and some of our small leather goods. So again, continuing to add to that capacity. The reality is we're in a global economy. So every single component is not made under one roof. That hasn't existed for a very long time.

Speaker 7:          22:32          Um, you know, we felt very strongly what we were doing. We were doing more than assembly. And so we use the word build. You guys probably read that's got us into a little hot water of recent, but I think it's an opportunity, um, for us to work with the FTC on clarifying for the consumer and makers of products to say, this isn't clear. It's not clear for the consumer and it's not clear, um, for anyone who's trying to do business and do the right thing in the u s um, you know, I can tell you from experience, there's stuff out there that says made in Italy, are made in France, that is definitely not made there. They might add a zipper at the end or a small stitch. Um, and their country allows them to say that to preserve, you know, their industry, what's left of it.

Speaker 7:          23:21          So this is happening across the board. Um, you know, the one thing I can say, you know, to anyone, please, we do do tours. You're welcome to sign yourself up for one. Um, you walk through that factory and you see the people that are most of them. Detroiters, it's hard to say that we're not having a positive social impact. And I, the most thing you know about it is when you say, try and suggest to these people that what they're doing is an important or what they're doing. I heard some comments as people do on social media. Oh, a monkey can do it. It's like putting together Ikea furniture. First of all, I'm challenged putting together,

Speaker 1:          24:02          I challenged putting anything,

Speaker 7:          24:05          but it is hard. Yeah. You know, a watch is made up of these tiny little parts and to suggest that assembly is not as complicated or you know, not an important job that takes some level of skill. You know, that's why we felt very strongly around the word build. Now we have to qualify that to, to make sure it's clear that it's a combination of us and imported parts. Something that we were always transparent about. When you look into her FII cues. In fact, there was a question is this American made? And we answered that and have done from the very beginning. Um, but I think that as a brand and also the FTC need to take this opportunity to educate the consumer. Maybe there's a, like with food, you know, if you guys remember with food, it was sort of the wild west and people natural and organic and what did it all mean?

Speaker 7:          24:56          Well, now there are systems in place and labeling in place. Maybe we need to do the same thing with consumer goods. Yeah. Well it's, it's clear that you have made an impact in Detroit, um, beyond today's news over the FTC. So, you know, how do you, how does that, it sounds like you've been trying to do that regardless of what retail store you, what location you open a retail store, um, how does that, how do you guys factor that in to where you do open them up and how do you look to embed yourself in the community? Like I know Ethan, the Saturday you have a local band playing at the store in Detroit. So tell us a little bit about how you've continued to look at, where are you open stores and how important the you've, you've made an impact. You're trying to make an impact in the local market.

Speaker 7:          25:39          I think for us, um, you know, it's always a balance. Yeah. Um, we recently got some investments so we have a board of directors and so, you know, there's a responsibility we have now to a group of people versus one person. Um, but you were just actually having this conversation today. We're still a baby brands, so there has to be that balance of brand building and making sure that we're still unique and special for people and high touch and also getting the Roi and getting us to profitability to make sure that we're being responsible and also growing a sustainable brand. Um, as far as the community aspect is concerned, we'll continue to look at our manufacturing, not just in Detroit. We're actually looking at Chicago potentially for eyewear. So parts of, of the, the manufacturing that we can do in the states, we will, whether that's through our own facilities or partnering with facilities that are out there, um, you know, we're, one of our leather partners potentially could close because their rents going up and they can't afford it.

Speaker 7:          26:44          So it's looking at that and saying maybe we can put them together with, um, manufacturers that we know in Florida to combine efforts. One is strong in high end handbags, the other one has great process and back of house, you know, how do you bring, there's so much time and effort that we put into these things to continue to stand behind our goal, which is to create American jobs. Um, you know, on a local level we go into markets and really either it's working with an agency or just going in on our own and making those relationships with the local community. So the local makers, uh, different organizations that are working on job creation, um, and really embedding ourselves. In some cases it might be as simple as, you know, hosting an event for them in our store or a fundraiser or donating a watch for uh, an option.

Speaker 7:          27:39          Um, but again, making those relationships on a local level as well. Yeah. And hopefully I'm, you know, as we start to grow and, and really start to push through tent pole initiatives, I think the idea of workforce development is something that we can be thought leaders in. So we're talking now on how do we, whether it's partnering with Job Corps, which was started in DC but has local chapters across the US and really help playing an active role in this workforce development. Because the reality is, uh, and I was just starting to educate myself on it. There's, I think it's something like 2 million, what they call middle skill jobs out there. Uh, so primarily trade manufacturing jobs that there are no longer that generation with that skillset. So it's like a dying breed of artisans and two things need to happen. One, then there needs to be infrastructure for the training, but also a PR campaign to encourage people to take these jobs.

Speaker 7:          28:39          Because it's a better job than working at Mcdonald's or, um, you know, any of the big box stores. And it's an opportunity to learn a craft and work your way up. You know, I, I, my mother owned a factory, she started working in a factory in New York and it put food on our table and put me through school and through college. So, um, it is a career opportunity and we need to kind of change the face of what these jobs are. They're not dirty jobs. Yeah. They're actually career paths for every one is not, you know, some people will go on and start their own tech business or some people may decide they want to be designers, but, um, there's a lot of these jobs out there and not the skilled labor force to take them. And then we have the unemployment rate. So, you know, these things can be mutually beneficial.

Speaker 1:          29:25          So do you see that, was that a premise at the start, do you think? For the company I'm at the heart of, it was job creation. Um, or did it start as um, you know, really, really strong, um, wellmade products and then the job creation thing, cause it is a really interesting component you mentioned you didn't actually mention I think I wear is one of the next areas that you're going to go into. So you think about eyewear and how you would now repeat this whole process of finding the right partners and, and go about selling it. So curious about it.

Speaker 7:          29:57          The job creation was always part of the conversation alongside and making quality products that were well designed. And then we'll classic, um, you know, from a business opportunity standpoint, watches for instance, so you have watches at the, you know, the big old fashion watches. So Michael Kors and brands such as that at the three $5,500 range. And then you have the high end luxury watches, tag horror and the like. And no one was really at our price point offering the quality, um, with the great brand story behind it. Um, so we saw a business opportunity as well. Um, where we, Parker is a good example. They saw a business opportunity and they also have the social impact part of their business, which if you notice it's not front and center, um, it's sort of behind the scenes even more so now than, than ever before when they first launched. So I think ultimately it has to start with good product. Yeah. It has to be somewhat of a differentiator in the marketplace and there has to be a positive impact in some way, shape or form, whether it's double bottom line or triple bottom line, which is hard to achieve. But, you know, I think it's important now and in the longterm it's just good business. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          31:07          So always back to that conscious consumerism type thing. So you weren't here at Google and data is part of our world. We love data. And so some of the, uh, the marketing get samples, uh, as the Cmo you've talked about, um, uh, traditionally based, um, and then a lot of the experiential things you talked about in your retail stores, very experientially based. So can you talk to this group who really looks at a lot of data, um, and the campaigns and things that they do, how you think about marketing and how you, what kind of data you look at based on the things that are important to you and trying to reach these consumers. In the beginning we didn't have data to look. We, we had nothing to benchmark mark

Speaker 7:          31:47          it against. Now, you know, going into our fourth year, we do have that data and we are diving into that data and actually working with you guys as well as a group out of DC called resonate to really hone in on, okay, we have this fan base here of Shinola advocates and super fans. We know there are like people out there who don't even know we exist yet. So how do we develop those personas and then we're off first time ever believe it or not doing programmatic. Um, so really looking at like individuals out there and using a lot of digital to, to reach them. Um, really cutting back on print. I'm a still a big fan on experiential. I think at the end it's about the mix. It's not like, oh, all digital is the way to go, or all print is the way to go.

Speaker 7:          32:38          It's the mix because that's how people live their lives. That's how they're consuming media and information. So it can't be all one way. I think part of the success early on is that, and again, this is somewhat anecdotal, but if people would tell me, Oh, you guys are everywhere. Well we weren't, I had no way had a budget to be everywhere, but we were everywhere where they were in the right moment. So you know, and there was a lot of, you know, great PR value there. So they saw the PR, then they'd go online and you know, see the social activity. Then they'd go outside and see the out of home. It's how that mix all works together. And then you have to be careful, you know, the data, depending on how you look at it can drive you in a direction that may not be the right direction.

Speaker 7:          33:26          This is somewhat of a weird example, but I'll give it to you anyway. So, um, when I was working for Urbano, he often told this story. Um, there's an NGO that went into, um, a village in Kenya and the women were walking like five miles to clean water every day. Uh, and so they came in and they built a well in the village and the women kept walking the five miles. Well, no one stopped to ask them, you know, we're going to build a well, where would you like us to put it? So finally, after the fact, because they were so puzzled, they asked, why are you still walking five miles? And they said, well said, get away from the men.

Speaker 1:          34:04          That's our time together. No one asked the question. So they were like, what if we did it half way? And I'm like, perfect. And that was a moment when too. So we can't forget that

Speaker 7:          34:15          this data is great, but we're all human beings, right? And there's aspects to our behavior that can't be put on a spreadsheet. So the emotion and that the high touch of a brand, if you can maintain that some in some way, shape or form. Um, you know, especially when you have limited dollars, there has to be that element of just human nature. And then I don't know the answer for every brand of what that is. And you know, I, I still watch that video and think, well, maybe we should run that in theaters, you know, just because you don't even know what the hell we're selling. But I'm intrigued. I want to know more about that brand after seeing that video. Yeah. So it is about the balance. It's about the mix and don't be so dictated by the data that you lose the fact that you are all human beings and consumers as well. And that, that gut feeling of, you know, what is right and taking some calculated risks. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:07          Uh, I want to open it up for any questions that you all might have that you'd like to ask

Speaker 8:          35:11          Bridget. Go ahead. All right. Thanks for coming. Good. First off, I did not know anything about the association with the Schmidt family tied to your bicycles, but that seems to be a model in your personality or an expert in the field kind of help that. Can you explain like the process of identifying that person that represents best the shuttle a brand? Because I would think it's more art than science. Yes. To the data of like, is it a relationship? Is it, how do you identify that person that represents how you want to launch a brand?

Speaker 7:          35:44          Um, we've been very lucky. Our founder knows a lot of people. Uh, and so it's a little bit of asking around. I'm asking you advice from, you know, friends. Uh, and then some people would just somehow cross our paths because, you know, someone might know what we're up to and say, I've got the person for you. You need to talk to sky Yeager or you need to talk to Alex. Rostin. So it's been pretty organic from that perspective. And we've never done big searches. I mean, even we just named Tom Milan or CEO, we didn't put the job out there. We never did. Um, but we just started to put our feelers out. Tom was working with us on some side projects. And again, it was that gut feeling that our founder felt like this was the right guy, um, to help lead the brand. And so that, that's kind of at least to date how decisions are made around people in particular. Um, and it makes for a really, uh, uh, Tom or founder refers to us as the bar scene in star wars.

Speaker 9:          36:47          Um, and that, you know, we all come from,

Speaker 7:          36:51          from varied backgrounds, but I think it's helpful in making, keeping us on our toes and also seeing different perspectives. The fact that Tom Comes from, you know, the sports arena and coming from that background I think is an interesting perspective for, you know, we don't even like to call ourselves a fashion brand with zero sells more as a design brand. So I think having those outside voices in the outside perspective, because if you're all in a room with the same, you know, if we had just had a whole bunch of fashion people, we'd be doing things very differently tonight. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          37:20          The questions got ahold of a skilled trade thing. I grew up down river written all the high schools down there. My parents generation has shop, they had a actual working auto shop within a high school and everything. But then that generation, it's such a stigma how you feel, especially with how deeply passionate people like your sectors upper middle on came from those families that have the stigma. How do you use that and where do you start to try to remove it? I mean is it started with politicians start in the schools? Does it start with the brain out cause that you have re calibrating their mindset and where to really start to get rid of that trade school is under achieving and you have to have before your school because those jobs are kind of skills do transcendent and Mary Lou.

Speaker 7:          38:09          Yeah, I think definitely education is one piece. And working at the civil level, just make sure that you have the support locally in these cities because there are certain cities like Detroit that are more, um, you know, sort of better poised to really drive this, uh, buffalo's another good city. Um, and also working with partners in the media, um, who have such control now to really shape people's opinions one way or the other. Um, to help tell this story. And you know, especially now with things like Etsy for instance, I think it's coming back to where people are interested in learning how to make things on their own, making things and selling them now with a great platform that you can go direct to consumer. Um, so it's good timing. And I think now with kids coming out of college with that degree, that really expensive degree and no guarantee of a job, zero.

Speaker 7:          39:07          You know, so people are looking at different ways of how they can build a career. And it's not the traditional doctor, lawyer, not everyone can be an entrepreneur and make the next Uber or whatever. So, um, it is, uh, education is a big piece of it, but that you need that support at the civil level too. You know? Um, oh, what's the word? You know, making sure that there's certain land, um, agreements that it's not just about building luxury condos, right? Cause it's very quick to say a factory will, you know, uh, not yield as much from a real estate perspective than a luxury condo. But you know, that's not going to help build a community, uh, and certainly not help build at diversity within the community. Um, and I'm hoping Detroit has an opportunity and there's a lot of people working hard at this to help build this infrastructure.

Speaker 7:          40:05          Uh, and also if we can make it work in Detroit, that's a blueprint. Let's hope to do it in other cities. But I was one of those kids who grew up in the factory and I said from a very young age, I would never work in the factory. My brothers on the other hand, did work in the factory, made a lot more money than I did, um, got burned when things by the 90s. It was, that was it. Um, but it's all coming back now. My brother actually held onto his machines and now he's his knitting businesses, getting, he's getting the phone calls that he, you know, a lot of people sold their machines. He happen to hold on. Um, but I think there's a huge opportunity there, but it's going to be a lot of different entities working together and there needs to be a huge PR campaign that the media can help drive, um, to change the perception.

Speaker 1:          40:53          It's a lot of people in this room work with cmos every day. They have to go out and meet and, and, and provide thoughts, ideas. I'm sitting there and obviously you've had a good PR background. It's helped set you up for a lot of things here, even handling today. Could you give them advice and, and, well, how do you think about when people come in, you, you know, you said you talked to your agency about the ad that was going to run when the Apple Watch was being announced. Can you give us any advice for how you, you think about it or when someone comes in to talk with you about ideas or thoughts, how you, how you think of about

Speaker 7:          41:28          things? Um, for me, I'm always impressed when someone takes the time to research your brand. All the information's out there now. Not all of it accurate, but there's a lot of sources out there where you can really educate yourself about a brand. I mean, even for people who are, um, interviewing, I'm often shocked by people who don't really do their research. And I'm like, why are you here? You know? Um, so do your research, help them realize that you took a moment to not only understand their brand, but to understand their business. So, you know, not only researching Shinola, but looking at where we sit in Nordstrom and what, who's our competitive set and looking at their business leading up to meeting. You don't need to become a watch expert. Um, but just gathering that information and bringing that to a meeting to say, we looked at your business, we looked at your competitive set and here's some learnings that we had from an outside perspective because often you guys might see something that we don't see because we're in the thick of it. Um, so I think a fresh approach to just the information that's out there before we even get to the meeting. Yeah, good question.

Speaker 8:          42:35          Good. Detroit is for manufacturing, also famous for creativity. And, um, and I wonder if you could speak a little bit to Detroit's influence and Shinola designed now and maybe as you see the future, especially with some of these world class leaders in the areas you're going into being a New York based as you might expect. But how is Detroit for House talent?

Speaker 7:          43:12          For us, we're very, from a product perspective inspired by the architecture. Uh, so definitely the architecture of Detroit. I would say the spirit and the attitude of Detroit you see in our marketing and sort of the irreverence of our voice comes from Detroit and that Detroit versus everybody. Um, sort of sentiment. Um, you know, I do think that in order for Detroit to really be a player as it was in, in the global marketplace, from a creativity innovation standpoint, it needs to be a place that maintains its, its talent. Because often what happens is the talents here and they leave, they go to Chicago, they go to New York because the opportunity isn't here. So as businesses continue to grow or move to Detroit, um, I think that's an opportunity to get back on in the ranks, if you will, of being an innovative city of being a city that drives creative.

Speaker 7:          44:12          Um, it certainly inspires us every day. Um, but I think being able to keep the talent that comes here is something that we need to work on. Um, I mean the education system as a whole other thing because if you're a young person or you know, if you're coming married with kids, I don't have kids, so I live in Detroit. I'm not worried about the education system personally, but it's a huge problem because, you know, I have colleagues of mine that say I would love to live in Detroit, but I don't know where to send my kids to school. So they drive them to, you know, gross point or whatever after a while. First of all, not everyone has access to do that. Yeah. Um, so those are things that are really important. Just basic things or our public school system really needs a lot of work in order to make this an attractive city for creative people, for business minded people to live in and build a family and not have to go live in the suburbs because I need to be in a certain zip code to write for their kids to go to a good school.

Speaker 7:          45:07          Very important.

Speaker 1:          45:10          Any last one last question from the audience then I'll close with one. Go ahead.

Speaker 8:          45:14          So this may be a little bit of everywhere, but I was curious to hear it, uh, when [inaudible] started, to what extent was Detroit factored in as like the only location or was it like one of several locations that were considered? I've heard kind of how price point was factored into choosing to try it as a potential location to kind of headquarters at all. And then part two of that, as you expand internationally, what is the recognition of Detroit, uh, on the international level and do you think like, should I know all of that salt is now going to become a vehicle to help promote the trait, whereas the tray first may have promoted Froedtert? Shinola? It's almost seems like it's now should I know, is Turner to promote Detroit in the international spectrum?

Speaker 7:          45:50          Oh, we definitely are doing that. I mean this brand part of our DNA and what we built this brand on is the fact that we're in Detroit. The fact that, you know, we have a watch factory and a leather factory in Detroit, the intention was always at this would be a global brand. We didn't know how the Detroit, um, name would resonate certainly outside of Michigan, but even outside of the u s what we're finding is people, um, it's resonating because it's that underdog story. People want Detroit to win. There's a Detroit everywhere. I'm so sorry. Um, it is resonating.

Speaker 1:          46:38          No, I'm joking. No, it's funny because I think as we, as we travel, many of us travel all over the place and that we probably all feel that we're the ones standing up for Detroit. I know I'm, whether I'm here or are internationally, it's, I get teased a lot. Oh Detroit, what's happening in Detroit? I'm like, come on to try it. It's great. So I feel like we were off fill that in a lot of time.

Speaker 7:          47:02          But to answer the price question, it wasn't really so much prices. We invested a lot of money to build the factory and do the training, which we continue to do. Um, and we did not take the tax incentives that were offered to us. Certainly it's cheaper to open a factory in Detroit than it is in the middle of Manhattan or la. Um, but really the opportunity that we saw, you know, you had a workforce, a trained and talented workforce that we're sitting without jobs. So we thought we could transfer that skill and to watch making leather making. Um, so, sure. Is it cheaper to open a factory in Detroit? Yes. I mean that's changing now with real estate booming the way that it's doing. Um, but it wasn't necessarily about the price, it was about the, the opportunity and the talent base that exists here in manufacturing.

Speaker 1:          47:55          And so one last question. You mentioned Shinola to be a global brand. It's only about five years old. So what are the global brands that are iconic brands that might be on the wall or in the thoughts of those at Shinola to emulate?

Speaker 7:          48:10          You know, we'll even say we poked fun at them. Apple definitely is up there and it was all in good fun. Um, you know, Tesla, Virgin, um, these are all brands that, you know, we aspire to. I think Tesla would probably be number one on that list. Yeah. Um, you know, and it's, it's been amazing to just be a part of what's happening in Detroit. We're one of, you guys know how many people that are working both small and large scale like Dan Gilbert, to really help bring the city back on its feet. And my hope is that it continues to be a place of equal opportunity. That it doesn't just become my, my lovely New York, but million dollar plus, you know, condos that most people can't afford. Uh, cause it really starts, it really hurts a city when it becomes homogeneous like that. So you have to make sure there's a balance of opportunity, um, that maintains the diversity. Um, that's the one thing that I think New York lost over the years because now you turn around everywhere you go. I mean, bedstuy which, you know, I remember growing up as a kid in Brooklyn, you just didn't go there. And now it's like luxury apartment buildings and townhouses all over the place. Yeah. So, and that's going to keep the creativity here as well.

Speaker 1:          49:33          Well, we want to thank you for your time. We know how busy you are out. We have a little gift for you. And um, thank you for being part of our first talks at Google in the Birmingham office. So thank you for

Speaker 2:          49:43          [inaudible].
