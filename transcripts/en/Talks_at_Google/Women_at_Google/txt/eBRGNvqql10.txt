Speaker 2:          01:15          Raise your hand if you wake up feeling every day. I can't wait to be my awesome self at work here. A lot of chuckles. No, raise your hand if you want a wake, a feeling. I can't wait to be my authentic self at work. Awesome. I've got everybody on there. Welcome to authentically you taking charge of your personal brand. And before we dive into the program, I want to take a moment to thank a few people who made this happen. Uh, neelay Mitchell, Kelsey bunch or an Emily sorts for making this happen. I know you guys are really busy. Um, and the fact that you're taking this initiative to put this together means a lot. So if you guys can stand up, um, and if we can just give them a round of applause

Speaker 3:          01:56          for their hard work.

Speaker 2:          02:01          I'm going to also want to thank Google for providing this. I think it's amazing that a company as great as Google that's known to be one of the greatest employers, it's still continuing to invest in its employees by providing a space and the resources to make this happen. So we can just give uncle Google a big round of applause too. And I also want to take the time to acknowledge each and every one of you for coming live and also, um, uh, connecting via live stream. I know all of you are incredibly busy. I was just hearing about your long commutes for some of you. Um, and you could be out there taking pictures with the I bought or going to the gym. And the fact that you're here says a lot about you and your commitment to your career. So a big round of applause for you.

Speaker 2:          02:50          Um, I don't want to take this opportunity to do something that I think we often don't do, especially for people who are high performers like yourself. That's the reason why you're at a organization like Google. So I want you to trust me with this. If you can raise your hands really wide and while you're added, try not to talk to person on the right or left and just to give yourself a big hug and say, I'm so awesome. I couldn't hear you. Let's do together again. One more time. One, two, three. I am so awesome. Yeah. And that's just a great reminder for yourself. I love seeing the smile. It's just that can give you so much energy. I think sometimes we're in Britain, the busier doing and getting things done, you forget to acknowledge how amazing you are and how far you come. So if you just have this practice once a day, maybe first thing in the morning, that'll really help jumpstart your day.

Speaker 2:          03:39          So when I started my career, um, I struggled very much in my career. I had this mentality that I have to put my head down and work really hard and be humble and not bother anybody because everybody's really busy who can relate to this. Ah, it was like everybody in the room, everybody is really busy. And I was the first in my family to go to college and to go to professional school. They didn't really have anybody I could talk to to say like, Hey, I'm running into this issue. How can I solve that? So I became known for being really reliable, really dependable. And that was great because I got a lot of good work. How many can relate to that? That the reward of good work is more work. It's like everybody in this room, they're like, yeah, that happens. Um, but on the flip side, what was not so great about having that reputation was that on Fridays at 9:00 PM when there was an urgent project, guess who got to call me?

Speaker 2:          04:32          And I'm assuming a lot of you are also in that shoes as well, right? Where you're the ones who are known to be reliable and so you're getting this call. And so what happens is it creates a really frustrating environment where you're feeling tired and overworked and underappreciated because people are so busy, they forget to thank you or to really acknowledge you for your contributions. And at the same time, what I saw is that when it came time for raises and promotions, I wasn't necessarily getting the best raises, their best promotions. And a big part of that was because I kept my head down. It didn't talk to anybody and I didn't want to bother anybody. So nobody knew that I was doing anything right. Other than that, I was getting things done when they needed it done. Um, and so I found myself in a place where I was really frustrated and exhausted and just really wondering what I was going to do in my career.

Speaker 2:          05:16          How many of you at some point of your career can relate to that? It's like almost everybody in here. Um, and it wasn't until I worked with a leadership coach where she helped me to question my assumptions and my values and what it meant to be humble, what it meant to be authentic and what it meant to be a hard worker. And then to devise some key strategies where I made some small changes in the way you interact with people, that had a huge impact that I was able to see my life and my career transform. And I was so inspired by the work that she was able to do with me and that inspired me to become a coach. And now I have the privilege of being able to help my clients go from being stuck or frustrated or waking up with dread or maybe feeling a little bored at work to go from that space to being at a place where they're getting that dream job that they want to go into that space where they wake up, excited to go to work and they're getting the promotions and the raises that they so worked hard for and deserve and most importantly to be happy.

Speaker 2:          06:13          And I really excited to be here to share those strategies with you. We have a short now 45 minutes together, cause I know we started a little a little late, so I'm going to give you my best stuff, but I also know that we won't be able to cover everything. I will try to reserve a little bit of time afterwards for questions and then we'll hang out afterwards if you have questions that you don't want to ask in the audience and one as privately. Um, and if you have questions beyond that, feel free to always email me at some more and add some more insulin. coaching.com I do read every email that comes through. Um, so what we're going to cover today is what is your personal brand? Why does your personal brand matter? How does authenticity fit with their personal brand? And then with all that information, what do you want to do without personal brand?

Speaker 4:          06:56          Okay.

Speaker 2:          06:59          So what is a personal brand? Anybody recognize who that is?

Speaker 4:          07:03          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:04          Yeah. Somebody raised their hand. Awesome. Who is that person? Oh, Bruh. Yes. Everybody recognizes Oprah. So when you see Oprah, her picture right here, her name, what are some words that you associate with her?

Speaker 4:          07:19          Success. What else? Confident. What was that?

Speaker 2:          07:28          Yeah, she's loved. Yes, she's loved. So what did the con consistent theme that you're hearing in the words are being described to Oprah? Would you say it's positive, negative, or neutral?

Speaker 4:          07:39          Awesome.

Speaker 2:          07:39          Positive. Oprah has a very strong personal brand. And if you know her backstory, she started from very humble beginnings, right? But she had a strong vision about who she was and what she stands for, and now she's been able to build this amazing empire where in a moment's notice, she can put you on her book club list and go from an unknown author to be a New York Times bestseller overnight. Now some of you might say, well that's cool, but that's Oprah. What does that have to do with me? Similarly, in your own career, if you have a strong personal brand, you can really have the ability to make things happen and to help accelerate your career. Or if you have a negative association with their brand, guess what? That can also prevent you from being able to be promoted or being able to get to work on projects that you might want to have or even be able to have good relationships with your coworkers. It's not the value of a brand. And I want to bring up an example of one of my recent clients. Um, my, one of my recent clients that I worked with, it's an attorney who works at a tech company. How many attorneys are in the room?

Speaker 4:          08:41          I got like,

Speaker 2:          08:42          like one person in the back, any engineers in the room, ah, go like all engineers 11, it's going to be like the fight battle between engineers and lawyers. So a common story that hear from my engineering clients is I hate talking to those lawyers who can relate to that. Like everybody, right? There are roadblocks [inaudible] they don't understand the technology and it's really a waste of time. Um, so that's a common response to hear from my engineering clients. And then on the other, countable to hear from my lawyer clients as those engineers, they're really smart. They're so brilliant, they make amazing products, but they have no clue how they're screwing our company for millions and bazillions of dollars because they will ever talk to us when they're doing these licensing deals or they won't patent these projects. Right. Um, and so this is a common conversation that goes on between these two clients.

Speaker 2:          09:30          It's funny because I get to sit behind closed doors with them and I'm like, wow, this comes up almost every single instance. And so what happens is there's a cat and mouse game where, uh, issue comes up, lawyer calls, engineer, engineer, avoids lawyer. And that loop kind of goes on, creates a very frustrating situation and we have basically zero productivity. And in fact, what I argue is negative productivity because who would be frustrated in that? How many of you would be frustrated with that? It's like I see everybody, almost everybody's hands up. Yes. It's a frustrating situation. So what you end up with is energy where you're spending a lot of time being frustrated with each other and not a lot gets done and then something big might go wrong because you're not communicating and there's a communication breakdown. So this particular client went in knowing that this is something that typically happens.

Speaker 2:          10:14          And so what we'd devise in terms of a strategy for him was instead of approaching the engineer's only when there was a problem, uh, with the legal issues to actually go and get to know the engineers. So this lawyer went to a lot of the brainstorms. Um, sometimes he understood what's going on. Sometimes we were like, I don't know what this is, but he made friends when he was there. And what he would do with invite these engineers to go to coffees or to go to lunches. And through this process, what he was able to do is ask them about their lives, you know, actually care about them as a human being. How about that rate? And then ask them like, what are you working on? What's going on there? And point blank say, what can I as a lawyer and our legal team do to support you in, to better communicate with you because we're really here to partner with you and we really want to help you.

Speaker 2:          11:01          Um, and through that process and through consistent, and this is a key consistent interactions and this way he was able to develop a really strong relationship with them. And so instead, now when he calls the engineers, they actually pick up his phone call and instead of being seen as a roadblock or he's actually seen as a true partner. Um, and what's also really interesting is that now the engineer's how problems they actually call him and say like, Hey, are running into this issue. Do you think you can give us a hand? And so through those positive associations with his personal brand, he was able to transform it from a negative association of being a negative roadblocks, right? To being somebody who's positive and a true partnership. Um, and so he's able to in his day to day life, decreased frustration and increased productivity and have more time to be able to, to rebel in the successes that he has.

Speaker 2:          11:50          And how does that benefit has career, has supervisors now know him as somebody who is a problem solver, who can connect with others? And so he becomes a goto person when the legal team needs to work with engineering team and you can see that it's a win win for everybody. So that's pretty amazing, right? The power of your personal brand. Um, so what I love for us to do right now is to do an exercise. Um, and in this exercise, often what people forget to think about is how our perceptions of what's going on actually impacts our interaction. So what I want you to do is to trust me, is to close your eyes. I make sure nobody pokes you from the side. And if somebody does, I'll go and hit the hand. Um, and so to think of some colleagues that you have that you work with, either in your group or outside of your group, and then to pick one person in mind, and if that person had to describe you using three adjectives, what are the three adjectives that's coming to mind?

Speaker 4:          12:46          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          12:47          And I want you to sit with those adjectives for the next five to 10 seconds, a little uncomfortable, but I want you to feel what that feels like when you hear those adjectives about yourself. Now I want you to open your eyes and on your handout, write down what those three adjectives are in the section. That's what is your personal brand.

Speaker 2:          13:22          So what we're going to do now as partner activity, um, I want you to find a partner, a and a final partner. Hopefully somebody you don't talk to regularly because the, the purpose of these types of conversations is really to meet somebody else as well. Right? So find a partner. Go ahead and pair up. If you're on the right side, my right side, you'll be partner a if you're partner a can you raise your hand? Okay. And then if you're on the left side, you'll be partner B. And if you were doing front and back, the person in front will be a, and the person in back, we'll be beat. Okay. So if your ace, can you raise your hand? Okay. So A's in this exercise, what we're going to do is you're gonna get a chance to, to, to tell your partner what the three adjectives are and what feelings came up for you as you were thinking about these adjectives. And B, what you're going to do is practice active listening. What that means is you don't get to talk, you don't get to ask questions, you actually don't even get to make noise. You can nod your head. But the idea is to really listen. And if there is an awkward silence, sit in that awkwardness, but allow a to really describe what's going on for them. Okay. So you're two minutes starts now.

Speaker 4:          14:56          Okay.

Speaker 2:          15:00          Felt a lot of energy and positivity and saw a lot of smiles. That's good. So now be, you did such an awesome job being a listener. Guess what? It's your turn to get to share. And a likewise, please sit in silence and let the other person just express their feelings. And if there's awkwardness in the silence, it's okay. Just let them keep going. Okay. So you're two minutes be starts now.

Speaker 4:          15:27          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          15:52          Wow. So it sounds like there was a lot of energy and enthusiasm and sharing. Um, and what I love to hear is what came up for you. What were some of the adjectives? How did it feel to actually share what, what those agitated, I just made you feel and what was it like to be on the listening side? Do you mind sharing what those two are?

Speaker 4:          16:20          Awesome. You came back.

Speaker 2:          16:24          Okay. Taking initiative and being very helpful. So very positive associations. And when you thought about that about yourself, how did that make you feel?

Speaker 4:          16:33          All right.

Speaker 2:          16:34          All right. Okay. He's like, um, that's actually a common experience that I did is a lot of people often don't take time to really think about the assumptions that they make about other people and how those people are perceiving them. Um, and often the assumptions that we think that other people are making about us often or not as positive as what those other people might be thinking because we tend to be our worst critics. Um, I love to hear a couple more shares.

Speaker 4:          17:10          Awesome.

Speaker 2:          17:14          Okay. Okay. So you thought it was interesting that you had a more positive association of yourself and your partner had a more negative association. Maybe we maybe more self aware or grilling. Yeah. More self aware of more critical. What, what, what was it that you found interesting about it?

Speaker 2:          17:32          Yeah. Yeah. Um, and you know, here's, here's why these associations are really important. It's that if you have a positive perception that somebody else thinks you're um, you know, a good person or easy to work with, when you see that person, are you more likely to engage with that? Thumbs up? Yes. Thumbs down, no. Mostly thumbs up. Yes. Yeah. Now on the flip side, if you're like your partner where you might think like, oh, I don't, I don't think that person really likes me. Or it was difficult to work with that person. When you see that person, are you going to want to engage with them? No. So this is the power of perception about your own personal brand and this is often a critical piece that people don't think about is what are the assumptions that are underlying that is impacting our interactions with others.

Speaker 2:          18:19          And um, I'll share a really good example of this is one of my clients I worked with her and she's really amazing across the board with her peers and her sub ordinance. She's seen as somebody who's really amazing, wonderful to work with. How many of you know amazing colleagues like that? It's like everybody, it's googled course. You've got to know at least one person like that. Um, but the thing is that she was being passed up for promotions and raises all the time. We were like, Huh, that's odd. Like why are you being patched up all the time? I don't get this. Like you were really fantastic. And what we uncover was that she never talked to her boss and the only time she talked to her boss was one, there was a crisis or something urgent. Does that sound familiar to everybody? You can get a lot of head nods like, yeah.

Speaker 2:          19:02          Okay. So now I want you to imagine if you were her boss and you saw her trotting down the hallway, hey boss, or you don't want to talk to her? No, because she's basically the crisis problem person, right? So you've just had this very negative association with her and she also has this very negative association with her boss of light. He's always frustrated with me. So when she goes in, she's not her awesome, authentic self. Right? Because her awesome authentic self is somebody who's social. He gets along with people who wants to be helper. But when she goes to her boss because you have this association that he finds her annoying or she's disrupting him or bother him, she just freezes up. And the only thing she goes to him and is like, Hey, we have this problem. Can we solve it? It's not making for a really good relationship.

Speaker 2:          19:42          I see a lot of labs out there like look at people like yeah, that's, that happens. Yeah. And it's easy to imagine that happening because we're all so busy. So what I would challenge you to do, um, and in what we did with our client was, hey, when you're having your one on one meetings with your boss, which happened every two weeks for her, it's to not only go in and be like, hey, here are the five problems. What are we going to do? That doesn't set up a very good relationship. And some of you may want to write this down, but the key steps that we put in place that really help her transform her relationship was how about we start with, hey, how's it going? Pretty normal. Right? And that's actually something she does with all her peers as well as the people that she supervises. It's a ten second interaction where you can humanize yourself. And in the second step that we did was to also share what were the things that were going well. I cannot imagine that in your workspace that only the sky is falling and you're only having problems, right? There are things that are going well, but we often forget to mention the things that are going well because it's not urgent on our mind. But it's still really important to mention those amazing things that are going on because doing so your supervisor

Speaker 2:          20:48          can know that you're actually getting these things done. And you're also reminding them like, Hey, I'm doing a really good job here because we're busy. And so if you don't remind them of that, they're going to forget or they're not going to be aware that you're doing that good job. And then after you present those positive things and say, I think we should keep doing these things because it's working, then go into the challenges. So what you've done there as you set up a positive association. So every time that you're going into the office, he's not gonna be like, let me duck and hide because all you're coming to me with his problems. Right? And here's the key thing. When you go to your supervisor with challenges, come up with a few solutions. Maybe the solution is an I have the answer that's going to fix all of this, but at least have a here, here's some two or three things that I think we could research or here are some people I think we can talk to to help solve this.

Speaker 2:          21:35          So then what you do is you change the association that the, that your supervisor has as you're the problem, big crisis person to you're the person who's going to come and share some good news that I can also then share with my supervisors as well. Cause I love to share how while our department's doing and how all my peoples doing. Um, and if you come to me with problems, I know that you're also being very proactive and like you over there, you're somebody who's taking initiative, right? So you can see how your own biases about what people are thinking about, you can impact your interaction with them and impact your career. Uh, now on the flip side, what I want to then go into is why does your personal brand matter? Anybody know who that is? Yeah, who's that? I get a lot of laughters does everybody know what a game of Thrones is?

Speaker 2:          22:24          Oh, it's only like half of the room. I can't believe this unfathomable to me that you don't know. Um, so, uh, I'm will, I'm a Geek nerd and I love reading about dragons and all these other things. But just to give a high level overview of game of Thrones is a book fantasy series that has been turned into an HBO series. And this is one of my favorite characters. Tyrian Lannister Tyrian is born into this very powerful Lannister family, which is fortunate and unfortunate. Has father really hates him and so does the sister, but we won't get into her on this particular story. So Tyrian in the middle of the book series finds himself in this really interesting position where he's been asked by his father to be the king's hand and he has to to buys the king, his nephew on strategies and how to keep the country growing.

Speaker 2:          23:12          Um, and as many of you know who've been following the series, there's all these wars that are breaking out everywhere, right? Everybody is trying to be the key. So teary and finds himself in his place where kings landing has confronted what's a battle and they are about to lose this battle to the enemy. But because Tyrian is so smart and so witty, he comes up with an ingenious plan and with courage tries to fight to the death. And what we find is that he actually helps saves the country from being taken over. So now you think, oh, well if he's done that, of course it's going to get all these accolades, right? No, what happens is his father, because his father has this perception that Tyrian is basically not reliable, is you know, somebody who drinks too much. Um, and somebody gets under his skin and is the cause of his wife's death. And it has all these negative associations about Tyrian. What he does in fact as he actually takes all the power away from Tyrian, dismisses him and to add salt to the wound, takes his lover.

Speaker 2:          24:18          I know it's very tragic, right? Um, and this is what can happen if you're not paying attention to your brand. So we know how your own perception of your association to your Brown, how others perceive you might impact your interaction. Now, the other piece of your personal brand is how other people actually see you. And so if the person who is in charge of your career getting the raises or promotion or giving you projects, or even if they're not, but they're supposed to help you as a colleague to get things done, if they don't have a very positive association with you, no matter how hard you work, no matter how long hours you put in, no matter how great your accomplishments, you could end up like Tyrian where you're not going to be acknowledged or that right? And that's a tragedy. Um, because, uh, obviously somebody who is saving the country from being taken over by the enemy should really get that accolade and we don't want that to have happened to you, but we see this time and time again.

Speaker 2:          25:15          How many of you can relate to that? Where you're like, why is that person getting a promotion that I don't understand what they're doing? A lot of head nods, a lot of laughters there. Okay, well we're like, ah, you know, I've been here until midnight every day. Like everybody know that I'm alive. Like, why? Why are you supplying stuff to me? Right? Lots of hands that can relate to that. And, and so that, that's the reason why that one, if somebody who is in charge or who is there to collaborate with you, if they don't have a strong sense of your brand, they're also not going to be there to promote you. Um, and so now you recognize how important it is to have, um, a strong personal brand and, and to manage it because you can see that it can impact your career. Um, but why is there resistance to it?

Speaker 2:          25:56          There's often a resistance to it because people, uh, the most common response I get is I don't want to be fake. How many of you have that natural aversion to like thinking about your brand? I'm like, I don't want to be faked some of you. Okay. And what I would encourage you to do is think about Oprah's lesson where she says, I can be a much better Oprah than I could be a pretend Barbara. And the references is to this. When Oprah started her career as an anchor woman, the person she admired most with Barbara Walters and what she would do it with study Barbara and try to mimic her when she's on TV. And that was really exhausting. And it wasn't until there was a moment where she screwed something up and just kind of laughed and let out a sigh of relief that sh it hit her.

Speaker 2:          26:37          And there was a moment where their light bulb went off and she said, you know what? It's much better to be me than to be a pretend Barbara. And that was when her career took off. So what I would encourage you to do in thinking about your personal brand, it's really not about making this where you have to be fake or you have to kiss up or you have to change yourself so drastically so that you don't remember who you are. Because that would be really exhausting to wear a mask every day. What I am encouraging you to do is to take a look and say, hey, what is going on with my personal brown about my own assumptions and how? How are other people really perceiving me and is that something I'm happy with? And if that's not, what are some small things that I can do to make some big changes?

Speaker 2:          27:22          Um, so, uh, you know, I've worked with a lot of introverts and people who are humble and shy. How many of you relate to being an introvert, humble or PSI? Three floors to the room. Okay. Almost every everybody in the room. Um, and often when, when I talk to them about this is there's this like, I just feel like it's too much or I just can't do it. Right? Or like I just don't want to change myself in, in what I would encourage you to do is to not make this huge leap. I'm not asking you to go from this person who is more shy or there have to being like, Hey, I'm the life of the party, but to really take some small steps that can actually make a big impact on your career. And here's an example of where you can make that big difference.

Speaker 2:          28:04          So working with the client where he's really bright, he's really great at what he does, but he's not. Um, uh, but when you ask who he is and the company, everybody's kind of like who's that? And it's because he's keeping himself really small and really quiet. And so some of the things that we did for him to help him change his own perception of himself, but also to help others see that his brand is something that is strong and something that's positive that should be associated with, um, is, uh, to make some minor changes. So for example, when he goes to the cafeteria to get water or goes to a meeting to just actually say, hey, how's it going to the person standing around him? It's a little awkward at first, but it's just that initial step, right? Because everybody's feeling a little awkward. Um, and so that's one thing.

Speaker 2:          28:49          So just by doing that, he was actually able to get to know people and people knew his name. So that was an amazing feat for him. So after a month of doing that and feeling more competence cause he's like, Hey, I didn't die from that. People actually said hi back. It was amazing. What we then did was say, okay, what can we do now to up your game just a little bit more. So his interaction with people are, hey, how's it going? Good. How's it going? Good. Okay. That was good as an initial step, but it didn't really allow room for rapport. So the next thing that we added to his assignment was to say, what's one thing you can say about the work that you're doing that you can share with somebody else that you love? Because when you're positive and excited and being authentically sharing about what you love, it spreads joy to everybody.

Speaker 2:          29:33          So what we added to his assignment was to come up with one thing every week that he wanted to share. So the interaction became, hey, how's it going? Good. Uh, I've been working on this feature and I'm super excited to hear the feedback on it. The reception to that was a lot more positive and it actually opened the space to have a longer conversation, which was, oh, with the feature about Blah Blah, blah, you know? And so it really allowed him to go more into what he was doing and to share that passion. And over time, by consistently doing that, people in his company, we're actually able to know his name and also know what he brought to the table. And more importantly, have a positive association with him because he was actually excited about the work that he was doing as opposed to be knowing, no, not the guy who, you know, never talked to anybody who didn't care and didn't seem like he was invested in the company.

Speaker 2:          30:20          Can you see the big difference of that small thing can make a lot of head nods? Yes. And so that's what we're hoping that you can do today is to find the things that are authentically true to you. You know that you're excited about, that you're happy about the things that you're working on that are good and to share it in a way that honors your contributions. But also uplifts everybody around you. It doesn't have to be this experience, that negative or that it's fake. And by doing so, the good thing about that is that when there's an issue involving that particular project or that particular assignment, the first person they might think about calling to help solve that problem and that issue comes up is you. And so what we're doing is creating value for you, but we're also creating value for other team members and then overall productivity for the organization.

Speaker 2:          31:10          So, um, so now you know what a personal brand is, right? It's an immediate association that people have about you and they think of you are here of you, similar to what we saw with Oprah. You see the positive consequences that can have in your career like the lawyer that I was talking about or they're really negative consequences. It can have your career like my favorite character Tyrian Lannister and you see that you can be authentic in your own way and still manage your personal brand. Then the next question is, well, what do you want to do with that? What I find is that a lot of times people go back and say, well, I'm inspired for a day and I'm going to do something and then kind of drop off. What I would encourage you to do is to be consistent about this. So three things that I would recommend that you do that can make a big change as one, go back and do the exercise we did earlier, which is to think about the people that you're interacting with on a regular basis and ask yourself what do you think they're thinking about you and how has that impacted your interactions with them.

Speaker 2:          32:09          The second thing is actually go out and ask a few coworkers about that. What are the three key adjectives that comes to mind when you think of me? What do you think are my strengths and what would you like to see more of? This can be scary because you're being vulnerable and putting it out yourself out there, but this is also moment, a chance formation because without that information it's really hard to assess where you are and whether you want to make changes. And then the last piece is this. With that information, what are you going to do about it? You got to go home and say, we know what it's cool but I'm not interested in making changes. Or you can make that decision to put things in your calendar. And all it really takes is 15 minutes a week to make these changes.

Speaker 2:          32:49          Um, so that you can better manage your personal brand. Um, and I know that with change it's always scary even if it's good for you. And it reminds me of a story of myself when I was in college. I was a long time ago and I was in my senior year of college. I got an interview with this tech company that at the time was really up and coming and I was so excited, I was researching the company, I was practicing my pitch. I made a list of 10 questions so that I wouldn't be stumped at the end. Right? I like cross the t's and dotted the i's and I was like, I'm ready for this interview sound like jotting into the interview. And I'm like, oh, it's super excited. So the guy says hi, and we kind of Chit Chat a little bit, a little talk. He goes into, uh, the spiel about his company. And uh, over the next 15 minutes, he answers every single question that's on my list. And then he says, what do you want to know about us?

Speaker 2:          33:48          I could not come up with anything. I was completely stumped. So the question I asked and I'm still embarrassed about it, is, is it true that your company offers good free food? You got the what that company was Google. Yeah. Um, and I was mortified. I, it stayed with me for awhile. I'm like, oh my God, they must think I'm in the most awful interview ever. And it's not a great question and I've thought, you know, it, it was embarrassing and it was hard to actually share it out loud, I guess share this story because I think that that situation could have stayed with me and derailed me and kept me in a place where I'm like, oh, I'm never going to talk to Googlers ever again. I'm never going to do anything here again. Um, and fast forward years later, I'm now being invited to come back and give this presentation to you and to um, how this honor of being able to share through my own personal trials and tribulations and through the training that I've got and through the experiences I've had and helping over a thousand clients to now be able to give you these strategies.

Speaker 2:          34:48          And I share that story because I can assure you all of you have jobs at Google, so you're definitely 10 steps ahead of me, right? Y'All at least got through the screening around and got through the call backs and I know the interview process here is really long and you're way ahead of me when I started. So if I can go from that place to being where I am now, I am more than confident that with consistent work with these strategies that you will be able to have a really amazing successful career. And that at this point, if you make that choice to choose to change your personal brand in a positive direction, you can definitely make that happen. So it was with great honor to be here and I just really wanted to humbly thank you for spending this time together. And I'll take questions after this. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          35:38          So what about if your personal perception of yourself and other coworkers are different?

Speaker 2:          35:46          Hmm. So we've got depends. Great question. So, um, let's take a little bit into that. Uh, do you feel like your personal perception of yourself as positive or negative? A positive. Okay. And then do you think your coworkers perception of you as positive, negative or neutral? Um,

Speaker 5:          36:02          still positive but just different stuff.

Speaker 2:          36:05          Okay. Um, and so what I would say with that is it sounds like you're in a good place because you were feeling pretty good about yourself, which is the first step and your coworkers are feeling pretty good about you. And so if what you want to do is to have them see more of the stuff that you are feeling good about, then the recommendation would be, um, you know, depending on the interactions you have with people to discuss those things more to find ways and highlighting those things more. So give me a specific example cause like it's harder to answer in the abstract. Um, what the positive association of yourself that you want others to know about you. Um, taking more iterative. Okay. Okay. So if you want to show that you're somebody who is taking more initiative, um, uh, one of the ways you can do that is if you're at a team meeting, um, instead of just sitting quiet and not saying that to you, but for the sake of time, what I would say is that, you know, at every meeting, um, you should at least make one comment if you're not making a comment, right?

Speaker 2:          37:01          And asking questions. And the other thing that you can do to really show initiative is if there's something that's being assigned or things that are, um, projects that are coming up, you, you would be the person who would volunteer for it. Um, and that's, that's showing initiative right there. The key thing then though is to follow up that and when you're working on these projects to let people on your team and let your supervisors know that as well.

Speaker 6:          37:21          So there is a one school of thought where they say you keep doing the good work and things will fall in place. And now there's this concept of personal branding there you have to proactively influence or change the perception of other people you see any conflict?

Speaker 2:          37:39          No, I don't, I doubt at all. And I think that's a really great question. I think, um, um, the basis is you have to do good work. You know, um, if you're doing bad work and you're expecting everybody else to think good about you, that's a really hard place to be. And that would not be something that I would advocate for any client cause I, I'm really about having integrity, honesty, and authenticity. So you do need to do consistent good work, um, and some things will fall into place. Um, so you know, you get a job at Google, that's things falling into place and Google is an amazing place to work. Now if you want to elevate yourself and get to that next stage where you're going into management and leadership, um, there has to be some changes in your strategies. So the foundation of doing good work, it's still a core foundation of who you are, but, but that extra step of sharing the good work that you're doing, um, doesn't take away from that. And it only adds to that. Thank you very much. Thank you. Bye.

Speaker 3:          38:35          Yeah.
