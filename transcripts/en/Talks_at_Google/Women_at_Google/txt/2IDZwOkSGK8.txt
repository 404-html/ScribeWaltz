Speaker 1:          00:06          This is Katie can trial with factory farming awareness coalition. She, she's here to speak today about the impacts of an animal agriculture on the environment. Um, and so I hope everybody enjoys the presentation. Okay, so he was kidding.

Speaker 2:          00:20          Thank you so much and thank you everyone for coming. So again, my name is Katie [inaudible]. I'm the founder and executive director of the factory farming awareness coalition or a local nonprofit based in the bay area dedicated to talking to people about the impacts of our food choices. Here's an outline of what we'll be discussing today, the basics of factory farming, what that term means, an overview of the environmental impacts and we'll conclude by talking about potential solutions. So you know, while some of this information is disturbing and depressing, I promised that we will end on an upbeat note and there'll be little cuteness interludes in between each section to give you a chance to ask questions. Now, how many of you are saying all Mcdonald's when your kids, or maybe you're singing it with your own children? So when we walk into the supermarket and look around a picture, pictures on products, it looks like old MacDonald's farm is still around today. We see all these rolling green hills sides, all those happy cows. But unfortunately, this is not what farming is like anymore in the United States rather than old Mcdonald. This is what we have today. Factory farms are technically known as concentrated animal feeding operations or k foes. It's a practice of keeping thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of animals in confinement for their entire lives. This has done to produce the most product for the most profit.

Speaker 2:          01:34          Before we go any further, does anyone want to guess how many animals are Brad and killed for food every year in the United States? You don't already know the answer. Anyone want to take a guess? Okay, so pretty close. So yeah, there's actually 9 billion there. Between nine and 10 billion animals raised and killed for food every single year in the United States alone. This is just land animals, not even counting fish. So there are more farmed animals in the United States than there are people on the entire planet. Now. Of these 9 billion animals, what percentage of them do you think are raised on factory farms rather than on this nice small old Mcdonald type farms? 80% but 99% some 99% of meat that you see nowadays in restaurants or supermarkets is going to be coming from these factory farms. Now if we've heard the term factory farming, it's usually in the context of animal welfare and that's not what we'll be focusing on today.

Speaker 2:          02:28          But I do briefly want to discuss what conditions look like on factory farms because that's also what contributes to most of the environmental problems as well. And I think it helps to understand the mindset of factory farming, which is really summed up best by national hog farmer magazine. They said the breeding sow, which is a mother pig, should be thought of and treated as a valuable piece of machinery whose function is to pump out baby pigs like a sausage machine. So these are no longer thought of as living and creatures they're thought of as units of production. It is this mindset that allows us to treat farmed animals in ways that we would never dream of treating our dogs or cats. So again, the hallmark of factory farming is this intensive confinement the animal spend their entire lives sometimes can find in Kate's or courageous CZ cages or crates so small that they cannot even turn around other industries like the Turkey industry, they're kept by the thousands inside of these sheds. So this obviously causes extreme problems for animal offer. They can't engage in even the most basic of natural behaviors, but it is also this overcrowding that causes the environmental issues as well. So for the rest of the presentation, you have to keep in mind that these are what conditions look like on factory farms where 99% in meat is coming from.

Speaker 2:          03:43          Now. One question that frequently comes up is what about the labels that we see on products that seemed to indicate they're coming from better places? So I want to quickly go through what those mean. I'll start with cage free. This is a picture of a cage free egg farm. Now it's true. These hands aren't in cages, but it's not exactly what we imagine when we see the term cage free. He says happy looking chickens on the front of the carton, so it really means just that they're not in cages, but they're still kept by the tens of thousands inside of these industrial sheds for their entire lives.

Speaker 2:          04:13          Unfortunately, conditions on free range farms are very similar, so technically it means the animals must have access to the outdoors, but there are no real enforced specifications for what that means, and there are a lot of loopholes as well that lot farms get away with keeping their animals can find by the tens of thousands inside of these sheds. But if there's access to the outdoors like a tiny little door that opens onto a dirt patch, it can technically count as free range even if not a single animal ever actually steps foot outside. Now to give you a real world example, the wording on the left is from a package of Judy's eggs, which is a popular organic free range brand from right here in northern California. It says these hands are raised in wide open spaces and Sonoma valley where they are free to roam, scratch and play.

Speaker 2:          04:57          While on the right you can see an aerial photo of what Judy's farm actually looks like. Those are those industrial sheds with tens of thousands of chickens. There aren't any birds outside and the purple that you see in front, there is a manure pit, which we will be talking about much more in a few minutes. Now, Judy is actually settled a lawsuit with the Animal Legal Defense Fund for misleading consumers with the claims on their packaging. So they have changed the wording, but there are still certified free range and organic and in fact they rebrand under several different brand names, which is a very common practice to make consumers think they're coming from these nice little individual family farms when they're coming from the same source, these factory farms, so they sell under Judy's Uncle Daddy's rock island gold circle. There are also a leading supplier for whole foods, three 65 brand and organic valley. So unfortunately even some of the most respected organic free range brands are in fact sourcing from factory farms.

Speaker 2:          05:50          The final term that you might see is humane and this has no legal meaning whatsoever. The USDA does not regulate the term humane, nor do they the term natural, so any company can put these on any product. It's really just a marketing gimmick and it's unfortunate because these companies are taking advantage of consumers desire to buy products that are coming from a better place. We don't want animals to be mistreated. We don't want to impact the environment and negative ways. But unfortunately this is usually just used as a mechanism to increase the price when they are, they're still coming from factory farms. Animal Agriculture is one of the single most destructive industries on the planet. I know this can seem a little bizarre for still imagining old MacDonald's farm. What could be so bad about, oh, Mcdonald's, right? So I'm going to walk you through it.

Speaker 2:          06:34          So again, keep in mind that there are 9 billion animals raised and killed for food every year. And this is where most of the environmental problems stem from. It's the sheer number of animals that are required to make enough meat for 300 million plus Americans to eat meat every single day. Often with every meal. And the problems come from the fact that these are 9 billion living, breathing, eating, pooping animals. Now they're eating primarily corn and soy. And we imagine farmers and farm land in the U S we, I think, imagine, um, we imagine growing crops to feed to people, right? But in the United States, over half of all farmland is planted with corn and soy and most of that is going to feed not people, but two animals on factory farms. This is a problem for several different reasons. One is that animals are actually a very inefficient source of food. So imagine that you are raising an animal for food from the day that that animal is born until the day that you slaughter it, you have to feed it right.

Speaker 2:          07:32          So that's days, weeks, months, potentially even years that you're giving this animal food every single day. So if you add up all of the food that you give to that animal over the course of its lifetime, it ends up being anywhere from two to 15 times more food than the amount of food that you get from eating that animal's flesh. The latest studies have found that if we cut global meat consumption in half, and we used all of that farmland to grow fruits and veggies for people to eat directly, rather than growing that corn and soy to feed to animals on factory farms, we could feed every single person on earth. Today plus an extra 2 billion people. So we hear a lot of talk about how are we going to feed the growing global population. And in fact we could do it easily if we were using our land more efficiently, but eating lower on the food chain, this land use is a huge problem globally as well.

Speaker 2:          08:20          Me Production is actually the leading cause of the Amazon rain forest being cut down. We can see that here in this infographic from the center for biological diversity. Every minute there are two acres of rainforest clear cut to make grazing land for beef cattle or land to grow corn and soy to feed to animals on factory farms. This is also a problem in the United States as well. Oftentimes people think I don't want to support factory farms so I'm going to buy free range beef. Now there are a couple of different problems with this. One is that actually most beef cattle or free range for the first eight to 10 months of their lives. So if you drive, you know, especially in Moran Petaluma, that area you might see these bucolic looking cattle grazing on hillsides. And it looks very nice, but most of those cattle are then shipped to industrial feedlots where they're fed corn and soy intensively for the last few months of their lives to fatten them up to reach market weight.

Speaker 2:          09:12          The other big problem is that while there are certain ecosystems that do benefit from having grazing ruminant animals, there is a limit to how many animals that land can sustain. It's called the carrying capacity. And when you exceed that, you start to have these very serious ecological problems. And that's what we're seeing across the west now. So cattle are being grazed on, uh, on public lands. So the government is basically subsidizing these, this grass in order to Gracie's free range cattle. But the bureau of land management, which manages this land is not insuring that it's being managed properly to prevent these environmental problems. So you have too many cattle on this land, so they're eating everything that comes up out of the ground. They're eating what would grow into shrubs and trees to provide habitat for native animals. This also causes soil erosion and impacts waterways.

Speaker 2:          10:02          So a lot of different devastating impacts of overgrazing. And to make matters worse, there's a very secretive government agency called wildlife services. They're a part of the USTA, and in 2015 they killed over 3 million animals, mostly at the request of ranchers. So they're killing off predators like wolves, bears, coyotes. Fox is mountain lions that could kill the livestock. They're killing off prairie dogs and ground squirrels can dig holes that the cattle could fall into even rounding up and killing Buffalo. So native ruminate animals because they're competing with the cattle for feed. So we're destroying these entire native ecosystems in order to make them suitable for free range cattle.

Speaker 2:          10:45          Now another big problem with all of these animals and all of these crops is that they're very water intensive. Now when we think about ways to save water, what are some things that come to mind? What are ways we're told? Just to say we can help save water. Yeah, take shorter showers, right? That's a classic one. Turn off the tap when you brush your teeth, right? Water your lawn less. So all of these suggestions focus on our direct water usage. In this next video clip from the movie Casper, see, we'll see how this compares to the water impact of our food choices.

Speaker 3:          11:15          I found out that one quarter pound hamburger requires over 660 gallons of water to produce. Here. I've been taking these short showers, trying to save water and to find out just eating one hamburger is the equivalent of showering two entire months. So much attention is given to lowering our home water use. Yet domestic water use is only 5% of what is consumed in the u s versus 55% for animal agriculture. That's because it takes upwards of 2,500 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef.

Speaker 2:          11:44          The single best way that we can help say water on a daily basis is through our food choices, so the numbers they used, they're on the high end, but even the more conservative estimates show switching from my hamburger to Veggie Burger, just one single time opting for a Veggie Burger. Instead of a hamburger, you save as much water as not showering for one entire month. So all that water, all of this, um, corn and soy. Also a lot of hormones, pesticides, antibiotics are fed to these 9 billion animals. It goes through their system. And then what happens to food after we digest it? It comes out as poop. Farm animals in the United States produce 130 times as much proof as the entire us human population, and there's very little waste infrastructure for factory farms.

Speaker 1:          12:32          One of America's biggest secrets is that farms practically don't exist anymore. The animals we eat are grown inside giant hidden factories. Since 2012 I've been secretly planning a project to expose these factory farms using the highest texts, spy equipment available

Speaker 4:          12:55          drones. This video provides just a sample of what I saw during only a few days of filming. You're looking at a lake of toxic 80 CC's and urine the size of four football fields. That's because thousands upon thousands of pigs are inside of these buildings. Their waste falls through slats in the concrete floor and it sloshed it directly into this giant open air cesspool. How many of these kinds of factories are there in North Carolina alone? There are over 2000 and the consequences are disastrous.

Speaker 5:          13:38          The waste false through through the floors it's flushed out. And to have an open pit assess Paul,

Speaker 4:          13:46          it's easy for a big hog operation to have as much waste as a medium size city. Of course the pit will fill up so it has to be empty and they're empty by spraying the liquid waste. Yes. You heard that right? Yep.

Speaker 5:          14:04          If you're familiar with a garden sprayer, they're gigantic versions of that. So they're making droplets fine mists out of this liquid waste and that can drift down wind into the neighboring communities. Uh, shut my hog operation down and I got out of it and uh, I, I couldn't, I just couldn't do another person that way to make them smell bad.

Speaker 4:          14:32          It is a safe food. If you put please season, you're urinary, a hole in the ground that you dump a toxic waste. And I've seen dead hogs and stuff like that. People can't

Speaker 5:          14:43          open their windows. They can't go outside. I've seen it. I've talked to the people. I've seen the little children. They say mama data. Wow, we got to smell

Speaker 6:          14:52          this.

Speaker 4:          14:52          Did you get stories like I can't hang my clothes out. Pc. Oda Combine attacking itself to your clothes and then people are saying we're spirited by neighbors. It can. I think we're very correctly, right?

Speaker 5:          15:05          Be called environmental racism or environmental injustice that people of color, low income people bear the brunt of these practices,

Speaker 6:          15:16          so this is where they spray around our waist on us. This is about eight feet from my mother's house. What is it like when the mist that snacks, you think it's raining really? You think it's raining? We don't open the doors, the windows, but the oldest still comes in. It takes your breath away. Then you start gagging, you get headaches.

Speaker 5:          15:34          Is there a number of studies of asthma and asthma symptoms,

Speaker 4:          15:38          particularly in children near these facilities? Among adults, there are reports of several types of upper respiratory symptoms. These pollutants are affecting people's blood pressure. Who's responsible for all this Smithfield suits, specifically the subdivision Murphy Brown, which controls the factory farms shown in all of the drone footage in this video. Smithfield is by far the largest pork producer in the entire world. And inside these buildings there is something else entirely.

Speaker 6:          16:11          Pigs are really intelligent animals. They are more intelligent than dogs. They are more intelligent than cats. In the average pig barn, there could be hundreds, if not thousands of pigs crammed into this one sprawling indoor space. Their entire life has been standing on concrete floors. Mother pigs are locked in metal cages so small that they literally cannot even turn around for months at a time.

Speaker 4:          16:34          This is not a partisan issue. We are all opposed to children being made sick to animals being abused and to everyday people's lives being ruined by the stench of cesspools in their backyards. These thousands of lakes of toxic waste must be among the most bizarre and disturbing environmental phenomenon that has ever confronted America. And Dave had been kept well hidden from the public for long enough.

Speaker 2:          17:17          So you've just seen what happens to all of this waste. It's fairly shocking, right? And for urban consumers meet starts at the supermarket. It starts at a restaurant. We don't ever have to see or experience the real impacts of it, so it's usually these rural low income communities, often communities of color, the bear the brunt of the rest of our meat consumption. They're the ones who have to be exposed to this environmental pollution on a daily basis. The other huge problem with all of these animals and all of this waste is climate change. I report from the United Nations found that animal agriculture creates greenhouse gas emissions than all the planes, trains and cars in the entire world all added up together. Part of the reason for this is it ruminant animals like cows and sheep lambs actually burp methane, which is 20 times worse for climate change and carbon dioxide.

Speaker 2:          18:06          The poop from all of these different types of animals, chickens, pigs, all the ones that we've seen releases nitrous oxide, which is 300 times worse for climate change than carbon dioxide. And they're also all of the impacts of that. Deforestation when you consider the whole life cycle of everything that's required to produce the meat. The deforestation also plays a large role because they're cutting down forest that would otherwise be absorbing CO2. So when you factor in all of these things together, you see that our food choices are also the single best way that we can help shrink our carbon footprint on a daily basis. Just like our water footprint. So one study found that not eating meat just one day a week, say some more greenhouse gas emissions and buying local food 100% of the time.

Speaker 7:          18:49          Okay.

Speaker 2:          18:49          A different study found that if everyone in the United States ate no meat or cheese, just one day a week, it would be like not driving 91 billion miles are taking 7.6 million cars off the road. So we can think about what are the chances that we're going to convince 7 million people to sell their cars and never drive again? Probably not going to happen, right? Whereas getting people to not eat meat just one day a week, you know, choose a PB and j instead of a Turkey Sandwich. And a Veggie burrito instead of a beef burrito. It's one of the easiest and most effective ways that we can help stop climate change.

Speaker 7:          19:24          Okay.

Speaker 2:          19:24          And in fact there's more and more scientific evidence showing that we cannot keep climate change to a level that's conducive to human civilization without addressing the carbon footprint of agriculture. So this study found that the agriculture related emissions alone, if we continue our current practices, especially as a global population grows and demand for meat goes up worldwide than agriculture alone will take up almost all of the global carbon budget by 2050 so this means that even if we got every other industry down to carbon neutral, but we left agriculture the same, we would still be hitting that two degree target. So the only scenario that would reduce emissions in 2050 compared to 2009 levels is what they call the healthy diets scenario, which is switching to significantly more plant based protein

Speaker 2:          20:16          and as an added benefit, eating more plant based protein also has positive impacts on the health of citizens and on health care costs. So if American's transitioned to a plant by plant based diet, not only would it reduce food related greenhouse gas emissions by 79% we could also avoid 460,000 deaths and save $289 billion in healthcare costs and climate change costs. So one of the reasons that people eat so much meat is that it seems cheap, but that's because the true of it or externalize. So we don't have to see the environmental costs, the healthcare costs when we go to the store, when we go to the restaurant. But as taxpayers we are actually paying the true cost. And the most effective way to reverse that is to transition to a more plant based diet. The basic solution is very simple. We have to eat less meat.

Speaker 2:          21:07          That's really what it boils down to. And different organizations, world leaders are starting to catch on to this and starting to encourage people to switch to plant based protein. So the United Nations Environmental Program has urged first world citizens to cut our meat consumption, half become what they call dematerial. The Stockholm International Water Institute has gone even further. And said that we need to limit animal based foods to just 5% of our total daily calories. Right now the make up about 30% of the standard American diet, so they said we need to eat just one sixth as much meat as we currently are, and they've warned that if we do not do this, then we will be faced with food and water shortages worldwide that could lead to civil war. So the stakes are about as high as they get. When we're talking about things like climate change, global famine, and all of this can be impacted directly through our food choices.

Speaker 2:          21:57          Now a big challenge is how do you get people interested in eating less meat? There are a lot of reasons that people eat meat. It tastes good, it's cheap, it's convenient, it's part of our culture, it's part of our habit. And so now different organizations and nonprofits as well as money, different food startups, especially in the bay area are working on ways to get people excited about eating more plant based protein. One initiative that's been very successful as meatless Mondays. This was actually started by Johns Hopkins University as a public health initiative as we saw a few slides ago. Healthcare costs are hugely impacted by the amount of animal protein than Americans currently consume. Many of the leading causes of death, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, stroke, are directly related to eating too much animal protein, so they figured if people eat even a seventh less meat, if people are not eating meat one day a week, then it will really help people's health and many other organizations have jumped on board and said it's a great way to help the environment and animals as well and even for die hard meat lovers.

Speaker 2:          22:55          The idea of not eating meat meat, just one day a week is something that seems very doable and currently a third of Americans report trying to participate. Green Monday is also another really successful program, but it's similar to meatless Monday, but really focused on those environmental impacts, emphasizing the fact that the best way to go green is by eating more plant based protein. It's actually based in Hong Kong and they've had tremendous success in shifting the entire cities eating habits by having a really positive empowering campaign. Emphasizing that eating green choosing veggie options is a very effective step to take. And Green Monday emphasizes that, you know, it's not a one size fits all. So oftentimes people are deterred from taking a step because they think that they won't be able to be perfectly 100% vegetarian or Vegan and so get dissuaded and they give up. But as a green Monday shows, there are a number of different ways that we can go about this.

Speaker 2:          23:50          So whether that's routine based, one day a week, so green Monday or meatless Monday, you can do every day for lunch, eat a vegetarian or Vegan lunch it, you know, just one meal a day. It's pretty doable for most people. But if you do that, then a third of the time you'll be eating fudge. It can also be portioned based. So decreasing the amount of meat theory are eating, increasing the amount of plant based protein, vegetarian foods on your plate, or it can be impact based. So pledging to only order Veggie burgers instead of hamburgers from now on. There are many different ways that we can play around with our food choices and increase the amount of plant based foods that we're eating. And again, as one of the single most effective actions that we can take. There are also some very exciting tech solutions that are in the works right now, namely clean meat.

Speaker 2:          24:38          So clean meat involves extracting stem cells from animal tissue, culturing those and then basically growing meat tissue in the lab and then layering that to produce hamburgers, chicken nuggets. So it is actually meet, I mean it is animal tissue and it's based on medical technology used to grow human skin cells to graft onto burn victims, but they're actually growing meat and this is successful. Memphis meats has produced just um, I think about a month ago they had the first tastings of clean chicken and duck meat. And there are a few other companies that are working on beef as well. And this is extremely more efficient than factory farming. So clean meat uses 99% less land. 96 produces 96% less greenhouse gas emissions and uses 96% less water. And there's a really great organization called the Good Food Institute that is working to help encourage the science behind clean meat and policy around clean meat as well.

Speaker 2:          25:36          So according to the latest estimates, it should be on the market within about four to five years. Again, the technology is there, it's just a matter of scaling it so that it's cost competitive with factory farm meat. But I think this is one of the most hopeful development. So if we can replace fast food, meet with clean meat, then we will see drastic impacts on the environment. And obviously it's for animals as well. But the good news is that you don't have to wait four or five years to make a difference. There are a number of other startups all based right around here that are working on creating foods that have the same case in textures that we love, but they are made from more sustainable plant based sources. So as Biz stone said, these guys are coming at the meat analog industry, not as a novelty.

Speaker 2:          26:20          They're coming at it from the big science angle. So they're really, these products are not made for vegetarian markets anymore. They're not made for niche market. They're getting the top chefs, top food scientists to create products that are really delicious and satisfying for diehard meat lovers. So you have companies like beyond meat and impossible foods, which makes the Burger, the burger that bleeds as it's been getting a lot of attention in the press. Hampton creek foods, which makes just male, um, cookie salad dressings and all of these products. You can read articles, see interviews online, they do blind taste tests and people can't tell the difference. So,

Speaker 7:          26:54          okay,

Speaker 2:          26:55          if the main reason that we're eating meat is because it tastes good, it's fantastic news that there are now products available that have that same taste, the same texture, but they're better for us, better for animals, better for the environment. So it's really a win win.

Speaker 2:          27:08          And this is a top growing trend. This is really the direction that the market is moving. So food navigator, magazine, mental, um, business, uh, the nutrition business journal, I mean they've all documented that Americans are eating more and more plant based foods. They're interested in it from a health angle, from an environmental angle. And this is consistently one of the fastest growing sectors of the food system as a result. And even more exciting trend is that meat and dairy companies are actually starting to jump on board. So even Tyson chicken, their CEO, the CEO of Tyson chicken said that plant based protein is the way of the future. And dairy companies are also investing in plant based dairy. So Dannon Yogurt, the parent company that makes Dannon bought white wave, which makes silk, so I'm milk and almond milk and they're shifting a lot of their marketing budget away from marketing dairy foods towards marketing plant based foods.

Speaker 2:          27:59          So we see this very positive feedback cycle where the more that we vote with our dollars and we buy these products, the more appealing that food sector becomes to businesses. They invest in it, then those products are more widely available, they're cheaper, they're more accessible. And so more and more people start buying them. And as we've seen, especially with products like almond milk, then they start to take up a larger and larger market share. And as a result, there are fewer animals bred and killed for food every year. And so oftentimes people say, but I'm just one person. What difference do my food traces really make? But we really can't have a very direct impact on this industry. And especially at a time when federal policy is increasingly frustrating and alarming. You know, there's zero chance of federal action on climate change within these next few years. So this is even more important that we can really directly impact this industry, have a real impact on climate change through our daily food choices.

Speaker 2:          28:55          And it's really never been easier or tastier to eat these plant based foods. So I'm guardian products are probably my favorite. They have these great guy, I'm crispy tenders and they're actually owned by the company that makes hungry man dinners. So again, we see these meat companies starting to invest in plant based products. Um, almond milk is available every supermarket. Ben and Jerry's now has seven flavors of almond milk based ice cream. So we see, again, it's, it's a growing trend, which is great for all of us because it makes it so easy to do. And again, you know, you don't have to be 100% vegetarian to order a veggie burger or Veggie burrito. You don't have to be totally Vegan all the time to put almond milk in your cereal instead of cow milk. It's not about being all or nothing, you know, a hundred percent perfect. It's about looking at the impacts of our food choices and deciding what we our money to support. And the other good news is that again, this really has a direct impact. So supply and demand applies. Demand has been going down since 2007 demand has dropped and as a result there are 400 million fewer animals bred and killed for food now than there were back in 2007 as a direct result of people like you and me deciding to eat less meat. So remember that every time you decide not to eat an animal product, you are taking action against one of the most destructive industries on the planet.

Speaker 7:          30:13          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          30:14          we'd love to get your feedback on the presentation. So just a quick survey and if you'd like to sign up for our mailing list, we send out just once a month newsletter with recipes, national news about factory farming, petitions to sign, things like that. And we'll also send you some recipes and some further resources, but you can also fill this out anonymously. Oh, so the, is there, the question was, is there a good place to find the sources for the studies that I've cited or more information? Yeah, so we have all of the citations for our presentation available on our website and we actually have a, um, a fortune, I don't have any with me today, but we have a new leaflet that's focused on the environmental impacts and there's a page with citations for that also available on our website. So those have all of the original studies that were, we're setting from the movie. Cowspiracy is also a good resource and they have a website with a lot of information as well, specifically about the environmental studies for more information about food sources and you know what to eat, nutrition, all of that. Choose vege.com is a really fantastic resource. They've got meal plans, tips for eating out all the nutritional info that you need.

Speaker 7:          31:17          Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          31:19          So the question is what's the relationship between the animal products consumed in the u s and what is consumed around the world? So I mean it's a pretty complicated relationship. It depends on the industry, but roughly 15% of products here exported. So Americans do have no, we have the second highest meat consumption in the world. We are actually, um, pass by Australia, but we do eat most of those products here. Some of it is exported. Um, we do import some products as well and a lot of these companies are now, they started in the United States, but they're now multinational corporations. And actually Smithfield, which is the largest pork producer, was um, bought. Basically a majority stake was bought by a Chinese company. And so now we are starting to see an increase in pork exports to China. So now Americans are having to deal with these environmental, the environmental pollution and these products are exported.

Speaker 2:          32:14          Another huge issue is Alfalfa feed. Alfalfa is the most intensive crop in terms of water and Saudi Arabia and other countries are now, um, they're importing Alfalfa from the United States. So they're basically important water. So, and this is a huge problem because a lot of that Alfalfa is grown in southern California and Arizona and parts of the country that are facing these droughts and our water is actually being exported to support the dairy industry in the Middle East. And the US is also, you know, we've, we have set this example that if you're well off, you know, the lifestyle that we've, that other people want to emulate as their income grows is that, you know, meat is an integral part of living well, eating meat every day shows that you are middle class or upper upper class. And so there's a cultural impact as well. Um, and I'm hopeful that we can change that.

Speaker 2:          33:07          You know, if we can show that the United States, the saying actually now plant based protein is the way to go. This is a really exciting way of the future. Then hopefully countries that are starting to ramp up their meat production will shift to plant based protein as well. Um, I also have some resources here for you that we can pass out. So this is the guide to cruelty for eating. It's got some great recipes, nutritional info, and then if we have any athletes in the room, this is a compassionate athlete. So there's this idea that um, eating vegges feminine or it's hard to get enough protein, but this is a David Carter. They call them the 300 pound Vegan. He was an NFL player, actually played for the Raiders and he's totally Vegan. So good info in there as well. Again, where the factory farming awareness coalition, this is our website and we give presentations. This is really what we do. We're focused on grassroots education. So if you know of any other, um, schools, community groups, businesses, faith communities that might be interested in learning more about this issue, we're always happy to come out and speak for free. All right. Thank you. Thanks everybody for.
