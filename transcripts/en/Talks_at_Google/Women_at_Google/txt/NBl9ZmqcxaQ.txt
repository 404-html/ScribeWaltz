Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Hi everyone. My name is Elise spark Hoffer and I'm one of the global program managers for women at Google. We were very excited today for a special talks at Google, hosted by Eileen Naughton, VP of people operations at Google and Marine Schuchat Marine Schuchat began her career in marketing at L'oreal Paris in 1985 she has worked at the gap help launch old navy and was president of Banana Republic before becoming COO and president of US operations of Chanel in 2003 in 2007 she became it's first global CEO where she oversaw the business and brands worldwide expansion. She left Chanel in 2016 to focus on writing, speaking and developing new leadership initiatives. There is a dory for questions. I'm go slash Maureen Hyphen Dori. If anyone who's over live stream wants to add a question remotely when we open it up. Thanks.

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       Thank you Lisa, and good morning, everyone know the afternoon if you're watching from other parts of Google, we have I think, well over 200 people signed up, so good morning everyone on the GBC and welcome back to Google Morgan. Thank you. Maureen and I ran into each other in the hallway this morning and one of the reasons I was so intrigued come in and speak with you was I met Maureen in the past. She was, um, at the time, CEO of Chanel, one of the most coveted accounts in the New York office. I might add on all of our sales executives from transcend very, very specially when the Chanel team came in. Uh, and they got a lot of love from us and Maureen, you were really pushing your team to, uh, drive more value through digital marketing. And so clearly a lot of leadership insight there. But I read the book review, uh, uh, beyond the label Marines first book.

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       Um, and I was intrigued and I sent the review to our director of leadership development because I thought there were so many leadership lessons in here and I said, we might want to get marine to come to Google and tell us about this. Uh, Maureen, you were running a $5 billion global company, one of the most iconic brands in the genre of fashion and high end luxury. And suddenly it stopped. Uh, December, 2015 was it? It was, it was January, 2016. Right. So you've had this meteoric career. You're one of the monkeys, Myers Ceos, a female CEOs in your industry, but also, you know, an American CEO of this iconic crunch brand. And then it stops, I think, talk a little bit about what it felt like and the disorientation. Describe in the book. I would love to. So there's a, there's a story in the

Speaker 3:          00:02:59       book and it's the first story and I'll give you a sort of brief synopsis and let you read the rest. But you know, from one day to the next I found myself no longer with a, with a title, with a label of global, of Chanel. And as part of what I was going through I think, and I think, to be honest, it was a moment for me of both freedom in a way. Cause I had been working in a company for over 30 years in companies. I had three major companies, L'Oreal gap and all three divisions. And then Chanel. And so while at one point it was kind of liberating. It was, I was also grieving. I mean it was really hard because I found myself without knowing who I was anymore. And the story goes that I decided for whatever reason, y'all probably think I'm crazy, but I decided I need to purge my closets.

Speaker 3:          00:03:52       I have been wearing the same uniform for 13 years. I know it's a really wonderful treat to be able to wear this kind of uniform. For me it was jeans cause I, you know, you can't give up your roots. So I had, I had my, my denim jeans. Any variety of denim jeans. What's your favorite? Well, at the time, at the time I was wearing j Brown, but I've now transitioned to rag and bone. I really liked there. I'm giving them a plug. I hope they're happy now. So all you Google earth, I just think they're really comfortable, well made and beautiful fabrics. But I would wear any variety of j brand jeans back then. My American apparel, now they're going out of business unfortunately, tank tops and a Chanel jacket every day, 13 years. That's what I wore. So I had this moment, I need to purge my closet. I did that and I realized that all I had left or tank tops a few woven shirts from a company called Hartford and these genes. So I thought, oh my God, what am I gonna do? So I call it Jeffrey is a store in New York. I called Jeffery and I said, are texted him. S O s I need, I need clothes. I'm sorry, what did you do with the old ones?

Speaker 3:          00:05:05       I know everybody has their about, I don't know if you've just myths. They're about 10 closets full of my basement. But, um, I still haven't done anything with them, but I really, it was, you know, I know, I know everybody. I know. I haven't figured it out. I haven't had time to figure it out. But, so I went into Jefferson and I'm a merchant at heart and meaning I love clothes and I feel them. And I love to think about what looks good in stores. So I walked in probably the most intimidated I had ever been because I felt almost nude. You know, I felt naked at this point. I had on some of my converse sneakers and jeans and I'm touching the mannequins and they're looking down at me and I'm thinking, you know, I don't belong anymore. I don't know where I belong.

Speaker 3:          00:05:50       And fortunately thanks to the team there, they littered the, the dressing room at all different options. And you know, my first instinct was to go over to my old identity, cause by the way, this is a story about clothes, but it's really a story about identity. And I started looking at all the jackets. That's all I could see was fitted jackets, Chanel type jackets. And they said, no, why don't we show you some other things, wide leg pants and you know, this kind of jacket and an underpinnings and all these things that I hadn't ever thought about wearing. And I started looking at myself in the mirror and I thought, oh my God, I'm, there's a person in there beyond the label, really beyond the label of global CEO of Chanel. And it was the beginning of the process that I went through a rediscovering who I was after this 13 year stint as the CEO, 13 years spent as Theo Chanel hurting your closet is a metaphor for purging your life.

Speaker 3:          00:06:43       That's exactly right. Yeah. Your marriage of 26 years, is it the perch that to automatic way it was, you know, it wasn't dramatic. It's, it's interesting to be in the situation where I'm, and I think in honesty of wonderful, wonderful relationship, which is still there is a friendship. And to recognize that and to be able to say, can we be, can we evolve this relationship from what it is and go beyond our own labels, basically cool to into a friendship. And so Antoine, I call him, I was banned. And so, um, because we're best friends and he lives in Africa. His passion and his work is in, is really in, in setting up NGO's in Africa. So he's living in Burgundy. Um, he does a lot of work also in Uganda. Um, but I also realize that what was interesting about our, our relationship is so much of what he had to do in so many ways was follow me.

Speaker 3:          00:07:40       And this allowed him to follow him. So it was a real opening. And now I say this, it sounds really easy, but I cried for three months and I kid you not, this was not an easy thing, but it was a, you know, you're right. It was a, it was a, it was a kind of identity. It wasn't, I even hate to say purging, maybe a strong word, but do you think had your separation from Chanel not happen, do you think you would have been provoked to, to, to your label? You know, it's interesting. Um, my marriage, we were separated long before I left to Chanel. And um, it was interesting for me actually to go through that. I'm not this, I'm not, I don't want to talk too much cause it's going to be the, I think it will be the subject of my next book.

Speaker 3:          00:08:25       I know I would love to, I'd love to talk more. I, we can talk. I, I, cause I haven't formulated all my ideals. Um, but you know, it was, and I, I don't, you know how sometimes when you're in it, and I think I'm the way I'm still in that you're not exactly, you don't have a distance enough to say, what did I glean from this? Or what, what questions can I ask? What observations can I make that might help other people going through major transformations? Um, I, you know, I, I'm, I'm still in the transformation. I think kind of, we always are, right? But this one was a big one.

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       It's remarkable in so many strong women are giving voice to what it is we variance in life. Um, Sheryl Sandberg, who was one of the founding, um, she was the founder of women at Google, which was here I had just come out with option B and her whole premise of resilience and you learn, you actually learn how through a difficult transitions, just how resilient you can be and resilience himself is a learned skill. Is that something that you've been toying with or has it, I haven't been able to read the book yet.

Speaker 3:          00:09:31       Yeah, you know, in fact, very early on in my career, I started learning this notion of resilience and I, there's a story in there. When I was a young merchant at the gap, now you have to understand, I was at L'Oreal for three years. I was pretty sure, and I had no idea by the way, that when I went to L'Oreal, I was going to be a marketer. I studied literature. So I'll at least in the room, maybe some out there. Hi, you always. But I, um, I studied film as a literary form. So as looking at imagery and trying to understand the emotion that's created with image, and it was, I'd never thought about that might be career marketing, but how logical is that really amazing at L'Oreal, which is such a visual marketer. Exactly. And so I fell in, in, in really in the right place.

Speaker 3:          00:10:21       But I'd come from this three years and I had, I gone on the road they sent, L'Oreal has this great program where they sent me actually to the north of France, which is the industrial part of France. I mean, all my friends were going to, you know, that could, that could desi on I'm, and I'm in the north of France with the coal mines. Um, and they, and they actually asked you to sell L'Oreal products out of a suitcase and you're trapped. You're basically traveling salesmen to hypermarkets hypermarkets or three times the size of your local supermarket. I mean, at least, and I would meet with these guys and there's a story in there. I met with one guy and he buys, you know, he bought ps, he bought sanitary concerns and he bought hair gel. Now you can imagine, and hair. And I was selling Moose that day and you know, his hair's all slicked back.

Speaker 3:          00:11:08       And I'm thinking, maybe I should change my marketing. I've got the marketing speak and I'm giving my sales pitch. And he's like, finally, he said, no, no, no, no. Look, let's, let's talk about the UNCAP. How about, you know, how much will you give? And we started going back and forth and I realized that I actually had to step in his shoes to understand. But all that to say, I came out of L'Oreal. Sure. I was a marketer actually. Sure. And I got to the gap and it turned out they actually had advertising at that point, not marketing. So they had said, you know, you're going to be a merchant. And I thought this is great. I mean, I like looking at beautiful products and selecting them. My interview with the CEO, then Mickey Drexler had gone really well. I picked out some bags. I'm like, oh, I can accent.

Speaker 3:          00:11:48       Well, not so fast. I found myself pretty much in a sample closet the first several months trying to sort through all the very, you know, the disarray of different products that hadn't been organized in several years. And then I had to learn this thing called the open to buy, which was a, it's a tool that manager inventory. And um, I had a difficult boss and he one day said to me, you know, I had lost again, lost. I had not knowing where some Paisley bags were. And he got very angry at me and told me he wasn't going to teach me the open to buy, that I had to learn on my own. I, you know, and this is, I'm a young person and I'm also the sole breadwinner, so he had yelled at me to such a degree that I found myself crying, calling my mom, this is what you do when, right.

Speaker 3:          00:12:34       Call Mom. So My, you know, my mom had at that point said to me, and you're talking about resilience. She said, well honey, I hate to see you working so hard. I was working 12 hour days. I didn't understand this thing called the open to buy. I never been a merchant. I realized that it was way harder than anybody had told me in the beginning or that I at least had surmised. And so she said, why don't you do something else? I said, but I want to be close to creativity. And by the way, no Google at that time, this was back in 1989 if I had known I might've come here. No, I love, I love the gap so much, but I was so wanting to be close to that creativity. I sit and I was watching the old, the older, you know, the, the levels above me and what they were getting to do and are working with design teams and picking these beautiful close up for the store. So I stuck in there and I said, mom, I'm going to stick it out. And I think it was a very early lesson in resilience, the resilience, which is basically for me about when you care so deeply about something and you're kind of willing to tough out some of those moments that aren't as easy. And I care deeply about being close to creative. I love that story.

Speaker 2:          00:13:40       Uh, but because there is something in your twenties where you prompt this sense of who you want to be professionally, you really do have to learn your stuff your way into it, Tony. And, uh, the ability to be patient with yourself, uh, and learn the tools of the trade. I think those are important lessons because I often say too many Googlers who are by and large, a very high capability, ambitious group. You're going to be working for probably 30 years. This is a marathon and enjoy this journey. So you had quite a journey through, okay. Marketing, merchandising, and then what I would call leadership. Yeah. Yeah. You were, you were senior of the gap when you left work.

Speaker 3:          00:14:27       No, no, no, no. I was, I was president of Banana Republic. That's it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:31       All right, so now Republican and then to be selected or a Chanel, maybe you have an unusual profile. You're bilingual, right? You had worked in Krantz earlier, but that is a leadership daunting leadership. Remember we talked sometimes at Google about imposter syndrome. When you show up somewhere, if all of a sudden you realize,

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       wow, everyone else is really knowledgeable. How did it feel walking into the story of house of Chanel and taking up your, well, first of all, it was incredibly, incredibly exhilarating and intimidating and I remember standing in Gabrielle Chanel's apartment, it's beautiful. Crystal Chandelier and I talked about this in booking, gazing up and then going to these fashion shows in the 17th century convent. Cool. And, and the, and and you know, the beautiful detailed, intricate couture. I had never seen anything like this. And then here's a, here's a brand that has a hundred year, almost a hundred here. Your history and gap is that was created in 1969 and so I didn't I that the richness of that and how do you take that forward into this very different future was going to be, I knew one of my biggest challenges, but as the story go, who is, when I started in CEO, so this is after three years of training, by the way, three years of training.

Speaker 3:          00:15:56       So I've taught, you talked about patients, I think I learned to cultivate patients, but the first year they had sent me to France to just listen and learn, put a tape on my mouth. I said, basically we launch in France and then around the world, we want you to meet everybody in anybody you can. I went into every single department from creative to the factories to, you know, finance visited with all the teams and all I could do is ask questions, which you said you're not allowed to make a decision for a full year. So that was humbling, very humbling. And after about nine months I was going, I want to do something. And you know, you're seeing these things that you think you can do, but this house has such a beautiful storied history that you really do have to learn the ropes first. But when I came finally to become, when I probably became CEO in 2007 that was equally a hurdle because I actually found myself at the table at the head of a table of 10 men and all of them were in their beautiful suits and cc logo ties.

Speaker 3:          00:16:53       Now I knew them because I'd been there, but all of a sudden I was at the head and I was 43 years old. I'm American then most of them are French. Most of them were a decade, if not two, my senior. And they all had, not three years but about 20 years of luxury experience. So that was the beginning of actually tapping into a different kind of leadership that I, you know, I had always thought about leadership is, you know, the idea of take charge, demand, respect, you know, be focused, be strategic, have a vision and that wasn't going to work. I wasn't going to work because they had such deep history, such such deep knowledge that I had to figure out how I was going to integrate the things I was seeing. And certainly the digital world that was coming out that, you know, really 2007 was the beginning of the major digital revolution.

Speaker 3:          00:17:42       And I had to figure that out. So I realized that it was going to be through asking questions through actually sitting on their side of the table, not trying to push my agenda and actually being vulnerable saying, you know, guys, I don't know this help. It was it collaborating with them, you know, mixing ideas and actually opening questions to everybody so that we could actually co create a future. And that was that, that knowledge of that moment. This is getting long. I'm sorry, but I'll be good. So that, that was a PR, that's a personal story. But it taught me something really deep about leadership because what I realized during that moment, now this is three major things were happening in our world. The digital revolution for you guys is incredible. Now imagine yourself a luxury company where it's all about exclusivity. It's not more is more.

Speaker 3:          00:18:35       It's not about pushing sales are getting more exposure. It's actually about making your products rare and beautiful and connecting to that customer. Not In en masse, but one on one. So the digital revolution actually scared us. So we had that as a great unknown. And how are we going to be relevant in this revolution if we are about rarity and exclusivity. So that was the first thing. The second thing was, um, the globalization. We had been, we had been global, but we hit the, when the Chai China began to gain so much. Well, we had clients all over the world flooding our boutiques from China and that was hard. We didn't know the culture that well, but also we didn't know how to still serve our loyal clients when the boutiques were brimming. So challenge two, challenge three and I'm looking, yeah, I did all of you and probably some of you there, this generation that everybody's so fondly called millennials for a luxury brand.

Speaker 3:          00:19:34       You know, and it's, it's a patriarchal company. It is based on a lot of history and you have people who are born with devices in their hands and who have a very different perspective about what makes up a luxury company, not to mention mention different values about ethics and social behavior. So as I'm sitting at this table, and you know, this happened over a period of a few years, I realized that what I learned when I came into the unknown and uncertainty about how I should behave as a leader was something that the leaders in our company would greatly benefit from. And that we as a company, in order to step into this, you know, new age would actually have to adopt new leadership behaviors and shift a culture. Were you explicit about those leadership behaviors with your direct team? Yes. And I'll tell a funny story about that.

Speaker 3:          00:20:28       Um, so I had a coach and I had begun to realize that these were things that were starting to help me. So when I could sit at the other side of the table with my team, when I could actually engage in questioning and curiosity, not only did our relationship got better, but more ideas are starting to spawn. So I said, great, I got it down. I know what qualities I am going to teach these guys what to do. And this point, by the way, it added some women to the team. So we were, now I had added six women actually. So I, it was a rainy day in July. July is not a good month. I couldn't control the rain. But July is not a good month in France because it's a month before people go on vacation and people leave for months about. So very busy people are stressed out.

Speaker 3:          00:21:17       Um, and I corral my team into a dusty ballroom and I, the ballroom was 10 times the size of this room. And there were 20 of us so you can imagine what that felt like. And then I had them play those team building games, which sometimes are good, but when you're in a group of Europeans and when you know you're actually forcing them to be out in the rain because we did them out of the rain. I don't know what I was thinking. That doesn't go over so out. And then I got up in my band, Stan and I started to say, listen, we need new leadership qualities. We need to change our culture. We need to be more empathetic. We can to be more flexible. We mainly have more collaborative. You can imagine. Okay, so Ooh is right. Biggest face plant of my entire career.

Speaker 3:          00:21:57       How they revolt immediately? Well, so pretty much pretty much. I had also brought in some consultants from California and that just wasn't the right mix. They felt like, I mean, you know, they can smell it doesn't rain here. So to say they felt like I wasn't taking into account their perspective, their point of view. There are great history and all the things that had made them great up until this point. So I had one of those moments where, you know, your biggest errors are usually your greatest learnings. And um, August came, took some time off. I had, I had organized an offsite with a great, wonderful poet and speaker named David White and that we had to cancel at the last minute. I cancelled it. I canceled it because I thought, what am I doing? I didn't actually listen to it for heed, my own advice. Um, I actually need to let go of my preconceived ideas and collaborate with them on how they see the future.

Speaker 3:          00:22:54       So while my ideas around leadership might be valid, I'm not going about this the right way at all. So I sat down with each team member for over two hours, one by one. I just tell me how you see the culture. Tell me what you hope to improve. Tell me what you hope to retain. What about you? Where are you struggling? Um, what are you ambitions? What's your purpose? What do you, when you care about and how can you contribute to what we're going to cocreate. So I gathered all that 20 hours of, of um, interviews into some themes and we met again and this time they were completely engaged and we co created something we later called active and conscious leadership journey. Oh, so listening was cute. And acknowledging their expertise, respecting their history and their legacy. So the active leadership, active and conscious leadership journey journey.

Speaker 3:          00:23:50       Can you tell us a little bit about that with pleasure? Um, so I, one of the things I also realized is in any company there's a very specific culture. And while I respect lots of consultants, I knew that actually in this culture for this company, it was going to be more about really creating something very, very specific for them. It's tailor made and that takes into consideration not just the culture of the company, but the business issues that we have. Right? I mean it's, it, that's what we're ultimately you will, you want to create an environment or good business can flourish and, and employees are happy. So, um, I just said, we're going to design this. I had a coach, we decided that we would, we would design it together and it started with having outside speakers just like today. Only the difference perhaps in this situation was we would take an outside speaker and ask them to work with us on our questions.

Speaker 3:          00:24:46       And so that we would have a session of speaking and then we'd go into some of the things that were going on for us. So the first speaker was a wonderful poet by the name of David White. And everybody thought it was crazy at first, but I'll, if you want to hear that story, we can come back to that. We had, so Elworthy who was a peacebuilder and had worked with Desmond Tutu and taught us a lot about nonviolent communication and deep listening, we went. So the idea is you were going from inside out. So who am I as a leader? What do I care about? What triggers me? What gets me excited? Then who am I in with relation to my colleagues, my team, alumni with relationship to the business, into the world. And so the, it went from inside out, started with David White, went to Scilla and then we started actually with some business leaders like Clay Christiansen, we use Dan pink.

Speaker 3:          00:25:36       And so the idea was really try to understand how do you connect who you are as a human being, as an individual to your greater business purposes. And after, so this took a, and there was that component. We, each executive had a coach and this is in the, in the phase where we were just in 20 at 20 people. Um, and they, I asked them to work on, so anything they wanted, just one thing, she's one thing and I mentored them through that coaching. So it was a very rich program and it lasted for, I don't want, I don't actually don't like to call it a program. I like to call it the journey and the, yeah, because it's, it's, it's actually leadership doesn't start and stop. It's something that we do all the time and we're active and we're conscious and it hopefully so Atlanta and ended up a year long for this group and they were so enthusiastic because by the end of this time they were working in new ways together.

Speaker 3:          00:26:26       New ideas were coming about. Our business was on fire, on fire, and the brand reputation and never been better. So they wanted to roll it out. They ended up, and this is what was so amazing to me, I get chills thinking about it. They said we'll roll it out to the next 200 and so they took it to 200 people. Now we couldn't afford coaches for everybody, but there's a, there are a lot of ways of getting good feedback other than getting a coach that 200 Ben said, we love this. Can we roll it out to 400 and by the time I left, we were 600 strong. It's a really powerful program. And it did start to shift our culture. I mean that was, you know, meaning at the time with Google was one of the beginning things, you know, how do we get digital, how do we create relationships with external vendors, partners really how do we begin to create those so that we can be relevant in our, in, in our field.

Speaker 2:          00:27:17       You recall having visited the Googleplex here, not when you're with your team and when you went back to Paris and, or New York is when I first met you. You were, I think working between parents always. Yeah. Um, was there anything that shifted in your approach that was conscious that was sparked by something you experienced?

Speaker 3:          00:27:39       Yeah. You know, it was amazing. We, so I had, I did a, I chose actually I want to say 12 executives. I can't remember how many, there were none of them executives across levels to come here to Google. We might to, um, Facebook. We might, I mean we were really trying to get a good sense. Pinterest at the time. Yeah, it was, it was really, really small. It was like in one room, but it was really interesting. We were trying to figure out how do we, and we sat in a room and shortly after Google, we'd love the environment and Google. I mean, one of the things that we've picked up on was this, this notion of creativity in any domain at Google. And I don't know if that's something that you experienced, but it's what's what we experienced meeting with Googlers. It was like this freedom and ability to express and to be in a creative mind regardless of what kinds of jobs you are doing. And I Montessori I was inspired by that. Totally. I mean, and just the ideation, you know, we drove in the, in the driverless car and the kind of ideation and forward thinking that I think Google has was something I wanted to learn from. Because even though luxury companies, one of the components of being a luxury company at the highest end, his history, you can't ignore the future. And if you get stuck on history, then you've got a problem getting into the future and you ha that's a balance that you have to.

Speaker 2:          00:28:57       Um, actually France has that problem. I loved reds. I went to university for a year in Paris would there upward and increasingly I feel back there on business quite a bit, but it does feel a little stuck. I felt that before a little messy and like beautiful places.

Speaker 3:          00:29:13       French are extraordinary because they have exquisite taste. They understand beauty better than I think any culture. I mean Italians also doing, they have a different, I think a different way of expressing it, but the French in terms of food and wine and five minutes. Yup. And you don't, I and I feel like that is a gift for any culture. It's a gift to the world. And if you know, just not unlike luxury brand like Chanel, if there was a way that we could all benefit from that gift and make it contemporary enough so that we can connect to it, I think it'd be beautiful. I mean, one of the things that I'm seeing with luxury companies today and something I've been watching quite carefully is this notion of purpose. And our Google has a great purpose and I can feel it and luxury companies, some of them do and some of them are still developing that.

Speaker 3:          00:30:04       And purpose to me isn't just about adapting a cause. It's when the cause and who you are connected yeah. Is Intrinsic. So I think about Tesla for example, now that, and then you look at their luxury, they've made a luxury car and they, their sales have been better on their top model then BMW, I think, and, and Mercedes. Um, but what's so interesting to me about Tesla is you have all the fittings have a luxury car because it's a beautifully appointed. Um, Eh, it's a technological innovation and yet it's for you feel good about driving it because you're not putting more carbon or Max at, into, into the environment. And it just, there's something about that to me that feels really relevant in luxury brands today, is how do you figure out how to connect to today's consumers? Connect to what we care about in the world will still having a luxury offer in a world of seven and a half billion people, most of whom they could ever afford something, which now would be a lipstick.

Speaker 3:          00:31:07       And that would be an indulgence. Um, that's a, that's a call. That's a tall order for a brand like Chanel and, and to make it accessible yet still retain its luxury. Indeed. But if you look at, you know, what a great brand to do that, and you have a story, a true story, a legendary story about a woman who was an orphan. She was a complete orphan. It's a rag to riches story. She became a cortisone. And then she finally started her own tour business and became all the rage and the top couturier in all of Paris. And besides, she changed the way women could dress. She liberated us from corsets and long dresses. So that is, is for me that's a contemporary story that, you know, the iconic clastic perspective, the subversion, she took men's wear fabrics. No one had heard of doing this into women's design.

Speaker 3:          00:32:01       So you know, when you have as richest revolutionary, that's fair and you think about it for women today. And I, you know, I think about it for an and, and I think there are other companies, I, they're companies that are doing amazing things, but it's, I think it's slower for luxury companies because sometimes, um, the concerns have been much more around that, just that impeccably beautiful product and service rather than thinking about, so consumers have today, they're not just in this transactional mode anymore. They don't just want the label, they want to go beyond the label. Something about authenticity that's really popping in, uh, in, in New York culture. But I think you see it popping up in retail around the world. Love you to free associate. You worries the Tesla. Obviously Chanel great brand. We talked a little bit about rag and bone, but the brands that really stand out for you, that resonate with me right now.

Speaker 3:          00:32:55       I love Rei. I just think it is amazing opt out on black Friday. It's not just a marketing move and you know that because they care about being outside and, and you know what I think, and I think about luxury this, this may sound crazy, but what does luxury today, it's time, right? Both said that at the same time it's getting outdoors, you know, because that's rare in rare it's connecting with friends and with oneself. So I love Rei for the way that it taps into the outdoors and what it means. I actually think Nike's doing a really good job, big company, but you know, equality has no boundaries. That is, to me, I, that made me want to run out and buy Nike. So I, they're connecting to something I care about and they're still making great innovative products do you can't forget, for me, the product is still the, you know, you've got to have a great product.

Speaker 3:          00:33:48       It's, it starts with the product, but you also have to today off of more than that. And I think those are the two examples. Just, you know, that I've been kind of following a bit. I was looking at, um, does anyone reformation? Does anybody because they want to know that, that yeah, it's a, it's an online clothing brand that's really going after ethical sourcing, ethical products and things that don't, that don't rob our environment of natural resources. And I think it's an interesting concept. I don't know what, you know, where it will go, but I, I'm hopeful that we can get more of that kind of attitude and environment into fashion. Did you, for how long did you know you had a book inside of you? Because that's a brave thing to do. It's time consuming, very extremely personal and intimate and you share it, you're vulnerable.

Speaker 3:          00:34:38       You don't know what the reaction of the press will be. Els, fair haired CEO, everyone knew. And now you're an author with a completely new orientation towards your professional life. Uh, which is still a journey. Absolutely. Where are you itching to do this for a while? I never considered not, it's funny cause I, any of my jobs I've never considered before. I kinda got at the doorstep of them that that's what I wanted or could do. So with writing, I was a literature major, sounds kind of logical. And I, I've read, I love reading, I love stories, especially fiction. And so what happened is when, when we did the active and conscious leadership journey, I wanted to share it. I really wanted to share it. And I started with an article, could not get the article down to a reasonable size. And I met an independent editor who said, listen, you know, had asked me, was a great asker and was pulling ideas out of me and I thought, and she said, why don't you write a book?

Speaker 3:          00:35:42       And at first I was like, oh, I can't write a book. And I realized that actually I had a lot of things that I had learned and stories that I wanted to share to provoke questions. I ask questions in the book, um, observations so that I could help other people create their own paths to success. And when you read the book, you'll see it's not a set of rules or dictates or how to, um, I don't give a lot of instructions because I feel like everybody has his or her own journey. But this is really about reading, opening somebody, somebody else's journey up, asking yourself some questions, looking in the mirror and, and, and, you know, using some of those observations for your own, for your lives and for your own careers. You're clearly a courageous person. You were a teenager, decided to study abroad in France one summer, fell in love with goat cheese, left me more about that.

Speaker 3:          00:36:34       And that somewhat set you on a trajectory that has you here today. I mean, did you consciously know that you're a bit of an adventure? You know, I, I don't, I don't think I thought of it as adventure. I fell in love with friends. I think I'm very curious. I'm exceedingly curious, but I fell in love with the notion of France because my father spoke really fluent French. He learned without a textbook. And believe it or not, I think that was so interesting and so effective. He split it with beautiful accent. So I was, I looked up to my dad, I wanted to speak French. I came, I had a great French teacher and I decided, I got it in my head one year. I said to my parents, [inaudible] shoes, I said to my parents, I must live in France. I must go be with a family cause I have to have this language, this language.

Speaker 3:          00:37:23       I want to learn it too, except that nobody can, nobody can tell I'm an American. And the only way you can do that I think is really other than my dad's schooling, which they weren't doing in my school, is go immerse yourself in the culture. And so I landed in the south of France, which was incredibly lucky. And I, I stayed for a month with a family and my father was a gal, has east. So he was a mechanic and I got to work at the gas station. And every morning the table was set with fresh wild flowers and the light would glow on the limestone and I would smell the lavender. And my senses just broke open. It was almost like I didn't know that I cared so much about these things, but the beauty, the sheer beauty and their appreciation of it way, they take it in the lecture hall, which you know, which is the hour that you had the drink at night.

Speaker 3:          00:38:13       Everybody sits in the, you know, they pour the pest east and calm and it's a moment to be together and it's a moment to take in the surroundings. And I found that absolutely just refreshing. Fascinating at the time in France. And I had, um, also later gone back as a college junior, I found a roommate and she, and you'll read about this and book and she was very liberated about her sexuality and about her body. And I thought, that's cool. Cause I grew up, I grew up in the Midwest and you know, it was, I, women really weren't supposed to be sexual beings. Well I didn't, I did not feel that way. I felt like, you know, I'm, I was supposed to be very, very careful with who I was and you know, kind of buttoned up. And so this liberation really appealed to me. I love that story. I'm going to invite now. We have questions on the dory. I can keep talking and I have plenty I could ask Maureen, but there are a lot of people in the room there. Mike's and there are dory questions. So I don't want to, um, completely dominate the Q and a, uh, anyone in the room. So motivated. We're going to have to get you a Mike. You can take mine for a second.

Speaker 4:          00:39:22       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:39:22       Hi Maureen. Hi. So you mentioned, um, we'll luxury means tool, uh, everybody in today's society a little bit tired and being outdoors. So I'm also from Saint Louis and I did a little Wikipedia research earlier. So fraud. You grew up in San Louis? Uh, Clayton. Oh cool. Yup. Great for, I know you went to John's morose. I did go to town. No secrets, no CRM. We, it's like we know we can speak each other's language. Um, so I'm curious from John's were rose in St Louis to leading one of the most coveted fashion houses in the world. How has your personal interpretation of luxury evolved over time? That's really interesting. You know, I think I always loved luxury, but I wouldn't have called it luxury. I was, I just, once I had that experience in France, I realized that I love beautiful things and just the, the make the way they feel, things that smell good.

Speaker 3:          00:40:14       Um, great, great food things on the pallet things. It's, I love music. And so I think the initial thing that drew me was beauty and not this notion of luxury by the way. I find beauty in things that aren't expensive. A lot of beauty. And in fact, one of my early experiences at L'oreal was I was driving in coal mining country and it was a foggy industrial area. Um, and I rolled down my window and I noticed this purple mountain of coal debris and it was glistening and sort of the early morning hazy song. I thought, that's so beautiful. There's a beauty in that, even though in a way it represents something that's about hardship and about, you know, difficult living conditions. But that was the beauty. The beauty wasn't the perfect aesthetic. The beauty was actually the story at toll. So that was my initial, I don't know that I've changed that much on that, by the way, just cause to me luxury and I think recently now I'm realizing that luxury is so much more than objects. It really is this notion of being able to have time, being able to have space outdoors and with the people who you love. To me, that's what I think where I've evolved to, but in the beginning, and I think it's still in me, that notion of beauty is imperfection, not perfection. Yep, exactly. And it's, and it's in the story. It's in the story that there is beauty and it doesn't have to be, you know, this kind of aesthetic plastic thing.

Speaker 4:          00:41:44       Thanks for asking.

Speaker 3:          00:41:47       I am also from Saint Louis. Not just kidding. Wow. I was going to be like, you go St Louis. I'm from Paris and by the way, I love friends as described by American. It sounds amazing. So I want you to ask to you, I've been CEO of Chanel from a long time. What keeps you motivated and how did you reinvent yourself? Or this is yours to keep being a great visionary CEO? Oh, that's a great question. Thank you. I think interestingly enough, it was pretty easy from about 2007 odd because of what was happening in the world and the, and our business was exploding. So I was being motivated just by trying to actually keep this historical brand, this incredible, incredibly beautiful house moving into the future without compromising or sacrificing the things that made it so special. And it kept me motivated because everyday there was a new, you know, we, we'd wake up one morning and there was yet another social media platform to think, to consider, or we'd have to, we'd have a new fashion.

Speaker 3:          00:42:51       What's great is you always have new collection. So there's a new collection to figure out how to, to communicate to your customers, how to sell to your customers and how to create desire all the time. So for me that, that actually wasn't difficult. What towards the end of, I guess the last three years when I was doing active and conscious leadership, I was actually discovering beauty and people. And so what was really keeping me motivated was, was watching this team and this big team and getting, I mean hundreds of letters from people who said that this work had changed their lives. That was really, really motivating to me. It's like how do you in a company get people to tap into what they love best, where they can bring value and how they connect that to the purpose of the brand. And when you do that, and you guys know because is such a great place, when you do that, you get incredible workout people and they're happy. So that kept me really motivated.

Speaker 4:          00:43:44       Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:43:49       Hi Matt. Hi Maureen. Thank you so much for coming, uh, for having me. Well, I'm originally from India, but I'm California for awhile. Um, so I had a question around the inflection points in your career. Could you speak a little bit about like what brought you to your next opportunity from L'Oreal to grab to Janelle are so different. Great question. So, um, I moved to the L'oreal story is that after three years I was there and I loved it there. I was learning all about marketing by the way. I did not go to business school. So there were, you know, there's all these, I had to learn all the techniques, techniques or technical terms, what marketing really was, um, ups and market segmentation. And everybody around me had gone to business school, so I had a lot of catching up to do. Um, but I realized that my one, my one gift that I had is I could see image and I can understand what emotion was created.

Speaker 3:          00:44:47       The thing is, is after three years, I didn't see a lot of women at the top then, and it's changed so much. I mean, I was now one of the best companies for that, but back then it wasn't, and in the meantime, my husband had an offer to go to Indonesia and I didn't want, I didn't see myself there. And so we decided to pick up and come to San Francisco. So this is the funny influction point about getting into retail. I would have never, if you had asked me even lit, leaving L'Oreal, can you see yourself in fashion or retail? I would say absolutely not. I'm a marketer. So I come to San Francisco now, this is not so smart. We didn't have jobs and we had about, I don't know, maybe a month to have savings. So that was it. And it was sort of like you got to get a job.

Speaker 3:          00:45:27       So I started interviewing, this is, um, I guess in 1989 I started interviewing and I realized that I am at this point, I have the label in my own head of what I am. I have an expectation, it's called marketers, you know, fixed on my head. So I go to the two packaged goods companies, biggest in the bay area at the time, Clorox and del Monte. Okay. Demonte doesn't call me back. I mean they don't, I don't even get my foot in the door. I get one interview Clorox and like, you don't have an Mba, what are you doing here? But also I realized, wait a minute, I don't think I want to be on photo shoots for toilet bowls like this. I don't, this isn't, I mean I love, you know, I respect them, but the, I don't think this is right for me. And so I'm walking down market street and you ask about reflection point and I see this poster of Miles Davis, Miles Davis, jazz, great.

Speaker 3:          00:46:13       And his head is in his hands. He's got this soulful look and he's wearing a black tee shirt that says gap Michael. I'm like, I want a market that, well, the story goes snail mail at this time. I send my resume a week later, whatever it was, I got a call from the recruiter and I said, so you know, he said, when you want to do her, so I want to market the gap. You said you're a merchant. I said, I'm a what? What would it mean? What is a merchant do that don't want to sell stuff? Like I'm not a good salesperson. I had learned that myself and the north of France, I'm not going to get, I don't think I should do that anymore. So he said, no, no, no. A merchant works with design teams will make they help to create the products. And the assortments and figure out how much to buy and where to source them.

Speaker 3:          00:46:51       So that was the info. But the inflection point, if I think about it, I mean to two things. One was being in a company where I wasn't sure I could progress and wasn't sure that I had the means to do what I really thought I want to do it or at least grow. Um, and then the second thing was seeing that poster and saying, you know, is that, so that was one transition. And then I guess the second inflection point was getting that call from a headhunter while I was at old navy. I'm, I'm still selling $5 to use out of the back of a truck and they say a French luxury companies interested. Now at this point in my life I was missing France. We were living on the west coast. Um, we've been here for 15 years. And just the notion of working in a French leisure, coming, getting back to sort of my, my, it was a dream.

Speaker 3:          00:47:37       It was, it was absolutely dream. And so, and then I learned about Chanel story, who she was as a person and I thought this is, this is new for me, this is going to be the next challenge. So it, you know, again, and I never imagined that I would be doing that, I think ever in my life. But it just sort of being open and opportunistic in a sense. And I'm seeing those things and hearing those things. I mean, of course I got that wonderful call, but you know, it's funny, I'll tell you the funniest story about that. This is gap. Let's see, what was it about 2001 when I got the call was the center of the universe. Back then Chenelle was small and I thought it was a brand for, you know, older women. Like I didn't know that Chanel could be young and hip because it wasn't so young and hip done.

Speaker 3:          00:48:27       So for me it was actually a huge, it sounds crazy, but a huge risk. I had moved my entire family, my kids were 11 and eight, so I moved him from, you know, their cozy little noe valley slash Tiburon existence to new, to first to Paris for a year and then to New York. So it was actually religious risk. And I didn't think, you know, I didn't at the time I, you know, I didn't, I wasn't sure, but I ended up thinking, you know what, there's something about this, this feels right. Trust your instincts. Long story, sorry. But we're storytelling here today and thank you for coming. Um, and my questions, but were there key mentors that you had along your journey and what kind of pivotal role did they play for you and then to then inspire you to, to mentor others? I uh, I have, I have mentored so many people and it's one of my favorite, favorite things.

Speaker 3:          00:49:23       Um, I have a lot of really amazing mentors at both at gap, um, and even at Chanel. But one I think about mentors cause it's kind of a hot topic. We talk about it a lot and we talked, especially amongst the women mentors. And I think that's amazing. But I would encourage all of you to think broadly about the mentor because I learned as much in so many ways from my friend in France flu in the book. Um, who is, who taught me about, you know, being comfortable as a woman, being comfortable in your own body. I would say I would learn in so many ways as much from her as I have some of my greatest mentors, like Jenny Ming who was running old navy and Mickey Drexler who is the CEO of gap. So at mentoring doesn't have to be a hierarchical thing. I think it's really about getting somebody with whom you can share conversations, stories you can ask questions.

Speaker 3:          00:50:14       I made a lot of mentors will mentees I guess is how we turn that have asked me to, so what do I, what do I do about that? And I never answer. Instead, what would I do is I ask them more questions about what they care about. You know, where they want to go with this. And what ends up happening is they find answers that are better than any answer that I could give. And so I would, for me, that means that mentors can breed a broad range of people and it doesn't have to be somebody who is really impressive or higher up reading in your book you're talking about just a fall on them is getting comfortable in your own body. You talk about spending a long time in your career operating in a masculine frame. Uh, when did you realize that wasn't working for you or did it work for you for a while and you just decided to go beyond that label?

Speaker 3:          00:51:02       Um, you know, it's interesting. I never thought of it. I've never really thought of it when I was at gap, first of all, because I think we were such drivers and business and while leadership and management was incredibly important, gap was progressive in this. The one thing that cap had done for me, I'd given, they'd give me a coach. I'd already been working on my own leadership capabilities and, and learning even more how to listen. I have a funny story in there about the launch when making Drexler, um, it taught me how to listen. It was very tough story. Um, and another one of those embarrassing moments. But, um, so I was aware of this in myself, but I wasn't so aware that it would, it would be the those feminine qualities people by the way, I didn't, I didn't label them feminine qualities. Sociologists and researchers are now saying these are feminine qualities but can be found in men and women in fact, and happened to be intrinsic to women, but they, they're both men and women share these qualities.

Speaker 3:          00:51:58       So once I started, I didn't, I didn't notice that or I didn't think about it that way. I would say when I was at the gap, um, once I got to Chanel, as I realized that I had to shift from the drive out of the strategy and vision and focus and all the things that had made me really successful, that I had to actually use those other things that I was, I was also aware of and working on. But those things would become more important or not more important. I get those things at least had to be integrated and I think that's the one thing I think about sort of this masculine feminine thing that a lot of people are talking about. I don't love the labels. I really, I really don't. Um, and I think you know, there, there's, there's different people have different qualities, but what I see is that great leaders actually combine so they know when to be firm. They know when to be strategic and focused and determined and they know when to listen and to be empathetic so that they're the balance of great leaders is what I'm really intrigued by me. If you watch great meters, you can, you can really, really see that they are, they are toggling quite a bit in different, in all different ways I should say. Multidimensionally

Speaker 5:          00:53:07       Maureen, thank you so much for sharing your story. Thank you. [inaudible] an incredible career. And if you were to look back and talk to your young self as you were just starting out in your career, what's the one piece of advice you would give yourself?

Speaker 3:          00:53:22       Well, I'll tell you and because people told me this, I look back and I think about this a lot too. Two things. One is I was so serious and I was so, you know, I was really a serious, I took everything to heart all the time and I had, and I still have it, I'm working at, it's work in progress, but so my young self and my own self share this, I have, I have, I have, uh, I have a big self critic and I think I would have actually just tried to quiet the critic a little bit and I'm a times that I was really beating myself up a lot on the other thing, and we haven't talked about this much here today, but in life as those things were talking about, I have two kids and I was traveling, I mean a lot, every, every three weeks.

Speaker 3:          00:54:05       Just about, since I was a gap and I raised both the girls and on Sean was there as the staff, the staff on Dad, which was at that time, if the gap and the gap, it wasn't so unusual. But at, you know, I'll try the gap. It was, and we took a lot of flack and it was really, there's a painful story in there about this, but I would've loved to have some conversations with my kids about what that was like for them and what that was like for me. And I think I was so grateful to Antoine that he was home and that he was taking care of them, that I thought everything's fine, but you know, in fact, and you'll read in a book, there's a story that everything wasn't that time. And um, the, these are hard things to grapple with and you're in a wonderful environment here where you have flex, flexible working schedules, but um, I do think it's, it's, things aren't perfect in this thing called perfect work life balance.

Speaker 3:          00:54:55       It's another label that's another label that I feel I feel really uncovered. It makes us feel, I think it, it disappoints us automatically. You set yourself up for disappointment and fulfilling guilty as a mother or a father, by the way. Yeah, I call it managed disequilibrium and sometimes work. I like that sometimes family wins. And as an individual, you have to make sure you win every so often because otherwise no one actually wins. But, um, knowing that it's never a PR imperfect balance, it's liberating. Yeah, exactly. Well, yeah, you, you, you live with that. The sadness let me cry. I cried on planes to Hong Kong. I remember just leaving those little kids and I didn't want to leave, you know, lonely hotel rooms at night and it, but you also know where you show up and where you show up to me. And for what for me was, you know, I had two girls. It was the emotional ways of crying and mommy shoulder and you know, hugs at night and just when I could, when I could support them emotionally and then schoolwork because Antoine is French. So he didn't know the American school system part as well. Um, and trying to really, really be present in those moments when you are there. Um, I think is so, so, so important. But I, it's not the, not the extent that you get exhausted yourself because when you're not present. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:56:12       Um, so the first question is, can you share some practical advice on cultivating sponsors and champions in your organization? Practical advice and cultivating sponsors and champions in the, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       I think that that's a great point are great question. For me. Again, it was about, and I think about my own personal experience because by the way, I wasn't, I didn't necessarily have a Chanel that many sponsors other than the owners at the time because everybody, nobody knew me. And while they wanted to like me, my experience didn't fit the exact profile of what they, you know, what they thought she should probably meet the company. So it really was about listening and about being on their side of the table. And to get the Digi actually get champions means that it's, for me, it's a, it's a two way street. It's not about convincing someone. Um, it's not about telling someone what to do. It's actually about living in their world and with, with them and what they do. And then you coach champion something.

Speaker 4:          00:57:16       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:57:17       Did Mr Lagerfeld participate in the active and conscious leader? You know, isn't true. No. Isn't a no. Um, no, I, I have been an oh, well I'll, I'll answer that and I'll get you, I've been such a huge admirer of creativity. I think when you think of creativity, the word you think of Karl Lagerfeld, you know, in the fashion industry. Anyway, so what I, and I've worked with amazing, amazing creative people at gap and Banana Republic, old navy and at L'Oreal. In fact, my early, early experiences were at L'Oreal. What I noticed is working with someone, creative means giving them the space, the resources to do what they do best. And that, you know, to me that was what was really important.

Speaker 3:          00:58:01       Hi. Um, it seems on your crave held a lot of different titles and part of what your success was was not holding herself, redefining, defining yourself to a certain label. Um, but I was also wondering, I think for a lot of people in their career journey, they have to sort of eventually find somewhere where they specialize in or where like the, like that's an area that they own. So I'm wondering like how that journey was for you and kind of figuring out like what you specialize in or what skill sets you bring to the table and then how that evolved over time. That, that's a great question. I appreciate it. Um, you know, I actually think there, I mean, I always say the three, the three groups of questions you asked, you know, what do I love so much that I can't live without, you know, beyond the label and beyond the roles and beyond the definitions, what is, what makes my heart sing?

Speaker 3:          00:58:45       We're, can I bring value? You know, what is, what is my greatest gift where, you know, where can I cut and, and how do I connect those two things where I bring value on what I love and then what, you know, sort of answer your question, what context am I, am I in? You know what, sometimes you have to take jobs that you don't like for a while, but I found that always staying really close to what I cared about was something. And I learned it early on. And L'Oreal, there's a story in the book about this. But, um, so here I had not been to business school and I was in marketing and I, and everybody else had. So I didn't have that advantage and I had to figure out what it was that, you know, what was my path to your point, what was it that I really, really wanted to do and what, what was my mark?

Speaker 3:          00:59:26       And it ended up, I, we, I got invited into some advertising meetings and the art director and an advertising agency, I just, I felt a connection with what he was trying to do and we had this big oval tables and I would find myself like kind of scooching over to the, to the advertising agents side, you know, you're supposed to, if it's client agent back in those days. And I, I found myself wanting so badly to see through his eyes and it turns out and we became friends. He's the one who taught me about jazz and we became friends and spent a lot of time and he spent a lot of time showing me how he sees buting, which was how I thought about beauty as kind of an imperfection because he was showing me models and they might've been plastically perfectly say, but she's, she's not giving something in the camp to the camera. Like he talked about it in such a cool terms. So I think, um, you know, from, from my perspective, it was really kind of tapping into that what it is I care so much about and how can I bring value and in that environment, for me that was one case I can bring value because it was different from what most of what most everybody knew. Most everybody was doing more classic market. That's everybody. There were great. You know, you said it's a greatest that a company, but for me that was really what we'll counter

Speaker 2:          01:00:38       if we have time for perhaps one more question. Anyone in the audience? Sorry, the Dory. Oh, a gentlemen. I'd love it.

Speaker 6:          01:00:52       Thank you again, very much. Reading. Um, so you've worked both in Europe and here and t you were of course, a female in a fashion world with stereotypes about women and dominated by May, let you know, executives. Uh, what is your comment about the attitude that, uh, you're showing France visuals but was here and how this has changed over the year and what do you think are, I know there are a lot of, there is a lot of room for improvement, but some suggestions about how to improve the attitude to the women and getting to that state of really, you know, uh, equal, uh, no discrimination. Right? But the idea,

Speaker 3:          01:01:49       thanks for that question. Um, first I'll say, you know, it's interesting, I worked around the world, so not just in France, but all over Europe, all over Asia. And each culture is different and it's, you know, it's almost impossible to even kind of categorize them in terms of their views of women. It's interesting. We were just talking earlier because Eileen is on, uh, the L'Oreal board, um, French companies now actually have, they passed a law several years ago requiring boards have 40% women. So while they may seem like you know, more more bias in the workplace, I wouldn't say necessarily that that's the case, although there are fewer women in top leadership, there are also very few women in top leadership in this country. And we're talking about 4% CEOs that 4% of CEOS are women. That is not a lot. What I, my thoughts about this, uh, are, are kind of clear equity and pay is, you know, obvious work life arrangements that help both women and men as those are obvious.

Speaker 3:          01:02:49       I mean, we have to change these things. We can't, you know, I, I'm, I'm impressive. Google has flex time. It's amazing. But in my experience, if we don't also start to integrate these qualities of empathy and flexibility and collaborative collaborative skills and deep listening, if we don't start to integrate those many women, many women won't ever feel as comfortable or as confident or as natural actually being leaders. So I actually think that there's an attitudinal shift that we need to make to get more women competent in those roles. You know, past the ho I call it the hard stuff. Meaning the, the pay issues and the, and the work life arrangements. We need to expand our frame of leadership. We need to look at leadership differently and consider that there are other qualities both required for the world but also that are intrinsic to women and make women actually really good leaders.

Speaker 3:          01:03:45       And the good news about this is by the way, and there's research done about the oddness that women leaders where women are leaders and where there are boards, those entities perform better. So, so you know, this, this is a win win for everybody. Well that's a perfect statement in the, uh, talk on Maureen, we've had a lot of discussion at Google on these very issues, especially lately. There's been a lot in the, in the news around gender parity pay parodying the tech industry and we're very, very convicted about ensuring that you paid for the job you do not for the person, the bar, um, talent and tenure and performance in the role matters. But gender has no place in that equation. So thank you Maureen, you are active and conscious leadership journey with us. Thank you. See it is you're on the journey and there's a lot more interesting acts that we're going to read about or hear about. So best of luck to you. Thank you for spending.

Speaker 4:          01:04:48       Thanks everyone. Thanks. Do [inaudible].
