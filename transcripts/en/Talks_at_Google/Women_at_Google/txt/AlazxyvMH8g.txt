Speaker 1:          00:06          Now, I would love to welcome to the stage both Alfredo and Anita. Please join me in welcoming both. Just tell us a little bit about yourselves. Um, and [inaudible] let's start with you. Well, thank you for having us today. My name is [inaudible] bias and I am the program director of our advocacy and mediation program at Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights.

Speaker 2:          00:31          My name is Alfredo [inaudible]. I'm the executive director of [inaudible] Salon. Would you saw ng or human rights NGO that works in Venezuela and we assist, uh, pro bono, the big themes of repression in Minnesota.

Speaker 1:          00:45          Great. Thank you. Um, I forgot about through your work, um, through your Human Rights Organization for opener, you've helped over 10,000 people. Um, I had, I had outdated data. I, I thought it was 40,000. It's actually 10,000, which is incredible. So you've helped over 10,000 people. Can you tell us a little bit about your work as it pertains to the restrictions on freedom of expression?

Speaker 2:          01:09          Well, yes. We have assisted more than 10,000 people because we've been working since 2002 actually, uh, we started, um, oh, I started myself, uh, assist in the family of one guy. His name is Jesus, actually was Jesus an 18 years old, a boy who was killed. He was shot in his head. So at that time, I thought there was going to be, you know, my only case, I thought, okay, I'm not going to cease this guy because I'm, the family actually came to me. I can tell you the whole story is longer than that. But then after that, a second family came to me and the third one on the fourth one or whatever, and I actually thought it was going to end, uh, into southern too because, uh, I, I mean, I wasn't used to assist the big themes of a state repression. This guy was actually killed in a mass process.

Speaker 2:          02:03          Protests that happened in 2002. Um, well actually, repression increased a lot. And, um, so, uh, this moment we have assisted more than 10,000 people or where I'm talking about a big themes of a [inaudible] including people that are, he has been or be tried to taint, uh, um, they're also forced, disappeared. Basically. Uh, people have been killed. People that have been tortured, so on the number has increased a lot. How we help them, well, we have sees them legally, but it is legally many. You've talk about illegality in Venezuela over the judicial system is something that is not a uh, with, I mean it is very important for the world is very important and for us, but for the Goldman index actually controlled the actually absolutely everything to work as a lawyer is minimum of percentage of the work that you do. So actually we do campaigns.

Speaker 2:          03:06          We do, I mean, a lot of different things in order to increase the cost of repression, that's actually what we do more than assistant legally. Uh, all these big themes of repression. So, um, we, you know, hug, I will say the families and we, um, held that we won, uh, and the families or the friends or whatever, even looking for people that are being disappeared. So that's actually what we do. But there is a very important thing that we do. Uh, and I realized, uh, that, that, that was extremely important recently that we registered all detainees on victims of repression. And you can imagine, and then I realize that if we haven't eve not meaning if we were in there and Ray Easter and everything, nobody will know how many people have been detained or very important or where they are. And, uh, that's a very important thing that we are doing right now besides, you know, well, all things that we do with victims. And

Speaker 1:          04:12          can you talk a little bit about, um,

Speaker 2:          04:15          okay.

Speaker 1:          04:15          Basically how the organization has reacted in the, um, how assembly and creating awareness, um, due to technology. Um, how has your organization, um, in the context of Association in Assembly reacted in terms of restrictions on that as well?

Speaker 2:          04:39          Well, we were live in a country that everything's been controlled. Um, um, freedom of expression. I mean, it doesn't exist as the, as you know it here in the United States and in free countries. So we don't have like a new opportunity to go to the media and talk about what we do. Actually, that's something that happened until 2007, there was a very important thing that happened that they closed. The government clothes are very important to be channel. Uh, the name was our, our see TV and I'm telling you about it because that, that channel Lisa, I was able to go and, and denounced what was going on. And, um, all the situation of what's going on, um, are these moment is impossible. I mean, do you don't have a media that you go and talk about what is going on? And the media actually doesn't show what is going on.

Speaker 2:          05:39          Um, I mean, they, they, they doesn't show and somebody is detained or when somebody is killed or when somebody searchers something that we do, we do it by ourselves. So what we do, uh, in order to, you know, to continue working and showing people what is going on and to increase political cost where they use media for our social media is extremely important. Um, that's something that actually I didn't know too much about it. I started using social media and to southern nine, that was the first student I actually helped. He, he was the first student that was actually, are we trying to tame his name? Is Julio on? I remember just to tell you an anecdote about it. Um, he will listen. He will stick into the court and the, this guy who was at 21 years old at the time, maybe 20, he was very Thien, you know, very naive like, and, and, um, he was at the doors of the court and I took a picture of him, uh, you know, and it wasn't Twitter actually.

Speaker 2:          06:48          So I, I Polish it in Twitter. I didn't know too much about Twitter at the time. And, um, I used it and actually the picture, I mean, the whole old Venezuelans, it's just saw the picture and they were all, you know, reacting about this student. It was taken to prison and he was extremely important because, uh, after that a hunger strike started of the students, um, you know, claiming for the release of the sky and actually he was released in 22 days. And, um, so that was very important. After that we'll, I'm being using social media as, um, as the most, I will say is most this, the most important tool for increasing the cost of repression. Because it's not that you can, you can tell it, uh, to, to the world like easier because it's not that you have the media there too. I mean, the me story control, even they, they controlling the by themselves or because the government section put pressure on them or they've Cobram and just control the whole media because they have all state, you know, the public, uh, the, the channels or though the media that's being controlled by the government but the state.

Speaker 2:          08:04          But, so that's the way that we actually show people where it's going on on the world. So it is extremely important. I mean the way how we can, um, in some way work without, without having freedom of expression, you know, that the way, at least as you know, how you know, how it works. Yeah. And you briefly touched on it a little bit about your work with detainees and alerting the families. Can you talk a little bit about that, what that looked like before your work? What it looks like now? We work, I always say that we work in the darkness and solitude. So because when there is a mass protest and a lot of people are out there on the streets and protesting, at least you are, you know, with your family, your friends and all of that. And when we start working well, where, when people are arbitrary that taint after I did the protest and eh, and because of a cause of repression.

Speaker 2:          09:00          So, so we go what we do actually, people in Minnesota knows followup, they know for a panel and they know that we help people that are being arbitrary thing. But more than that, they know that they only way to know where their son or daughter or mother or father, Eh, ease, I mean was taken, is to call for up in us. So what we do, we have, we are more than four and volunteers right now. It's incredible. I mean, he's a very big organization now when these volunteers do is not just lawyers, lawyers, we are right now formed by more than 160 lawyers or around the country. But what the balloon juice do, the volunteers are the ones, I mean, I'm talking to volunteers on a student, a mother or whatever. I mean, even volunteers are, we're already big of repression in some polling. So they help for helping other victims.

Speaker 2:          09:54          Um, so they go, because when you're detained, technically in Venezuela, you are forced, disappeared. I mean your [inaudible] they're forced disappearances so why? Because you didn't know where you being taken. It's not that you call 800 government Bhavana soil and then you find out who, who, where, where your, your son is being detained or your daughter. So that's what we do actually. We work at night, uh, until the morning in order to know where these new know where, where the people that they need are. So the families are sold, the feminist called us and we tell the family go to the, to that place. So because we have found out that these guys send that place. So whenever we found out, for example, Pedro, he's in whatever place and how we find it out. Well because we talked to the, to the custodians there and you know, he's not like an official thing.

Speaker 2:          10:47          And so we do it like underground. So we talked to them, this, that, these guy here, whatever. So then when you find out that these guys there, because somebody tells you that he, these guys, they're, sometimes you find out that there are 10 others. So we start helping these people. So we tell the families on, we use Twitter basically or the social media to tell gay, these guy has been detained in this place. So the families called also in come to the place and they know where they are. So, and then you know, the whole process started. So they, some of them I've taken to the course room, they are not, but it's more important that because you have to provide food to these people because these people is not that you're being detained and you have food and water. I mean you don't have it.

Speaker 2:          11:31          Even food and water if you are not detained so that you can imagine in Venezuela. So you can imagine if, how if you are detained, I mean you have to provide water. So you have to bring water, you have to bring food, you have to um, general bring everything to these people that are being detained. So, but he's extremely important because as I said before, you imagine if we were in there, I mean, nobody will know where the detainees are. So I'm going to talking just since 2014 January, 2014 they are being exactly till today, 11,903 people that have been Abby triple detained for political reasons. So, and we have a race third now we have a very sophisticated database. So we have register everything, the place where they, where the Tane the age, the profession. I mean we know everything. How many women have you detained?

Speaker 2:          12:25          So this is a very confidential information, but you have absolutely everything. So it's not that we, when I said that there had been more than 10,000 detainees, 11,000, 903, it's not because I'm, the media tells me, well, the media gets information from what we tell them where we have. So, oh, this is some of the things that we do. And um, oh, some of the things that we actually, we have our car, I kind of a mathematical way of analyzing and the actions that we have to do in order to increase the political costs. It's a kind of interest in thing. Um, because we, we, we use like a tactical plan. I mean it's, it's not something that we do at right now. Like I'm like, you know, as an informal way, we do it in a very tactical way of, you know, doing a specific thing.

Speaker 2:          13:19          So we analyze it and all of that. And I'm telling you this because I was, I was telling you about the legal assistance, actually the, the, the number of actions that we have in order to release a person is, Eh, is for reactions. 40. So the legal assistant is just one of the 40 actions of the cell. So there are many. So, and social media, he counts. Um, the value for social media is five of the 40 actions. It's that kind of, I mean, it's the berry a methodology that longer too. I mean, there's that long explanation, but that's how we work.

Speaker 2:          14:02          And why have you chosen to become a human rights defender when it comes at such a great rest of your life and your safety? I didn't choose to become our humorous offender. I mean the two of these, it will sound, I don't know how we'll sell, but at the beginning I was graduated from Catholic University, good university in Venezuela, g-suite university in by the you suits. And um, and then I came to Georgetown University and I got my master's degree in Latin American stories from the School of Foreign Service. And then I went to London School of Economics and I got my master's degree in banking law. So I care about human rights and is not that id didn't care. I didn't know anything about the human race that even start humor. It's what happens. What are the, was telling before that in 2002, one guy was skill, he's was shouting, he said 18 years old boy, his name was Jesus.

Speaker 2:          15:01          He's mother name was Maria. So, um, and I was at that time and a dicer to the Supreme Court of Justice, um, to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court. And I was working as a corporate lawyer is still work as a corporate lawyer with all the restrictions and all of that. Um, so as, so I said, I saw this site did to help this guy. That's it. I thought that a fight, you know, help the sky, then I will, it will finish and I will continue with my work. But then I realized, and for example, there was a, um, right now my, my friend and member of that my NGO and also part of the vote of the extras go salary meal who is also my compadre like and uh, we started helping these people and actually we realized that no, there was known NGOs doing legal assistance pro bono to these people because I realized, I thought that there were a lot of NGOs hoping these people. So I thought, okay, we'll help this guy and then our NGO will come to us and, and continue with, uh, with assistance as a of these people. But actually there was his sous, then there was another okay. Schools, John Carlos and you know, and now we have Geraldine, we have Maria, we have all these people that actually were, became super pressured and they came to us and ask for help. And, um,

Speaker 3:          16:41          yeah,

Speaker 2:          16:42          I became a humorous offender and actually in 2002 I thought it was the end.

Speaker 3:          16:48          MMM.

Speaker 2:          16:49          It's just on three. I thought he was the end and do something and for it was the end. And now we're in 2017 and we are still, um, helping all these people are being tortured like, uh, with electric shocks or um, you know, sexually abused or were killed. Uh, like, um, you know, I can, I can tell you many names. They are already the families of these people already. No, no, no. Just my friends, they are part of the follow up in a family of my NGO family because they had become part or photo banana and they are not just my friends or my family. And

Speaker 3:          17:30          uh,

Speaker 2:          17:31          you know, a, a very interesting thing that we, when you start helping people, you'd never know. I mean, you didn't want to do it of course. Okay. But then you feel like a need of helping another one. And when you listen to them and they tell you their story about what is happening to them and more, most of these people are very poor people, so they don't have low, I mean that they have money to pay for a lawyer. If they would have money, they of course, they didn't call those a to pay for a lawyer. So, um, so you're getting to do, get involved with all these people. And when a mother of, for example, Carter, Julio Velasco, an 18 years old boy student who's right now in jail, and he has to be, um, you know, he's sick, uh, and all of that, and he's there in jail and his mother took to you and, and, and crying and then you get involved with it.

Speaker 2:          18:32          So it come to be a human rights defender and to help people, he had become an addiction. To me. It's true. I mean, it's like an addiction. So I, I, I always, sometimes I wake up, I said, okay, I have to finish with it because I'm very tired. Because as I said, I work in the mornings, I mean, very late at night. And, uh, I came to my house sometimes at 4:00 AM for example, because somebody called me that he was being detained. And so I go to the prison center to the military, uh, you know, place where they are being detained or the police station, whatever. And uh, and then the next day I said, I'm very tired, so I have to continue with my work, with my regular work or have to, you know, continue musician also, sorry, I need to play music or things. And I, and I realized after I slipped a little bit a wake up and again, I said, okay, I have to continue because these people asking for help.

Speaker 2:          19:36          So in the end is not that daddy's real sacrifice because if you were a sacrifice, I'm told sure that I will stop doing it is actually a great benefit. And I'm, maybe I'm talking too much, but I will tell you another little thing. We have four principals in a migraine section or what they call the four C's versus the forces because the, the, the, the words to start with a c in Spanish, it's Constantia, which means perseverance. The second one is compromised, which means commitment. The third one is [inaudible] would you means conviction. And the fourth one and the most important one is quarter sawn, which means heart. This is very important one because I is not just a beautiful words, the it has a meaning but that everyone but, and I explained to everyone whereas the meaning, but the last one is very important because w I explained it and he said what means Corazon are hard.

Speaker 2:          20:44          It's not just love of romantic word, it's more than that. That when you two good things to people, you will receive good things to you. I'm actually, I'm very happy doing what I'm doing and I have a great family, a lot, a lovely flat, lovely family, a nice songs on and they appreciate what I do. And this is just, the family is very important for me but have very well be. So ward term receiving, uh, it's not usual that you receive at like that. So he's probably would buy more than that. Is that you feel Barry Nice helping people and easy something that really everyone has to feel it because he, as I said, he's very great indemnification to your life until you're, you know, do you,

Speaker 4:          21:33          absolutely. So it sounds like one thing that you thought or one incident you thought was just going to be the one time thing turned into this whole, you know, series of events that basically found you.

Speaker 2:          21:45          Yeah, I get out of my comfort zone and I thought that I will come back and yeah. Now you're still going for the one with I'm doing. So this is like right now it's my comfort zone to be, to be a here Moreso fender. I don't see myself doing something different, even though that I can, I mean I have to, because to be a humorous offenders, nothing something that actually you have, do you have a lease in economic indemnification that, um, so you have to continue working. And this is something that I always say to Kim or resist the defenders if we are to be calm or human rights offenders, think about doing it because it's not that you will receive a payment for that. So you have to continue working in what you do and, and tried to finance yourself. And, um, uh, as I said, I always say that whenever I help people, I will always receive something a better from, from life.

Speaker 4:          22:45          That's a perfect segue, um, to Angelita. Angelita can you tell us a little bit about partners for human rights and how your partnership with a fellow came to be? So my organization, Robert Defcon, he humorize has been giving every year for, this is the 34th here that we give, uh, these, uh, annual human rights award that eads was created to recognize people like, afraid of, you know, the most courageous human rights offenders from around the world. And, um, the program that I direct is precisely a support program within our organization. For those that win the award, the award is an idol only recognition, uh, eight cells. So, or offering as an organization to Alfredo and his organization to really provide all the support we can, all the tools we use, uh, no, or expertise or human resources or contacts right yet to help, um, amplify the voice of [inaudible] as a network of, of laureates that, that we have.

Speaker 4:          23:50          Um, and that's, that's what we hope to, to, to be able to from now on, continue working very much hand in hand with, with Alfredo and photo penile, uh, knowing that Venezuela right now really needs the international attention and the support from, from people all around the world, uh, to put it into these, these situation in this crisis. And one of the areas that as an organization we've been focusing more and more is the protection of civic space and, uh, including of course the basic freedoms that make civic space possible. Freedom of expression, freedom of Association and assembly. And by partnering with Courageous Human Rights Offenders, second flow, we tried to protect those basic rights because in helping those that are the front line, like Alfredo putting their lives at risk, their reputation, no, and he didn't say so, but he's attack constantly by him, by government and by sectors of society that don't like him being a supportive of those that are being, uh, whose rights are being violated.

Speaker 4:          24:54          And by partnering with Alfredo and put up an avenue salon or we're trying to lend our support and extend our hand to, uh, organizations that really are in, in, in the day to day trying to take the most important and basic freedoms that we all need, um, to really be able to participate into express ourselves. And, and, and, and, you know, have even to the people that have been detained, but sometimes they're just protesting for the basic right of, of having food under the table, being able to work or being able to disagree with the government. And those rights are being completely curtail. So again, we, we aim at supporting organizations that are doing incredible work just like [inaudible] and protect that space that is so important. I mean those basic freedoms such as expression and association.

Speaker 1:          25:55          So, you know, we are in a very interesting time right now where there are a lot of causes that could use support. Um, and so what was it specifically, because I know that there were thousands of applicants. What was it about unfair though and his specific organization that led to the selection of the 2017, uh, Robert F. Kennedy Foundation, Human Rights Award?

Speaker 4:          26:18          Many reasons. Um, I fairways definitely the, the very clear and a unanimous decision by the jury. We have an external jury that chooses the, each year the, the low and we don't plan. We saw somebody that is courageous, that has being able to choose a different path. And having had that even carrier has made and has received the calling of, of being a human is offender and has um, yeah, really fell through. We did. And, um, we, we also saw it and see that, um, ability and the to take it like the methodology that is used by my Alfredo and a up an advantage. This, um, idea of really creating a network, um, it's unending support that goes beyond just the legal systems but also attends to all the other aspects of, of uh, needs of victims of human rights violations. So he's a very integral approach and it involves people, uh, and in your victims and families of victims and society at large.

Speaker 4:          27:29          So that was one, one of the many special things then that had flavor has and his leadership and also, um, yeah, using data even though there is no independence of the judiciary and um, the, the, the government has absolute control over everything. What I've been at and pretty have nine entirely given up on the rule of law and know the need to use the law to defend the basic human rights of people. But at the same time also use all these other creative ways, including social media to try to get the message out. So that's another reason why we thought, um, I couldn't really embodied the courage and the creativity and the perseverance that we would look to recognize with a human rights award.

Speaker 1:          28:19          So we've touched on technology a few times today and the use of social media to create awareness on what's going on, to notify family members and to even just get the word out. Um, so last week there was a law passed, uh, that gives printed prison sentences up to 20 years if a post or if something, uh, on broadcast television or on the radio is deemed as hateful. Um, you know, in the wake of that recent, that recent lot, how can technology still be used as a something that can help your organization and, um, as a human rights defender in general?

Speaker 2:          29:01          Well, um,

Speaker 1:          29:03          and I guess also the impact photo

Speaker 2:          29:05          is too, who will say five, but do you have to have all these obstacles since we started? Um, does he sell low? That actually restricts severally this kind of expressions, which are geos, expressions, I will say expressions or message us or whatever. Yeah. Against the government because the government is the ones who buy your leads. Sorry, human rights. If you abuse people. Um, the problem with this law, I mean they call it a law against hey toy games. Um, but what the problem is that they don't even explained what does in mean? I mean, what is, um, a message that actually, uh, you know, this is included in this law and it will be sanctioned, um, or criminalized. You don't know. So it's very discreet. It's on the government discretion. Why when it's a message against the law or no, that's a big problem. But this is our law and new law, but they already have been detaining people for Twitter messages.

Speaker 2:          30:23          Right now, for example, there was a guy called, his name is Victor [inaudible] for example. These guys be in jail for more than three years just because of a Twitter message. Um, there is another guy called Leonel Sanchez. He was in you still in jail because of that other being more than nine people because of social media using social media. Um, and they come to your house and they take you out of your house, uh, because well they can find out where you have sent the message. So the important thing is that the whole world knows about it and they understand that they're using this loss in order to, you know, officialized or legalized in some way in have to formalize, I will say, Eh, political persecution. But this is something that we are used to it. And, um, um, well we have to continue doing our job in there are very objective and, and um, and the way that we're doing that we use still need the two.

Speaker 2:          31:32          And of course for the government, no, but that's why they, they restrict or media on all freedom of expression because they don't want the truth to be known all around the worst. So that's why it is extremely important to be here. Um, for example, uh, I will say this, companies like Google or, or international companies that have the access to, I will say to people and that they can tell the truth, I hope that they can help countries like Venezuela, that we are always more and more restricted. And, and sometimes it's is important because I'm totally sure that if you leave here in the United States or in a free country, you will say, well come and why these people are stupid. You know, why, why these people can be controlled by a guy or two guys. Why they don't protest to, I didn't do things like that where they don't just go out of the street.

Speaker 2:          32:34          Oh, people have gone out of the street, made anytimes. But having killed, having tortured on the, when your song is being killed, I was 16 years old, 15 years old for example, this [inaudible], uh, 15 years old boy that was skilled then you think twice before going out of, uh, out of trees. So, so this is important to understand because, um, and this is also very important thing to understand. You cannot take freedom for granted. If you live in a free country because you never know when you're going to lose it. I used to live in a free country. I didn't know. I didn't even imagine that it will be involved in these issues. Uh, I didn't even imagine that will become a humorous offense. I didn't imagine that will be here at some point in my life is not general something I was looking for, but I'm glad it happened. And um, that's why he's important, um, for the whole world to know, um, you know, for the people to, to be some kind of interested in, in human rights and human rights abusers.

Speaker 1:          33:51          And um, in thinking about your partnership together with, uh, throughout the Robert F. Kennedy Foundation, I guess in thinking of the year ahead, um, what's your vision between this partnership and even the organization?

Speaker 2:          34:06          My vision. Why? Well, for both of them, um, uh, we, uh, as we have been growing for open, Eh, very much, uh, we're more, as I said, more than four south and volunteers are these moment in Venezuela, a EDC important to what he called twin tart internationalized for open al. And the, the, and the message and he know there's a message, the method, the methodology that we used [inaudible] increased the cost of political, of, of state repression. And I think this partnership, um, uh, I have to find out how we will work together. Yeah. A lot about, I know that, uh, it is extremely important, um, to have, uh, uh, an NGO or an organization dependent one that can actually help in Eh, you know, pulled in the message and you know, and the place where it, where it needs to be, you know, food and this and the way that, uh, we need everyone to know what is going on and um, you know, make people interested in, in what he's going on and actually for even for our safety and so in some place in some way because, uh, when you, as I said, we work there leg in the darkness and if you talk about Venezuela, maybe you will think, well, first of all, where he's been a sweater in South America.

Speaker 2:          35:39          Okay, let me see. Okay. And what is happening there? I mean, yeah. So, well there is a guy whose name is Alfredo Romero with an organization that works in a system, a big theme for the state repression. So people have been killed, people are being tortured. Well three central gate station here in the United States that actually can in some way speak or a Lauder and say that this is going on. I mean in case something happened to us, then we have some one here then at least putting attention, uh, of what is going on there. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          36:16          Yeah. I mean for us it's, it's, it's a privilege and it's an honor and we're really, um, truthfully very, very, um, eager to help as much as, as we can, including there's many tools. One of them of course he did one video, all the advocacy work international book. I see that we can, we can do around the word bet and what, why these going on in Venezuela and the work that for a banana is doing. Um, we also do international mediation. We've been cases like implematic cases that uh, before international tribunals where, um, cases that I representative of a wider, larger problem. And, uh, for example, the law, the recent law, then my spice in Venezuela. It's, it's, it's interesting because it's just an example of one of the tactics that more and more countries are using repressive countries where social media was like another frontier that was not, it was completely out of control for repressive governments.

Speaker 4:          37:13          And so, and it's so new also and he's so new, so they're really by adopting this type of laws are trying to also control that. And um, and so it's, it's, you know, there's a lot of things to do there even to try to combat these laws. But there's, there's many aspects of the work that, and the tools that we can use together, um, including read international mechanisms, then targeted advocacy that we really look forward to, to work together on and just put the message out and continue calling the attention of, of, of the world and what's going on in Venezuela. So I have one more question before I open it up to Q and. A. Um, so for the people here, for the people that will watch this, uh, for anybody that's interested, how can people help? How can people get involved? Um, you know, being in the United States, what can you do? What can you do to help?

Speaker 2:          38:10          We incorporate everyone to our network so everyone can be part, can be a member of four opener so they can register for open al.com and actually this is extreme, very important because it's what I say, even if you work one minute a month, I said Boland tear doing that, you know, saying something about what is going on even if you just worked two hours. Um, I dunno, participate in, in a, in a an assembly or in a forum that we do eat is extremely important. So, um, as I said, everyone is important here. I mean, and we train people to become powerful or organizations. So that's some very important thing because if, if you are registered in our organization, then we know where you are and we can some way, Eh, send information and, and because he's, I mean, he's extremely important to understand what is going on.

Speaker 2:          39:20          This is the most important thing. How you, I will say not translated in the, you know, the judge did not use the language is how to make people understand what, what does in mean to live in a country that the freedom has been a lost even the children. I mean we incorporate 14 years old, uh, boys or girls bogus and I listened to them exhibited from, well I will say that in order for anyone to understand what you say, you have to talk to a 13 years old boy. That's the way that you have to, that people can understand what you're saying is difficult, but it is important. So that's the way, the best way to, to, to support what we do. Um, and um, for example, as you know, I'm not talking about lawyers of course, not just students or, or intellectuals I'm talking about is singers, about artist, about DC 16 year platform, every, no, but everything is extremely important.

Speaker 2:          40:29          I used for example, music. I'm a musician, so use music in order to sing and some time to explain where I'm doing with that with a songs. And when, whenever I, for example, I publish a song either in Youtube, whatever singing, I will get more views that just talking about a state repression and you know, all the technicalities of these, of people that are being tortured or whatever. So everyone can help just, I always ask people to register to become part of our organization and I'm sure that they will do something very good for people in Venezuela and also all around the world where, where governments and um, dictators actually have the control of people. And I needs to control people with repression or to keeping power. Google is known for having some of the most talented people on technical field and

Speaker 4:          41:34          communications field. They think that putting that talent also in getting, coming up with ideas, particularly on when it comes to getting the message out. Um, uh, securities also big thing, not only for, you know, a fair bit. All the people in the network, why they're doing what photo is doing is documenting human rights abuses that comes at a high risk. So anything that can help do that work in a safer way, in a more secure way, in a more mainstream way. Um, it's, it's always going to be welcome. Even Venezuela and, and, and in other places in the world where, uh, but in, in this specific case of Venezuela is, especially now with the additional challenges that are being created by the government, really disseminating information. That's also something where these, the brains that we have here, I'm sure it can be very, very useful.

Speaker 2:          42:24          Just very quick. It was, um, also another story bearing tourist in order to understand how, for example, people in the working help and again, daily and what is going on and to increase in the cost of political repression that they call the political cost of repression. Just once, about one year ago, there was, um, a woman that was detained, uh, she was protesting or whatever and she was, um, she was, her name was Joseph alleine show. She was sustained actually, and she was taken to, um, to a military base. And these guy, from what she's told me, uh, this military officer was starting, it started touching her on, she was with her like in a, in an office in his office and somebody started knocking the other door. There was a soldier or whatever, and this guy is a stand up, very quick stop touching her.

Speaker 2:          43:33          And then the guy came back to the office, I start yelling and took her and to her to whatever place, I don't know. And she said, why are you, why? Well, because there's social media is with your picture, with your name. I'm married. Then we were the ones that were actually publishing pictures of her and their name on her name. And so this is extremely important. So this is the only way. Sometimes you can not totally sure. And she says that, that we held her, I mean if, if we, if we were in their publishing the pictures, I'm so, I'm sure she will be, um, raped. So, um, it's extreme important. I mean, just if you mentioned something in social media network, whatever he could, he could save a life. So, uh, that's how you can help. For example, I will give you, I know their idea is something that I, I don't care because whoever can do it and Google is a place.

Speaker 2:          44:38          For example, I have thought on a map of big teams of repression the world. So there isn't a map. So how many political prisoners are in? They were, nobody knows it. I know I didn't make country because we have a register. So it's important to know where are the big teams of repression or around there so people can actually put their names so that the whole world knows there is like a map or so something's happening here, something's happening there and Google is a great platform to do that. Now I want to open it up for questions. Does anyone, does anyone have any questions on either side? We can start with you.

Speaker 5:          45:20          Sure. Hi. Well thank you for everything. So global are also data driven company and I see you're looking at a lot at you, at your data. I'm just curious, how have you seen trends? I mean with number of cases, number of repressions and things it change or has it only gold and on par. Has there been any change? I mean I'm interested about it.

Speaker 2:          45:42          Yeah, this is, this is a very important question. Again, we, how we work or how I analyze everything. I analyze this as a, as a cost, as a political cost benefit analysis. That's it off the repression. So we are the organization that actually shows the list of political prisoners in Venezuela, just to give you an idea. So they use what I have called the revolving door effect. So when they incarcerate some and they release and others and they incarcerate the recent others. So I always said that there'd been more than 11 south and 900 whatever political detainees. But so there've been affected. I mean the, the intimidation effect is really important. So everyone is being intimidated. So everyone is a big team. So she told me that if one of our families was a big thing, so they called us and you can see all that as well as all around the world even telling me the same thing.

Speaker 2:          46:47          So in order to increase the political costs we have showed how many political prisoners are. So for example, before April, 2017, before the, the last broadest mass processes started, they were a one south, 117 political prisoners monthly. If you see our statistics, there were 100 every month, there were not the same. We're 100, you know, with uh, uh, political, uh, with a revolving door effect around talking about it in July because of protest, the number of political prisoners increased to six and 76. And we started saying that there were 676 right now. After that I started, uh, we started, uh, Eh, Eh, sending the list of political prisoners to the Oi Aes, to the Organization of American States in order for them to certify it at least, and to verify it, at least not for the government to say, well, where are the political prisoners? Where they here? So the OAS has, it has the least.

Speaker 2:          47:57          So we have it here. So we have the names on everything. We'll re now the government called dose. Actually send me a letter asking for the least of people that had been detained in a bile int eh actions or whatever. This is the least of political prisoners. So I answer the letter, I sent another letter, um, saying, okay, here's the list of political prisoners. Actually they use the lease and they went to all [inaudible] centers. Some of the prisoners centers, actually the, the, the number of political prisoners have decreased to 342 is a, is the last one. So every week they had decreased the number two about in about 1120 or whatever. So they have to go again to the 100, Eh, Eh, you know, number. And this is important because this is how you increase the political cost. This is how you do because the government, they are not, they don't want to have a, you know, one south and political prisoners, they don't want to have 600 political business.

Speaker 2:          49:11          Well, they don't one, it's not that they don't want to have it. They want to have it because it's an intimidation effects or they don't want people to protests or they, they want people to say, okay, if I go to protests, they haven't gone to jail. So I prefer not to protest or I'm being killed or whatever. So they, they, they don't care about, uh, about, uh, incarcerating people by data one the world to know they have political prisoners so shall the ones who are showing that. So that's why I was telling you about this map because if a country in the world knows that the mat that they, the map shows that they have 100 political prisoners, they will like, they will better not to have anyone if nobody knows. For example, in Egypt, I was talking once to a human rights defender there and I asked her, how many political prisoners do you have in Egypt?

Speaker 2:          50:05          I'm talking about Egypt because Egypt is not, he's not a socialist country. Cause you know, it doesn't matter if you're a socialist or capitalist or whatever. It doesn't matter. Political prisoners or repression can happen in a socialist country, in a capitalist country. And she told me, I didn't know, I dunno, 10,000, 20,000. And she asked me and I said, we have bought that, that, that the number specific number. And then I realized, okay, this is how you, uh, these, the way, the methodology to release political prisoners or to stop repression or to decrease the state repression. And, well, that's why I think, I don't know if I answered your question specifically, but I, I think, uh, that's, that's the best, the most important thing that actually we do.

Speaker 1:          50:56          Thanks for your question. So I just want to end on actually a quote from Robert F. Kennedy. Um, it reads, it's from the numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped. So thank you both for your courage and thank you for everything that you do. And thank you for being here today. Thank you all for coming.
