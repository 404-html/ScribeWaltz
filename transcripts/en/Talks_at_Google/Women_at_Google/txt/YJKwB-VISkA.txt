Speaker 1:          00:06          Thank you

Speaker 2:          00:11          you so much for having me. Google. I'm really honored that y'all showed up during your lunch break. Very cool. And for those in the audience who haven't read the book, can you summarize what it's about? Sure. So, um, the book breaking cover is a memoir and it's about, um, it answers all the key questions. Like how in the world did you get into the CIA? Uh, it talks about my career at the CIA, which was, um, being an undercover counterterrorism officer along with my husband. We served together for 10 years, uh, primarily in the Middle East. And then also follows us after we leave the agency and what we did afterwards. So it's a memoir. And, um, the whole point of the book is to use my story to inspire others. Uh, cause I'm from a small town in Florida and I come from a very rural area and I never imagined myself doing anything remotely like the CIA.

Speaker 2:          01:04          And, um, I eventually found out that um, ordinary people can do really extraordinary things when you don't let your fear get in the way. And that's the point of the bike. How did you go from being someone who wanted to become a ballerina to actually becoming an expert with counter terrorism and at CIA? Yeah, so people will say, they just assume like, you must've grown up wanting to be a spy. I'm like, really? No. Um, I wanted it to be a Rockette or a ballerina. And, um, but instead I actually found myself being very fascinated by foreign affairs, um, because of National Geographic magazine. I love National Geographic. And so as a kid introduced me to a world completely outside of anything I knew from central Florida and I eventually followed that passion, um, to the Middle East for study abroad programs in college. And then I went to Georgetown for my masters and Arab Studies and got recruited out of Georgetown and to the CIA.

Speaker 2:          02:14          In the book you talk about, uh, your mentor who wouldn't even make eye contact with you because of your gender and would only address your male colleague in the room. How did you deal with that? Okay. So here, here you are. You're from a small town, you've been offered a job in the CIA, but now you've got to go through a year's worth of training, which is kind of like bootcamp for intelligence officers. And so I had, I totally had imposter syndrome. How in the world did I get hired into the CIA? What am I doing here? Am I capable of this job? And so during that year of training, because you're learning a trade craft, it's very intense. And so you're, you get placed with a mentor. So there's one mentor and to students. And so it was a male, a male student, and myself, and this guy was a legend at the CIA.

Speaker 2:          03:08          And on the first day in the little tiny office where we were meeting, he introduced himself and, and um, I realized he was only talking to my male colleague the whole time. He couldn't even look at me. And I was like, that's really weird. And, uh, after, after we were done with that hour long session, my male colleague said, well, that was strange. And I said, did you notice that? He goes, yeah, he didn't look at you once. And eventually it came out that this gentleman who had already been retired for about 20 years had only worked with women and the context and being secretaries and the agency and he could not conceive of the idea of a female being an intelligence officer. And he just couldn't wrap his brain around that. And so I realized in that moment, you know, that, okay, so I guess I'm going to have to deal with being a little bit invisible, but you got to do what you gotta do.

Speaker 2:          04:04          How do you transition something that can be a perceived weakness into an advantage? So I decided in that moment like, I can't help what this guy thinks about me. Um, he has his own preconceived ideas of what women may or may not be capable of. And he kept saying things to me like, are you sure you want to work in the Middle East? And I kept saying, yeah, I mean, I've actually spent a lot of time already in the Middle East and I'm fascinated by this culture. And he said, but you know, it's dangerous. And I said, I'd get that any, he admitted to me one day that he could not envision me carrying out clandestined operations on behalf of the CIA as a, as a woman. But I just decided like, okay, um, there's nothing I can do about that, so I'm just going to learn everything I can from him and just push past it.

Speaker 2:          04:58          So like there are places like I'm sure a company like Google, if you perceive a systematic issue or a problem, you can address that officially, but the agency is not one of those places. So I just had to like put up with it. I'll show him eventually. And it's interesting because I remember there was a part of the book where you talk about it's the HR department that decides to place people at, especially women at desk jobs and it's intentional. Yeah, it's, it's an intentional decision. Uh, at the agency, certain positions they, uh, they would like women to be in primarily, uh, when you're talking about field positions being deployed overseas in the clandestine service, um, there's a case officer role and they tend to like having men in that role, particularly in the Middle East region. And then there's one that's more behind the desk, uh, that's managing the flow of intelligence. And so they put me in that position and they said, your husband, who's a native speaker of Arabic, he, he can do this field role much better than you as a female.

Speaker 2:          06:08          And I was like, okay, well they're the CIA. They must know because they kept saying, these guys are not going to respect you. Um, the kind of sources that we're dealing with are very hardened terrorist and insurgents and you're just never gonna be able to do this job. And so I, I thought, well, this CIA must know. And when I got to Baghdad in my third deployment, I'm and in the field, and I'm seeing that my, my male colleagues other than my husband and a couple others had never been to the Middle East. And it suddenly dawned on me, wait a minute, how can these people do a better job than I can when I've been busting my butt to study the Middle East? And I, and I know this culture really, really well. And it, and I finally realized him in Baghdad when I finally got into the debriefing room that the CIO is wrong. But it took me a really long time to figure it out. And

Speaker 3:          07:07          unfortunately, this is not just at CIA is, you know, um, we all deal with it in various forums. Um, a lot of my friends, uh, not just in the tech field, but even outside, uh, they get to control. You'd have the biases and they decide to leave the workforce. How have you, um, ever felt like doing that? And if so, what made you, you know, what kept you going?

Speaker 2:          07:31          So I, I would be lying if I said that I didn't consider leaving the CIA about a thousand times. There was a really hard career and, um, but I'm also a very stubborn person, so if somebody tells me I can't do something or I'm told I'm not good enough, or, um, I'm pushed aside, there's something deep inside me that just wants to prove everybody wrong. And so I think that determination to win, just what kept me in there kept me in the role.

Speaker 3:          08:04          Based on your experience, what advice would you give to a woman who feels somewhat marginalized and their role? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          08:15          so it's really tough to be completely underestimated all the time. And, but at the same time it can be useful, especially in the agency when you're dealing with like counter terrorism issues. There were a lot of, uh, experiences in which it was good to be underestimated. So meeting with special cases where they thought we could be dealing with double agent. And so what was really useful as walking to a meeting, uh, an individual from a different culture, some were from the Middle East, somewhere from different cultures who essentially thought that I didn't know anything. And so that I use that to my, um, my advantage and there was meetings and so I would get people to open up to me not realizing what they were doing. So being underestimated. You can't help what other people think about you. You have no control over what's going on in somebody else's mind.

Speaker 2:          09:10          But what you do have control over is the extent to which you develop yourself to a point you can no longer be ignored. So all those years when people thought I wasn't intelligent and couldn't anything about Arab culture, I put my head down and I decided to do, to figure out how to do this job better than anybody else. I mean, they just decided I've got to figure out how to be a really good intelligence officer. And so I built up this expertise over time, a counterintelligence and counterterrorism expertise. Until finally the point at which I demonstrated very clearly that I could walk into a debriefing room with an Arab stores and get him to give me intelligence. He wouldn't give other people. And then finally, I finally, after years and years of building up this knowledge could prove myself and then I could use that leverage to get the kind of job I wanted in the CIA, which was, um, that special job looking at potential double agents and things like that. But it's a slow process. It takes time to become an expert in your field. But I would just say like, do the best you can to become really good at that thing you're most passionate about and then make it so that people can no longer ignore you because you're so good at your job.

Speaker 3:          10:33          Um, this is a bit of a loaded question though, I admit, but do you think you would have ultimately achieved more in your career if you were a man?

Speaker 2:          10:42          I know that is a loaded question. Um, I don't know. And I guess I try not to think of it that way. Um, I just, I'm the eternal optimist. So even when I'm up against something that's a huge challenge. I just, you know, I guess I feel like eventually on the other end of this, something good is going to work out. And if I think back to what if I had been a guy or what if this it just, I guess I try not to think of it that way.

Speaker 3:          11:11          Um, in the book you talk about how sometimes being open and s, you know, smiling can be misconstrued as a one dimensional and naive. Um, how did you deal with it? Do you think that sort of assumption is warranted and also does it make sense for us to put up a tougher exterior?

Speaker 2:          11:35          Are you guys can tell just in a short period of time you've been in this room that I'm a fairly outgoing, Smiley personality. Um, I really enjoy interacting with people. And so I have noticed, especially in a environment like Washington DC, um, people assume that when nice and friendly and open and smiley, you are not, um, multifaceted that you're not intelligent. And, and it's not people being jerks, they don't even really often understand they're creating these ideas about you in their head. Um, but I learned in DC and in the Middle East how to show other aspects of my personality at different times. So I learned when I was in a place like Cairo as a student, I'm studying culture. I learned how to stand up for myself in situations where I was being taken advantage of. You know, and that's when the smile comes off your face.

Speaker 2:          12:31          And that's when you show the rougher part where the more aggressive part of your personality. So coming from the south as a good southern girl where you don't show when something's wrong or you don't, um, you have to be very subtle in how you approach people. When something's wrong. It doesn't work in a place like Washington or the CIA or the Middle East. You have to find that. You have to find ways to reveal the multidimensional nature of your personality. So I can stand up for myself. I can get aggressive when I need to. Um, and understanding and having the confidence to do that was something I learned in the Middle East. And earlier in the talk you mentioned imposter syndrome and this is something that's not, um, you know, time to just, you know, being a woman that it cuts across gender. Um, and you also talk about one of your male colleague who also built with it. Uh, how does one overcome imposter syndrome? Yeah. Um, okay. Has anyone in this room raise your hand if you've ever dealt with the whole imposter syndrome issue? Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:49          I feel so at home right now. Um, that's so interesting cause I came to Google thinking you guys all knew how awesome you are all the time. And Jasmine's like, no, we feel it too. And so, um, imposter syndrome, I think there's something refreshing about knowing that you're not the only person who suffers that. Okay. So I get into the CIA. I've never known anybody who worked at the CIA. I've only seen it in Hollywood movies. So in my mind, people were prep their whole lives to be CIA officers. They're all martial artists with black belts. They all speak five languages, they're all total cultural savant who traveled the world. And so you walk in there all meek and mild and thinking, you know, I'm not sure, I'm not sure I can do this. And then you discover how very wrong you were and you look around you and you're like, okay, these are just regular human beings here in this building.

Speaker 2:          14:47          Um, the way that I dealt with imposter syndrome is simply by not quitting and much of the time was just because I was too embarrassed to quit. And so sometimes I tell like to tell people I've had a lot of success in my life simply just cause I hung in there longer than other people with the secret to my success. Um, and it's because I think when you struggle, when you work so hard to deal with your imposter syndrome, the process of that struggle breeds something really beautiful in you in terms of your expertise. When I had a meeting and the guy sitting across from me is telling me he's an l Catia Amir and he's telling me he's been running operations in Baghdad and something about his body language is telling me intuitively that it's that he, there's something wrong with this guy. And I sat in the struggle for weeks after this debriefing trying to figure out why is it bothering me, what about this guy is giving me this bad feeling?

Speaker 2:          15:58          And after weeks of trying to go through this debriefing in my head, I suddenly realized this guy was an acting like an l Cada Amir. He wasn't behaving like all of the other terrorist I had dealt with when they walked in a room, these other guys, they walked in like they own the place, they had the biggest egos I have ever seen in my life. And it suddenly I was suddenly realized this guy didn't have an ego and he was scared. And when I picked him up in my car, I actually had a moment where I thought this guy is going to pee his pants. Like he was shaking like a leaf. And after weeks of going back through the entire meeting, this struggle brought me to a point where I said, I don't think he's what he's telling us. I don't think he's in Okada Mirror.

Speaker 2:          16:48          I don't even think he's in El Cada at all. Nevermind being the leader of a cell group. And it turns out that after a couple of months of intensive efforts for me to vet his information, he was never an all Cada. And so that, that, that struggle, it brought me to a place where I suddenly had this confidence. Like I can read body language, I get the culture enough to realize when something's wrong. And then finally that whole imposter syndrome thing, it finally went away. And it was like a turning point in my career when I realized that I was actually really good at intelligence. So the moral of this story is just hang in there.

Speaker 3:          17:33          You know how, uh, biocese goes both ways, uh, like how people judged you in Middle East. Uh, we tend to have all these stereotypical ideas about people from at least as well. Uh, but you have spent a of time with them. You know them on a personal basis, what are some of the misconceptions that we as Americans have against them?

Speaker 2:          17:58          So I mean the first thing is that, um, when you don't interact with it, certain people group you tend to have the worst ideas about them. And the thing that I love about people from the Middle East that I, that you realize immediately when you go to the Middle East is how hospitable people are and how they will literally give you the shirt off their back. The way they treat visitors, the way that they welcome you into their home or welcome me to their country is, um, I learned what hospitality wise from Arabs. And it taught me a lot about being a better person. So that's, that's one thing I like to tell people. And another thing that makes me crazy is when I hear people say things like, Oh, you served in the Middle East. It's that place where people just kill each other all the time. And this has been going on for thousands of years and it, and it sounds like, oh, they're just animals over there and they just love to fight.

Speaker 2:          18:55          You know, they're just warmongers. And what makes me crazy about that is it's a fundamental misunderstanding of the Middle East. There's a lot of identity politics that exist in the Middle East that are different than where we have in America. Our political system here is very different than the political system in the Middle East. And so what you have, you don't have separation of church and state. They're integrated into one. And so that creates a completely different dynamic in terms of identity, politics and fighting for control over ideology, which is fighting for control over power. Um, it's not because people aren't biting each other because they just love warring or they're just these animals is that they're dealing with a different set of political circumstances. And in order to understand that, you really have to look at and recognize how different the systems are that we're dealing with.

Speaker 3:          19:53          That's quite fascinating because most of us hear about terrorism and terrorists, you know, based on headlines that we get, you know, through media, but you know them as people beyond criminals. And um, and that is really interesting. You know, we don't get to see that side of those people. The

Speaker 2:          20:14          most fun part of my job isn't as an intelligence officer. Everybody thinks of Hollywood. You're driving fast cars, you're drinking Martinis, you're doing all this high speed stuff. Um, but what I find the most fascinating aspect of being an intelligence officer is the psychological aspect of those interactions with another human being. So the way I like to explain it is you have created a relationship with a guy who you have nothing in common with. As a counterterrorism officer, your job is to get insider. You need to stop terrorist attacks from occurring. So who are you meeting meeting with? You're going to be meeting with penetrations of a terrorist group. These are guys who have turned on the rest of the terrorist group and have agreed to be the mole. They've agreed to risk their lives, to partner with the CIA to give you this intelligence.

Speaker 2:          21:10          So while he's a terrorist, while he has clearly killed people, he now is at a place that he's willing to work with you. If you mishandle his intelligence, if you mishandle his identity information, you could get him killed. So he's risking his life to be meeting with you. So if I'm going to be interacting with this human being to get intelligence out of him, fundamentally he has to trust me. And if I walked through the door and I'm the opposite of what he's expecting as a female, he's not going to trust me. So how do I connect with this guy who has crazy hard and ideology, thinks nothing. Women should never leave home. And if they leave home, they should have be completely covered and have a male escort. How am I going to connect with him if I want him to see me as a human being?

Speaker 2:          22:00          I have to understand who he is and it's got to be something other than terrorists sitting in a seat across from me. He has strengths, he has weaknesses. He has his own motivations. And if I'm going to work with him in intelligence, I have to know what his motivations are. Is He doing this for money? Is he doing this to take out the competition? Is he doing this because he no longer buys into the ideology and he's had it with El Catia and he's willing to risk his life to work against them. Um, so fundamentally I, I can't do my job unless I can see that person and interact with them as a human being. You say have the agent who interacts with them, they have three big challenges and then you don't case you have the fourth one. Um, do you want to elaborate what those challenges are?

Speaker 2:          22:51          Yeah. See your challenges as you're trying to then make this connection with this person. You have s you know, hardly anything in common with is, first of all, you're an American, so you're the enemy from the get go. And we're talking about not all middle easterners were talking about these terrorists sources we're meeting with. Then secondly, you worked for the CIA, so you're double enemy. And then thirdly, it's assumed you're a Christian if you're white, that doesn't, it's obviously not necessarily the case, but they assume that so you are American, Cia, Christian, and then female with soon. It's like you have the deck stacked against you and so you'd have to figure out, I was preparing for my first debriefing in Baghdad. I realized, okay, again, I can't help with that. Guy Thinks of me when I walked through the door, but I've got to figure out very quickly how to make this connection with him.

Speaker 2:          23:46          So I've got to take all of his assessments about me and turn them on their heads. I have to absolutely turn them upside down. And the reason why it's got to happen quickly, it's because we're getting shelled constantly and there's a, it's we're in the Green Zone and we've got a curfew and we thought all of these external things going on. So we have got to make this meeting happen quickly. So I walk in the room and I have to be sure that my body language is exuding confidence, even though I am terrified, I'm excited, I like I'm shaking, but I don't want him to see that I'm shaking. So I'm like deep breathing exercises. I agree to him in Arabic. I greet him using Arabic, uh, freezes that show. They're not like show Kieron off one. Like thank you or you know, silly phrases. I'm using phrases that demonstrate I've studied Arabic and then I'm talking to him about something that matters to him.

Speaker 2:          24:43          So I've studied this guy inside and out and I know that the guy I'm meeting with has this huge ego and he feels really important. So I stroke his ego. I say Abba, Muhammad, I am so impressed by what you have done in the last few months. You have been incredibly brave by sharing x, Y, z. What you have done is literally pushed l Catia out of your village. I'm really impressed with you. So I'm stroking his ego. I'm making him feel important because we all want to feel important. And then I got to show him that I'm intelligent. So I have to talk about Iraq writ large. My knowledge of a rock, what kind of a country or rock is, I have to show him that I know specifically how a rock is different than the rest of the Middle East. What makes a rock unique? And as I'm having this conversation with him, this like back and forth, nice to meet you in this, this exchange, I'm seeing his eyes like twitching because I am not what he expected.

Speaker 2:          25:42          And so I know that it's working and so I continue this dialogue with him and I can see that I am shocking the heck out of him. And about five minutes into this exchange where I have confronted every single miss assessment, he has this moment where he just decides like, wow, she's smart, I like her and I'm going to work with her and now we can get down to business. And now I have taken my disadvantage as a female and now I've turned it on his head and now he wants to impress me because I'm a female. Fine. I can work with that if that's how, if that's what we're dealing with. Fine. And so I realized that if you are, um, the, anyone can use this strategy to deal with people who don't fundamentally understand who you are, but you have to work with them nonetheless.

Speaker 2:          26:38          I'm going to switch gears a little bit. Um, there have been a lot of shootings recently, including one at our youtube campus. Um, is there something that we as civilians can do to be more alert and stay safe? Yeah, I know that's such a tiny question. Question, easy question you asked Jasmine. Um, so I think the most important thing is to realize where you're most vulnerable because some attacks were surprised like this one, and you can't plan for that. And you can't really prepare in many situations for the lone wolf to, to crack and do what this woman did. However, I do like to tell people it's really important to know when you're most vulnerable or to know when you're in situations where if something's happened, this might be a place where it will happen. So it tends to be in places where like, um, you're at a concert or you're at a mall during Christmas time, like buying presence in December where you're in large gatherings of people, you're at a sporting event.

Speaker 2:          27:42          Whenever you're in places like that, you have to just say, okay, in this moment I realized that I am in a place where this abuse, we're just target rich environment for a terrorist. Um, but here's the other thing, it's telling yourself ahead of time that you're going to have the right response. God forbid something happens because when an attack occurs, you have a surge of adrenaline that goes to the courses through your body and you have one of three reactions. It's either fight, flight or freeze. And it sounds really basic but a lot of people freeze and their situations because they're so overcome by fear or they don't know what's happening. And so the idea is to tell yourself ahead of time, God forbid I am ever in one of those situations, I am not going to freeze. And so sometimes survival, it's as simple as not freezing.

Speaker 2:          28:36          And this the ca gave us training because a lot of us were sent to war zones and places where we could be ambushed and the idea is that the place where the attack occurs is called the acts and you have to do anything possible to get off the ax and their situations so they actually trained us find out where the threat's coming from, which direction and run the other way and again it sounds really like really the ca has to teach you people that but yes they do and actually I think as human beings just recognizing the potential responses in being able to say like you're taking your family out and you guys are in a public place and you realize we could be a little bit vulnerable, vulnerable here. Where are the exits? The exits. So when I go to a concert, I look at the concert hall and I already exit, exit, exit, exit.

Speaker 2:          29:27          Whereas everybody going to go probably that direction. Is there another direction I could go to not get involved in a stampede? These are the kinds of things I think through my head. Where's cover or concealment? If something happened right now, where would I run? And so it's a counterterrorism officer. I am a little sick like that all the time. But anyway, it gives you an idea of what you can think through in your head is you're dealing with an attack, like what just happened on your youtube campus? How long did she have her weapon out? Did she brand a shit for several seconds? Did she give anybody a moment to respond or does she literally just pull it out and start shooting? So the questions are, you know, how much time do you have and to just do anything. I'm telling you guys anything to get off the ax.

Speaker 2:          30:14          That's, that's actually a great advice. Um, as someone who has dealt with a lot of people with ill intent, um, can you even spot them in public? Is it even possible? I mean, once they pulled the gun out, then of course, you know, um, I think that you could be quite surprised at how much you can see when you're paying attention. Um, I was with my family, this was during my CIA training. So I started learning how to pay attention to my surroundings at this period of time. And we were in a toy store and this book, this story is actually in the book, so you'll recognize that. Um, but we were in a toy store and we're walking down the aisle and I saw this guy crouched down by the Barbie dolls and he looked weird. He looked unkempt, like his hair was like not combed.

Speaker 2:          31:06          Like half of his shirt was tucked in. He just looked super sketchy and he like made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. And so I literally watched this guy's eyes glom onto my six year old niece and watch her walk down the aisle in such an inappropriate manner. I could barely put it into words in that moment. All I might have thought in my head was pedophile, pedophile and um, you know, like grabbed her and like usher her through the aisle. And I didn't have confidence at that point to like say something cause I didn't, I always like second guessing myself. Am I correct? You know, is that right? What can I say? Like I think there's a weird guy and I'll fight and five, like what do you tell people? Knowing what I know now, I would've gone back in time and I would've gone to the front desk or whatever and said, there's a really sketchy guy in aisle five.

Speaker 2:          32:04          He looks like a pedophile to me. But you know, just letting you know. Um, but it's, so, it's interesting because I noticed something, I was paying attention to something that didn't look right. And so I think you really have to honor your gut feeling when something is out of place. And the more you pay attention to your surroundings and more, you'll see things that just don't fit in or just don't look right and, and you'll be surprised. Yeah. That makes sense. Um, last question and then we'll move on to audience questions. What's most valuable lesson that you learned at CIA that might be applicable to everyone, including us, civilians? So it really kind of, it's the theme of today, which is you have to find a weak way in your job to be authentically who you are. It takes a long period of time to build up the confidence to say, how can I, with my unique perspective, bring who I am to this job or this role?

Speaker 2:          33:08          And to have the confidence to say I see things a little bit differently. Can we potentially do this or that? And what's nice is Google, you worked for a company that really honors innovation and you work in a place that kind of upholds that, which is fabulous. Like I'm jealous. Um, but the idea is to not, is to feel free to disrupt because of who you are. Use your personality to disrupt the status quo, to innovate, to change how things are done. Your power comes in your authenticity. When I tried to run an operation like my male colleagues, I wasn't doing a very good job. But when I decided in that moment I'm going to be Michelle, my Smiley Michelle face, whatever that seemed so foreign to the CIA. But when I brought that into into my job and brought it into the way that I planned and executed operations, I stood out in the best possible way.

Speaker 2:          34:11          And I, I what made me feel initially like an odd ball in this day is what enabled me to shine eventually. And again, it took me like five years to figure that out. And hopefully it won't take you as long, but it is to encourage you to be as authentic in what you do every day because I think that's where your success lies. Yeah. Oh yeah. Say the question is what do I think about what's going on in terms of terrorism in the Middle East and there is it getting better or worse? So, um, we've done a pretty good job of disrupting isis from its stronghold in Syria and northern Iraq, as you all know. Um, there's no longer a caliphate, although there are pockets of Isis in northern Iraq and obviously still in Syria now what the press is not telling you very much. I think there's just been little glimpses of it.

Speaker 2:          35:03          This is the big insight right here. A lot of the leadership that hasn't been killed in counterterrorism operations is in Libya. I think Libya is going to be the next Afghanistan in terms of a base of operations. Um, and so I think because Libya is essentially, uh, hardly functioning country, it's a, it's Olivia as you can tell is, is a mass. There is a government, but the government has very little control over what happens all over Libya. And so things are going haywire in the country, which is why you have people smugglers and crime syndicates sending migrants across the Mediterranean into Europe. And now I think that the more that terrorism leadership sets up base in Libya, the more you're going to see a marriage of terrorism and the human smuggling trade, which is very lucrative in terms of lining their pockets and helping them, um, kind of re constituent, uh, recalibrate, reconstitute themselves. And so I'd say heads heads up on Libya.

Speaker 4:          36:15          You mentioned earlier getting the motivation behind why individuals are doing what they're doing. And one of them struck me was to eliminate the competition. Yes. Um, what kind of terrorist competition is dinner?

Speaker 2:          36:29          Yeah. I let you know. This is interesting actually. So it took me a long while to figure this out, but there were a lot of, a lot of sources who pretended like they were all like, oh yeah, CIA, we're friends, we're good. We're going to work together. When in a, in effect, they had never intended to leave terrorism behind. They just wanted to take out the other guy in the block so they could be in charge. So it's like a double agent, but not in order to work against CIA necessarily, but a double agent to establish their power on the street. So they'd be like, Hey, that guy over there, he's a really bad terrorist. His name is so and so. This is his phone number. This is make and model of his car and this is the location of his safe house. Next thing you know, ca or not, Eh, military troops, uh, take out that guy. Next thing you know, we find out a year later we took out the competition then that that guy took over as head Honcho and was playing us. Essentially. That happened more often than we'd like to admit.

Speaker 4:          37:34          Here's my Herdman. Uh, so imagine that there are many sources who are coming to you, but in my case that you're reaching out. Like how do you, uh, how are you finding the people that are the best sources and then how do you train them into sources of names?

Speaker 2:          37:52          It's tricky because so much of that I'm not allowed to talk about. Um, I can say, cause this was cleared for my buck. People think it's so hard to recruit sources. Um, and there's certain things and intelligence like it's hard to recruit a North Korean cause it's hard to find them. It's um, it's hard to recruit, uh, Putin's inner circle for obvious reasons. It's not hard to recruit in the Middle East, especially for counterterrorism operations. It's not hard to collect information. What is really hard as collecting good information. Most of what we get as fabrications or lies. And so the better we are at vetting the information and finding the golden nuggets, the better. You know, that's, that's the hard part of the job. And, and recruiting people who are being truly recruited versus using you to take out the competition. That's also the hard part. It's like a half answer. How do you like that one?

Speaker 5:          38:54          Um, you were talking a little bit about developing those instincts for spotting things that you feel are off. Um, we have programs running here are Rhonda becoming more aware of your unconscious biases and how those can be really damaging. It's not something that you may cut a potentially really damaging news. They're not based, they're based in unconscious bias rather than it's kind of back. So I'm curious, I'm not, as we were developing those instincts that, how did you differentiate between what might be bias on the basis of how we're socialized, you know, broadly and where you found that your instincts were really right and how you, how you sort of be those determined?

Speaker 2:          39:33          Gosh. Oh, that's a good question. I mean, was it in terms of understanding my own biases are understanding theirs. Mine. Okay. Um, yeah, because we all bring biases to the job. Absolutely. All of us. And I think it's impossible to completely like, Eh, we're human beings. We're flawed. Um, but I think the extent to which you can

Speaker 2:          40:03          call it out and I, I think there's some level of emotional intelligence involved in that, you know, and being aware of yourself, some people just aren't aware. Um, and, and that's where a dialogue and debate with others can be helpful to you, you know, healthy dialogue to help us each understand our and things. So, I mean, I had to be, if I'm going to deal with this guy, you know, my natural, actually this is funny, this is not, I would say my natural inclination was to not trust, but that's actually a good thing in intelligence. Um, so in that case it worked, but in, in real life, outside of intelligence, not trusting anyone as, as a hard way to live her life. But I don't know if that answers your question. You're gonna make me think about that for a while,

Speaker 5:          40:55          not sticking around. And that's are kind of internally focused that he really good at. What are you doing, gutting it out there? Any ways or do you have any thoughts about ways to kind of more directly addressed some of the obstacles that you faced in your career?

Speaker 2:          41:11          Great question. One of the things that I did, because I had to find ways to show that expertise. So you're like, yeah, okay, become really good at what you do and then what? And so, uh, for a long period of time in the CIA I was really jealous of a lot of my classmates that getting sent to really nice places. I read it now, I'm like, I can't tell you where they were eating great food and they were classical architecture and nobody's shooting at though. And um, my husband and I felt like we kept getting the shaft because, okay, one more zone to war zones, but really 10 years of that and um, we kept doing the jobs no one else wanted to do. And part of that was okay, we were Airbus. Okay. There's a reason why you keep getting sent to these places because that's where a lot of the conflict is going on in this moment of time.

Speaker 2:          42:15          It took me looking back at my CIA career to realize by taking the jobs no one else wanted to do, we had developed this level of terrorism expertise that I would sit with my classmates back at CIA headquarters when I was on on a TDY and they would listen to my story stories if my meetings with terrorists and be like, I have nothing to relate to that I've never done anything like that. I realize by getting shaft and getting shafted over and over again was actually a career builder. And so I also realized that by taking a couple of the projects that no one else wanted to do, jasmine and I talked about this last night a little bit. She did something similar. Um, and sometimes you don't know somebody has given you like the project no one else wants. Um, there were a couple of occasions when I did that and I said like, I kind of show my skills and so I found some ways to like, do these projects tend to be unique and creative and different. And when I actually handed it back to the manager, they were like, well, what is that? You actually did? You did do the project. I'm like, well yeah, you gave it to me. I did it. Um, so there's some thing about doing the things others don't want and knocking the ball out of the park. I don't know. There's something to be said in that strategy. I know that's not the only strategy, but it worked. That's one strategy that worked for me.

Speaker 5:          43:47          So you're talk, uh, you mentioned that, um, as a female and he smiled and people were thinking that. And I'm especially in Washington DC as long as all, and sometimes you only use the, with people briefly. So how was your strategy? Right, the worst question,

Speaker 2:          44:11          I think it's really impossible to do. If you have a really short interaction with someone, they're probably going to still walk away from you after a five minute meeting or a two minute meeting or an introduction thinking when they walked in. So I think in order to change people's minds, you have to have some time. You have to have some history with them. Um, you know, I figured out how to make it work and there's debriefings cause it had to happen really, really quickly, but that was a very artificial compressed period of time. Like we just had to get in that room and get down to business. But that was unusual. I think that often I'm not a person that feels comfortable being like, yeah, I'm smart.

Speaker 1:          44:50          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          44:51          I, I don't, I'm not one of those people that feels comfortable like trying to self promote. I don't like self promotion, but I think in some cases you have to find some subtle way to do that that might be against your nature in order to survive.

Speaker 5:          45:12          Hi. It's very nice. It is the CIA, CIA today. Is it your friend and know when you joined or did it change in there?

Speaker 2:          45:21          I did, I don't know for sure. Cause I, um, when you leave the CIA, you can only take, stay in touch with people who reach out to you because you don't want to blow their cover. And so it's very tricky about who you talk to. And so it's not like I'm still in touch with everyone. So I am surmising that privately nothing has changed just because I've talked. Was that, does that diplomatic enough? Um, just because I talked to women and men who served like in the 1980s and I hear the same stories and so nothing's changed since 1982 it probably hasn't changed in the six years since I left agency.

Speaker 4:          46:07          And 2003 the war was stolen. Two allies, public art on the basis of information about by us. Yes. To what extent did you feel pressured to develop information that's important to be the point of view and it's, we're expanded your calendar that,

Speaker 2:          46:28          yes. So, um, we were there when that always happening because we were just baby intelligence officers. And so there was a efforts to try to find this elusive information that just didn't exist. Um, you just have, there was a situation when my husband's boss changed a report to reflect something that didn't actually happen in the meeting and he stood up and said that's not what happened in the meeting. And that information was of such a consequential nature. It was going to end up in front of the president in the White House. My husband basically got nixed on his annual performance because he stood up to his boss and said that that never happened. So when I say the CIA is a hostile work environment, that's the kind of thing I'm talking about. So you have a decision like are you going to do the right thing if it means that your setback in your career, um, or are you just going to tow the line? I wouldn't, but just to be fair, that guy was very unusual. I hope to never work with someone like that. Again, I didn't see that in other places. I just saw that with that particular individual. A lot of fabrication going on. But it's a, it's a very, I wish that on no one, cause that's such a hard place to such an awful place to be really. Does that answer your question? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          48:04          right. Another question. Uh, just keeping your husband, it's obviously you, the CIO, yours. Um, we see movies all the time and I'm sure you know, movies like we watch hacking and nobody is this like on bypassing the fingers right hand. That's cool.

Speaker 2:          48:21          Eyes Roll back. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          48:23          Um, how often, how true is it in your life where you weren't allowed to tell your extended family what you actually did it or where you were, what like did where you, uh, were you, did you have a cover story for back home?

Speaker 2:          48:36          Okay. So, um, it was really interesting. So it, as we're going through that CII recruitment process, the recruiter said, be careful who you tell about the process you're going through right now because you can't, you can't tell your 50 friends that you're applying to the CIA and you're going through this process and then suddenly, er, no, I'm just kidding. Then they also, once we got into this day and we got hired, you are allowed to tell your immediate family but only if you think they can handle it. Um, and so there are some people, like I had a colleague in Baghdad whose family thought she was working on her phd in the United States. They had no idea she worked for CIA government. I'm like, how do you keep that cover story writing were like eight, nine hour time difference. How do you to that? I don't think she hardly ever talked to her family.

Speaker 2:          49:28          Um, there were people who is like, yeah, if I tell my mom she's going to shout it from the rooftops, she seemed like my is so awesome. She works for the CIA. Or there's somebody who's like, my dad's going to be watching the evening news every night thinking he's going to see my face on there and he can't handle it. So you have to make this a c because they now have to protect your cover story when you tell them and they have to do it conveniently convincingly for you. And if you pick up the phone and you call him and they say, how are things at the CIA, they blown your cover. So you have to be absolutely certain that the few people that you do tall understand that your life is on the line and they, they've got to protect you. Um, my husband's family because he's originally from Egypt, were not American citizens and so we never told them because we didn't want to put them in danger. Um, I think towards the end of our career before they passed, I think they suspected that something else was going on. And I, and I think they were proud of my husband, which makes them feel good now, but he was never actually able to tell them. I think at one point he said to his dad like a month before he passed away, you know, dad, I've been doing counter terrorism work and he goes, I know, just shake his head like that. And so I think you've figured it out. But

Speaker 4:          50:51          yeah, an interesting question. Um, there is fun. Rather they read return on it. If they can make a magic wand and have a good night

Speaker 2:          51:05          to create this caliphate, which they thought they were creating and Syria where they could control this whole new, um, uh, Ma, uh, the body of believers, this political religious state firmly grounded on their interpretation of Sharia law. And of course the guys that are terrorists really want this to be, you know, the woman doesn't leave the home uncovered and the men's are men are warriors and you give people a choice to convert to Islam or die like, so their, their interpretation of Islam is what you see on the TV. And in their perfect world there, their idea of perfection is this, this caliphate really. Yeah. And, and, and the caliphate then being used to then spread Islam to the rest of the world and specifically their interpretation of Islam and, and, and, uh, bringing that, uh, either by missionary efforts or force.

Speaker 4:          52:06          So would you say that in some ways they're idealists? Yes, absolutely.

Speaker 6:          52:19          I have a question about what is the reason make you leave CIA and it was New York cons. Uh, how do your things, your cons, um, commuter life compare when was snowing there?

Speaker 2:          52:30          Um, so after 10 years of war zones and working weekends, working holidays, I'm not seeing your family except maybe once a year for a couple of weeks being undercover, working in places where you're constantly looking for hostile surveillance. Cause we were in places where there were car jackings and kidnappings and Alcott it was running around. So it was like this really intense and hard way to live. We're, Joseph and I are constantly looking at, somebody's got an AK 47 or an RPG aimed at us. You just, it's not sustainable. That lifestyle. And we work saw stud. And I'm also at the same time I felt this spiritual calling to write this book. And I knew that in order to do, to help inspire others with my story, I had to do it in true name versus pseudonym, which meant I'd have to leave the CIA and I'd have to request permission to drop cover, which is a big deal and they don't have to do it. So, um, after 10 years we left and I actually started writing this book, um, breaking cover when I was a year before I left the agency. And now I feel so free.

Speaker 2:          53:48          Nobody's trying to shoot me most of the time anyway, right? Like, um, I, I, yeah, I in the United States is still a dangerous place and all, but it's, it's a, it's, it's very different than what our former lives where the fact that, um, that I can be sharing these stories with you gives me intense, a lot of joy to share my stories and inspire others. And so I could not be happier at the moment.

Speaker 4:          54:14          It was very public events, uh, affect your ability to build trust with their contacts then, uh, figure don't believe you didn't do your job.

Speaker 2:          54:23          Um, public events like speaking events,

Speaker 4:          54:26          very public events like Benghazi and then use,

Speaker 2:          54:29          oh, sorry, sorry. Um, how do those events affect you,

Speaker 4:          54:33          your ability to, uh, to like develop that trust you need.

Speaker 2:          54:36          Got It. You know, it's really hard to tell your sources these days. Trust me, your name will never get leaked. I think there's just been so many leaks, so much classified information has come out and it's made our jobs. I can tell you every time there was a leak and we were still working at the CIA, we had all kinds of sources quit left and right because I'm, once those names were late, people were, was lives. They either had to get out of dodge or they were killed. Um, so it is very hard these days to recruit new sources because we can't really, I can do everything I can to protect you, but I can't help who, you know, what other people do. So it's hard. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          55:21          So let me get this picture of the CIA as a bureaucratic boy, number three guy down or eat rigorous in their determination of what we've always done it this way. Yeah. And at the same time, the tourist organization or something like the Westboro Baptist Church speaks copy up. Are there any upsides? I mean, this doesn't look like a recipe for any sort of improvement you do long term.

Speaker 2:          55:48          Yeah. Um, I think that this, the CIA, there are a lot of, there are a lot of good people at the CIA that I succeed and protect us every single day despite this bureaucratic organization that is still living like it's 1960. Um, I, I, we kind of need some serious strategic and visionary leadership to change that. I don't see that happening. I really don't. I, I'm, I'm a realist in that regard. Usually I'm an optimist, but I've been in long enough to realize it's probably not going to happen. Um, but I think that the world changed so much and we're still pretending like we're in a cold war and we haven't adjusted the way that we carried out operations to the new realities that we're dealing with. So I think that we're not doing as good a job. America deserves better. Um, I don't know how to get us there, but even having these talks, I hope in some way will influence some people to join who are going to be visionary people in the future and maybe bring some something new and fresh to the CIA.

Speaker 4:          56:49          What are your thoughts on Edward Snowden's actions and what you reveal?

Speaker 2:          56:53          Um, he put a lot of people and sources and in danger. So I don't have a very high opinion of Mr Snowden. Let's just put it that a lot of the programs that he, uh, he talked about were not secret secret programs in the sense that they weren't this, um, they were, um, coordinated amongst all of the entities in Washington that have oversight over intelligence. So it wasn't like a rogue, they weren't rogue programs in that regard. The way that the media makes it sound does this, they were the NSA and its own rogue program, but you have congressional oversight and you have this oversight and that oversight. So they were, um, these programs were, uh, as I understand it, properly coordinated, but he relieves so much other, he really so much information that was so damaging to our relationships with our allies abroad. You mean almost all week. All of our ambassadors had to have meetings after that where they basically were told by the, um, the president or minister of Interior that country. Like, we can't trust you people. You guys can't keep anything a secret, and so we're not going to tell you secrets anymore. So our counter terrorism fight us, suffered our, our, um, ability to work with our foreign powers on law enforcement and migration issues has suffered a great deal because right.

Speaker 1:          58:19          That stuff,

Speaker 4:          58:22          is there any sense of responsibility for if we weren't spying on Americans?

Speaker 2:          58:28          Um, then you get into the details of the, is it, is it spying? It's metadata collection. Then how are you using it and all of that

Speaker 1:          58:35          stuff. Um,

Speaker 2:          58:39          yeah, I mean, cause, uh, then then the question would be, um, to the oversight committees. You thought that was okay, but now we're telling you, or if you disagree with that, then there's a debate about should we be doing this or not? Yeah. I mean, this was a delight. Thank you for coming here and sharing your experience with us. We really appreciate it. Thank you.
