Speaker 8:          12:11          oh. Just like that.

Speaker 4:          12:19          Yeah.

Speaker 11:         12:34          That was amazing. Thank you. Oh my gosh. That was so great amount of applause

Speaker 4:          12:38          first that, yeah. Thank you. So I had, I had this like

Speaker 12:         12:45          very distinct way. It was going to an order, I was going to ask you a question, but I have to start with something different. Okay. Because you said something while you were up here and, um, I think it was really profound and I don't know that every performer when they get on stage gets that overtaken by their music. And I wanted to ask you about that because you, you saying that, um, second laugh, clown laugh, clap, and he said, I lose myself in that sometimes or something to that effect. So when you're up on stage like this in your performing and you, and that feeling overtakes you, what's going through your mind? How do you feel about your music in those moments?

Speaker 11:         13:24          Um, I'm not really thinking on a, you know, you can kind of like a rational level and that's really the problem. Most of the most, we call them, we're not a problem. It's a good time to be a problem. Um, yeah, I'm, I'm in, I'm in like a dream state when it's, when I'm at my best, I think to be connected to, you know, the performance and, um, and I'm really grateful anytime that I get to share my music and perform it and for that experience of, you know, receiving energy from people that I'm performing for and also giving that energy out. So when I'm, when I'm in that cycle and that circle, um, I, I spin out sometimes and I'm kind of in dream state, which can be a problem if, if like I let my emotions kind of take over, right? If I let my adrenaline take over, I can do things that I could hurt myself or like jump on people or, you know, do all kinds of things that I'm known to do.

Speaker 11:         14:30          But then I don't remember after, you know, I'm, I'm not like really present in that rational sense in that moment. And then sometimes I'll see a video and I'll be like, I was dancing like that. Oh my gosh, I don't even know how I can do that. I'll be like, why do my knees hurt? And I'll look at the video and I'll see that I was doing like these dead drops, like doing like pow, like doing all these crazy things. I'm like, I don't even remember doing that thing. I didn't split my pants. But that's, it happens. Yeah. And you usually play with the band, right? Yes. Uh, currently my set up is a four piece band, so, um, I am free to, uh, sing mostly and um, I play a little organs in this current setup. Um, but it's myself, my drummer, Marco Bocelli and then a bass player and a guitar, keyboards. If things get really out of control, they can, they usually are. I let you go there on the back line. They're holding it down. Yeah. They're usually just like, what is she doing today? That's amazing how we think we all need to see you at the band. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Come. Yeah, come out. Yeah. [inaudible] great. So this is a really exciting time for you. You're on your second

Speaker 12:         15:38          can album. Your first record was released in 2013 magic tricks. Yeah. Yes. Um, and then this album, which I think is so beautiful, they're both so beautiful and they're sonically so different. Um, what, what is your process when you write music? What's your inspiration?

Speaker 11:         15:57          Oh, thank you. Um, well I usually start by improvising, so I usually start a writing session first with something that I know, just whether it's a song that I like or a song of mine or something that I know to kind of just warm up. And then, uh, I usually start improvising, uh, other with just my voice or on an instrument, a physical instrument, like I'm a keyboard or on a, on the base. In this case, I wrote a lot of the album on, on base, which I don't know how to play really. I just, I bought a, I went and I bought a bass because I was demoing the song and I needed a bass player to play this lines and nobody would show up that day. So like, well, I guess I'm just going to buy one. I'll return it. I guess I shouldn't say that, but I'll return it later when I'm done.

Speaker 11:         16:43          But I was having so much fun, they decided to keep the base. Um, and so I ended up writing a lot of this record on that. But usually it's just improvising night and I tried to, um, just let, let myself go for a little bit and then I start to hear some bit, whether it's a rhythm that I'm playing or I'm singing were a, or it's a melody that's happening and I isolate this, a small bit of that, and then I repeat it. So I repeat it a to find out more about it through repetition. And, uh, usually when I find out something about it, then something else happens that changes. And that's usually how an idea starts for me. So it builds organically yeah. Through, yeah, through improvisation and right. And listening.

Speaker 12:         17:30          Do you think the fact, because the first record was very synth in Oregon sounding, um, and the black Terry cat is, is there's something smoother and more jazzy, more melodic about it. Do you think any of that had to do with the base? It's, if you just pulling out that base and beginning to write the record

Speaker 11:         17:50          with it. Definitely, you know, the writing, a lot of the songs on bass, you know, influenced the sound of the album is very based centric. A lot of the melodies came from, from playing on that instrument rhythmic. Um, the first record was kind of a piano trio power trio record. Okay. So it was very minimal. It was bass, drums and keyboards mostly. Um, there's not much else in the sound Palette. And in this record I expanded a little bit and uh, I, I did more vocal stacks like, and my boy in the vocal arrangements, I have like these kind of fat vocal stacks and layering that I hadn't done as much before. I used to loop my voice and use my voice. That's kind of like horns and different textures was, which I'm still doing in this record. But I expanded the sound Palette a little bit more with more since some guitar.

Speaker 11:         18:38          Um, but I think ultimately what changed on this album for me was also the music I was listening to at the time. Um, so I was really into, I was discovering a lot of hip hop music that I didn't, didn't know about. Um, some groups like slum village and which was, yeah, I represented some village where they were they good clients. I was a music attorney before I joined Youtube in 2011 and in 1997, I think [inaudible] 96 I represented this artist named some village and I didn't know that anybody knew slum village. That was, yeah, that was some of j Dilla is a master masterful work at the beginning. The producer who was slum village, um, I think Jay Dilla produced those tracks and that a lot of those artist with donating, his name is Bryce was his last name. Oh Gosh. I don't remember. You taught me.

Speaker 11:         19:34          You call me on that one. Really hilarious. Okay. Oh, they're incredible. Yeah. Um, black moon. Um, and, and j Dilla. I mean, uh, discovering sampling, you know, for the kind of for the first time. I mean, I knew what sampling was, but it was just kind of, I hadn't really been digging into that music. Um, I kind of was coming out of a period where I was discovering punk for the first time. Um, and I had been listening to jazz for a while, but I had kind of been suppressing some of those, uh, interests in my music or I'm not suppressing them. I was just on another tip and this time around I was kind of digging into this music, going back and listening to Busta rhymes, who I listened to you as a child as well. Um, listening to Kendrick Lamars album, pimp a butterfly was also really influential for me at the time that I was finishing this album. That album came out and I was thinking about, uh, lyricists, uh, rappers and people who use their voice to tell stories and listening to, you know, Kendrick's album and how he sounds like 10 different people on one album and thinking about different ways to use your voice. So all of those things, um, influenced me on this album. I wanted it to be really beat, driven, really soul fun and funky and also kind of on

Speaker 12:         20:47          the vocal performances. Right, right. Oh, what do you do with your EFL courses? Incredible. Thanks. So pitch, work, audit it. Right. I pulled a quote, um, that pitchfork referred to your music as, as adept at punk confrontation as are unbeaten run ons, which was very interesting to have a Pumpkin RV and it's the same sentence but um, and then from, you know, there's also outside of the, the sound of the music, there's really deep messages in, in the work on this album and the last one too, but I wanted to focus on this one because you, you perform Mexican chef. What are you trying to convey?

Speaker 11:         21:27          Well, that song Mexican chef just started out as kind of an observation. I was walking around running errands and my neighborhood in Brooklyn and there were kitchens that were signing up for the night and they had the back door open and you could see the kitchen staff like, you know, cleaning up, setting things up, prepping. And they were blasting Bachata and fun shit. US and Salsa and um, today and the Google cafeteria, actually, they were listening to south side, like on blast. And I was like, what's up? Who's playing this, all this old school salsa. And they were like, yeah, we are. What's up? Um, so that was cool. But so all of the kitchen staff was, was listening to this music. And then in the front of the restaurant, the wait staff was mostly white. And uh, the, the kitchen staff was mostly Latino and the, the in the front of the restaurant was completely different sound palette, completely different kind of music playing.

Speaker 11:         22:15          And I just thought that was so funny. So I started kind of improvising on these, these words. I thought it was writing a short story or like a funny rhyme to myself. I didn't think anything of it. And when I got home I just, I wrote it all down and I thought it was just kind of making myself laugh. It was a joke, you know? Yeah. But then it ended up becoming that song Mexican chef. Um, so, right. People are responding to have responded to it a lot in terms of saying that it's very political and it's very social, which, you know, I guess, I guess it is very social. Um, but I didn't intend for that. I didn't set out to write a song like that. I was kind of just having fun and, and observing things. But, um, my mom used to say, when I was a kid, I always remember her saying this one thing, um, that, that, uh, you know, the hands of Brown women welcome you into the world and clean you and you're an infant and welcome you in the hospital and they're the same ones that, that, uh, kind of take you out of this world or not take you out, uh, take care of you when you're on your way out.

Speaker 11:         23:13          Right? They're the same ones who take care of you when you're on your way out, you know, in nursing homes and stuff. My mom worked in a nursing home. She's at, she's a registered nurse. When she first, I would've heard the first big jobs in this country. Um, so yeah, she's talked about the Labor of the Brown people. So that's kind of what I'm referring to in the song is this kind of somewhat invisible workforce that, you know, makes our cities function, especially in a city like New York. But we're all of these, you know, big, sure. Metropolitan cities where we have all of these, uh, incredible services. Uh, you can have your laundry, you could have your clean underwear delivered to your doorstep if you want to. You know, it's absurd, but it, you know, it's, that's the luxuries that we live, you know, and these cities and the, a lot of the times the people who actually make those services function are people of color. Um, so it's kind of a shout out to, to that workforce.

Speaker 12:         24:08          That's great. I've had the experience, I've been, I've been in the nursing home. Mm hmm. You're referring to. And I've had the experience of birthing my own children and had exactly the same experience and both were beautiful. Um, so, so when you think about your, your, your process and your music and the meaning, you know, there's, I think that as an artist, um, you have your own perception of your music and then you have all these external accolades and critiques of your music and w are they the same for you? Do you feel about your music the way that you read people writing about it in the way you, you hear or see people responding to you?

Speaker 11:         24:54          Well, it's like when you look in the mirror, the eyes that you see yourself with are totally different than the eyes that others see you with. You know, the lover sees you or a stranger sees you, you know, so no, it's not the same. You know, I'm, uh, sometimes, you know, sometimes there synergies. Sometimes when I'm performing, I might be, I might, that day I might've been working on something and channeling something where I might've been listening to a song like Eric have I do song or something before I come on stage. And then after the show, someone will be like, Oh, you remind me of Eric about do and I'll be like, whoa, that's weird. And I'm like, channel, you know, like, just because in that day I think that I was maybe a channeling that or, or projecting that and through our transfer of energy, like somebody received that. So I think that, you know, that kind of stuff happens sometimes where someone will perceive something that it's a new thought for me that I'm working on. Yeah. And you know, and that way we'll agree, but a lot of times I'm surprised, you know, and it, and it, it's fun. It's fun to see how people perceive your work sometimes more than others, you know? But

Speaker 12:         26:00          how do you want the music to make people feel?

Speaker 4:          26:03          Yeah.

Speaker 11:         26:03          Um, well I would like people to feel joy and to,

Speaker 4:          26:12          okay.

Speaker 11:         26:12          To feel enraptured by my music, to be, to feel inspired, to listen to music or to make something when listening to my music.

Speaker 12:         26:25          Do you do any other form of art? Do you write? Do you paint any, is there any other Larry, I wish I could,

Speaker 11:         26:33          can you draw us or I can't even draw like a square or a circle. It's really sad. Um, but I do enjoy writing. I've just been in a fight with words for like a decade now. So I'm working something, I'm working on, something I was working on on this album. I wanted to, uh, work on my lyric writing a little bit. Um, because I felt like in my first album I relied a lot on, um, kind of figurative language and, um, a lot of my lyrics were super open to interpretation, which they always are. But I, I was wondering, uh, what it would be like to approach lyric writing in a more literal sense. Right. And I guess one of my big fears is m two, two big fears is, uh, talking about things I don't know, and just adding to the noise of people just talking about things they don't know about. And the second was about being corny or cheesy with like being so literal that it's corny right now. And so now I, I just went for it. And I was, you know, was literal, but writing is something I'm really curious about and interested in.

Speaker 12:         27:31          Right. There are some artists and songwriters that, that actually put down the lyrics first. They create music to it, right? Or vice versa. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         27:40          Yeah. In my case, I've always done it the other way around. My, the sounds and melodies and rhythms come first. And the lyrics have always been last. But on this record, I was, I was like, no girl, you go in and you write the words down. What does that mean? So I was trying to be more specific. Right. And you know, it was, it's tough. I'm the only way I convince myself a couple of times just being like, don't worry, you're gonna throw it away afterwards. Like, no one will ever see this. So I had just had to, you know, it's, it can be petrifying just to be that specific. And so, and, and now, you know, we're just always throwing out words all the time to each other, you know, on Twitter or whatever. We're just always like, [inaudible], everything is, everyone is so entitled to say whatever they want. All the time and write it down, you know, um, and not, maybe not always think about it before, but, um,

Speaker 12:         28:24          do you use your social media in, in promoting your shows or things like that? You want music?

Speaker 11:         28:31          Yeah, I do. It's complicated. We have a complicated relationship even working on it.

Speaker 12:         28:37          The artist that has a complicated relationship with social media, um, I, you know, I, the one is, and you probably feel this also, is there's so many different places to go to reach your fans today. And you know, I hear sometimes from artists, will I mind youtube? And I'm on Twitter and I have Facebook and I have Instagram and I have snapchat and I have whatsapp. I, you know, it's like the litany of different outlets and where should I go first and where should I reach my fan? And I think it's kind of difficult when, you know, um, and I think some artists will just select one place to really focus on and build a fan base. I Dunno. Do you know, how do you,

Speaker 11:         29:17          well, yeah, I just have fun, you know? Yeah. I think ultimately people can tell when you're not about something in general. Like if you're playing a song that you don't believe in or that you don't like what you're doing, people can tell. So I think, you know, audiences are smart and people are smart, smarter than we give them credit for it. So I think like trying to be genuine in all of those things. So, you know, I might, I tried by just makes me feel old. I don't understand what's going on. I'm not, I can't ever find, I like to trying to respond. I'm like trying to do the thing. Um, but, and I can't figure it out. Um, but yeah, I just try to have fun and, and figure out my, my way and not force things. You know. What's your favorite song to play?

Speaker 11:         29:59          Oof. Uh, see them, which is a jam I didn't play today. Um, but that's kind of like a B side jam from, from uh, black Terry cat. Okay. And, uh, it's kind of a choose your own adventure song except I chose it for you but you, but uh, but it kind of, it's kind of has some similarities to through composed piece, which is a piece that you know, would have, if your sections are lettered, it would just be a, B, c, d, e, f, g and it would never, never repeat. It would just go from one section together. So I kind of set out in this structure of writing this thing that would never repeat, but then that didn't happen. I ended up repeating a couple sections, but it still has this kind of longer development and all these different sections and I have so much fun playing that like too much fun playing that song live. Um, I need the help of my band to play it because there's so much, so many layers going on that, uh, to, to otherwise I would just be pressing a button and singing to tracks. Um, but I, I love playing that song live and seeing how people are connecting with it physically is cool too.

Speaker 12:         31:01          When are you playing in the area? I just

Speaker 11:         31:03          played in the area. Just miss me. Yeah. I just had my homecoming show. Um, uh, a couple, like a week ago or something. I just finished my first ever headline, a national tour.

Speaker 12:         31:14          That's fantastic. Yeah. Thanks. Where did you, where'd you go? All over the U S I went to Canada. Um, drove from coast to coast, went to the south. Amazing. Went to the middle. I went to the west, went to the east once of the north. I watched all the directions I need to ask performance. You must have done that in the middle of there. I did that. I think the summer they play tape them an advance. Oh yeah. That was fun. There was, must be so much fun. I was really nervous in the NPR tiny desk performances. I love them. I was very nervous, but we got it. We got through it. Yeah. It was probably a little nerve wracking in that space. It is.

Speaker 11:         31:48          Then also, you know, there's, yeah, it's a lot of heavy music cats in there, you know, that have played there and that work there. So it was like, whoa. Yeah. But we got through it.

Speaker 12:         31:58          Yeah. Um, speaking of heavy music cats, now I've asked you this question, but you said that who would be the one person, the one musician that you haven't met yet that, oh, that would be most inspiring and, and you know, cause you to write more and, mm. She told me that one before. You can think about it. While I'm going to ask Julie, ask if anyone in the room has any questions or anything more you'd like to hear or that you'd like to share with us?

Speaker 4:          32:33          Nope.

Speaker 12:         32:35          All right. Um, so when I was first through

Speaker 13:         32:40          a black Terry cat, um, I was thinking, okay, this is a little more political. Uh, but the thing that kind of turned me around on that, uh, was the song laugh clown, which you just performed. Um, so in the first line you talk about how, you know, you're letting your eyebrows grow back in and my mustache, mustache and your mustache as well. Yes. Um, and that, that kind of spun me around because

Speaker 4:          33:15          like

Speaker 13:         33:16          I found that political, but then I questioned why I found a political, because in effect, like as a default state, your body is a statement to the rest of society. And, uh, and that's really, uh, I think that also applies to some of some of your other statements like in Mexican chef that, you know, this isn't necessarily, uh, you going out to be political, but I see that, you know, in this society your body is political. Um, so could you comment to that at all?

Speaker 11:         34:04          Um, yeah. Well it is interesting. Thanks for the quick, they were great question by the way. Um, I think that by virtue of just being who I am, looking how I look and where I come from and being a woman, a lot of just observing and just saying what I see or what I've lived is political. You know, it's just as simple as that. But it may not be if someone else, you know, maybe if you were to say some of the, some thing that you saw or something that you lived, it may not be perceived as political, but just by virtue of me telling you my experience, it's political maybe because yeah, there are less people who look like me in certain contexts and situations that are expressing their lived experiences and things that they see. So, you know, that's one thing. And I think that, uh, this album is, this work is really personal.

Speaker 11:         35:12          It's, you know, the, um, the song laugh clown at that the beginning, I'm really talking more about like personal hygiene and the passage of time and how I'm, you know, I was also working through depression and grief and, um, and kind of having that, that the beginning for me personally is, is about, I'm just, I'm over it. Like I'm not even carry, like when I'm looking at myself, I'm like, Whoa, I didn't pluck my eyebrows, eyebrows for a month, like, what's going on? What's the deal? Um, but it's more about just being in that kind of state. Um, but I, but I am also in this album talking about brown girls and people of Color, um, Brown boys too. And, um, you know, talking about body issues. I have a song called, I won't say where I quote a piece from one of my heroes. Maybe that's who I would like to meet.

Speaker 11:         36:11          Abby Lincoln, um, vocalist. Um, she was a contemporary of Billie holiday, but she's a little bit less well known, um, and Abby's work and voices so rich and so beautiful and has a lot to say, a lot of commentary about things that she's lived and seen. Um, and she wrote an essay that was published in a, it was called Negro digest at the time, I think it might be ebony now. Um, and it's called who will review the black woman. And it was talking about, uh, how in our society, the black woman is kind of disposable and thrown away and not champion and her, her nose is too wide and her, you know, her feet are too flat and her face is too black and all this kind of thing. So in this, and I cite some of that in my song, I won't say, and I'm dealing with some of these body image issues and that are universal regardless of your ethnicity, you know, but of of um, feeling like you don't fit in, you know, just all that be kind of universal things. But so ultimately this work is very personal for me, um, more even more so than, than political. But it's the other, if the others who do the other thing, it's the others who say that it, you know, I'm being political but I'm just, you know, sharing my, my personal experience. I don't know if that answers your question, but it's a couple of thoughts. Thank you. Yeah, thank you.

Speaker 12:         37:43          Hey. Hi. Um, first I just wanted to say, this is kind of weird for me because earlier this week I found out you were coming and I was just like, oh shit. And I got here really early cause I was like, this place is going to be tagged. I can't believe she's coming here. And now I'm just like, apparently I have to tell everyone to listen to you because they haven't already. Um, but I was wondering two things. Um, first have you always lived in Brooklyn or, um, I guess just wondering about like where you grew up and how that like influenced you. Um, thank you. Also wandering, you're just more of your musical influences I think. I don't know if you listened to it, but I kind of, I'm reminded of like early Virgina Specter sometimes with your like vocal. Yeah,

Speaker 11:         38:36          I see that activity or like, I dunno. It's, it's nice. Cool. Thank you. Um, yeah, tell everybody to listen to me. It's all good. It's all g net. We're going to spread the word happy. Happy to be here. Um, I, I'm not from Brooklyn originally. I've lived here in New York City for 10 years, so I guess that's, that's a cutoff that makes you the real New Yorker, right? Like 10 I heard, I dunno, whatever, but I give it to New York. You have to like, do you actually really hardy place? Like, if you can make it two years in New York, I think you are safe to call yourself a New Yorker. Okay. I've been living here for 20 well so you are definitely the real deal too. So you got me beat two and a bit. Well, I'm 24 time flies when you're time flying life. Um, yeah, so I'm, I was born in Hartford, Connecticut, so there's just two hours north of here, smack dab in the middle of the, of the state of Connecticut.

Speaker 11:         39:40          Um, and I've lived my whole life here in the northeast of the states. Um, and I guess the majority of my life and Hartford and that is a very, um, oppressed city, uh, financially and culturally. Um, which is ironic pieces in like one of the richest states in the country. But um, there, there's a lot of poverty. Um, there's a lot of cultural oppression. There's not much going on, um, arts wise, although, you know, folks are always constantly working to change that. Um, but, uh, very racially segregated city, um, very large Hispanic community that lives there. Um, my mom is from Puerto Rico and my father was from Cuba and they met in Hartford of all places. I'm like, really? I couldn't grow it up. And when the beautiful Caribbean island, um, but so that's where they met. And in the 70s, there was an effort to recruit, uh, laborers for the industries.

Speaker 11:         40:52          In Hartford. There was a cult, huge Colt, uh, weapons manufacturing companies, huge, uh, industries in Hartford. And they needed people to come and work, um, probably on the cheap side in, in, in these factories. So they actually went to Puerto Rico to recruit workers and offer them housing. And I think I have to do more research and I'm very curious on this topic and I hope to be able to do it soon. But I think that was how the ghettos were built in Hartford. And I always wondered like, how did all of these Puerto Ricans, I ended up here and in this cold place, you know, the cold and friendly kind of climate. Um, and my mom was always like, oh, you know, it's like somebody's cousin said it was, there was work there or somebody on. It's always like somebody, family member told them, um, to go for work.

Speaker 11:         41:40          Uh, but, but I've recently read, read that about kind of like this recruitment effort in the 70s, which makes sense of why so many Latinos, but, but that's where I grew up. Um, and I couldn't wait to leave, you know, and I spent a lot of my teenage years, I guess as many peop many of us do, like wanting to get away from, you know, where I was. My family was great and very supportive and very loving and came from a very loving, supportive home. Not Musicians, no one in my family as a musician, but music lovers, they love to dance. They play music at all the family functions, um, as many Caribbean folks do. So I grew up dancing to satisfy, I grew up listening to classical music. My father, uh, who was the Cuban, my Cuban side. Um, he grew up listening to the radio, classical music he discovered on the radio in Havana.

Speaker 11:         42:32          And, uh, he had a lifelong love of classical music and for him, modern music was like Stravinsky or something. So he wasn't sure like what I'm trying to do. But, but uh, when you started playing music? Well, I, he took me to the, like a toy store and there was a piano in there, I guess when I was like four and I supposedly sat down on the piano and really couldn't stop playing. I don't know if it was me who did that or if it was him because he had always wanted to be a pianist. Um, but in that time it wasn't acceptable for men in that community to be artists because it would imply that something about their sexuality or, um, it just wasn't an acceptable career choice. And Cuba in his, in his community. I don't know if that's true for all of all of when he was in Cuba, not after he, no, no.

Speaker 11:         43:19          Yeah. As a child, when he was growing up, maybe it was something in his household or, um, his dad was not a classical music fan. He would say that some music for, for dead people, like don't play that one. I'm here or whatever. But, um, so anyway, my dad says that I couldn't, you know, stop playing the piano. So he got me the piano. I was like, couldn't wait. He's like, well, she's going to be a pianist or like, she's going to be an opera singer. And, uh, but then I, I was like, I really like Mariah Carey actually. I just want to, I just want to like, ah, I just want to do more. I carry songs all day. And he didn't, he was like, if you want to be like Maria caddy, you need to learn how to, you know, uh, read music. I was like, really?

Speaker 11:         43:56          You sure can. I just not. So, um, so he encouraged me to, to, to choose another instrument aside from voice to learn also how to read music. And so I started, you know, lessons and he, he, uh, like met people at my school. He was always into something trying to encourage me to, to be musical and met somebody at the school who was able to fund a scholarship for me to study privately. And that's how I learned how to, uh, to read music. Yeah. And some of my musical influences, I mean our la, I grew up listening to classical music. Ravel is one of my favorites. Um, it has beautiful piano Sonatas and uh, hip hop I talked about earlier, j Dilla. Um, it was important for me to discover Bjork. Um, when I was in my twenties, which I, when I first heard her album post, I was like, what is, I don't understand what this is. I hadn't ever listen to electronic music. I didn't know what that meant. I didn't know what she was doing. It took me like a good year to really kind of come back and realize the depth of, you know, her compositions and her sound world. And that was really inspiring to me too. So that's great. Another question. Hi.

Speaker 14:         45:08          So music is brilliant. One of the main reasons I ended up moving to New York, and especially like listening to bootlegs from places like Arlene's grocery and places like that or Jeff Buckley playing at Shinay. Uh, but a lot of those places are gone or you know, do they still exist but they're in a different location. And I'm kinda curious what your favorite places are to play around the city or to see new music that you were discovering.

Speaker 11:         45:34          Oh yeah, that's a great question. Um, there's a new newish to venue in Brooklyn called C'mon everybody. Uh, that has a really, uh, great kind of curatorial program, a lot of diverse, uh, groups playing there. It's not one, it's not specific to one style or one social scene. I feels like there's a lot of different kinds of music coming coming through there. Um, and it's a new space and, um, very welcoming space. Um, it feels like a safe space for people to, to gather. So I really liked going there. Um, it's one of my favorite, favorite venues to just kind of hang out at and check out music. Um, Trans Pecos in Ridgewood is also a really great venue. Um, that's run by Todd P, kind of a famous promoter who, uh, kind of came up doing a lot of punk shows and DIY shows. Um, he, he runs Trans Pecos and also the market hotel that just recently reopened. Right. I'm also in Brooklyn. Um, so there are a lot of great venues, um, to check out music, uh, check out music at, um, I guess one of my favorite spaces that I've ever played in New York best that I love the sound of his Bowery ballroom. I think that room sounds incredible. And the house engineer, I agree, he's a legend. Like, you know, such a, such a pleasure to, to work there. And, uh, I just, I love that, the sound of that room a lot.

Speaker 12:         47:02          Thanks. Sure that it's actually a great question because I was going to Shanae and Arlene's and brownies. Um, you know, it was like there was a scene in, in the East village and then it moves further down to Ludlow and then Orleans opened and Shinay closed and everything gets kind of kept moving south. And, um, and then it moved into Brooklyn. In the 10 years that you've been here, have you seen a radical shift? I mean, I spent some in La, I spend time in Nashville and there's been a little bit of an exodus, it feels, um, for musicians and artists from, from this area. Oh yeah. Do you sense that? Oh, absolutely.

Speaker 11:         47:40          Yeah, definitely. I mean, uh, when I moved here 10 years ago, you know, the Williamsburg of today has nothing to do with the Williamsburg of even 10 years ago. And I don't even know before that, who knows? But, um, yeah, I used to hang out a lot in Williamsburg. I had some, my first shows, they're at this place, um, that was called Galapagos, that used to be on north sixth street right next to, what is it a now music hall of Williamsburg. Then they moved to Dumbo. Um, and then, uh, there's a big article of them like moving to Detroit and buying an, uh, a fabulous, you know, building in Detroit for, for like $5 or something. So there's all that. Yeah, that kind of stuff going down for sure. And the last 10 years. And um, lots of great venues, glass lands on North on.

Speaker 11:         48:25          Um, oh Geez. On Kent mentality, that whole scene there with glass, there was another place called monkey town. That was my hangout. Um, that place was wild. It was like this cube room really small. You can probably feel like 30 people in there maybe or maybe, I don't believe it was a hundred, I don't know. But it was all these video walls, you know, that you were surrounded by and then these couches and the, the artists would play in the middle and they would have like kind of this like video music sets like Dj sets. Um, and like mostly experimental stuff like late night vibes. Um, but with such a great space and so many, so many great venues that have moved on and don't exist any more. But there are, there are new new places play. But of course a lot of a recording studio is also have, you know, shut down and moved away.

Speaker 11:         49:09          And um, you know, it's an expensive city. It's not an ain't cheap. We got all those services we were talking about earlier. It's cheap. You know, it's, it's, it's not cheap to live here so that it's not conducive to, uh, folks who are maybe trying something new and starting new adventures or new businesses. It can be a little challenging, um, certainly when, when real estate is pricey, when, when your rent is too damn high. I don't know if he can say that on here, but, um, you know, that, that's the vibe for sure. But there, but there are still, you know, I, I, I love New York City. I love living here. I, I, um, met incredible people and I meet new, new people working on really exciting ideas a lot. And that's what keeps me here. Yeah. That's great. All right, well, thank you so much for being with us. Thank you. Fantastic. Thanks for having me.

Speaker 4:          49:59          Great.
