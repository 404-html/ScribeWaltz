1
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.730
[inaudible] welcome

2
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.610
<v 0>to Google.
Thanks very much.
Yeah,
so a phenomenal,</v>

3
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.070
uh,
it comes out on February 23rd,
um,
globally.
And so,
uh,

4
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.410
we're super excited.
Um,
so this is based on a novel.
Um,

5
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.470
and so by Jeff Vandermeer has a trilogy southern reach.
Um,

6
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.630
so I want to talk about a little bit about when was your first time when you

7
00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:35.090
discovered the book or read the Book and,
uh,
what attracted you to it?

8
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.690
It was sent to me by,
I'm a producer.

9
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:43.290
I just worked with him on this movie x Makena and um,
uh,

10
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:44.540
I was in post production,

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.820
so editing and so on of x Makena he sent me a book and he said,
uh,

12
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.450
you should take a look at this.
And,
um,

13
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.070
I read it and uh,

14
00:00:55.071 --> 00:01:00.071
and I sort of decided as I was reading it that I'd like to give it a try at

15
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.080
adapting it.
Um,
uh,
it had two particular things.

16
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.140
It's genuinely original as a book and that is unusual in itself because,

17
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:14.240
uh,

18
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.240
most stories that we encounter in literature and in cinema and in television

19
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.010
actually repeats of stories that we tell ourselves.
Again,
and again and again,

20
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:25.970
for whatever reason,

21
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.450
it's like a form of reassurance or a ritual that we need or enjoy or something.

22
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.500
And this wasn't like that.
It just stepped outside it completely.

23
00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:39.710
So first off it was original and it also had a very,

24
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:42.940
very powerful,
strange atmosphere.
The,

25
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.080
the reading of the book is a little bit like having a dream and,

26
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.170
um,
uh,
that was also very unusual.

27
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.620
It presented a lot of issues in terms of how you adapt it.

28
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.070
I've worked on adaptations before,
uh,

29
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.060
where you have a certain kind of narrative that you're almost cutting and

30
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:06.320
pasting the narrative.
Uh,
and,
uh,
this,

31
00:02:06.321 --> 00:02:08.000
I couldn't see how it would function like that,

32
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:13.001
but the thing that attracted me to it was true originality and this crazy,

33
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.080
dreamy,
trippy atmosphere.
Right.
And,
um,
you know,
you,
you wrote her novel,

34
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:21.200
the beach back in the 1990s,
and until that long time ago,

35
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.670
and it was a debit into a film.
So what was your experience like now,

36
00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:26.391
kind of on the reverse?

37
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:29.790
So you had your book could dip it into a film and now you're adapting a book.
Uh,

38
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.550
well,
I don't know.
I mean

39
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.460
that was 20 something years ago.
It was a long time ago.

40
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.410
And I've been working in film.

41
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:42.950
I basically stopped writing books and I started writing films and working in

42
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:44.420
film.
Um,

43
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.610
over that period of time I'd done I think three adaptations,

44
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.440
uh,
as films that got made.
At any rate,
um,
one was never let me go.

45
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.860
Uh,
which was an adaptation of a book.
One was dread,

46
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.380
which was an adaptation of British comic strip character called judge dread from

47
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:04.860
a sort of anthology series called 2008 d.

48
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.440
And then there was this annihilation that was the third one.

49
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.740
And in each case it was different.
Never let me go.

50
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:15.850
Very almost slavish adaptation of the book,

51
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.210
um,
uh,
dread,
uh,

52
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.620
is like a set in a big Saifai world.
I work in a low budget arena.

53
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:27.670
I can't really do that stuff.
So I was faithful to the character.

54
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.070
It was an adaptation of the character.

55
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:33.550
And in this instance it was like an adaptation of the atmosphere,

56
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.260
I would say broadly as that's very broad.
What was it like?
It was really,

57
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:42.880
really hard.
I mean,
it was seriously difficult.
Um,
but,
uh,

58
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.920
that's okay.
That's,
um,
as the job.
What about Jeff Vandermeer?
So the,

59
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:50.320
you know,
the original author of the book,
Do what,
did you work with him?

60
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.050
Did you get any advice from him that you clear out the clear anything with him?

61
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:56.110
Or did he kind of say,
yeah,
I can do what you definitely are because,

62
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.880
because having,
having written novels years ago and had them adapted,

63
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.160
uh,
and really what I am as a writer,
but that when I think of what my job is,

64
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:08.710
I'd say I'm a writer.
And so I,

65
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.810
I feel an affinity with the writer of the book and a kind of duty,
uh,
to them.

66
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.700
And what I said to Jeff was,
I'm not going to,
I was upfront,
I said,

67
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:22.120
I'm not going to be able to do a beat by beat adaptation this cause I don't know

68
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:26.470
how to do it.
Somebody else might be able to do it,
but it's not me.
And so in a,

69
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.310
in a sense,
partly what I needed from Jeff was his blessing,
his permission.

70
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.320
And then I wrote a screenplay and I showed it to him.
That was it.
Yup.
Yup.

71
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.840
And it's,
it's crazy cause it have,

72
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.710
how many of you guys read the book but people were there and called the book is

73
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.090
I just read it and I was spraying because the characters don't have names.

74
00:04:45.091 --> 00:04:49.740
They're just go by counteracting that biologists have a psychologist.
Right.

75
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.070
And so,
um,
and do that in the film while I'm used to writing it.
Yeah.

76
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.660
You didn't character names,
especially when you don't need them.

77
00:04:55.661 --> 00:05:00.610
But what I figured was,
um,
if you didn't have names,

78
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.870
because we use names when we're talking to each other and if you completely

79
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.370
avoided that in a film,
it might feel arch,
you know,

80
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.330
it might feel like an affectation.
And in a book,
it,

81
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.960
I think because it's such a sort of internal first person bucket,

82
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.400
it doesn't matter.
And it's actually kind of cool.
But in a film I didn't,

83
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.120
I didn't want it to feel mannered in that way,
so I just gave them names.

84
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.240
And so,
uh,
x mark in our,
um,
which you worked on before,
the subs,

85
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.310
your first directorial debut.
Um,

86
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.600
what did you take away or learn from that funnels director that you brought over

87
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:38.470
to this film and what was easier for us or nothing?
Nothing.
Fair enough.

88
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.210
Uh,
basically any way the job never changes.
I,

89
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.850
I,
I find myself repeating this again and again,
but it's because of,

90
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.170
I think it's the way we perceive film,
which is as a pyramid structure.

91
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:56.290
And at the top of the pyramid is a director and it's,

92
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.740
it's just my personal experience of filmmaking.
Um,

93
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.300
uh,
I don't really like pyramid structures anyway.
I have to say they're not,

94
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.570
they're not my scene,
but,
um,
uh,

95
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.810
I would see it more like a mountain range,

96
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.530
a mountain range with a kind of parallax effect happening.

97
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.820
So sometimes one mountain feels more prevalent than another,

98
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:24.370
and then you shift your perspective and everything's different.
Um,
and,
uh,

99
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.440
that has always been the case at different times in the process in development

100
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:35.000
shooting postproduction the parallax is shifting.

101
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.080
That didn't change before x Makena after.
Um,
and,

102
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.710
and the truest way I can say it is that it's a collective.
Uh,

103
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.930
I work in a collective and it's a group of people.

104
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:50.390
Some of them I've worked with for 20 years.
Uh,

105
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.560
some people come in new and then they have to learn the vibe of how the

106
00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:58.610
collective works together.
Um,
I'm not saying this is lip service,

107
00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:01.730
it's literally true.
Uh,
uh,
it's,

108
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.360
it's something like a version of anarchy.
Uh,
it,
it's,

109
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:06.950
but it's not anarchy as chaos.

110
00:07:06.951 --> 00:07:11.930
It's anarchy where you have a collective of autonomous bodies who are all

111
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:16.400
working towards the same goal.
And,
uh,
that,
that's the sort of methodology.

112
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.480
Um,

113
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.460
so I never sort of quote unquote coax a performance out of an actor.

114
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.330
The actor is responsible for their performance.
After we do a lineup,

115
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.920
a rehearsal and all the crew comes in to see what the blocking looks like.

116
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.731
Uh,

117
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:35.750
I then turned to the dop and I don't say put a camera here and put that lens on

118
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:38.300
it and move it like this.
I say,
how do you want to shoot it?

119
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.930
And that is the whole process the whole way through.
Wow.
And,
um,

120
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.000
so you talked about,
you know,
working with a lot of same people and,
and,

121
00:07:46.001 --> 00:07:47.450
and kind of building up your crew.

122
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.340
You're without Oscar Isaac on x mocking out and he brought him back for this.

123
00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:55.670
So what was um,
or it came back and gets bored.
What was,

124
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.430
when did you guys meet and what kind of,
why don't you to,
to reap cast again?

125
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.350
That's just a good partner.
We met in x Makena um,

126
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.440
trying to find the right cost and Oscar is a bunch of things.

127
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.230
Um,
you know,
part of what I'm saying,

128
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:16.880
part of what I just said before relies on likeminded people.
Okay.

129
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:21.080
So if you're not going to fit into that vibe,
it's not going to work.
Um,

130
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.520
and uh,

131
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.630
Oscar fits into that very naturally because he's a very self possessed actor.

132
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.220
Um,
he,
he thinks about it on his own.
He comes to a conclusion,

133
00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:35.900
he arrives between takes,
he varies the takes.
Um,
he says,

134
00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:37.850
I want to try it like this.
And then he tries it like that.

135
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.600
So it's partly that he's just flat out brilliant actor.

136
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.740
He's very self possessed.
He's also a good guy to have around.
He's very witty.

137
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.620
He's got a fantastic sense of humor.
He's kind of relaxed,
um,

138
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.630
like what's not to like,
yeah.
Now easily.
He's phenomenal.
He's phenomenal.

139
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.070
He's phenomenal.
Our next on you have

140
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.640
<v 2>an incredible cast with Natalie Portman and who plays lead junior Rodriguez,</v>

141
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:04.300
Tessa Thompson,
um,
Jennifer,
Jason Leigh,
and so brilliant.

142
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.550
Yeah,
no,
and it's,
it's a phenomenal,
a phenomenal cast.

143
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:12.120
So when you're casting your lead and you're kind of looking at the characters in

144
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:15.570
the book and then you're trying to adapt that to,
to what your vision is,
where,

145
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.030
how did you land on,
especially with Natalie being the lead,

146
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:19.030
how'd you find her and,

147
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.710
and what qualities did she bring to that where you're like,
this is,

148
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.760
<v 0>this is my Lena Wah Wah Notley has as an actor is,</v>

149
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:32.410
uh,
she's got these two concurrent things going on at the same time.

150
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.600
One of them is an enormous amount of poise.
Um,
she's,

151
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:38.620
she's kind of,

152
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:43.710
she has a powerful presence in her behavior,

153
00:09:43.841 --> 00:09:47.620
in the way she looks in this sort of aura around her and all that kind of stuff.

154
00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:52.500
I'm talking about primarily talking about in terms of performance,
um,

155
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.480
because obviously that's the thing that is on the screen and that's what you're

156
00:09:55.481 --> 00:09:58.850
looking for.
But she also has something else,
uh,

157
00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:03.990
which is she has the ability to demonstrate damage between the cracks.

158
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:09.990
And so as well as having all of these actually rather intimidating features,

159
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:15.580
uh,
there's something she can tap into which is broken and,

160
00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:20.080
uh,
um,
explosive,
uh,
and,

161
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.240
and kind of wild.
Um,

162
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:27.450
and so there's a sort of subversion inside her and that made her exactly right

163
00:10:29.021 --> 00:10:30.190
for this particular character.

164
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.670
<v 2>Yeah.
And she's absolutely been with the entire cast is just so well,</v>

165
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.330
well Castin and,
and so well chosen and phenomenal.

166
00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:39.710
And the movie is just,

167
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.710
it's crazy where we talked about this a little confident where it's just,

168
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:47.660
it's really weird.
It's a mind numbing thing and it's phenomenal.
Like it's so,
so,

169
00:10:47.661 --> 00:10:52.470
so freaking good.
Cooler.
Um,
where I was,

170
00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:56.150
was there any kind of know,
but what,
was there any kind of like,
no,
it's,
it's,

171
00:10:56.151 --> 00:10:59.570
it's smell,
but like was there any inspiration in terms of the store,

172
00:10:59.571 --> 00:11:00.710
cause it did change from the novel.

173
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.370
Where did you kind of pull from in terms of what it,

174
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.260
was it the story you were arresting him for a while or did it just kind of

175
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.310
evolve as you are right now?

176
00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.630
<v 0>There was two things.</v>

177
00:11:08.631 --> 00:11:12.530
I think always when I'm working there's something that's obsessing me for some

178
00:11:12.531 --> 00:11:14.360
reason or another.
Uh,

179
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:19.430
and in this case it was about self destruction.
Um,
I,

180
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.440
I had this kind of thing that I'd become,
uh,
aware of,

181
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:29.450
uh,
or I believe I'd become aware of which was that,
um,

182
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.940
uh,
everyone I know,
uh,
and I would speculate,

183
00:11:34.941 --> 00:11:39.020
everybody in the room at the moment is self destructive.

184
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.420
And,
um,

185
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.660
you meet some people and their self destruction is very apparent.

186
00:11:44.661 --> 00:11:49.110
They almost offer it up to you.
Uh,
they're an alcoholic.
They're a heroin addict.

187
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.000
They keep,
uh,
committing crimes.
They're recidivist or whatever it,

188
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.320
and you can see it.
It's,
it's sort of demonstrated.

189
00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:01.030
And then you also meet people who are very confident,

190
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:05.890
comfortable in their own skin,
they've got a great job,
they earn a lot of money,

191
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:10.891
they have a fantastic family and you feel always slightly on the back foot

192
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.600
because those people are intimidating.

193
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.800
And you also feel that they have cracked life in some kind of way.

194
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:22.210
They've cracked it.
And then if you become very close to one of those people,

195
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.240
you discover odd fishes here and there and you discover very strange bits of

196
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.610
meaningless self,
destructive behavior.

197
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.810
And it was the meaninglessness of the self destructive behavior that I found

198
00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:39.140
interesting.
And,
uh,
people are the,

199
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.620
you know,
even the sort of supernaturally,
uh,

200
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.530
pre possessed person is,

201
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.760
is sort of dismantling their job or they're dismantling of friendship or they're

202
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:52.040
dismantling their marriage.
And,
uh,
and,

203
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.240
and so that became the kind of fixation that was overlaid onto this film.

204
00:12:57.461 --> 00:13:01.760
It is basically a film about self destruction and it has a kind of thesis within

205
00:13:01.761 --> 00:13:05.890
a about why we do that.
Um,
and uh,
and the,

206
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:10.060
the various forms in which it takes,
I suppose.
Um,

207
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:15.390
and then in terms of overlaying that onto Jeff's really beautiful novel,

208
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:21.430
uh,
which is about another kind of destruction,
more eco the planet.
Um,

209
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:26.650
uh,
I thought reading this book is like a dream.
So,

210
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.310
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to adapt to it like a dream.

211
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.520
I'm not going to reread the book,

212
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:38.680
I'm going to adapt it for my memory of the book.
And,
uh,

213
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.560
and in a way that was what Jeff gave me permission to do.

214
00:13:41.561 --> 00:13:46.150
So in some places it will correlate very closely in another places it won't,

215
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:51.040
um,
you tap into that feeling that you got from the book versus just how it's a

216
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:56.040
dream response to a dream book kind of.
And uh,
and it,

217
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.410
and it's an interesting thing as well because then it becomes about the nature

218
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:01.660
of memory,
I think to an extent as well.

219
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:06.160
I years and years ago I was watching some TV show and there was a cop talking

220
00:14:06.161 --> 00:14:09.550
about eye witnesses and he said,
I witnessed as a useless,
like,

221
00:14:09.551 --> 00:14:12.820
forget about everyone thinks an eye witnesses the best thing you can have in

222
00:14:12.821 --> 00:14:15.100
solving a crime.
But it's like the worst and,

223
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.410
and what you need is empirical evidence,

224
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:19.330
fingerprints and DNA and stuff like that.

225
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:24.810
And he was saying someone runs into a restaurant and there's a violent crime and

226
00:14:25.481 --> 00:14:26.141
someone's killed.

227
00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:29.710
And one eye witness will say he had a gun shot five times and another one will

228
00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:33.280
say shot once.
Another one would say there wasn't a gun,
it was a knife.
And He,

229
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.650
you,
you can't really rely on memory.

230
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:40.120
And actually in my life I've often observed that's true.
Um,

231
00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.830
and uh,
so it was sort of making that application of that,

232
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:49.540
that thing about subjectivity or suppose to,
uh,
to the story.

233
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.010
And so it's,
it's a

234
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.810
<v 2>beautiful film,
beautifully shot.
And the set design steps.</v>

235
00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.020
I want to talk a little bit about that in terms of where was it shot?

236
00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.670
How did you expand upon using practical effects and practical set design versus

237
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:02.504
Cgi,

238
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.430
<v 0>uh,
were shot.
So,</v>

239
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:10.590
so one of the things about this movie was to make everything off,
you know,

240
00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:15.870
kind of,
it starts in a suburban setting and it ends in a psychedelic setting.

241
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:20.340
This is suburbia to Psychedelia story.
And,
uh,

242
00:15:20.341 --> 00:15:23.640
so the awfulness,
how you get the quality of awfulness was,

243
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.360
was an important part of it.
And,
um,
uh,

244
00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:30.420
so what we did was we,
uh,

245
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.420
rather than shoot it,

246
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.870
it's notionally set somewhere on a coastal part of North America,

247
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:41.850
Florida Ish.
Right.
Um,
and we could have shown it in northern Florida,

248
00:15:41.851 --> 00:15:43.350
we could have showed it in Louisiana.

249
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.770
He's got a good tax break and all that kind of thing.
Um,

250
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.820
but we ended up shooting it in England,
just outside London,

251
00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:56.090
and we dressed an English forest to look kind of like a distorted version of a

252
00:16:00.061 --> 00:16:03.930
North American bit of southern,
southern,
North American coastline.

253
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:09.320
And in the hope it would give us some of the otherness we were looking for a

254
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.470
rightness and wrongness.
And I think I,
you know,
I kind of think it did.

255
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.610
<v 2>Yeah.
No,
it's,
it's great.
Um,
when you are,
um,</v>

256
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.320
working with sings like that and stuff,
because it's a very complicated film.

257
00:16:21.321 --> 00:16:25.670
There's a lot going on.
There are monsters.
So I guess I could call her animals.

258
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.870
Yeah.
Evoke a animals.
And,
um,
so when you're working with that,
was there any,

259
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.733
what was the most,
I guess,

260
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:35.270
difficult scene that you had to work with or get right?
Uh,
or challenging?

261
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:40.650
<v 0>The film got progressively more difficult because there's a kind of contract</v>

262
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.220
that is in a way made with the audience at the beginning of the film,

263
00:16:44.221 --> 00:16:46.560
which is that this is going to end in a strange place.

264
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.030
And Creating Strangeness in a Film Is Complicated.
Um,

265
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.050
partly because like Jeff's normally it has to be original.
Um,

266
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.400
and so we had to find out where we sourced that strangeness and the,

267
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.050
that that was part of the question.

268
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.860
And also strangeness itself has a kind of diminishing return.

269
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.920
So if you start a story strange and end it strange,

270
00:17:07.921 --> 00:17:09.180
by the time you get to the end,

271
00:17:09.181 --> 00:17:12.810
you're kind of a climatized to the strangeness and it's actually lost the

272
00:17:12.811 --> 00:17:17.790
quality that you specifically wanted at the end.
So,
uh,
hence suburbia,

273
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.890
starting in a suburban setting and,

274
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:26.110
and progressively giving a film a nudge forward into a more and more hopefully

275
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.740
earned,
uh,
hallucinated a hallucinogenic kind of state.

276
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.200
Okay.

277
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.850
<v 2>Um,
and we're going to go into court just a few minutes.
If you guys want this,</v>

278
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.651
there's a Mike there.

279
00:17:36.651 --> 00:17:40.040
Do you want to stand there and just make sure you flip it on?
Um,
but uh,

280
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:41.640
when you are,
um,

281
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.590
when you're obviously crept in the film and you're shooting it and then again,

282
00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:45.200
editorial,

283
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.640
was there anything that you have to cut for time or for pacing that you wished

284
00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.070
you could've kept in it or was everything was in there

285
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.510
<v 0>that you want to do?</v>

286
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:56.070
The part of the job is making sure that the end cap,

287
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.840
the end thing is the thing that the collective was working towards and being

288
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:03.870
respectful of that.
And uh,

289
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.880
that can involve a conflict sometimes,
but um,

290
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:09.480
uh,

291
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:14.480
but you got to stay true to the thing that you intended to do and um,

292
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.480
uh,
so nothing is on the cutting room floor that should have been in there and

293
00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:21.600
nothing's in there that shouldn't be in there as a collective.
We,

294
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.580
we are judged on the final product.

295
00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.690
So you better respect the final products and do it the way you meant it.

296
00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:28.151
<v 2>Right.</v>

297
00:18:28.151 --> 00:18:32.500
And were there any directors or films kind of when you were growing up that

298
00:18:32.501 --> 00:18:35.650
helped kind of inspire you to become the director that you are one of the

299
00:18:35.651 --> 00:18:36.580
reasons that you are as well

300
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.710
<v 3>loads?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
um,</v>

301
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.770
uh,

302
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.640
<v 0>the first film I ever made a really strong impact on me was probably apocalypse</v>

303
00:18:46.641 --> 00:18:47.474
now.

304
00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.570
<v 3>Um,
uh,</v>

305
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.910
<v 0>I also love the first alien movie.</v>

306
00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.510
I think it's just an incredibly beautifully constructed,

307
00:18:55.511 --> 00:18:59.950
intelligent bit of filmmaking and,
and subversive as well.

308
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.650
I think I like films that are subversive,
you know,

309
00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:07.790
I like things that work within Georgia and then fuck with a jeweler in some way.

310
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.010
Yeah,
it's great.

311
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.590
<v 2>Um,
you mentioned kind of the anarchic,
uh,</v>

312
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.380
uh,
environment that you work in when you make your films.

313
00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:23.740
Does that bleed into when you write or is writing totally solo.

314
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.520
And then my second question is,
now that you've done writing,

315
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:32.030
directing and both,
do you have a preference?

316
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.143
<v 3>Uh,</v>

317
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.660
<v 0>no preference.
I think it's the same job basically.</v>

318
00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.580
And in terms of the solo aspect,
yeah.
You start writing on your own.

319
00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:48.020
You do.
Uh,
one of the first surprise is I had with writing,

320
00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:52.820
actually I've been doing it about 25 years.
And one of the first surprises,

321
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.390
this sound like a stupid thing to say,
but I realized you never get promoted.

322
00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.970
Like there's no ladder.

323
00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:04.400
You move up because it always begins with a blank page.
And uh,

324
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:08.710
that was sort of a shock bizarrely.
You know,
I thought something would happen.
Um,

325
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.360
but it doesn't.
Um,
so,
so you,

326
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.810
you start on your own but it,

327
00:20:14.811 --> 00:20:19.280
then it then stops and it becomes part of the collective for various reasons.

328
00:20:19.281 --> 00:20:24.281
One is that the script is effectively parceled out to different departments,

329
00:20:24.411 --> 00:20:24.861
production,

330
00:20:24.861 --> 00:20:29.780
design and wardrobe and VFX and special effects and all that kind of stuff.

331
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:35.000
And all of those people are bringing their interpretation to it.
Also,

332
00:20:35.001 --> 00:20:40.001
what happens is actors get involved and you are not the possessor of the

333
00:20:40.461 --> 00:20:43.520
character.
And he more,
when the actor becomes involved,

334
00:20:43.521 --> 00:20:48.010
it's actually their character.
And what I've found with actors,

335
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.710
and this is true across the board,
hence the collective right,

336
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.770
is that they make it better.
They elevate it.
They,

337
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.270
they do things you just didn't think of.

338
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:03.540
And the first movie I ever worked on the phone on the first one I ever wrote was

339
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:08.770
a Zombie movie 28 days later.
And there was an actor in it,
Brendan Gleeson,

340
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:12.640
and when he was doing the lines,

341
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.980
I kept hearing things that I had not intended or thought of or known about.

342
00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.100
And I realized right from the get go what,

343
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.930
what a good actor can do.
You know?
And so,
uh,

344
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.910
so yes,
it begins on your own,

345
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.600
but then really becomes like everything else in the film,

346
00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:35.440
which is part of a big conversation amongst the autonomous units.

347
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:37.390
Did you

348
00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.920
<v 2>go into writing wanting to be a director or did you just,</v>

349
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:45.990
<v 0>did that just come in my cabin like he just happened?
Yeah,
I,</v>

350
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.140
I didn't,
I didn't start writing,
wanting to be a writer.

351
00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:54.240
Like none of it was intentional.
Um,
uh,

352
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.040
I was a backpacker.
I started writing about backpacking that turned into a book,

353
00:21:59.041 --> 00:22:01.950
the book or made into a film.
I thought,
hang on a minute.

354
00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.290
You don't have to sit in a room on your own the whole time,

355
00:22:04.291 --> 00:22:09.060
you can be with a bunch of other people that I was working on films.
And then,
uh,

356
00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.850
gradually,
uh,
I,
in a funny way,

357
00:22:11.851 --> 00:22:16.851
I actually became a director to sort of get rid of the director in truth to just

358
00:22:17.641 --> 00:22:18.960
for the absence of the director.

359
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:20.830
<v 2>Uh,</v>

360
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:25.830
I've noticed personally that I tend to enjoy films and TV shows where the writer

361
00:22:26.621 --> 00:22:28.180
and director are one and the same.

362
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:32.150
And so I'm curious your perspective when you fill both roles,
what,

363
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:36.040
what advantage does that give you or maybe inversely if you're only doing one of

364
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:40.120
the two,
what handicaps and why is it that a powerful combination when your mind?

365
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.410
<v 0>Um,
I think,</v>

366
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.270
I mean immediately my brain starts filling with directors who are terrific.

367
00:22:48.271 --> 00:22:52.500
You don't,
right.
But I take your point and um,

368
00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.780
uh,
I think what it is is that in the end,

369
00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:02.990
probably the most useful thing that you can do on set is to be able to answer a

370
00:23:05.191 --> 00:23:06.024
question.

371
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:11.300
So if somebody is puzzled over why this bit of motivation is happening or why

372
00:23:11.521 --> 00:23:13.830
this thing should look like that or whatever it happens to be,

373
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.540
which happens to all of us,
right?

374
00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:18.480
You are confused about why you're doing the thing you were doing.

375
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.350
And if you are in the position of writing and directing,

376
00:23:22.351 --> 00:23:26.490
you're in a very good position to offer your opinion and informed opinion.

377
00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.340
Now that doesn't have to get observed,

378
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.560
but it does mean you can say something from a position of some,
uh,

379
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:38.280
personal knowledge.
And,
uh,
and I think that in,

380
00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:43.590
in,
and amongst the talents,
it's useful to have someone as a sounding board.
And,

381
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:48.800
and I think that often my job is on a day to day level is being someone you can

382
00:23:49.311 --> 00:23:53.120
have a conversation with.
It may be that,
but,

383
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:57.500
but then I'll tell you a lot,
wow.
Just,
there's no cookie cutter.
Right?

384
00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:01.220
And one thing I've learned is that you never know how a film is made.

385
00:24:01.221 --> 00:24:02.600
Whatever the credit say at the end.

386
00:24:02.601 --> 00:24:05.660
You never know how a film is made unless you worked on that film.

387
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:11.120
And I'm the processes with one group and not the process is with another and so

388
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.890
a different ball game with other people.
That's just me.

389
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:20.940
<v 4>Hi.
I'm going to bring it back to an isolation for a second because um,</v>

390
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:26.100
I was introduced to annihilation and the southern reach trilogy via the trailer

391
00:24:26.471 --> 00:24:29.230
and the teaser when I saw it and I just was blown away and was like,

392
00:24:29.231 --> 00:24:31.360
what is this thing?

393
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:35.710
And so I read all the books very sequentially and there's a little bit of

394
00:24:35.711 --> 00:24:40.150
unresolved ness,
not only about the first one but about all of them in general.

395
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.600
And I love that you said the dream state and then your dream of that is what I

396
00:24:43.601 --> 00:24:44.590
was drawn into.

397
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:50.100
And I'm curious to know how the other to either play into this or don't at all.

398
00:24:51.341 --> 00:24:53.310
It's kind of,
they don't touch it in any way

399
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.720
<v 0>that they really don't.
I mean it's partly because Jeff was writing the trilogy.</v>

400
00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.530
He was still actually writing it while I was writing the screenplay for the

401
00:25:01.531 --> 00:25:04.560
first.
But it's not,
it's not just that,

402
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.220
I mean that's just sort of factually the state of affairs.

403
00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.190
But it's also because I,

404
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:15.750
I don't want it to work on,
uh,
franchises.

405
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:20.780
Um,
I,
I have no judgment for people who do it.

406
00:25:20.781 --> 00:25:23.810
It's a completely personal position and it,

407
00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:28.650
and it doesn't stem from anything about the nature of franchises or sequels or

408
00:25:28.651 --> 00:25:32.460
anything like that.
It's because at the end of a three year process,

409
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.880
I know of myself already.
I will not want to work on it again.

410
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.880
<v 5>That's it.
Thank you.
Alex,</v>

411
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.630
you touched on this a little bit about the idea of having this thesis,
uh,

412
00:25:44.631 --> 00:25:48.950
in your,
in your films,
especially in this one that you,
you touched on.

413
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.890
Um,
how early does that come out in your writing process?

414
00:25:51.891 --> 00:25:55.190
Do you start with a thesis or did you sometimes discover it during the process?

415
00:25:55.191 --> 00:25:58.040
And if you could just maybe take us through the beginnings of a,

416
00:25:58.041 --> 00:26:02.720
of a story for your house,
how you start with it starts with a thesis.
Um,

417
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:08.070
<v 0>it will be some particular thing that I've started to get obsessed with and I'm</v>

418
00:26:08.751 --> 00:26:12.480
thinking about it in a repetitive,
compulsive way.
It's,

419
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:17.210
it's not really an intellectual process.
It's a compulsive process.
And,

420
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.850
uh,
um,
in,

421
00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:25.000
in the case of annihilation,
it was,
uh,
uh,

422
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.010
self destruction and uh,
this,

423
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.790
the odd qualities of self destruction and the odd places in which you find it.

424
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.680
And in the thing I'm working on at the moment,
uh,

425
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:38.920
it was a principle called determinism,
uh,

426
00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:44.060
a sort of product of living in a physical universe of cause and effect and,

427
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:49.620
uh,
some of the implications of that to do with freewill and,
uh,

428
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:54.870
un Un what potentially one could predict of actions and that kind of thing.

429
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.980
And so I get interested in that.
I start to read about it,

430
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.140
I start to,
uh,

431
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.760
I start to obsess and then at some point,

432
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.820
not intentionally a narrative arrives that inevitably is dovetailed to the thing

433
00:27:13.171 --> 00:27:14.790
I'm obsessed about at that moment.

434
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.820
And it's another reason why I don't work on sequels because,

435
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:23.280
because I want to be interested in something else and I will be interested in

436
00:27:23.281 --> 00:27:26.970
something else because I've gotten a limited capacity to be too,

437
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.170
to know much about anything,
right.
At a certain point.
So I feel,
okay,

438
00:27:31.171 --> 00:27:34.770
I've learned this up to my ability or I've explored out to my ability what's

439
00:27:34.771 --> 00:27:39.390
next?
Kind of,
it's not quite as present as that,
but it's,
you know,
more or less.

440
00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:41.973
Last question.

441
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.970
<v 6>Um,
nowadays I know that original content,</v>

442
00:27:47.971 --> 00:27:50.650
it's so hard to come by.
And so,
uh,

443
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:54.810
for you being a writer and coming up with original ideas and stuff like that,

444
00:27:54.811 --> 00:27:58.200
are you constantly thinking about,
you know,

445
00:27:58.201 --> 00:28:00.240
what the next original idea is going to be?

446
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.140
Or is it just one day something pops into your head and you just,
you know,

447
00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:08.980
<v 0>go for it?
Well,
in all honesty,
I'm not sure.</v>

448
00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.190
I think this is one of the reasons I was interested in Jeff's book is I'm not

449
00:28:12.191 --> 00:28:15.730
sure I do come up with original ideas.
I'm not sure that's what I do.

450
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:21.240
I think I often work with an existing ideas and sometimes then use the ability

451
00:28:23.081 --> 00:28:27.350
to subvert them or play around with them.
Um,
uh,

452
00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:31.420
so no,
I'm not thinking about what is the next original idea.

453
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.110
I wouldn't be able to think like that even if I wanted to.
Uh,

454
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.410
if I think back of the things I've written,
a spec scripts,

455
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:43.710
so say a film like 28 days later or a film like x Makena I can point you towards

456
00:28:44.231 --> 00:28:47.350
a lot of Zombie movies and I can point you towards a lot of movies that are

457
00:28:47.351 --> 00:28:51.010
concerned with artificial intelligence or the nature of sentience or

458
00:28:51.011 --> 00:28:55.480
objectification or whatever.
The,
the concern is within the thing.

459
00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:56.951
In a way,

460
00:28:56.951 --> 00:29:01.570
that's partly why I found the book annihilation so interesting is because maybe

461
00:29:01.571 --> 00:29:05.860
I lack the capacity to do that and Jeff has done that and that,
that's uh,

462
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:10.720
that's a,
that's like a honey to be no nectar.
They make honey.

463
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.290
So some sort of appropriate analogy

464
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:19.080
and a to wrap up,
uh,
as a,

465
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.810
a screen writer and novelist and director,

466
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.950
what piece of advice have you received that has been this kind of stuck with you

467
00:29:26.951 --> 00:29:27.784
over the years?

468
00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:33.973
<v 3>Um,</v>

469
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.143
<v 0>the only,</v>

470
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.770
the first bit of advice that came into my head was my dad when I was a kid

471
00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:43.360
saying,
you think someone's going to hit you hit them first.

472
00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.660
It was more just the general life lesson.
Fair enough.

473
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:55.580
I did doesn't apply.
It's just the only bit of advice.

474
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:03.240
I cannot top that.
So thank you so much for being here.

475
00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:06.880
Go Watch it.
It's phenomenal.
