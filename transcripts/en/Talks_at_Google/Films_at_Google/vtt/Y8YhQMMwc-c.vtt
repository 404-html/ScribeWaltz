1
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.811
Hi everyone again,

2
00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:12.380
is this Shilpa we're excited to bring to you the cast and crew here from Miss

3
00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:14.570
India America.
So let's give them a round of [inaudible]

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.433
<v 1>plus philosophy.</v>

5
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.190
<v 0>I'm suspending beside me.
We have Ravi [inaudible],</v>

6
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.040
the director and the writer of Miss India America alongside Mira,
who also,

7
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.900
um,
was played Gita in the,

8
00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.630
in the film and is also one of the writers for the film.

9
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.910
Tiaa the leading actress who plays the lead Prisaad Kosha who please sima,

10
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:39.911
Lily's best friend and the in the film we have mega and Sora who are the

11
00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:42.970
producers of the film.
So let's give him a round of applause.

12
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.913
<v 1>Yeah.
Just</v>

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.960
<v 0>so we all watched the film today.</v>

14
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:53.790
I've watched it personally about three times and I absolutely love it.
Um,

15
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.250
can you tell us a little bit about the inspiration behind the film and,

16
00:00:57.251 --> 00:00:58.950
and what you wanted to portray in it?

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.630
<v 2>It was,
uh,
you know,
Mira had a solo show called Miss Indian America,</v>

18
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:08.310
which mega produced,
um,
that was more of a,
it was,
uh,

19
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.780
it was based on your life [inaudible] lane and the,

20
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.150
but one of the worlds that mirror had experienced was the beauty pageant world.

21
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.670
Cause Mirror was a former Miss India,
California,

22
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.753
<v 3>right?</v>

23
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.960
The Indian beauty pageant that I lost the Miss India USA and it was very

24
00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:29.170
traumatic.
And so we had to write a movie about credit move so I could recover.

25
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.670
Ah,
not really.

26
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.790
<v 2>Well we really wanted to explore the theme of winning and ambition then</v>

27
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.940
particularly in the South Asian community as well.

28
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.730
And we thought a beauty pageant would be a perfect place to,
to,

29
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.070
to explore those themes.

30
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.330
<v 0>And you know,
we were talking about this earlier,
um,
before the film started.</v>

31
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.770
What a great timing to release this film.
Um,
Miss America,
as you know,

32
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:57.510
was I'm of Indian descent in 2014.
I'm just the Oscars that just came up.

33
00:01:57.511 --> 00:02:01.020
Everyone was talking about diversity and the nominations.
Um,

34
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.700
how do you feel that this film is helping spread that awareness of diversity?

35
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.690
<v 3>What's really great is that,
um,</v>

36
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.720
it's a predominantly female south Asian American cast.
You know,

37
00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:15.190
we have also,
you know,

38
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.470
the guys who play some really fun roles in the film.
So we,
we just,
you know,

39
00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:24.730
it was time,
it was timely in the sense that,
you know,
there was a story to tell.

40
00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:29.731
There are a lot of stories to tell about different worlds that are here in,

41
00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:32.980
in our society.
So this was one of them.
And you know,

42
00:02:32.981 --> 00:02:35.820
it was great to have this team and you know,

43
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.630
to be able to go into a South Asian American,
you know,

44
00:02:40.631 --> 00:02:43.910
world and let that be sort of the backdrop,
right?

45
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.210
To explore more universal theme.

46
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.740
<v 2>I mean,
I,
I still get excited when I see the film festival was a nice,</v>

47
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:50.760
see all these brown women.

48
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.100
<v 1>It's so unusual to you.</v>

49
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.130
Okay.

50
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.963
<v 4>Do you see your role?</v>

51
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.780
<v 0>Um,
so that kind of brings us to,
um,</v>

52
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.430
Lily's character who tia plays,
who's this very strong,

53
00:03:11.431 --> 00:03:16.410
confident individual and she has,
um,
what you call in the movie a lily plan.

54
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.890
Um,
tell us about that plan and,

55
00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:24.490
and do you yourself in your personal life,
have a tia plan that you live by?

56
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.900
<v 4>Um,
well,</v>

57
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.930
I definitely relate to Lilly in some ways as these guys can probably attest to.

58
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.510
Maybe not when I'm around.
Um,

59
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.370
I have a bit of a type a personality and so in that respect I have,

60
00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:44.260
I share sort of that straw,
you know,

61
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.880
like that drive to be that drive to excel and um,

62
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.150
to try and achieve perfection and like things I try my hand at,

63
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.110
which incidentally is why I don't play sports because I'm really bad at them.

64
00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:58.200
Then I like to be good at things.
So yeah,

65
00:03:58.201 --> 00:04:00.090
I guess I have a little bit in common with Lilly.

66
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.210
I'd like to think that I'm a little more well rounded than lily and maybe I have

67
00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:10.950
better interpersonal skills,
I hope.
Um,
but yeah,
so I mean,
I,
I,
yeah,

68
00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:15.951
I think I'm have always been pretty driven and maybe a little ambitious and so,

69
00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:21.480
uh,
maybe I have,
have had a tia plan,
but I never made a scrapbook.

70
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.280
Maybe I wasn't so organized in,
in enough to do something like that.
But,
uh,
yeah,

71
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:29.880
I guess I do have a lot in common with Willie for better or for worse.

72
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.570
<v 0>Um,
so Kosha,
your character,
um,
Sema is,
um,</v>

73
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.740
Lee's best friend in the film.
You kind of take this selflessness role,

74
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.300
which is quite opposite from Lily's role.
Um,
how,
what was,
you know,

75
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.000
how did you feel playing that emotionally,
that character and,

76
00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:49.640
and do you as a person resonate with that personality?

77
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.910
<v 4>Um,
I definitely resonated with that personally.</v>

78
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.650
Um,
I don't know.
I feel like it came very natural to me.

79
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:03.430
I've always been someone who has a lot of female friendships in my life.

80
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:04.720
I went to an all girls school,

81
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:09.460
so I knew what it's like to sort of put others first and then do the opposite

82
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:10.480
and put myself first.

83
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:14.830
I think those fine lines of friendship are really interesting and exciting to
me.

84
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.810
And,
um,
yeah.
So

85
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.430
<v 0>That's interesting.
So I guess in terms of that challenge,</v>

86
00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:27.210
in playing that role,
what was the most difficult pieces of playing sema?

87
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.733
<v 4>You know what?</v>

88
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.460
I feel like this is maybe the first time I've ever been able to say this,

89
00:05:32.461 --> 00:05:37.060
but this role actually wasn't super challenging for me because it was very cool.

90
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.970
Sorry,

91
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.960
it's very close to myself and that was such a privilege for me because usually I

92
00:05:42.961 --> 00:05:43.860
think you can attest to this.

93
00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:46.560
I don't get to play characters that are similar to myself.

94
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.590
So when I read this script and approach this character,

95
00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:54.591
I just embraced every part of me personally that I haven't been able to play in

96
00:05:55.201 --> 00:05:58.430
other characters as producer is having,

97
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.110
<v 1>you know,
a large cast to work with.</v>

98
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:03.680
What was your challenge in terms of making sure that everything was on schedule

99
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:05.870
and on time?
In terms of filming?

100
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.990
We were always on schedule.

101
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.120
<v 5>Think for the most part,
we were always on schedule,
fortunately,
uh,</v>

102
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.470
because this was an independent film through and through,
uh,

103
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.210
the cast and the crew were game.
Uh,
they,

104
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.900
they knew that this was the link to be a labor of love for,
uh,

105
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.960
for almost all parties involved.
And because of that,
uh,

106
00:06:24.961 --> 00:06:27.680
there are all kinds of things that you have to eat.

107
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.640
Everyone kind of has to wear many different hats.

108
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.170
But fortunately if your buddy was was up for that and that,
uh,
that kept us,

109
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.080
kept us going and kept us on time and kept us on schedule.

110
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.150
<v 3>Yeah.
And there's a lot of comradery,
you know,
with the,
with the cast,</v>

111
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.910
with the crew,
with we had seen,

112
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:48.650
so we had hundreds of extras and I think it created a very familial type of

113
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:51.020
atmosphere and I think everyone got along quite nicely.

114
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:53.240
And we've been together now for,

115
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:56.420
I mean Mirror Ravi and absorb and I for years,

116
00:06:56.421 --> 00:07:01.130
but with the cast over three years,
so we've continued to move with the film,

117
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.173
which is nice.

118
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.910
<v 5>Mickey,
it was also super,
super organized.
Uh,</v>

119
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.340
so that should've been my short answer.
That's the reason why

120
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.420
<v 1>they were married.
By the way.
Can you tell two married couples here?</v>

121
00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:14.920
That's Marin rubber.
Yeah.
Yeah.

122
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.710
Until you [inaudible] catching up.

123
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.540
We live in the same house now.
We don't,

124
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.980
it was interesting with the scheduling and keeping things on track,

125
00:07:26.981 --> 00:07:31.710
I hadn't realized really thought about how long it would take to the heroin

126
00:07:31.711 --> 00:07:34.570
Mecca for that many women.
And some of the biggest thing in this as well.

127
00:07:34.571 --> 00:07:37.360
So it was always like,
so when do we get the actors on set?

128
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.250
It's like another two hours
and rightly so.
But yeah,

129
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.690
just they have to look at,
I know if we had a few more minutes they to,

130
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.390
they had to look missing him.
Eric.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I mean

131
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.080
specifically it's a lovely dress up.
It was a lot of,
sorry,
it's a lot of uh,

132
00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:01.120
Indian [inaudible] cost 14.
Yeah,
I had to put you in twice.
I liked it.
I thought,

133
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.750
I love that stuff.
This whole like Indian dance costume,

134
00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:06.700
which has like all this like head jewelry.
I mean,

135
00:08:06.701 --> 00:08:10.660
some of you probably know it and bangles and they're like six different pieces

136
00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:15.010
of clothing has to be attached to a particular way and it's all danced.

137
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.560
So.
Yes.
Yeah.
So,
and then he did it.
Um,

138
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.410
and speaking about some of the traditional wardrobe and pieces,

139
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.180
I think that the story took a very interesting perspective because there's a lot

140
00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:31.000
of progressive scenes.
You had the traditional bark,

141
00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:34.840
not the dancer who's rang the traditional garb they described,
um,

142
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:39.270
dating and a non ethnic character.
And then you had,
um,

143
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.050
keep us character who played,

144
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.350
who was played by Mira m who was this mom,

145
00:08:44.351 --> 00:08:47.380
but she wasn't the traditional mom that you saw cooking in any scene.

146
00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:52.300
She was the mom that was a poet and successful.
Um,
so what,

147
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.250
you know,
what inspired you or what kind of triggered

148
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.740
<v 0>some of those scenes and where they based on a true story?
It</v>

149
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.740
<v 4>in terms of the dancing,
um,
I studied Indian classical dance birth,
not Tim,</v>

150
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.460
along with Mega.
Um,
and

151
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:08.130
<v 0>okay.</v>

152
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.270
<v 4>What inspired I think those scenes,
and I'm rubbing,
I wrote this together.</v>

153
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:16.460
So it's kind of these two voices coming together and that,
you know,
I,

154
00:09:16.461 --> 00:09:19.860
I never,
I was into my dancing but not really.

155
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:24.210
And I think I just kind of strayed away from it and had this whole other life in

156
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:27.990
a different way.
I wanted to express myself and Robbie,
you know,

157
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:30.690
would write these plays to that.
You know,

158
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.060
he wrote a play based on the Ramayana.

159
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:37.500
So that scene was kind of bringing our lives together to sort of,
you know,

160
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:42.300
kind of,
um,
really delve into this well,
why is,
you know,
this character seat,

161
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:45.060
that sitting there and it is something lily would say,
you know,

162
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:47.880
and it is something we've talked about and explored and,

163
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:52.080
<v 2>and it ups if the father and the mother and the mother being a poet and the</v>

164
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:53.430
father being a brain surgeon,

165
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.400
everything when we were writing the script was about,

166
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.790
well it was about the character of lily.
So how did those,

167
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:04.230
how do these other characters reflect on her and how the date define that

168
00:10:04.231 --> 00:10:07.260
character of Lilly.
And so with a mother who was like,

169
00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:08.970
so let's create this character,

170
00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:13.890
which she really butts up against if the opposite of Lilly as a poet in some

171
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:15.680
ways because she is so heavy.
Yeah.

172
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.960
Where was the mother was more heart driven and emotional.

173
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.130
And then the father of course was with somebody that she looked up to and,

174
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.130
and related to.
So all the other characters kind of came,

175
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.070
came in and relief to the character of Lilly.

176
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.660
<v 0>And,
um,
there was a very interesting,
um,</v>

177
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.270
and dynamic that Lily's character had because in the movie when you first

178
00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.830
started,
um,
you wanted to kind of,
you didn't relate to this character.

179
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:44.810
Do you want it to almost not cheer for her and then Theresa puncher in and,

180
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.660
Oh yeah,
you did.
I'm sorry,
my job here was done.

181
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.330
Um,
but then towards the end,

182
00:10:51.331 --> 00:10:54.270
you started to cheer for this character and you wanted to love her and you

183
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:59.010
wanted her to win,
um,
and being number one.
Um,
and so,
you know,

184
00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:03.420
how did that feel for you guys in that journey of really building her character

185
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:07.590
and lily or Tia,
playing that character?
Like,
well,
how did you feel?

186
00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:12.210
What were the challenges you felt to kind of express those,
that sentiment?

187
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.930
<v 4>Well,
I,
I,
um,
I felt,</v>

188
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.300
even though I wasn't lily exactly growing up,

189
00:11:20.301 --> 00:11:23.450
I'm sure my parents would have loved me to be a little more like lily as far as

190
00:11:23.451 --> 00:11:26.990
school was concerned.
Um,
but even though I wasn't her,

191
00:11:26.991 --> 00:11:30.740
I felt like from the moment I first read this script,
um,

192
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:35.240
not only did I think the script was just so well written and so funny,

193
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:39.290
but also something I connected immediately with this character.

194
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.610
And even though I wasn't her,
I felt like I knew her intimately well.

195
00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:46.940
And I sort of recognize parts of me and her.
Um,

196
00:11:46.941 --> 00:11:51.620
I have an older sister who is like typical first born child model,

197
00:11:51.621 --> 00:11:56.470
student model kid.
Um,
so I,
I recognize parts of my sister and her,

198
00:11:56.471 --> 00:12:00.940
so I just,
I felt like I knew this person really,
really well and um,
felt like I,

199
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:05.990
I really had to portray her if I read it sort of in a very early stage before it

200
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:09.190
was actually getting made into a movie.
And I,
at that point I was like,

201
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.720
if this thing ever gets made into a movie,

202
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:12.730
I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this job.

203
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.070
Luckily they didn't make me do that again,

204
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:15.993
<v 2>but,
um,</v>

205
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.290
<v 4>oh,
sorry.
I digress.
But I,
I,
um,</v>

206
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.930
I just felt like I knew her and I had to play her and I felt,

207
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.540
I almost saw her as a sympathetic character.

208
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.110
And so none of those things even occurred to me for some reason until after the

209
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:32.770
fact.
And I know I've told him,
said this story before,
but,
um,

210
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.380
I think maybe at our wrap party or some right after we wrapped production,
um,

211
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.050
one of the pas who had read the script early on said,
well,

212
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:42.400
I never told you this until now,

213
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:45.940
but I read the script and I really hated the Labor side.

214
00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:48.820
And I was really nervous that we were going to make a movie where the

215
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:53.350
protagonist is like this super unlikable character and now that we're done,

216
00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:57.280
I'm really glad that I,
I don't,
I don't hate her.
Like I,
I like her at the end,

217
00:12:57.281 --> 00:13:01.990
which is,
I mean,
yeah,
hopefully that's the case.
Um,
but it was sort of a luxury.

218
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.470
That was the first time it ever occurred to me that someone would look at her

219
00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:06.640
and dislike her.

220
00:13:06.641 --> 00:13:10.810
I just felt like I understood her strengths and her weaknesses.

221
00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:14.950
And so I had this sort of luxury of not realizing that until after we were done.

222
00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:16.900
I just sort of played,

223
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.490
played her as truthfully as I could and whatever happened happened I guess.

224
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.040
Oh,
well done.
I don't think so.
I really,

225
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:26.920
I wanted to hug you and I felt bad that you won third place.

226
00:13:26.921 --> 00:13:29.920
I think at the end it was a second or third place.
Uh,
I,

227
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.030
<v 2>yeah,
you were a second third and play those.</v>

228
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:35.913
Okay.
Yeah.

229
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.460
Lawrence not to win all the time and it wasn't good was okay.

230
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:47.040
<v 0>Um,
and so I guess like talking about before we open it up to the audience,</v>

231
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.040
let's talk about the cast a little bit.
I know that,
um,

232
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:54.780
we don't have Hannah Simone who stars in the new girl here today who also plays,

233
00:13:54.781 --> 00:13:58.830
I'm Sonia Nelson,
one of the contestants for Miss India America.
Um,

234
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.100
and you have to leading,
um,
females here.

235
00:14:02.101 --> 00:14:06.870
How was the casting process for you guys?
Um,
and was it difficult to find,

236
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.270
um,
Indian American actors for the film?

237
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:14.750
<v 2>You know,
so it took it about the Lita Lee character of lily.</v>

238
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.200
We knew we needed to find somebody that could take the audience on a journey on

239
00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.450
this supposedly on,
on,

240
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.030
on sympathetic character that did appear on sympathetic on the page,

241
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.950
but would still make us invested in her journey.
And we kept saying,

242
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:33.570
we need to find our Indian Reese Witherspoon.
And uh,
I think kind of got it.

243
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.270
I think,
uh,
you know,
two did an amazing job on his own.

244
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.500
He knows,
we like to say,
you know,
Reese Witherspoon is the white a ts her car.

245
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:46.920
That's what everyone's saying on the street,
right?
Yeah.

246
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.120
And it's like,
wait,
so knew a lot of the actors,

247
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.570
like Tiaa Mirror had played her mom twice before on TV show was.

248
00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:59.570
And I actually played her dad on one of those shows too.

249
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.700
So we knew Tiaa,
we already like,
yeah,
she can be brilliant.

250
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.910
And then like kosher,
I saw on a short film,
I was like,

251
00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:09.560
I'm like a kosher went through the reading.

252
00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:13.400
And so there were a lot of people who we knew and there was some people who we

253
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.150
didn't know and we were surprised by the depth of talent and the South Asian

254
00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:19.820
community.
Now it's pretty phenomenal.

255
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.320
<v 3>Yeah.
Think it was great to have,
you know,</v>

256
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:26.710
just a wealth of talent come in and audition and,

257
00:15:26.711 --> 00:15:31.320
and to see that they're just really good,
you know?
Really good.
And you know,

258
00:15:31.321 --> 00:15:34.140
you've said this a lot too,
where like,
you know,
maybe five,

259
00:15:34.141 --> 00:15:37.120
10 years ago there weren't as many,
you know,

260
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:38.970
<v 2>it might've been hard to cast this film</v>

261
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.640
<v 0>might've been hard.
Do you think it would have been the same if it was,</v>

262
00:15:41.641 --> 00:15:45.630
had a more of a,
a male predominant character kind of platform?

263
00:15:45.631 --> 00:15:50.070
Or are you think it would just have been it just the same wealth and depth of

264
00:15:50.071 --> 00:15:52.800
talent out there would be the same for a male versus a female?

265
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.930
<v 3>I think it's pretty,
I mean,
what do you guys think?
I think it's pretty,
you know,</v>

266
00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:57.970
even and things,

267
00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:02.560
so they went from a very female heavy movie to the next film I made,

268
00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:07.000
which is very male heavy.
And again,
South Asian,
um,
there's a lot of talent.

269
00:16:07.001 --> 00:16:11.140
I mean we're still lucky that we get to try out eight to 10,

270
00:16:11.141 --> 00:16:14.230
sometimes 12 people for a role,
which is really exciting.

271
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.950
<v 0>Um,
so we're going to open the floor up to questions.
Um,</v>

272
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.950
if you guys feel could go up to the mic and,

273
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.500
and please ask a question to the talent.

274
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.070
<v 6>Hi.
Uh,
I wanted to thank you guys for making a movie that was,
you know,
you don't,</v>

275
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.220
a lot of times when you see Indians are represented on screen,
it's Indian,

276
00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:32.090
Indian or immigrant Indians.
And like the story of those of us who grew up here,

277
00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:34.460
it doesn't really get told.
But on top of that,
I liked it.

278
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:35.900
It was a very specific story.

279
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:39.500
Like it wasn't about trying to get everything about him being an Indian American

280
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:40.790
out there.
And I wonder it like,

281
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.030
can I talk to a few writers and various other communities?
Like,
did you,

282
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.140
did you choose writers feel kind of like,
you have to fight that urge to be like,

283
00:16:48.141 --> 00:16:48.950
well,
I have to get every,

284
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:52.250
get everything about being an Indian American down on this page right now

285
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:54.680
because otherwise this will be the one movie where that,

286
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.370
<v 3>no,
I,
no,
I don't,
we didn't have to,
uh,</v>

287
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:05.030
fight that urge to talk about,
you know,
being an Indian American,
we,

288
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.280
we,
um,

289
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.770
we knew that this sort of story that we wanted to tell him what we wanted to

290
00:17:09.771 --> 00:17:14.420
explore and if anything it was just using,
we happened to be Indian American.

291
00:17:14.421 --> 00:17:18.350
It happens,
you know,
the beauty pageant world is a backdrop orange county,

292
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:22.580
but the world that we live in,
you know,
it was very,
you know,

293
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.400
human and connected in that way.

294
00:17:25.401 --> 00:17:29.660
And I think those themes of being an Indian American and have been explored in

295
00:17:29.661 --> 00:17:33.970
films earlier on like um,
American day C and a,
B,
c,

296
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.640
d and You know,
they,
they've explored those themes and maybe as a,

297
00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:42.410
as a group now our voices to um,
our stories are different,
you know,

298
00:17:42.411 --> 00:17:46.720
and what we want to talk about is different.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay,

299
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.380
thanks for sharing that.
Anybody else from the audience?

300
00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.160
<v 1>Oh we have the distributor.</v>

301
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.870
<v 7>Just an innocent person.
So you guys were talking about,
uh,</v>

302
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
you both had the background in the traditional dances but you both had to,

303
00:18:04.251 --> 00:18:07.100
as actresses portray a certain expertise on screen,

304
00:18:07.101 --> 00:18:09.500
especially you Cosha who had to say,
I've been doing this,

305
00:18:09.501 --> 00:18:13.910
I know this and now I have to coach someone who doesn't know how much had you

306
00:18:13.911 --> 00:18:18.050
guys worked on that before or had it in your lives before you even got to the

307
00:18:18.051 --> 00:18:18.884
movie.

308
00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.870
<v 1>I actually am maybe the only one here that didn't have a dance background,</v>

309
00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.890
which was like excellent.
Cause my character is not supposed to be amazing at it.

310
00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.770
So that goes back to what I was saying earlier.

311
00:18:30.771 --> 00:18:34.400
I got to like really embrace everything about myself.
Um,

312
00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.800
so I learned the choreography,

313
00:18:36.801 --> 00:18:40.760
which was exciting to me cause I don't have a dance background and I didn't have

314
00:18:40.761 --> 00:18:44.960
to make it look perfect the way someone would like lily would move.

315
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.490
Very cool.
I thought every Indian girl just knew how to dance

316
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.270
and dance.
But yeah,

317
00:18:53.271 --> 00:18:58.020
I know I haven't like bust a move the traditional time,
not the traditional type.

318
00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.170
I'm with you on that.
I relate.

319
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.570
I could do a little bunker up.
Yeah.
Punjab EMC taught me that.

320
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.750
[inaudible] Punjabi.
No,
I'm good.
Dropping.
Oh,
I was going to say,

321
00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.420
I mean Punjabi is just,

322
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:16.480
it's like in your DNA you have to know how to be [inaudible].

323
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.620
<v 0>My question has already been answered a little bit because I was initially</v>

324
00:19:22.621 --> 00:19:27.621
wondering about the existence of Miss India and the idea of cultural beauty

325
00:19:27.931 --> 00:19:31.500
pageants within the u s and so I'd like to expand it.
I,

326
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:36.210
so you were Miss India or California,
Diego,

327
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.030
California years ago,
and I'm sort of intrigued what the,

328
00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.180
what the weight of that in,

329
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:45.390
in relation to the traditional culture and the American culture and how that

330
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.900
played out for you?
I'm,
I'm just intrigued.
Can you tell me more?

331
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.100
<v 3>Right.
Um,
yes,
I would</v>

332
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.210
<v 1>[inaudible] that's</v>

333
00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:01.100
<v 3>the word.
Um,
you know,
I think,
you know,
I don't know what it's like when I,</v>

334
00:20:01.101 --> 00:20:02.320
when I did it,
um,

335
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:07.430
there was a group of girls who would go and we'd do these beauty pageants.
Um,

336
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.840
it was,
uh,
for different reasons.
I think it was a cultural thing.
I think,

337
00:20:11.841 --> 00:20:16.760
you know,
when we were younger,
we want it to be seen.
Um,
that was there,

338
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:21.650
you know,
and,
um,
maybe we wanted a crown and,
you know,

339
00:20:21.651 --> 00:20:26.270
get our face in the paper.
And it was that kind of thing.
And,
um,
there were very,

340
00:20:26.271 --> 00:20:29.930
uh,
and it was also like,
I think,
uh,
a dance,
you know,

341
00:20:29.931 --> 00:20:32.570
a place where you can showcase the talent too.

342
00:20:32.571 --> 00:20:35.960
So it was all these different things.
And I think,
you know,
for me,

343
00:20:35.961 --> 00:20:38.630
looking back on it,
it was,
um,

344
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.990
it was just one of those things I did that I would go,
okay,

345
00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:46.790
that was part of my experience of growing up and I was able to,
you know,

346
00:20:46.791 --> 00:20:50.130
bring it into this,
you know,
story that we told them.

347
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.680
<v 2>It's interesting now when you look at the girls that do the beauty pageants now,</v>

348
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.830
they're,
they're really accomplished there.

349
00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.010
This is just one aspect of their lives.
They're going to beat doctors,

350
00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:01.630
they're going to be lawyers,
they're going to be nurses,

351
00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:05.200
they're going to be engineers,
but they also have this,

352
00:21:05.201 --> 00:21:09.910
this pull towards doing these pageants as well when I think it's a little bit to

353
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:12.660
do with the Bollywood thing to that,

354
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.480
because Bollywood at the payment is still still kind of gets into their homes

355
00:21:16.481 --> 00:21:19.930
and into their lives.
They want to kind of touch that a little bit as well.

356
00:21:19.931 --> 00:21:22.480
And there's a value to that too.
Yeah.

357
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.070
And I think it's also the expectation of,
of,
uh,

358
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.760
Indian women in this country as well,
to be everything as well.
They have to be,

359
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.820
they're expected to be intelligent and smart and they're expected to be

360
00:21:33.821 --> 00:21:36.100
entertained as and,
and,
uh,

361
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:39.240
and to show off their talents,
to

362
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:43.580
<v 4>no confidence,
confident us,
play at least one.</v>

363
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:48.110
Amen.
And Sing and dance and dance and go to Stanford,
ugly.

364
00:21:48.111 --> 00:21:50.900
At the same time they'll go to Stanford and get your,
um,

365
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:55.280
electrical engineering degree know,
I think that was also a big part of it too.

366
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.153
Yeah.

367
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.260
<v 2>And in some ways,
even the title Miss India America,
it's,
it's a,</v>

368
00:21:59.261 --> 00:22:03.220
it's a wider idea of if the title of what does it mean to be Miss India America?

369
00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:04.030
What's,

370
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:08.860
what is the expectation that that's put on by other people in on themselves too.

371
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.430
<v 3>That's actually interesting because that was a question that was submitted was,</v>

372
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:17.100
you know,
in today's Miss India America,
what should she look like?
What,

373
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.730
how would you describe her today?

374
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.280
<v 5>Right,
yeah,
yeah.
Of what I think,
you know,
for her,</v>

375
00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:25.610
for any kind of culturally specific,
a beauty pageant or,
or,

376
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.170
or similar kinds of events.
Um,
you know,
whenever you have,

377
00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:31.580
particularly if we're getting communities,
uh,

378
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.230
in the u s ideas of standards of beauty,
uh,

379
00:22:35.231 --> 00:22:37.210
those are,
uh,

380
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:42.340
ideas that sometimes get challenged a little bit.
And I think what these events,

381
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.370
uh,
for all that we can make fun of them for,
which I think,
you know,

382
00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:49.660
there our film does,
uh,
there also is though a real sense of celebration,

383
00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:54.550
you know,
celebration of,
of this particular culture and this particular look and,

384
00:22:54.551 --> 00:22:57.150
and,
uh,
putting value,
uh,

385
00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.550
in that and within the context of American society as well.

386
00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:05.940
<v 3>And I don't think there's one look that there isn't one ideal.
You know,
I mean,</v>

387
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:10.180
if we're looking in the broader sense,
our title of Miss Indian America isn't,
uh,

388
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.670
isn't just a beauty pageant,
you know,
title it's,
you know,
somatically,

389
00:23:14.671 --> 00:23:18.840
much broader.
And,
you know,
it's so interesting to see are,
you know,

390
00:23:18.841 --> 00:23:20.280
young girls,
you know,

391
00:23:20.281 --> 00:23:25.281
growing up and you want them to be able to feel comfortable in their bodies and

392
00:23:26.341 --> 00:23:28.530
whatever they have and whatever they want to do.

393
00:23:28.531 --> 00:23:33.120
So I just don't think there's one definition of what that Miss India America is.

394
00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:37.710
It's just,
it's who you are,
you know,
and,
and do you even,
you know,
yeah,
no.
Yeah,

395
00:23:37.711 --> 00:23:42.660
I totally,
um,
as a person,
as an individual,
I totally relate.
I relate to that.

396
00:23:42.661 --> 00:23:46.300
And I think that you drew it into the film pretty well.
When,
um,

397
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.890
<v 0>Sima who's played by Kosha,
uh,</v>

398
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:52.700
was told by the judge that she should not be in the pageant because she wasn't

399
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.720
contestant Mike or she wasn't as tall as,
you know,

400
00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.560
the character who's played by Tiaa.
Um,

401
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.990
how did that make you make you feel in,

402
00:24:01.991 --> 00:24:06.230
in that moment when you were told maybe you weren't fair and lovely,
like we're,

403
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:10.970
we're brought up to believe,
um,
and that you couldn't be part of it.
Not Great.

404
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.833
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

405
00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.060
<v 4>I,
I think it's a,</v>

406
00:24:15.061 --> 00:24:19.440
I think it brought up like a very interesting and important point about what all

407
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.700
young Indian girls go through.
And,
um,

408
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.590
I also think it was interesting because I don't know if you feel like this is an

409
00:24:25.591 --> 00:24:29.220
actor,
but in Hollywood everyone has this idea.

410
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:32.670
Like these Indian characters are written and everyone has this idea as to what

411
00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:37.350
they are.
But none of us fit into that square box.
So,

412
00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.213
uh,

413
00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:42.300
I think it mirrored something that we all experience and it was really great to

414
00:24:42.301 --> 00:24:46.560
explore that in the film and not have to fit into that box that sometimes when

415
00:24:46.561 --> 00:24:50.950
we're doing other jobs,
we have to.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's really a great way to,

416
00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.900
<v 0>um,
I know I always wished that I was five,
seven,
so I could be part of it,</v>

417
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:56.940
you know,
that's never going to happen in my life.

418
00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.090
<v 1>Did you do it all right?
Yeah.</v>

419
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:05.080
<v 0>Um,
so any questions on the floor?
Do we have any?
Okay.</v>

420
00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:07.653
Oh boy.

421
00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:13.740
<v 1>Um,
this is for the actors.
Do you feel like in the last few years,</v>

422
00:25:13.741 --> 00:25:18.030
like in the wake of Oscars so white and all of this stuff in terms of diversity

423
00:25:18.031 --> 00:25:20.730
in Hollywood,
do you feel like the roles have changed for you guys?

424
00:25:20.731 --> 00:25:23.970
Do you feel like they're more opportunities out there and different roles and

425
00:25:23.971 --> 00:25:24.870
better roles?

426
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.710
<v 4>I would say absolute.
Thank you for your question.
Um,
I would say,</v>

427
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.580
I mean,
you guys are,
there's a bunch of actors up here.
Um,

428
00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.710
even in the short amount of time I've been acting professionally in Hollywood,

429
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:45.040
I have seen a marked change in the kinds of roles,

430
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.460
uh,
that,

431
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:51.530
that networks and studios will even consider South Asian actors for.

432
00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.270
And,
um,
I mean,
I still,
I definitely think we have a long way to go and,

433
00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:01.230
uh,
but I s t I s I see a tangible change and,
and,

434
00:26:01.231 --> 00:26:05.360
and,
and difference.
And from,
from when I first started working in this industry,

435
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.280
um,
you know,
uh,
uh,
a role on a television show might say,

436
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:10.731
you know,

437
00:26:10.731 --> 00:26:14.870
the casting notice might say like ethnically ambiguous or are open to all

438
00:26:14.871 --> 00:26:19.640
ethnicities,
but really they would mean probably African American.

439
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.910
And then maybe if they're feeling a little,
you know,
gutsy,

440
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:27.050
they'll go Latina and then if they're really trying to like push the push the

441
00:26:27.051 --> 00:26:31.940
limits,
they'll go Asian American.
But South Asian American was still so,
so,

442
00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:37.370
um,
so crazy of an idea that it was hard.
I think,
I mean,

443
00:26:37.371 --> 00:26:39.620
I was up for,
I mean,
you guys probably had the same experience.

444
00:26:39.621 --> 00:26:43.040
I was up for roles where I would be testing for a pilot and the network,

445
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.300
say we love Tia and she was really great,
but we're going to choose this Latina.

446
00:26:47.301 --> 00:26:48.990
I mean this happened once in particular,

447
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.590
we're going to pick this Latina actress because this particular network,

448
00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:55.590
40% of their viewership was Latina.
And I was like,
oh,

449
00:26:55.591 --> 00:26:59.400
but maybe just pick the person that was the best at the job.
So,
you know,

450
00:26:59.401 --> 00:27:02.460
I've had countless experiences like that one.

451
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:07.260
And now I feel like only in the last couple of years there've been such changes

452
00:27:07.261 --> 00:27:11.790
in like who we see in mainstream media.
And um,
it,

453
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.960
you know,
with your Mindi Kailyn's and your Aziz Ansari's and um,

454
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:20.570
Priyanka Chopra is even,
you know,
um,
it's,
it's,
it's exciting.

455
00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:25.200
I feel like we're right on the brink of really,

456
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:29.820
uh,
becoming so,
um,
so,

457
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:34.740
so integrated in mainstream media that hopefully soon we won't even need to like

458
00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:38.280
comment about it.
I mean,
I know that might be a little ways off,

459
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:42.810
but I see changes happening and it's very exciting and miss Indian America is

460
00:27:42.811 --> 00:27:43.644
going to be the reason.

461
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.170
<v 3>Hope so.
We're ready.
Thank you.
Um,</v>

462
00:27:48.171 --> 00:27:50.780
so as writers and kind of understanding that the,

463
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:54.740
the challenge that actors have and in getting some of these type of roles,

464
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:58.460
do you feel added pressure to write scripts that are catered towards a more

465
00:27:58.461 --> 00:27:59.900
diverse or niche community?

466
00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:00.850
<v 2>I mean,</v>

467
00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:05.620
I think we just want to tell stories which do touch on the South Asian American

468
00:28:05.621 --> 00:28:09.160
experience.
I think we're passionate about doing those stories.
You know,

469
00:28:09.161 --> 00:28:13.120
it's not an easy road as well.
It's a cause where it's still trying to,

470
00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:17.950
we're trying to figure out his or a marketplace for them as well.
And how,
how,
um,

471
00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:19.730
how much do we need to win to gray,

472
00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.920
the white American experience within those stories of the South Asian American

473
00:28:23.921 --> 00:28:28.180
experience.
We're still discovering it.
But I know from my perspective,

474
00:28:28.181 --> 00:28:31.870
I want to keep telling the stories about these brown people,
you know,

475
00:28:31.871 --> 00:28:35.020
because we talk a lot about if we don't write the stories and nobody else is

476
00:28:35.021 --> 00:28:38.530
going to do them,
and that won't be a narrative,

477
00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.740
a historical narrative in some ways that you can point to and go,

478
00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:47.050
so what was it like to be a South Asian American in 2050 or whatever?
And you go,

479
00:28:47.051 --> 00:28:48.990
oh well is this movie and this movie in that movie,

480
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:53.260
go check them out and you'll get a sense of it.
And if we don't do them,

481
00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:54.610
then they just won't be there.

482
00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.350
<v 3>Yeah.
And there's,
you know,</v>

483
00:28:56.351 --> 00:28:59.710
there's a lot of really interesting filmmakers who are telling these stories.

484
00:28:59.711 --> 00:29:01.000
And as a writer,

485
00:29:01.001 --> 00:29:05.680
I think it's not challenging to write a fully formed,
you know,

486
00:29:05.681 --> 00:29:10.660
three dimensional person who is like,
you know,
happens to be South Asian.

487
00:29:10.661 --> 00:29:15.340
So it's really great that there's a complexity too.

488
00:29:15.341 --> 00:29:16.151
And there's something,

489
00:29:16.151 --> 00:29:20.230
there's a depth and there's a history and the way they relate to each other too

490
00:29:20.231 --> 00:29:22.990
and just women relating to each other.
We relate to each other.

491
00:29:22.991 --> 00:29:27.760
In so many different ways.
And,
and I think,
you know,
we both won.
We weren't like,

492
00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:30.670
we didn't have an agenda.
I don't think in writing this,

493
00:29:30.671 --> 00:29:35.470
it was more just let's tell this story.
And,
and through telling this story,
these,

494
00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:36.910
these things happen.

495
00:29:36.911 --> 00:29:41.911
Do you know where women are talking about their friendships or they're about,

496
00:29:42.011 --> 00:29:46.810
you know,
this idea of being driven and how far they're going to go and their

497
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:49.990
relationships.
And then there's love.
Yeah.
And there,
you know,

498
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.560
so a lot of different things.
And so that's really exciting.

499
00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.460
<v 5>I think that just as a speaking as a producer,
you know,</v>

500
00:29:57.461 --> 00:30:02.200
even when I was just reading the script,
the Mira and Ravi wrote,
um,

501
00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.100
there was a universality to,
uh,
the,

502
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:09.010
the situations to the struggles that the characters are going through.

503
00:30:09.011 --> 00:30:13.120
And I think that a good way of maybe looking at it is just,

504
00:30:13.121 --> 00:30:15.790
it's having a real respect for,
uh,
an audience.

505
00:30:15.791 --> 00:30:19.030
Any kind of audience doesn't even have to be a specifically South Asian,

506
00:30:19.031 --> 00:30:21.550
but it's just telling really,
really good stories.

507
00:30:21.551 --> 00:30:26.290
And it happens to be this particular South Asian experience.
But within that,

508
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.900
you know,
supposedly narrow experience,
you can find the universe,
you know,

509
00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.753
within that.

510
00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:32.443
<v 3>That's interesting.</v>

511
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.280
<v 4>Um,
so we're,
I guess we could just go down online,</v>

512
00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.340
so what's next for each one of you guys?

513
00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.440
Get something that you're working on the next,
you know,

514
00:30:40.441 --> 00:30:43.550
in the near future or where can we see you next?
[inaudible]

515
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.690
<v 5>uh,
so,
uh,
from my self a,
so a meg and I are developing,
you know,</v>

516
00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:51.880
a handful of projects,
um,
uh,
sure.
Uh,
how,

517
00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.250
how much we can really say.
Well,
there's one,
it's,

518
00:30:54.251 --> 00:30:58.330
it's a children's entertainment brand called super duper princess heroes.
Uh,

519
00:30:58.331 --> 00:31:03.160
it is,
uh,
a,
a,
it's,
it's geared towards a young,
very young audience,

520
00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:08.110
but tries to teach values of female empowerment,
uh,
in a very fun,
uh,
sort of,

521
00:31:08.111 --> 00:31:12.820
uh,
uh,
Popey a superhero slash princessy atmosphere.

522
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.100
Um,
and,
uh,
yeah,

523
00:31:15.101 --> 00:31:18.540
we have a couple of her film projects that we're developing as well and yeah,

524
00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.960
you can talk about your,
your next one.

525
00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:24.650
<v 3>Yeah.
Um,
I,
I shot right after Miss Indian America shot the tiger hunter,</v>

526
00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.540
so that's coming out in the next few weeks.

527
00:31:26.541 --> 00:31:29.520
It's starting at the festival circuit and,
um,

528
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.320
and then the super duper princess heroes.

529
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:38.160
<v 4>And I am continuing to try and create as much comedy as I can and I'm working on</v>

530
00:31:39.161 --> 00:31:42.430
a show that will be on MTV.
I would love to tell you the title,

531
00:31:42.431 --> 00:31:46.720
but it keeps switching to untitled,
but it's about weed dealers.

532
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:53.130
Um,
I,
uh,
just uh,

533
00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:57.580
wrap production on a pilot for NBC,
um,

534
00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:02.410
that Amy Poehler,
um,
executive produced and directed,
which is really exciting.

535
00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:05.920
Um,
and then I've voiced a character on a couple of different animated shows.

536
00:32:05.921 --> 00:32:08.690
One is star wars rebels,
which,
um,

537
00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:13.990
our season two finale event is tomorrow night and airs on Disney XD.

538
00:32:13.991 --> 00:32:16.090
And then,
um,
I just started working on another one.

539
00:32:16.091 --> 00:32:19.780
It's a project for a drip for dreamworks,
for Netflix,
Netflix.

540
00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:22.840
Why can't I talk and I can't talk about it?
Yeah.

541
00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.920
Specifically because I've been told not to,
but I hopefully will get to soon.

542
00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:32.970
<v 3>Um,
Robbie and I,
uh,
I have written a half hour,</v>

543
00:32:32.971 --> 00:32:37.130
a single camera comedy,
uh,
called in transit about,
um,

544
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:39.980
it's set in the 70s,
and it's based on my childhood

545
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.910
<v 1>growing up in San Diego.
Oh Wow.
So</v>

546
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:47.280
<v 0>a lot of inspiration from within your own childhood that yeah.</v>

547
00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.160
That is portrayed in your writing.
That's great.

548
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.540
And I just stopped like a vampire and yes,

549
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:55.870
<v 1>take a story is it
creates,</v>

550
00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:01.760
<v 0>yeah.
Um,
and so just before we go into this rapid fire round,</v>

551
00:33:01.761 --> 00:33:05.350
we've prepared for you guys.
It'll be really quick.
Um,
it's not scary.
You'll,

552
00:33:05.351 --> 00:33:09.390
you'll eat.
Yeah.
Um,
so when,
um,

553
00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:13.560
the folks that didn't get to watch the film today,
where can they see it?
Um,

554
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:14.563
and where can they find it?

555
00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:19.980
<v 5>So we're pretty much on every major digital streaming platforms starting April</v>

556
00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:23.680
5th,
uh,
including Google play.
Uh,
but,
uh,

557
00:33:23.681 --> 00:33:26.570
just if you just look for Miss Indian America,
uh,

558
00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:30.820
you're almost guaranteed to find it on any of your on demand or streaming

559
00:33:30.821 --> 00:33:31.654
channels.

560
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:36.110
<v 1>Yeah.
And for those of you in mountain view?
Uh,
I,
as I said before,</v>

561
00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.670
we're still playing in San Jose,

562
00:33:37.671 --> 00:33:40.220
so definitely tell your bay area friends to check us out.

563
00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:42.380
<v 0>All right.
Um,
so we're going to do really quickly,</v>

564
00:33:42.381 --> 00:33:45.290
it was going to take a few minutes and we're going to do a rapid fire round.

565
00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:46.240
I'm going to ask you a question.

566
00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.530
We'll just go down the line and just say the first thing that comes to mind
when,

567
00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:53.210
when I say this.
Um,
and uh,
okay.

568
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.780
Ravi is saying we start with you Sarah.

569
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:55.733
<v 1>All right.</v>

570
00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.330
<v 0>Um,
okay.
So your favorite search engine,
Google or bing?</v>

571
00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:08.070
<v 1>Google.
Google,
Google.</v>

572
00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.220
Google.
Why do people use thing?

573
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:16.980
I heard they pay you to use it.
Oh guys and Google for sure.

574
00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:21.840
Google.
I Google it.
I've never even dumping.
Oh No.

575
00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:25.370
<v 0>Awesome.
We,
we paid them all to say that.
Okay.
Um,</v>

576
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.410
so if you had to pick your favorite movie between these two,

577
00:34:28.411 --> 00:34:30.630
which one would be the internship or the intern?

578
00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.073
<v 1>The internships.</v>

579
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:38.020
I said I'm going to have to say the internship.
The intern.

580
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:45.560
Thanks guys.
The internship,
the internship.

581
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:50.670
And I haven't seen the and so the internship as well by default.
Yes,
I'd okay

582
00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.770
being either,
so I,
all my answers are going to be by default

583
00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:00.520
<v 0>internship is pageant Miss Universe or Miss Rod.</v>

584
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.970
<v 1>Ooh,
Miss World Underground.
I actually do like Miss World Better</v>

585
00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:12.090
Miss Universe.
Which one doesn't have the swimsuit competition?

586
00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:17.310
That one.
Just one of them know how to I think so.
This is a one word answer.

587
00:35:17.311 --> 00:35:19.860
Sorry.
I knew I was gonna be terrible at this.
Do we know?
Are we sure?

588
00:35:19.861 --> 00:35:23.580
Now we know who miss universes.
Oh,
right,
right.
Um,

589
00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:28.950
Gosh.
Um,
Miss World.
Miss Universe,
miss anything.

590
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:33.660
Miss any miss everything.
Donald Trump does the Miss Universe,
right?
Okay.

591
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:38.280
Does that,
that affect your decision?

592
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:44.200
Did you know miss everything?
Paul Mrs. Cooper.

593
00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:49.570
I'll go pull with that.
Okay.
Miss India.
America.
Yeah.

594
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:51.910
Yeah.
That was off the charts.
But I like it.

595
00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.950
You're a writer so you can write in what you want to say.
Facebook or snapchat?

596
00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:59.780
Facebook.
I'm too old for snapchat.

597
00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.370
Facebook,
Facebook.

598
00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:11.110
Oh,
I don't know.
I'm getting into snapchat.
She saw a youngster.

599
00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.950
I'll go,
fuck,
I'm going to have to go Facebook.

600
00:36:14.951 --> 00:36:18.820
But I did my first snapchat on a red carpet last night and it was thrilling and

601
00:36:18.821 --> 00:36:22.630
terrifying at the same time.
So maybe snapchat soon.
Oh,
that sounds exciting.

602
00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:27.360
Yes.
Facebook,
I don't even know.
What is it the same?

603
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.610
I can barely cope with any of them kind of nick.

604
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:33.760
And by default I've never done snapchat.
So Facebook.
Okay,

605
00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.030
so he's going to ask you guys Facebook or Instagram,
but it's Instagram,

606
00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.450
Instagram,
Instagram,
obvious one.
Okay.

607
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:44.900
Who is the Facebook thing?
It's good.
Good to know.
Bollywood or Hollywood?
Yep.

608
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:49.740
<v 2>Oh Man.
Uh,
Hollywood.
I gotta I gotta I gotta get a Hollywood or Bollywood,
but,</v>

609
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:54.770
but I will say I'm a South Asian American independent film over both.

610
00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:04.130
<v 1>Oh,
I think I would go for like seventies Bollywood and,</v>

611
00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:09.830
and then,
yeah,
independent to errors then that's different.

612
00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:15.050
I'm going to go with Hollywood as am I.
Hollywood,

613
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:18.150
<v 8>Hollywood Bollywood Crossover.</v>

614
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.950
<v 1>You're answers are not answer.
Okay.</v>

615
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:27.650
Hollywood.
I'm not committing.
Am I knocking middle?

616
00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:32.050
It's all gray.
And I've never seen a Bollywood movie.

617
00:37:32.051 --> 00:37:34.160
So now Emma,

618
00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:39.300
Holly rusted millions of Bollywood Kapore and sons steer that the other day.

619
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:43.360
Good things about it.
That it was good in science.

620
00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:48.030
It wasn't about me then when I was just saying it should be about you.
Yeah,

621
00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.530
I was like what?
But it's still here.
Am I in this film?
Where am I in this bill?

622
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:58.150
What am my sons?
So the next thing,

623
00:37:58.151 --> 00:38:02.650
and please say one word.
Okay.
So if you were going to be great,

624
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.360
I asked you a question as a,
as a pageant contestant,

625
00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.690
what would you incorporate in your answer at child poverty or world peace.

626
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:12.303
World peace.

627
00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.650
<v 8>Tell it poverty.</v>

628
00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.480
<v 1>Oh,
Sema Kosha.
Child poverty.</v>

629
00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:26.320
World peace.
World.
Peace.
World peace.
Oh Nice.
Um,

630
00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:28.220
we saw a lot of child poverty in the movies.
Then surprise.

631
00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:34.140
Maybe you'll have tried [inaudible] I was thinking is,

632
00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:35.920
is that okay?
I was thinking,
okay,

633
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:40.090
we all thought like if you have world peace then these two to

634
00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.020
maybe you might have world peace,

635
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.270
hungry chicken

636
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:54.760
could be all about this.
Um,

637
00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:58.120
so final four team,
who do you want to win for March madness?

638
00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.780
They're not in it anymore,
but UCLA.

639
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:08.170
So the choices are Villanova,
Oklahoma,
North Carolina,
or Syracuse,

640
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.600
Villanova.
I'm to say North Carolina Pass.

641
00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:20.010
I know nothing about basketball.
It's a basketball [inaudible] path.

642
00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:25.360
Um,
this is not a very nice answer,
but I'm from Texas,
so anybody but Oklahoma.

643
00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.640
Okay.
We'll take that.

644
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.510
I'm going to say Syracuse because I know people from Syracuse,

645
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.960
but I know nothing about big basketball fans on [inaudible].

646
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.640
America's going to be playing basketball,
basketball.
I was like,

647
00:39:39.641 --> 00:39:44.641
we're really living up [inaudible] basketball thing.

648
00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:49.900
I love to see that.
Tia Kosha.
Can you put something like that together?
For sure.

649
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:54.740
I can handle the garden.
Not The end part.
Not the basket robot because the,

650
00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:57.260
the orange uniforms

651
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.780
I picked good ones.
Team writers.
Um,
so the last question for you guys,

652
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:09.970
are you in it to win it?
Yes or no?
Yes.

653
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:15.590
yes.
All Day,

654
00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.820
Yes.
I'm going to to be in it.

655
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:23.830
I'm definitely in it for when it.

656
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.950
Thank you guys so much for joining us here today.

657
00:40:26.951 --> 00:40:31.951
