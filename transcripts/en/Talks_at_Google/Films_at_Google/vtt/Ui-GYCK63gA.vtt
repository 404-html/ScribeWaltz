7
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.290

Who you are,

Hello,

00:00:32.831 --> 00:00:36.760
my name is Nick Frost and I play Ricky Knight.
Are we done?
Yeah.

10
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.390
You don't know where I'm from?
Google me
because yeah,

11
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.140
<v 3>my name is Paige and this,
uh,
this movie's about my life and don't Google me.</v>

12
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.680
I'm Florence Pew and I play her in life all the time.

13
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.380
Lina Hedy,
I play pages

14
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.590
and I'm Jack and I played Zac the brother who's also over there.
Ominously lit.

15
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.680
Genuinely.
So,

16
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.830
<v 0>so page,
let's,
let's kick this off with you for,
for many of you that</v>

17
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.060
<v 3>come on Granddad.
Sure.</v>

18
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.170
<v 0>For many of you that don't know,</v>

19
00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:26.290
there was actually a TV documentary that was made out of your family that kind

20
00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:29.270
of started a little bit of this a picture.
What's it like,
uh,

21
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.120
at this stage in your career?
Very early on,

22
00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:35.540
young to have a TV documentary in a bio pic about you,
you know,
with the rock.

23
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.330
<v 3>Well,
when it comes to the documentary,</v>

24
00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:39.640
I was very used to being in front of the camera cause you know,

25
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:43.450
my mom died love to do a documentary too growing up.
So me and Zach,

26
00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:44.800
what kind of used to that kind of stuff,

27
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.370
we didn't realize that the documentary was going to be so successful.

28
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.360
So a at won awards and we were really happy about it.
But again,

29
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:54.690
you don't think anything of it after that until I'm,

30
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.120
Dwayne approached me one day and said like,
Hey,

31
00:01:58.121 --> 00:02:01.120
we're going to make a movie on you.
And it's like so bizarre to me.

32
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.460
It's very surreal.
So,
um,
yeah,
it's,

33
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.350
and it's very strange to see a girl playing you two and,

34
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.220
and she just did such a fantastic job.

35
00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:12.430
She made me look so much better than I actually am and I'm,

36
00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:15.700
I'm just really thankful for the cost to there.
I've seen incredible.

37
00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:16.534
Apart from nick.

38
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.240
<v 0>She's kidding.
Just kidding.
No,
I'm kidding.</v>

39
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.700
I didn't get to meet page,
uh,
until after the shooting.
So what was it like,

40
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.500
you know,
being able to,
uh,
to pick someone who's,
who's real,
who's alive,

41
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:37.920
who's still very much in kind of the early stage of the career,
um,

42
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.540
to build your own character.

43
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:42.130
That was you and not necessarily just an impersonation of page.

44
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.000
<v 3>So many questions in that.
Yeah,
I didn't,
I didn't,
I didn't meet her.
You can,</v>

45
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:51.230
sorry,
I have a slight cough.
I didn't meet her until about three weeks ago.

46
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.470
Um,
which I think now looking back on it,

47
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.990
I'm quite glad I didn't because I think I would have been studying you probably

48
00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:00.070
a bit creepily.
Um,
but

49
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.160
<v 4>at the time page was injured and she had a neck injury and couldn't fly over and</v>

50
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:09.520
we started filming.
So,
um,
we were just in contact all the time.

51
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.850
A very odd playing,
someone that's,
uh,

52
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.090
not only alive but only a couple of years older than you.

53
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.190
And this only happened a couple of years ago.

54
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:22.750
So she doesn't need a memory refreshing.
She knows about it all.

55
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:24.640
So I suppose,
um,

56
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.590
you just have to kind of take that opportunity and hope that you're not going to

57
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.610
offend or most of the time you hope that you're going to do the story justice.

58
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.250
Um,
and,

59
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.340
and also I suppose make sure that I find some peace in that storyline that I

60
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.830
need to tell as well.

61
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:45.610
So you have to make some sort of amalgamation and then just fingers crossed

62
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:50.200
because she can rustle.
So you hope she doesn't find it offensive.

63
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.530
Sorry.
Yeah.

64
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.960
<v 0>Along those same lines,</v>

65
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.050
you were able to watch a lot of youtube and film because of so much her being on

66
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:02.190
stage or on TV.
How much did you prep and watch for that?

67
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.751
<v 4>I mean,</v>

68
00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:06.620
that's the best thing about playing a famous wrestler is that every single fight

69
00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:10.780
she's ever done is on there.
And even the documentary was just so,
um,

70
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.120
helpful to use because you can see what she was like when she was younger and,

71
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.240
and around her family and how they spoke.
Um,

72
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.510
and actually getting the accent down.

73
00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:22.190
That was really handy to watch the documentary.

74
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.270
<v 0>Jack,
you played the brother,
kind of a very,
very big part of this,</v>

75
00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:29.730
take a lot of the emotional toll through this.
Uh,

76
00:04:29.731 --> 00:04:33.000
I'm curious about with you doing a big core of the wrestling,

77
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.070
how much training went into,
um,
how much of the stunts did you do to prepare for,

78
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.420
for such a physical role?

79
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.780
<v 5>Um,
quite a lot.
I,
I was,
eh,</v>

80
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.290
Zack is a big lot as we call them back home.
Um,

81
00:04:48.291 --> 00:04:49.030
he's a unit,

82
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.630
like there's just a law of Zack and I really wasn't,

83
00:04:53.631 --> 00:04:57.740
I was sort of wafer thin and kind of pathetic.
Looking on,

84
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.940
told that very quickly by our director to em.
I needed to sort of,

85
00:05:01.941 --> 00:05:05.930
there was a lot of work to do to kind of do them justice and so then they are

86
00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:08.870
sore.
Gave me six,
six weeks to do that.

87
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.730
And so I had to eat like four or five meals a day.
I was given a trainer,

88
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.310
a crossfit training,
which is mental.

89
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.230
And I did that twice a day sort of floor.
I'm,
so I'd get the,

90
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.890
if I remember the first day I did it actually.
Um,
I mean,

91
00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:26.900
I barely did anything in the grand scheme of things,

92
00:05:26.901 --> 00:05:30.780
but went home and I fell asleep at three o'clock in the afternoon and I'm

93
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.690
morning.
I was only 26 at the time.
So that's,
that's quite embarrassing.
But I did,

94
00:05:35.691 --> 00:05:40.250
I ended up putting on to roughly two stone,
so I went from sort of 79 kilograms,

95
00:05:40.251 --> 00:05:42.000
so about 90 kilograms and,

96
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.980
but that's still wasn't even anywhere near the size that Zach was.

97
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.990
He's just huge.
Um,
but eh,

98
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:54.440
and then we were lucky enough to go over to the NXT and Florida for a week,

99
00:05:54.441 --> 00:05:56.810
a week and a half,
and do some training with some,

100
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.690
some guys that were like there,
there were only like 60,
75 years old.

101
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.320
Um,
and sort of all walked around with our hands behind our backs and it was all

102
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:10.000
disapproving looks and sort of very little information.
And,
um,

103
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.770
it was wonderful though.
There's,
there was,

104
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.470
it was just hilarious that you had all these professional wrestlers going

105
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:17.030
through all their moves so beautifully.

106
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.070
And then me and Florence pujas sort of huffing and puffing and eh,
but,

107
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.180
but in,
in a good way I think.
But,
but no,
it was,
it was very,

108
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.360
very difficult but very enjoyable to,

109
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.490
to try and get near the sort of size of Zach.

110
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:35.380
And it does even just aesthetically,
obviously it helps,
but it,

111
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.570
I loved the way it felt to sort of carry yourself being bigger than that.

112
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.870
I've always dreamed of being anywhere near that size and that it was a,
yeah.

113
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.150
My favorite thing,
one of my favorite things about playing them,
but the more,

114
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.950
the emotional storyline of it.
This is the,
this is,
I'm realizing as I'm speaking,

115
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:54.340
this is the first time I've spoken about this in front of the reels out.

116
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.220
So it's a little bit,
a little bit,
little bit weird,
but um,

117
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.870
Eh,
his,
his story is actually remarkable.

118
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.320
<v 0>Yeah,
let's get into that.
I mean,</v>

119
00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:08.250
that's a big part of the movie is the emotional storyline of not being selected

120
00:07:08.251 --> 00:07:11.460
and then new,
a new baby,
a lot going on there.

121
00:07:11.461 --> 00:07:14.380
And you kind of carry the emotional rollercoaster of,

122
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.080
of the character throughout the movie.
Um,
how did you,
you know,

123
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.140
I guess prepare for that and cover that while also doing all the physicality of

124
00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:22.974
the wrestling room?

125
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.430
<v 5>M I d I think it's a really cool thing.</v>

126
00:07:26.431 --> 00:07:30.420
That's th th th that it's been explored and I think,
um,
he,

127
00:07:30.421 --> 00:07:35.421
he's an incredibly honest human being and I think everybody's probably dealt

128
00:07:36.391 --> 00:07:39.670
with to some extent in their life.
I dream that they had,
um,

129
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.010
and it may be not coming true.
And,
um,
I think we,
you know,

130
00:07:44.011 --> 00:07:48.030
in this script,
I hope it sort of true enough to,
to,
to what actually happened,

131
00:07:48.031 --> 00:07:52.530
but you know,
it hits that quite hard in,
in,
in the film.
Um,
and as an actor,

132
00:07:52.531 --> 00:07:52.741
you know,

133
00:07:52.741 --> 00:07:57.450
I've obviously all of us have experienced that where there's a brilliant scene

134
00:07:57.451 --> 00:08:01.050
in it where he,
he brings up the,

135
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.370
the gay who auditioned them for the WWE basic to say,
give us another Gore.

136
00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:08.670
And I mean,
I've definitely thought of doing that,
um,
after auditions that I've,

137
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.180
that I've gone horrendous,
horrendously m and s.

138
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.300
So it was quite cool to do,
really,
really was it made,

139
00:08:15.301 --> 00:08:19.980
it made it really interesting.
I love that.
It's,
it's,

140
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.330
and well,
I'm glad it was because it,
um,

141
00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.410
the,
I did it with a guy who was laying in the foot,
well of the car.

142
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.420
He's in that scene as this little Canadian book lying there,

143
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:38.130
like squeezed up like that with sites with giving me utterly nothing.

144
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.970
So am I to stick my finger in my eye and uh,
do all the fake crying.
Okay.

145
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.150
<v 0>And Zach was on set with you a lot,</v>

146
00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.570
so you got to kind of work with him and meet him throughout the

147
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.080
<v 5>Zach's Zach's in the film.
And so there's an even weirder moment where,
um,</v>

148
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.930
Zach plays a drug dealer in the,
Eh,
Eh,

149
00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.890
and I grew up in a van and look at him and he said something to me.

150
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:06.510
So that was utterly bizarre and they really,
really weird.
But,
um,
he's,

151
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.060
I,
he's a remarkable human being.
And I went up to north shore.

152
00:09:10.061 --> 00:09:14.570
I was given a chance to go up there and watch him run the WEA w which is their,

153
00:09:14.571 --> 00:09:19.260
their company.
And for me it's better than the WWE.
Um,
I'm a massive fan of,

154
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:23.010
of amateur and Semipro sport.
I'm a big semipro football phone,
buck,

155
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:27.070
stop their soccer ball,
uh,
back in the UK.
And,
and,
and I,

156
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.780
I picked people who have that much passion and who do it for,
you know,

157
00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:35.490
a 10th of the money even,
nor money,
I think is,
in my opinion,
way more impressive.

158
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.500
And I think what he's done,
and he's such an enormous part of his community,

159
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.900
I really take my hat off to,
on these amazing,

160
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:47.010
<v 0>yeah.
And teaching a blind wrestlers big part of that too.
Like the movie.</v>

161
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.470
<v 5>Yeah.
And that,
that's a verbatim true story.
He,
he taught,
he taught,
I blamed care.</v>

162
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.100
Total wrestle.
Um,
you know,
I think when you think you've done,

163
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.930
you think you've done something well in life,

164
00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.360
and then someone tells you that a human being taught a blanket,
her arrest,

165
00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:01.820
or like,
you're really not trying that hard.

166
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.290
<v 0>Uh,
nick,
I want to,
I want to touch on the father figure,</v>

167
00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:12.291
a Ricky who talks multiple times about being a violent crime offender,

168
00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:15.390
of going to prison for violent crimes.
You've done a lot of comedy.

169
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.650
How did you take that character that has kind of a rough around the edges but

170
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:23.250
also is the cornerstone of the family and really doing what's best for them in

171
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.310
and bring your version?

172
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:29.140
<v 6>Uh,
I dunno,
I mean I think I'm always keen to point out that,
you know,</v>

173
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.020
comedy and drama and not mutually exclusive.
Do you know what I mean?

174
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:36.640
There's comedy in everything.
Even funerals,
you know,

175
00:10:36.641 --> 00:10:41.300
that's,
I don't think you can just be funny and not feel the other emotions.
Uh,

176
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.920
the human may feel.
Um,

177
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.940
I think Ricky was a dream for me to play really.
Cause it's as an actor,

178
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.710
it's everything you really want to be.

179
00:10:50.711 --> 00:10:55.220
You want someone who's a bit funny on his emotional and is a lunatic.
Uh,

180
00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:00.580
he,
he,
he was a treat.
And I kind of,
I mean me and Zack,

181
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.450
Zack and stuff today and getting to know page a little bit and see in the

182
00:11:04.451 --> 00:11:08.260
documentary,
I mean there are a lot like my,
my own family,
you know,

183
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:13.300
my own brother was a lot like Zack.
He was a bit of a loony,
um,

184
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:18.550
with a,
with a good,
you know,
good heart,
good egg.
And,
um,
I think we've,
Ricky,

185
00:11:18.551 --> 00:11:21.490
I like the fact that,
you know,

186
00:11:21.491 --> 00:11:25.150
so often you see a character who's bad or who has made a mistake and there's not

187
00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:28.390
much redemption.
And I like the fact that,
you know,
yes,

188
00:11:28.391 --> 00:11:30.790
he did that and he was those things,

189
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:36.180
but he's also a passionate father and husband and I guess dynamite in the sac.

190
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.830
Um,

191
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.960
why are you not?
But he's a trip.

192
00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.220
He's a dream to play for me personally.
Cause especially with Steven,

193
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.400
I'm the director,
you know,
he,
he was keen that,
you know,

194
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.180
I add a little something in and I didn't want to do an impression of Reiki.

195
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:02.920
I wanted to,
uh,
kind of,
uh,
an impression of,
of who he was as a man,

196
00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:03.480
you know?

197
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.810
<v 0>Yeah.
And so you bring up Steven and a lot of the dialogue,
I mean,</v>

198
00:12:06.811 --> 00:12:08.640
it's very quick,
very witty.
Uh,

199
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:13.080
how did you kind of embrace that and bring that into the piece?
It was,

200
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.340
there was so much back and forth.

201
00:12:14.341 --> 00:12:17.040
We saw a couple of the jokes of Vin diesel joke and all these other pieces in

202
00:12:17.041 --> 00:12:18.760
there that they throw in.

203
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.411
<v 6>Uh,
yeah,</v>

204
00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:22.140
I mean it's quite limp on the page and the actors really bringing it to life.

205
00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:26.430
I think.
Um,
uh,
I know,
you know,
Steven Robert,

206
00:12:26.431 --> 00:12:31.431
great script and we had fun and we had the time to muck about and you know,

207
00:12:31.861 --> 00:12:34.110
once you've kind of honored what has been written,

208
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:37.540
there was always time for a something looser or uh,

209
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.880
an improvisation or if one of us have a better idea or,
you know,

210
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.930
we were allowed a voice and that's always a plus.
I think we like it.

211
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.980
We will like each other.
And the crew was great and I think,
yeah,

212
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.750
some of us like each other.
Yeah.
And the crew was great.

213
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.670
And I think that for me personally,

214
00:12:53.671 --> 00:12:57.540
that gives you an ease and the fact that you kind of trust people enough to put

215
00:12:57.541 --> 00:13:02.250
a bit of yourself,
leave a bit of yourself out there,
you know?
I mean,

216
00:13:02.251 --> 00:13:05.730
what bit is,
yeah,
oh,
sometimes it was just liquid,

217
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:11.010
but other times,
spirit and heart,
you know,
but a lot of liquid.

218
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:14.060
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

219
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:19.060
Just to say that Steven really transport,

220
00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:23.360
he,
he,
he took away from the documentary and put onto page really well,

221
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:28.310
I think that was something that stood out to me was watching the documentary and

222
00:13:28.311 --> 00:13:31.670
falling in love with that family was exactly the same as the way that Stephen

223
00:13:31.671 --> 00:13:34.140
had put it down.
And I think as a testament to say how,

224
00:13:34.141 --> 00:13:36.470
how good he did with the script.

225
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.870
<v 0>So we don't want to ask you,
you know,
we talked about bad characters.</v>

226
00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:43.880
You're pretty famous for playing a bad character on TV.
Uh,

227
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:49.530
what was it like kind of taking the TV a big hit and playing into a movie and a

228
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:51.630
mom and someone who's here,
uh,

229
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.370
and there's a character and kind of embracing her role?

230
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.870
<v 7>Um,
I,
well I'm such a big fan of Julia.</v>

231
00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:01.630
I think she's an incredible woman and I watched a lot.

232
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.630
I watched the documentary and I watched,
um,

233
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:08.670
interviews that she did and she's had a really interesting,

234
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:14.790
sometimes tricky history and so she sought to sort of powerful,

235
00:14:16.871 --> 00:14:19.900
resilient person.
And I,
like Nick said,

236
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:24.160
it's like you don't want to do like an impersonation you want to do,
uh,

237
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:29.520
you want to portray someone with respect and bring in who they are at the core.

238
00:14:29.831 --> 00:14:33.430
And all these characters are such big,
a joyous,

239
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.520
honest people that fuck up and do really well and nothing's hidden.

240
00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:40.600
Like everything's just out on the table,

241
00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:44.690
which is why you can't not fall in love with them.
Um,

242
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:46.780
and I didn't want it.
Julie's beat me up

243
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:48.723
<v 0>his bottom line.</v>

244
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.160
And how much training did you to go through mean you definitely have scenes

245
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.740
<v 6>of the movie where you're in the ring.
And did you do a lot of uh,</v>

246
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.160
training for the,
for the wrestling part,

247
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:03.140
two of us together and we told,
wrestled it was good.
I was always,

248
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.530
I liked wrestling.
I was a keen wrestler,
keen amateur wrestler.

249
00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:11.030
I wrestled men I in pubs and privately in my own home.
Um,

250
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:16.010
and I,
I,
I'd always loved Dressler's boots.
I was always fascinated.

251
00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:17.660
I was always like,
oh my God,
their boots were amazing.

252
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.400
And then when we started to do the film,
they said,

253
00:15:19.401 --> 00:15:22.880
so we're going to meet you all hadn't made wrestling boots.
I was like,
oh my God,

254
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:25.010
this is incredible.
But just to kind of get boots on and,

255
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.700
and have a wrestle and the ring was very hard and noisy and squeaky and it was

256
00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:35.270
great.
Right.
We had fun.
Anyone?
Yeah,
no,
I loved it.

257
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.410
I loved it.
I was saying earlier,
I can recognize everyone by smell.

258
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.500
So paid.
When you saw the film,
you know,
you have this amazing cast.
Did you,

259
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.940
how did you feel that they depicted your family?
Yeah.

260
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.640
<v 3>Oh,
they killed it.</v>

261
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.190
And I'm not just saying that because I'm sent upstairs at home,
stayed with them,

262
00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:58.420
um,
or it's about my story,
but they really did kill it,
kill it.
Because you know,

263
00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.430
95% of the,
the movie was very true to story.
And,

264
00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.290
and they didn't get to spend any time with us.
Like I told apart from,
you know,

265
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.460
Jack A.
Little bit with who is Aggie boy over there.
But um,
I just fought.

266
00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.180
It was,
it was,
I cried my eyes out like the first time I watched it,

267
00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.010
like I see I blob it ever.

268
00:16:15.011 --> 00:16:17.290
I couldn't get through the whole movie because I was just crying because I was

269
00:16:17.291 --> 00:16:21.120
like,
these guys are just like,
it's so perfectly done.
And,

270
00:16:21.121 --> 00:16:24.850
and Steven did such a good job in the script enough with like,
so if,

271
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.400
I didn't know if you guys have seen it or not yet,
or you're about to see it,

272
00:16:27.401 --> 00:16:30.670
but they say some pretty crude stuff,
riots and some crazy stuff.

273
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.710
That's just something familiar.
But as Steven said,

274
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.720
like only had to do is pretty much follow.

275
00:16:34.721 --> 00:16:39.721
My parents went with a notepad and the s the script pretty much wrote itself and

276
00:16:40.151 --> 00:16:43.100
people always think that it's not real,
but that's the Luci who they are.
And,

277
00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:45.160
and these guys just absolutely killed it.

278
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.840
And the thing that broke my heart the most was the CN.

279
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.080
Jack did such a good job playing my brother.

280
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:55.470
And the wonderful part of Zach story is the fact that it kind of shows you that

281
00:16:55.631 --> 00:16:59.230
you don't have to be a successful in the way,
it shouldn't be measured.

282
00:16:59.231 --> 00:17:00.460
Your sorry.

283
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.520
Your level is success shouldn't be measured by how famous you are or how many

284
00:17:05.741 --> 00:17:08.890
people you have on Instagram or how many cameras are in front of your face.

285
00:17:08.891 --> 00:17:12.010
So how many people you're doing interviews in front of success is,

286
00:17:12.011 --> 00:17:14.830
is reaching a goal that you set for yourself.
For VR.
For example,

287
00:17:14.831 --> 00:17:19.090
Zach wanted a family and now he has two kids and Zach wanted to train disabled

288
00:17:19.091 --> 00:17:21.970
children,
had a wrestle and now he has someone with Down's syndrome.

289
00:17:21.971 --> 00:17:23.710
He wants to learn how to wrestle someone who was blind,

290
00:17:23.711 --> 00:17:25.840
who wants to learn how to wrestle,
you know,
and uh,

291
00:17:25.841 --> 00:17:29.110
also you want to be part of my dad's company,
which,
you know,
if you guys want,

292
00:17:29.111 --> 00:17:31.580
she says,
my dad said they're available.
Um,

293
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:33.613
<v 6>yes.</v>

294
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:37.900
<v 3>I feel like Jack just portrayed that in such a wonderful way and it just,</v>

295
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.630
it just completely broke my heart,
especially that scene.

296
00:17:40.631 --> 00:17:42.230
It was absolutely incredible.
I was like,

297
00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.660
<v 6>I wanted a coach.
I'd be like,
I'm so sorry dude.
But</v>

298
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.921
<v 3>yeah,</v>

299
00:17:46.921 --> 00:17:49.980
they just did such an incredible job and I'm sorry the answer was really long,

300
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.960
but,
um,
I loved it.

301
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.160
<v 0>Another big theme in the movie is I think the Rock Center says a line,</v>

302
00:17:56.161 --> 00:17:58.740
but don't try to be the next me.
You'd be the first year.

303
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:03.330
How did you embrace that?
I mean,
when you came on stage,
uh,
being,
you know,
from,

304
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:07.200
from Norwich and with all the models and the different,
he says in the movie

305
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.680
<v 3>kind of,
yeah.
It was a little bit different.
Yeah.
Well,</v>

306
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.220
when I first came over here,
like,
uh,

307
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:14.820
I didn't know anything about makeup was wearing my brother's hand me downs and

308
00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:18.720
uh,
and I didn't know how to brush my hair still don't,
and it was just,

309
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:20.820
it was very strange.
I was,
I was very insecure.

310
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:24.580
Like I was confident enough to know,
okay,
I'm going to be in the WWE and I'm,

311
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.890
I'm gonna fight till I make it.

312
00:18:25.891 --> 00:18:28.530
But it's another story once you come over here to a different country.

313
00:18:28.531 --> 00:18:30.260
It was a big culture shock and,

314
00:18:30.261 --> 00:18:33.240
and it was just so different because the women were so beautiful.

315
00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:36.270
The kind of ones that you see in slow motion with smoke machines and doves

316
00:18:36.271 --> 00:18:39.690
flying behind them and they're just like,
ah.
And I'm just like,
Damn.

317
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:42.780
And then there's me and my frumpy jackets and baggy clothes and like smelled

318
00:18:42.781 --> 00:18:45.960
probably really bad,
you know,
like they're just so beautiful.

319
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.740
And so I was really insecure.
Um,
but the one thing,

320
00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:50.680
even though it was super learning,

321
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.690
I didn't have any friends when I first came over here.
I still don't,
but,
um,

322
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:59.040
the one,
I'm never,
the one thing that,
uh,

323
00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:03.840
I did have with my family and they just made me feel like I was,

324
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:07.620
um,
very unique in that case.
I was there and,
uh,

325
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.350
someone told me before that being yourself is your superpower.
So,
um,

326
00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.250
I kind of took that and was like,
I tried to be something I wasn't,

327
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.810
which is when I lightened my hair and took my piercings out and got Tan,

328
00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:22.590
which is so strange for me.
Um,
but,
uh,

329
00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:25.920
I kind of took that after a couple of months of being there and cry my eyes out.

330
00:19:25.921 --> 00:19:28.950
I'm like embracing it and being like,
you know what?
Fuck you.
This is me.

331
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.230
That's just how it was.
And then,
uh,
it kind of ran with that and now we're here.

332
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.430
<v 0>So there's a lot of about perseverance,
wanting to quit.</v>

333
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.920
I think that's very relevant to,

334
00:19:40.921 --> 00:19:43.680
for the acting world where it takes a lot to kind of get to that level success.

335
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.500
How did that storyline kind of play to you as,
as,
uh,

336
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.370
actors in your career?
Open ended for any of it.

337
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.870
<v 5>Am I dye?
It obviously plays a massive part,
you know,</v>

338
00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:01.030
you're not saving lives doing this.
Um,

339
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.570
you know,
you're,
you have to enjoy it in my opinion.
You,
you're,

340
00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:09.660
you're obliged to enjoy.
It's your responsibility to enjoy it.
And um,

341
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.150
it's remarkable.
How often am I,

342
00:20:14.151 --> 00:20:15.590
I'm probably not speaking for just me either.

343
00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:20.170
So it's remarkable how often it's not enjoyable when,
because it's so about you,

344
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.400
this profession,
it's so you,
it's not like what you do with,

345
00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.720
you can't do your work and then stand back and people can look at your work.

346
00:20:26.721 --> 00:20:28.130
It's,
it's you.
And,
um,

347
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:33.310
I totally took that for granted before I got into this and sort of it's gotten

348
00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.060
easier and harder at the same team.

349
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:39.500
So it's exactly what these guys do.
You know,

350
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:44.770
what they do is the perfect combination of,
of sport and drama.
It really is.
I,
I,

351
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:49.660
it honestly is the best night I've had when I went up there.
I,
it's,
it's,

352
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:53.290
it's,
it's tremendous and it's full blooded as well.
You know,

353
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.920
a lot of people in our profession get like a lot of credit for being method or

354
00:20:59.531 --> 00:21:01.450
going deep and all this clinic,
you know,

355
00:21:01.451 --> 00:21:04.450
stuff that they like to say that makes them sound a lot sexier than they

356
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:08.740
actually are.
But like if you want to see going deep,
you go and watch going.

357
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:13.700
What's the wea w like the,
like their commitment in front of an audience is,

358
00:21:13.701 --> 00:21:15.520
is extraordinary.
And also,
you know,

359
00:21:15.521 --> 00:21:20.521
it to do what they do and not in front of an audience that's that much bigger

360
00:21:21.131 --> 00:21:23.070
than the audience.
We have no,
like,
you know,

361
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.960
the WWE without you respect her in front of 20,000 people,

362
00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:28.630
it's probably quite easy to get jacked up and get into it.

363
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.480
But to do it in front of,
um,
you know,
not a great deal amount of people is,

364
00:21:33.481 --> 00:21:35.650
is even more impressive,
you know,

365
00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:40.510
and it's kind of like doing a fringe or the Edinburgh festival when you do a

366
00:21:40.511 --> 00:21:44.050
play and like a cafe,
like it's a lot harder.
It's a lot,
lot harder.

367
00:21:44.051 --> 00:21:46.870
So like the respect level's huge for what they do.

368
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.870
<v 0>All right.
Anybody else have any thoughts on that topic?</v>

369
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.030
Yeah,
Jack competent covered it a perfect.

370
00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.343
Um,

371
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.170
so what was it like having the Rock Dwayne Johnson involvement in this?

372
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:08.260
There's a lot of parallels to his family,
uh,
into your family.

373
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.680
How much of that having him being a producer on this,
um,

374
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:16.180
played into a little bit more of like the overall wrestling family kind of piece

375
00:22:16.181 --> 00:22:20.560
of this picture?
Is that an open question?
Open ended question.

376
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:29.230
<v 6>Oh,
I never met the rock until last week,
so I was really nervous.
I'd never,</v>

377
00:22:29.231 --> 00:22:30.080
I was a big fan of,

378
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.970
I was a fan of the rock for years and then I kept talking to the producer,

379
00:22:33.971 --> 00:22:34.691
kind of saying,
hey,

380
00:22:34.691 --> 00:22:39.360
is though the real cover then a thumb down or the road didn't ask about the,

381
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:44.400
I've seen how fuzzy and I just said keep dropping hints and stuff and you'd have

382
00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.620
a go ahead and touch.
But,

383
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:51.630
so then I saw him like last week at Sundance and I was fairly nervous and um,

384
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.540
I practice three or four different versions of how I would meet him.

385
00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:59.680
And then at the end when you're faced with such a colossus,

386
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.610
all that falls to the side and you're,
you're just left saying,
hey here.

387
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:11.620
And that was it.
That was kind of what I go out.
I didn't know what,
I mean,

388
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.990
he does good in the poster.
He wasn't therefore,

389
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.160
um,
did you,

390
00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:24.400
did you send him your Jumanji audition tape?
No,

391
00:23:24.401 --> 00:23:27.940
I keep mentioning Jumanji too a lot.
Hoping that some,

392
00:23:27.941 --> 00:23:31.240
there'll be some kind of trickle down costing,
but I haven't heard,

393
00:23:31.241 --> 00:23:35.940
I haven't checked today but I haven't heard whether or not I'm in this.

394
00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:40.390
I think they're starting to fill up their roster of actors on a Danny Glover

395
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:44.350
recently got costs,
but I met him at Sundance briefing.

396
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:46.070
He didn't who I was when I was

397
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.600
<v 8>leaving there and if we did it,
I went home and he went hi and like Whoa.</v>

398
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.540
And I went up.
That was,
that was my extra,

399
00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:59.840
<v 4>in all seriousness though,
he did work.
Um,
sorry.
I'm,</v>

400
00:23:59.841 --> 00:24:03.650
I'm going to give him some good,
good things now.
Needs help.

401
00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:08.580
He needs a bit of help.
Um,
uh,
Jack and I worked with him obviously on,

402
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.850
on our first day of shoot.

403
00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:13.360
He did the scene where he shouted to us for 40 minutes.
Um,

404
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:17.800
and yeah,
it was,
it was fun.
He's really big.

405
00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.740
He eats a lot and I keep on saying that he,

406
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:25.510
he looks really smooth cause he does look really smooth.
Um,
but no,

407
00:24:25.511 --> 00:24:29.490
we had a great time and we were both just so amazed by how he,

408
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.030
but he basically went away and wrote that and then we exchange lines to figure

409
00:24:34.031 --> 00:24:34.960
out what we were going to say.

410
00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:38.110
And then he walked away and came back 20 minutes later and he knew this huge

411
00:24:38.111 --> 00:24:42.400
monologue promo and he just basically barked at us.
It was amazing.

412
00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.250
Um,
and then also towards the end,
I,
I did,
uh,
uh,

413
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.750
the pages fight in the staple center,
um,

414
00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.400
after Monday night raw and he was very much involved with the wrestling.

415
00:24:54.401 --> 00:24:58.380
So that was really lovely of him.
And uh,
yeah,

416
00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.850
those were the times that we work together.

417
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.670
<v 0>So I do want to open up to audience questions,
so if people want on up,</v>

418
00:25:03.671 --> 00:25:06.940
we have two mikes on both sides.
Um,
while people are lining up.

419
00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:11.680
I have a fun question for you and I'm there.
If you were a,

420
00:25:11.681 --> 00:25:14.620
this is more for the cast since pagers has already been picked.

421
00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:19.990
If you were a WWE wrestler,
what would your stage name be and what would your,

422
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.840
what would your finishing move?
B

423
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:28.030
<v 8>Lena has a really good one.
Cool.
Choo Choo.
Yeah,</v>

424
00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:33.230
but she comes on to Chile.
That's like a locomotive.
My uh,

425
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.330
my fuel is farts

426
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.440
and I just released one long deadly woe to

427
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:47.330
talk to anyone that's ever been done.
Oh actually yeah.

428
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.880
<v 4>Um,
not a,
which is um,
uh,
she,
she's a hot,</v>

429
00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.200
I want it part of the heart foundation.

430
00:25:53.201 --> 00:25:56.110
She had to fight on screen a lot and not know it as the fact that she was fine

431
00:25:56.111 --> 00:25:59.260
but Vince point,
it was hilarious.
There's yet she had to do it for months so,

432
00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.450
so like so,
but she was,
she's done in front of people just like,

433
00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.390
and that was all she had to do.
Months.
She got paid to fought.

434
00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:10.960
<v 8>Who did they have like a thing in her trousers were smoke would come out cause</v>

435
00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:15.680
that's got green gas.
Cooling your dad and being like,
Dad,

436
00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:19.880
I did it.
Yeah,
I'm playing the falter.
Thank God they're not making me queasy.

437
00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.870
I knew your Mama like that one.

438
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.220
<v 0>Anybody else have a wrestling name?
Yeah.</v>

439
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:31.171
<v 8>Um,
I,</v>

440
00:26:31.171 --> 00:26:36.171
I would be called rump steak and he wouldn't be so much as a wrestler.

441
00:26:36.521 --> 00:26:39.580
I,
I've thought he would just be around the ring.

442
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:44.160
It dressed in like a dress and grown it addressing going,
it's,
it comes

443
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.290
<v 5>from my prison name.
If I went to prison,</v>

444
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.950
I was told that I would be cooking known as sort of rump steak and sort of pass

445
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:54.330
their own.
And in a sort of two,
he cane away and I kind of think,

446
00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.510
I kind of think rump state could fill that kind of spot in [inaudible] so he's

447
00:26:57.511 --> 00:26:59.430
not featured,
he's just always there,

448
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.340
every single wrestling match and he just walks to vote in a,

449
00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:06.660
in a dressing gown and he,
uh,
and it's just sort of when he's given the signal,

450
00:27:06.661 --> 00:27:09.660
he just comes on and it's just there just to be used in any way.

451
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.250
Does he cook key stake?
No.

452
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:20.020
Well,
never do anything that sends you to prison.
Just having her that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

453
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.970
It sounds like you had something awfully traumatic happened to you and this is

454
00:27:23.971 --> 00:27:25.860
something that your brain is invented to cover it.

455
00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.330
<v 4>Wrestling.
Uh,
uh,
alter ego reminds me of of the alter ego.</v>

456
00:27:32.331 --> 00:27:36.350
The I came up with in case I wasn't page and it was me and Renee young and we

457
00:27:36.351 --> 00:27:38.410
said we were dressed in dressing gowns.
Sir.
I don't know,

458
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.720
I'm stealing your gimmick a little bit but we would be cool to sleep as and

459
00:27:41.721 --> 00:27:45.890
we'll put you to sleep and then we'll give him a buns on the rest and be like,

460
00:27:45.891 --> 00:27:50.330
you just got a case of the Melatonin
and then you'd be like,

461
00:27:50.331 --> 00:27:54.550
are you ready for your wet dream?
And then wow,
well you could,

462
00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:58.350
I'm not going to tell you about it,
but they didn't happen.
No of course is an sl,

463
00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:01.430
but it's an idea.
Yeah.
But you can join it.

464
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:03.460
<v 5>No anything.
I definitely think there's a gap and WWE,</v>

465
00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:06.860
I think there's a market for something a little bit more high bro.
Like that.

466
00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.940
I don't know Nigga,
I think we filled enough to allow the question.

467
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.730
One person lined up to there is stage Coleen.
First off,

468
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:19.020
thanks for coming out guys.
We really appreciate it.
Um,

469
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.740
I'm someone who grew up kind of watching like the attitude area,
uh,

470
00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.400
attitude era of WWE.
So there was a lot of cool crossover.

471
00:28:26.401 --> 00:28:28.380
It's cool at the rock is in this.
Uh,

472
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.550
were there any other stars from WWE that were on set helping out that didn't

473
00:28:32.551 --> 00:28:33.510
make it on camera?

474
00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.380
<v 4>Oh,
I,
I don't know that part.</v>

475
00:28:35.381 --> 00:28:38.020
I just know the ones that were on camera and the moves he gets in everything.

476
00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:42.630
So of course he was on there.
They can Mike,
it shows you,
it shows you a bitch.

477
00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:46.900
And um,
but we had that,
that was the one day.

478
00:28:46.901 --> 00:28:49.030
So when we show at Monday night raw,

479
00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.220
we were there and we were Kinda just milling about,

480
00:28:51.221 --> 00:28:55.510
waiting for our opportunity to go on after the show was over.
So Steven was that,

481
00:28:55.511 --> 00:28:58.600
she'd just go down the whole thing like,
hi,
anybody want to be in the film?

482
00:28:58.601 --> 00:29:01.780
Please be in the film.
And so all these like room walked past

483
00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.680
these massive wrestlers were just walking bow in their little speedos and,

484
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:08.471
and like just,

485
00:29:08.471 --> 00:29:12.690
we were just hoping that there'd be doing a gag with me and the food and then

486
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.270
that was a good one there.
That was like me when I,

487
00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.350
when I first got there I was just like,
everyone's like,

488
00:29:17.351 --> 00:29:18.250
you shouldn't eat that much.

489
00:29:18.251 --> 00:29:20.830
I'm like only wherever I want to and I'm just grabbing hot dogs,

490
00:29:20.831 --> 00:29:24.080
burgers and everything.
All the goals written like salads.
Like,
yeah,

491
00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.490
I'm just like,
no,
I like food.
That was perfect.
I love it.

492
00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:30.760
<v 5>Cool.
Well that was that.</v>

493
00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:35.280
Sorry there was that one question you guys came out.
I,
I'll keep asking that.

494
00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:39.900
So
thank you.
Everyone feel

495
00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:47.080
<v 8>nope.
Oh yeah.
Oh I on.
Oh you don't use the bathroom.
Oh,</v>

496
00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:47.914
he's off to do a shit.

497
00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.960
<v 9>Well,
hello.
Hi.
Uh,</v>

498
00:29:51.961 --> 00:29:54.060
I had to think of a question really quick cause I didn't wanna miss this

499
00:29:54.061 --> 00:29:55.750
opportunity.
You.
But,
um,

500
00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:00.930
I'm Irish so I'm not from the U S I noticed there's like a different sense of

501
00:30:00.931 --> 00:30:03.360
humor in the u s than there is in the UK and Ireland.

502
00:30:03.361 --> 00:30:05.730
I think we kind of get each other more.

503
00:30:05.731 --> 00:30:08.670
So how do you think American woody and says we'll take to the movie?

504
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.190
<v 4>I think no fucking love it.</v>

505
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:12.290
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

506
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:14.670
<v 4>Oldest screen is you went to,</v>

507
00:30:14.671 --> 00:30:18.690
everyone's literally dying laughing and I love that.
All the crying,
you know,

508
00:30:18.691 --> 00:30:23.460
we did have to,
so there couple of the lines.
So there's a really good line in it.

509
00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:26.820
Dick me dead buried.
We pregnant and when we'd be filming,

510
00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:29.910
Stevie would have to basically measure how many Dick me,
dad's,

511
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.290
each person could get.

512
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:36.560
So like if someone said the f word or if someone said Dick or it would be like a

513
00:30:37.411 --> 00:30:41.650
tally.
So there'd only be a certain amount of Fox and decks and Willie's there,

514
00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:45.180
I heard they had to change that just for American audiences because it was,

515
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:49.820
fuck me dead marines.
You're only allowed like to fuck me dead,

516
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.750
dead sparing me pregnant.
And the rug was even allowed to say it.

517
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:57.150
<v 8>Oh,
a lot pallets.
Yeah,
of course.</v>

518
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:59.420
<v 6>Sorry you,
I'm sorry you asked now</v>

519
00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:05.790
<v 4>what was the question?</v>

520
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:12.310
<v 8>Okay.
Sensibilities in comedy.
Oh,
internationally you can answer that one.</v>

521
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:17.350
Let me answer to that.
Oh,
uh,
I look,
okay.
So I mean,
I think,

522
00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:18.483
I think if you try and

523
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:23.600
<v 6>dilute or try and try and second guess what an international audience who like</v>

524
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:29.970
you,
you,
I think you dilute what the thing that is that made people laugh.

525
00:31:29.971 --> 00:31:30.804
Do you know what I mean?

526
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:34.380
So I think things I've made in the past immediately that have worked all over

527
00:31:34.381 --> 00:31:37.260
the place.
You just do what makes your mates laugh really.

528
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.990
And I think I've found all over the world,

529
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:45.090
there is that gang of people that then feel like what you've made is speaking to

530
00:31:45.091 --> 00:31:49.170
them a new directly,
you know?
Yeah.
And Our van,
sir.

531
00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.473
<v 8>Okay.</v>

532
00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:54.693
<v 9>Okay.</v>

533
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.640
<v 8>So I would love to,
to hear what,
you know,
your,
your,
um,</v>

534
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:03.690
last go home.
Little bit bold now I'm joking.
Oh,
whoa.

535
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:08.890
Oh No,
this is that.
So this is my brother.

536
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.440
I don't have a question.

537
00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.330
<v 10>In fact,
I just wanted to,
I talk to you jack.</v>

538
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.450
That's the first time I've heard you say anything.
Um,

539
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.710
my sisters told me about all the interviews you've done,
but you know,

540
00:32:22.711 --> 00:32:25.170
just stood there and you just made a six foot,

541
00:32:25.171 --> 00:32:30.030
three 18 stone guy cry to make sure that everyone knew here.

542
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.880
How much I appreciate you playing my character.

543
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.700
I know it would have been no one else of Barbara played my character.

544
00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.180
Thank you so much.
And thank you from what you then call it.

545
00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.073
Why'd you just give it

546
00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.570
<v 2>moment?
Yeah.</v>

547
00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:55.780
<v 3>Does going to do the same thing to you?</v>

548
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.800
<v 6>Well that's a nice place to end it.
I'd like to thank,</v>

549
00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:04.650
we would like to thank you all for up.
I just have a look at a clip.

550
00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.190
There's another question.
That's a beautiful moment to end on.
So,
uh,
one more.

551
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:11.780
Jesus.
We found thousands of miles.

552
00:33:11.781 --> 00:33:16.310
There's two people at Google wants to ask a question.
Ah,
three that'd be good.

553
00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:20.950
Thank you guys do and thanks for coming.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I was going to quit

554
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:25.550
<v 11>growing up here.
Did wrestling was very much a part of it.
How can the culture,</v>

555
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:29.600
when I was a kid there was it breakfast cereals in the Saturday morning cartoons

556
00:33:29.601 --> 00:33:33.980
and you know,
and uh,
I was just curious.
In the UK,
what does it like,
is it,

557
00:33:33.981 --> 00:33:36.080
is wrestling similar?
Is it,

558
00:33:36.081 --> 00:33:38.240
is it part of the popular culture in the same way it was here?

559
00:33:38.241 --> 00:33:42.140
Do you he's our wrestling,
the American wrestling popular there.

560
00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.440
<v 3>Uh,
yeah,
American wrestling is very popular over the,</v>

561
00:33:44.441 --> 00:33:47.620
actually that's where we do two tours a year over there.
Um,
is,

562
00:33:47.621 --> 00:33:50.830
is pretty successful and when we do go and uh,
yeah,

563
00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.100
British wrestling was a huge thing and we had wall to sport growing up and stuff

564
00:33:54.101 --> 00:33:58.060
like that and it was good.
Big Daddy.
Yeah.
Um,
so,

565
00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.910
but ace is really grown in the last couple of years now.

566
00:34:00.911 --> 00:34:02.860
Like it has just Indy federations everywhere.

567
00:34:02.861 --> 00:34:07.000
I don't see JP debris if opened up a performance center and to UK over that now.

568
00:34:07.001 --> 00:34:10.780
So,
um,
yeah,
it's just a alive over there as it is here.

569
00:34:10.781 --> 00:34:15.670
We're just a very small country.
So,
uh,
obviously is not as many.
Yeah.

570
00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:18.140
<v 6>I used to watch wrestling on a Saturday morning.</v>

571
00:34:18.141 --> 00:34:20.960
It was on for like an hour in the mornings and that was it,
you know,

572
00:34:20.961 --> 00:34:22.670
and there was a,
as Paige said,

573
00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.330
a character called big daddy and another guy called giant haystacks and they

574
00:34:26.331 --> 00:34:28.700
will always,
they started off in their own,

575
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.970
they were a tag team and then essentially there became enemies.

576
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.600
So to watch those two guys going at it,
that was my,

577
00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:38.390
my kind of beginning of wrestling and it was always,
I think maybe you know,

578
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:43.610
the birth of where w d a w started in small little halls around the country and

579
00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:44.781
it would travel.

580
00:34:44.781 --> 00:34:49.280
And the guy who presented it was a guy called Dicky Davis and he was very dapper

581
00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:53.450
and he had like dense big black hair,
but he had like a white streak in it,

582
00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:58.130
like the mum at the end of poltergeist.
Uh,
so that,
yeah,

583
00:34:58.131 --> 00:35:00.830
that's where wrestling started for me as well.
You know,

584
00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.300
in many ways I keep trying to think,
ah,
a biopic of their,

585
00:35:08.301 --> 00:35:12.110
their battle would be a great film by keep,
it keeps getting knocked back.

586
00:35:12.111 --> 00:35:15.260
People keep saying,
well it's two British perhaps and it wouldn't travel.

587
00:35:15.261 --> 00:35:19.010
But I think that shit,
no,

588
00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.390
we've opened up a gate.

589
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:25.980
<v 11>Thanks for coming.
So to go on that question,</v>

590
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:27.900
if you were a fan of wrestling growing up,

591
00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.680
who was your favorite wrestler and why?

592
00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:31.983
<v 3>Um,</v>

593
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.010
can I answer this question because I know I've always been a fan of wrestling,

594
00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:39.510
obviously it's obvious.
Um,
but,
uh,
I really loved,

595
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.670
I don't know how big of restaurant signs you guys are in here,

596
00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:45.270
but there's a woman called born Chicano and I was a really big fan of hers cause

597
00:35:45.271 --> 00:35:49.770
she was very different.
She was this,
um,
really big Asian,

598
00:35:49.771 --> 00:35:50.910
just beautiful woman.

599
00:35:50.911 --> 00:35:53.340
And she was just so different to the rest of the women in WWE.

600
00:35:53.341 --> 00:35:55.480
And that's where I stole one of my wrestling moves apart from Zach's Ba.

601
00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:58.560
And then,
uh,
also I love Leah because she was very different.

602
00:35:58.561 --> 00:36:02.080
And obviously Dwayne,
I'll put you over if he's watching,
I don't know.
And uh,

603
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:06.240
and stone called,
cause he just was just a Badass dude who was so amazing.

604
00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:08.220
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

605
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.053
<v 3>no one else like wrestling.</v>

606
00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:15.850
<v 6>I think the stone cold was one of my favorites.
I know the old English bunch.</v>

607
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.650
I,
I like big daddy and giant haystacks,
but when Kendo,
Nagasaki,
when he,

608
00:36:20.651 --> 00:36:23.730
when he ran into the ring,
he was,
he was shrouded in like,
uh,

609
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.500
a Kendo mosque.
Uh,

610
00:36:26.501 --> 00:36:30.280
he was kind of frightening and mysterious.

611
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:32.760
<v 2>Thank you.
Thank you.</v>

612
00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:38.540
<v 6>Hey guys,
thanks for coming.
Uh,
this question's for page one quick thing.</v>

613
00:36:38.541 --> 00:36:42.650
I did want to say that what you've done for women's wrestling,
it's been amazing

614
00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.020
<v 2>and I really appreciate it.</v>

615
00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:51.330
<v 6>That being said,
where do you see it going from here?</v>

616
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:52.230
<v 2>Okay.</v>

617
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:55.740
<v 3>It's just going to keep getting bigger.
I think now we have a,
a WB evolution.</v>

618
00:36:55.741 --> 00:36:58.350
I mean,
I'm sad that I can't be a part of that,
um,

619
00:36:58.351 --> 00:37:00.990
because of the injury that I had.
But you started it,

620
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.310
but I did start the damn thing.
So,
um,
no,
I,
I'm just,

621
00:37:05.311 --> 00:37:07.110
I'm just really happy with where we're at,
where it's going.

622
00:37:07.111 --> 00:37:10.440
We have so many amazing females now that's in the company and they're just

623
00:37:10.441 --> 00:37:12.530
meaner than in all these big things like wrestlemania.

624
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.680
I never thought there was going to happen,

625
00:37:13.681 --> 00:37:16.770
but hopefully it's happening this year and I just think it's just going to keep

626
00:37:16.771 --> 00:37:20.310
just getting bigger.
They get w women in the doubletree and our unstoppable,

627
00:37:20.311 --> 00:37:24.050
we're not looked at as a piss break or Elec tits and ass anymore.

628
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.710
We're looked at as,
uh,
truly,
uh,

629
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.480
serious in ruin competitors and uh,
no longer divas,

630
00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:32.130
but we're superstars and I love that.

631
00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:34.803
<v 2>Thanks.</v>

632
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:42.470
<v 6>Thank you.
Thank you guys for coming.
I didn't know that was working.
Um,</v>

633
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:46.720
this is probably mostly for page,
but it could be for everyone.
Uh,

634
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:49.220
you have a moment in the film or in the trailer when you're talking about,
hey,

635
00:37:49.221 --> 00:37:52.520
you know,
don't be the first are don't be me be the first year.
Right.

636
00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:55.280
So I'm wondering how people develop their persona is,
you know,

637
00:37:55.281 --> 00:37:57.290
how does somebody become a hero or a villain?

638
00:37:57.291 --> 00:38:00.740
And that might make more sense obviously in wrestling could also apply to
actors.

639
00:38:00.741 --> 00:38:02.960
You know,
who gets cast as what,
how does that work?

640
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:07.980
<v 3>Right?
So,
um,
when it comes to the WWE,
you have to,</v>

641
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:10.290
you have to turn,
develop the character.
Doesn't matter.
Why is like,

642
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:15.060
like we had honed swell goal,
who is,
um,
who would dress like a leprechaun.

643
00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.130
He was a,
it was a mirror image.
Yeah.

644
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:21.060
I don't know if that's the right time to say,
but,
um,
it just,

645
00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:24.750
it's like WB can give you a character,
like they gave it to him or oh,
you know,

646
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:25.801
but with me,

647
00:38:25.801 --> 00:38:29.310
I create my own character because I was just like the elevated version of
myself.

648
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:31.360
You know,
I just started screaming a law and,

649
00:38:31.361 --> 00:38:35.350
and be an extra pale on knowing it and apparently it works.
Um,

650
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.480
but like with the process,

651
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:41.020
you have so much time in NXT that that you can develop a character,

652
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:43.050
like they have such a great,
um,

653
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:47.320
sent a down there where you have permanent clauses and you have teachers that

654
00:38:47.321 --> 00:38:51.400
can work with you to try and try and help you create something.
And,
um,
but I,

655
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:55.600
I think the best way the character you can have is definitely just you with the

656
00:38:55.601 --> 00:38:58.720
base turned up essentially.
So that personally for me,

657
00:38:58.721 --> 00:39:00.250
what do you guys think about your wrestling career?

658
00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:07.150
<v 8>Okay,
wait,
what are you love it.
And as often got hornswoggled right?</v>

659
00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.930
That was his name.
Is there,
right?
It does ever people know who horns,
Walker was.

660
00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:17.610
One posted anything.
Oh,
and the one in the back,
he was hornswoggled.

661
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.670
There was also another one called [inaudible] and he dressed like a little bowl.

662
00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:30.460
We've had some characters.
I feel like we've entered another realm,

663
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.030
not the kind of realm you're thinking about.

664
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:39.503
<v 2>Okay.</v>

665
00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.633
<v 0>Amen.
Now,</v>

666
00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:46.160
the film was going to be in theaters everywhere on February 22nd.

667
00:39:46.161 --> 00:39:49.790
So please go see it and you can find out more information,
uh,

668
00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:52.940
fighting with my family.movie.
So thank you all for being here.

669
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.680
It's going to kill you.
