00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.620
Ladies and gentlemen,
Kevin Belk

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.060
<v 1>and Mr. Michael Moore.</v>

3
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.080
<v 0>So welcome to the toxic Google everyone.
I'm Kevin Belk.
Is Mr. Moore.</v>

4
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:12.650
Just introduce me and this is Michael Moore,
film maker.

5
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.500
Documentarian document it.
Document documentary film maker is,
yeah,
documentary,

6
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.290
uh,
you know,
writer,
producer of all this and know that word.
Which one?

7
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.050
Documentarian.
Yeah,
I know.
I can say it.
You don't,

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.140
you don't like call Scorsese a fiction.
Attarian that's true.

9
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.610
So it's like I choose nonfiction.
The others choose fiction.
But you're,

10
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:33.440
we're filmmakers.
I wish,
I want,

11
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.180
I've been trying to drive this home to more documentary filmmakers and it if

12
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.190
they made documentaries as movies and that his documentaries more people,

13
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.030
Michael,
watch them.
That is true.
So,
you know,
it's,
um,

14
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.340
it's all about what we're going to do on Friday night,
right?
I apologize.
No,
no,

15
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.570
don't apologize.
I don't know.
I'm just,
you'll see you have a series of films,

16
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.940
Michael Born today and receive an official apology from Google

17
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.160
you a series of films so that your new film,
uh,
where to invade next.

18
00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:08.720
This comes after Roger mean the awful truth.
Bowling for Columbine Fahrenheit.

19
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:12.230
Nine 11.
Sicko capitalism,
a love story.
So many of us,

20
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:14.790
don't forget Canadian Bacon and Canadian Bacon.
All right.

21
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.570
Many of us saw the film just now,

22
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:21.710
but can you just go into what the film was about and where the idea came from?

23
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.790
Well,
I've had this idea probably since I was nine

24
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.490
<v 2>teen.
Oh,
I wasn't a filmmaker then.</v>

25
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:31.491
I was just a kid with a youth hostel card and a Eurail pass and uh,

26
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.231
went over to Europe.

27
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:39.231
I'm one of those $99 flights and a backpack for two months and saw,

28
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.870
saw the way it was elsewhere,

29
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.210
Ben here and every country I would go to,
I would say,
God,

30
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.770
that's such a good idea of the way they do that.
Why don't we do that?

31
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.210
Or you know,
well that's so simple and so obvious.
You know,
it's like,

32
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.900
and,
and every time I've prattled since I was 19,

33
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.950
I've had this thought wherever I was in the world that there's always like this

34
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:05.430
really good little idea.
And how can we don't just steal that idea.
We're,

35
00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:10.260
we're good at evading and you know,
trying to get other things.
Why don't we,

36
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.620
why don't we just like take some good ideas and bring them back to the u s so,

37
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.570
so I probably been thinking about this for a very long time and,
uh,
um,

38
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.460
and finally,
uh,
this year I decided to,
to do it.
And,

39
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:25.830
um,
and uh,

40
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:30.300
so I called up some friends that had made those films with me.
And,

41
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.850
um,
so why don't we,

42
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.880
why don't we go shoot this movie and let's just see what we find.

43
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.780
<v 0>So why is this come now versus,
you know,
your first film?
What,
what,</v>

44
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.020
what was the difference between,
oh,
now I've got to do it.

45
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.420
<v 2>My,
uh,
because I think we're,
I think we're in a,
in a,</v>

46
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:48.130
in a fairly perilous time,
in a,

47
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.480
in a moment here where things are going to shift one way or the other.

48
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.490
And I think that they've been moving somewhat in a good direction lately.

49
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.730
But,
um,
I'm printing here how to explain this because,
okay,

50
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.950
let's go back to 1999.

51
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:06.850
I'm directing a video for a rage against the machine down on Wall Street.

52
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.960
And,
um,
and so we're,
we're going to run over and we're going to try and,
you know,

53
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.900
break into the Stock Exchange essentially.
That's the conceit of the video.
And,

54
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:17.734
um,

55
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.420
and so we needed like stockbroker types and hedge fund guys.

56
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.370
And,
um,
so we had this,
this crowd of extras and I'm thinking there's,

57
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.370
they need to be holding signs or something.
So I went over to the art person,

58
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:34.450
I said here at makeup assignment says this.
And she goes,

59
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:38.560
and she gives it to the guy and this 1999 and the science says Trump for

60
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:39.394
president.

61
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.540
<v 0>And
not saying it was my idea,</v>

62
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.660
supplemental lesson.
Well,
I just thought wouldn't be the craziest thing

63
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.800
<v 2>then I can come up with,
oh,
so,</v>

64
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.460
but now it's not so funny anymore.
Now it's real.

65
00:04:01.461 --> 00:04:05.390
Now he's going to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States.

66
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.210
And it's like,
oh,
see that?

67
00:04:08.211 --> 00:04:10.340
Did you see there his rally in Massachusetts last night?

68
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.340
It was like a football stadium of people.
It was,

69
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.300
it was,
it was,
it was America,
Uber,
Alice.
It was,

70
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.510
it was really,
um,
wow.

71
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.400
Now I don't believe he can win,
but,
um,
I,

72
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.590
I don't think anybody should take them for granted.

73
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.250
<v 0>People have been and the whole time it,
yes,
me too.</v>

74
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.070
And it would start off as a joke now it's like,
oh crap.

75
00:04:37.071 --> 00:04:40.670
But like people are following them.
So it seems like no matter what he says too,

76
00:04:40.671 --> 00:04:43.760
and not to get off complete topic,
but I remember what he says,

77
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:46.760
just seems to be like,
Oh,
I'm just said it and they just goes on.

78
00:04:46.761 --> 00:04:49.500
So how is that working for him?
Works?

79
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.580
<v 2>Well,
one thing that people do like about him is that he doesn't think before he</v>

80
00:04:53.581 --> 00:04:56.010
talks,
which was like most of us.

81
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.370
So He seems kind of real in that way where he just says whatever's on his mind.

82
00:05:02.371 --> 00:05:07.080
And it feels refreshing because we're so used to the political speak and,

83
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.400
and he's,
he's,

84
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.420
he too was interested in it and he's saying things he doesn't believe in.

85
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.270
So at the beginning of this year,
I thought,
well,

86
00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:18.220
this is just really good performance art because,
uh,

87
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.920
if you've lived in New York for any period of time or if you are a native New

88
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.510
Yorker,
you know,
you don't Trump.
And you know that he,

89
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.260
um,
you know,
has funded a,
uh,

90
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.130
all these different campaigns and groups for gay marriage for a pro choice,

91
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:41.460
for,
uh,
guns.
I mean the whole,
I mean,

92
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:46.320
he's been very liberal on all the,
all the issues through most of his,
his,

93
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.270
his life.
He's very pro union,
at least the private sector unions.
Uh,

94
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.790
he wants to raise the minimum wage has always been for that.

95
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.650
He's always been for a,
and he,

96
00:05:55.651 --> 00:06:00.651
and I think he still a one time tax on the rich of 14%,

97
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.240
where they literally would have to pay 40% of what they own right now.

98
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:09.100
But this would,
in his mind,
retire the debt.
He's for single payer health care,

99
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.550
not dot for the right reasons,
but because it all we're doing with those 50,

100
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.690
there's 50 state insurance commissioners,
red tape everywhere.
You know,

101
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.730
it's like we just need,
we just need one,
one insurance commissioner,

102
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.510
single prayer.
And uh,
you know,
it's like,
it's like,

103
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.370
uh,
so,
so on that level,
you know,

104
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:36.371
that he's faking it and his time on television sort of blurred the line in his

105
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:39.950
own mind between reality and,
and,

106
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:43.790
and TD or performance and,
and now,

107
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:47.950
and he's now he sees it works for him.
He sees by being a Demigod,
by being a,

108
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.520
by being a racist,
by being a kind of pro fascist,

109
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.000
uh,
that there's always a crowd for that.
And history has proven,

110
00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.200
there's always been a crowd for that.
And so,
but,
but,
but,

111
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.580
but the good news is,

112
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:07.450
is that 81% of the people of this country are either women people of color or

113
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.910
adults between the ages of 18 and 35.

114
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.530
That's 81% of America.
That's not the America he sees.

115
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:17.030
He thinks they are all guys that look like him,

116
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.010
but the white guys over 35 or 19% of the population.
So,

117
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.460
so he's speaking to a very small group.

118
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.680
And the reason he shouldn't and can't win is because the majority of the country

119
00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:34.210
are dames or broads,
uh,

120
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.400
people he wants to build a wall around or people your age who probably don't

121
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:44.450
find him to.
Cool.
And I'm just,
I'm just saying I'm not,
I mean,

122
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:45.860
I haven't surveyed everybody in here,

123
00:07:45.861 --> 00:07:50.300
but I'm just guessing that when you think of somebody representing you to the

124
00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:54.590
rest of the world,
the image of Trump doesn't come into your mind.
Um,

125
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:59.750
but,
but we are also the slacker side of the political arena,

126
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.770
our side of the fence,
my side of the fence,
you know,
the other side,
you know,

127
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.050
they're going to be up on election morning,
six in the morning,

128
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.020
they're going to vote.
Right.

129
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.060
The only reason we'd be up at six in the morning as if we partied all night,

130
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.710
you know,
so it's like,
right.
So it's like,
so,

131
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.740
so if enough people don't get involved,
if the,

132
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.190
if the Democratic candidate is an inspiring,

133
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.390
doesn't create the enthusiasm that Obama did,
you know,

134
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:30.080
it was just kind of zone like that.
Um,

135
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.770
and just talks like a politician.
Enough people may stay home.

136
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.040
Certainly enough young people when they stay home and enough people of color may

137
00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:39.470
stay home.
And that's really something to think about.

138
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.730
It's why and all those polls.
What's interesting is that Hillary is ahead of,
uh,

139
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.910
Bernie,
um,
you know,
in the,
in the main number.

140
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.510
But when you pit them against Trump,
in the recent polls,

141
00:08:50.511 --> 00:08:53.960
Bernie has come out of pointed to a head when it's Hillary versus Trump or

142
00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:57.170
Bernie versus Trump.
So it's something to,
it's something to think about.

143
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.770
I know this has nothing to do with this.

144
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.750
<v 0>No,
no,
but how did we get on that?
Uh,</v>

145
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.730
it was because you called me a documentarian and uh,

146
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:10.820
but no,
so I mean,
but,

147
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:15.290
but I can kind of tie this into segue into a social media because you kind of,

148
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.300
you very,
very much embrace that with Twitter.

149
00:09:17.301 --> 00:09:20.480
You did that stint at Trump tower with we all Muslim.

150
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.330
And so you fully embrace social media.

151
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.420
How has that kind of changed you and giving yourself another voice in this

152
00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:30.580
medium kind of,
you didn't really grow up with it,
but now you have it as a,

153
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.230
as a platform.
Oh,
I know,
but as soon as it came,
I was the,

154
00:09:33.231 --> 00:09:36.190
I had a TV show in 1993,
92,

155
00:09:36.191 --> 00:09:40.760
95 called TV nation.
It was on NBC and then it was on Fox,

156
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:45.140
a good fox,
Simpson's Fox,
not Fox News.
Um,

157
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.080
but the,
um,

158
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.560
but I was the first prime time television show to actually have at the,

159
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:57.440
in the credits at the end of the show,
www dot.
An actual website.

160
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.230
Nobody had ever done that before.
And they were like,
the network was like,

161
00:10:00.231 --> 00:10:02.660
why do you want put that in there?
I said,
because of this is really,

162
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.410
this is 1999 93 now.
Right.
So it's,
it's not really,

163
00:10:06.411 --> 00:10:08.150
it's not a thing yet,

164
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.980
<v 2>but I,
I immediately saw social media as,</v>

165
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.400
as the smasher of the wall between the people and,

166
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.450
and the rest of the people.
There's,
there's always,

167
00:10:23.451 --> 00:10:26.510
there's always been a wall where if we wanted to communicate to each other,

168
00:10:26.511 --> 00:10:30.560
how would we do that?
You know,
I remember something I didn't like.

169
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:35.590
It was written in the New Yorker magazine and my only option as it was for like

170
00:10:35.871 --> 00:10:38.210
a,
if you read something in the paper or whatever was to write a letter to the

171
00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:40.250
editor,
maybe they would publish it,

172
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.550
maybe not in its original form.

173
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.880
I wrote this to the New Yorker and they wrote back and said,
where they,

174
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.790
we don't have letters to the editor.
And I thought,
wow.

175
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.970
So they just published something about my hometown of Flint,
Michigan.

176
00:10:52.971 --> 00:10:53.804
That wasn't true.

177
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:59.030
And I have no means to correct the record in a,
in a,

178
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.350
in a valued in and sophisticated publication like the New Yorker.

179
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.090
And I just,
I thought,
wait,
this is way back then.
God,

180
00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:14.091
I wish there was some way where I could leap over the gatekeeper and just let

181
00:11:14.691 --> 00:11:16.370
everybody know.
Actually,
here's the truth.

182
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.510
The fact that that social media has allowed us to talk to each other,

183
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.740
that it can,

184
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.180
that we can't be regulated or stopped from doing that and that and that,

185
00:11:26.181 --> 00:11:30.560
those empower camp,
they can get away with things still.
And they certainly try,

186
00:11:30.561 --> 00:11:32.150
but it's a lot harder for them,

187
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.400
witnessed the police who simply cannot just,

188
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:37.971
you know,

189
00:11:37.971 --> 00:11:42.971
randomly get away with now it makes you wonder how many other innocent people

190
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.940
and by people I,
that's a euphemism for black and Hispanic people,

191
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.540
but people,
black and Hispanic people who had been,

192
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:55.630
who had been killed by police and we never knew that.

193
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.420
That's just one example of how,

194
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.600
of how the democratization and the,
and the sort of,
um,

195
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.690
egalitarianism of social media and that and that,

196
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:11.620
it doesn't matter that if I'm,
I'm a filmmaker,
I,
you know,

197
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:17.050
I'm with Warner Brothers or whatever that you can talk to me.
You can,

198
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:20.950
you can send me an email tonight.
You can,
you can tweet at me,

199
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:25.951
you can go on my Facebook page and I go there and I read it and,

200
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.880
and I will randomly write back to people.
I mean,
I mean,
I obviously,

201
00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:35.500
I can't write the thousand that may see this and,
and write me,
but I,

202
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.540
I do what I can do,
but I certainly,

203
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.940
I certainly get a sense of what people are saying.

204
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.430
I never would have got that sense before.
So this is such a,
a great era.

205
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.550
And I,
and I don't think,
I mean a lot of people my age,

206
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.890
and I can't believe there's still people,
boom,

207
00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:55.430
baby boomers and the such or are still like,
like this,
you know,
torn.

208
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.830
It's like,
oh my God,

209
00:12:56.831 --> 00:12:59.680
you're going to end up like both of my grandmothers never learned how to drive a

210
00:12:59.681 --> 00:13:04.540
car.
They thought the horse was going to come back.
I mean,
I'm like,

211
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.740
you know,
oh,
you're so crazy to stay away from this.
And,
and then they,

212
00:13:08.741 --> 00:13:10.570
and then they point out the things that bother them.

213
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.530
Like I came in here and I counted five people that were on their devices while

214
00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:18.940
my movie was going on.
And I'm like,
okay.

215
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.520
But then I'm like,
but you know,
but that's,

216
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:26.550
but I'd rather deal with that than not have this.

217
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.000
And,
and,
and who knows how many lives that those five were saving in here?

218
00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:43.220
No,
no,
no,
but it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
um,
um,
it,

219
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:48.070
it,
it's,
it's a good thing and it's an,

220
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.810
and we can't even imagine now.

221
00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:54.811
I remember I was at the 2004 Democratic convention and Jimmy Carter,

222
00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.670
I was just there kind of co,
I was covering it actually for a paper.
And,

223
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.980
um,
it was after fair nine,

224
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:06.670
nine 11 came out and he asked if I would like to sit in the presidential box

225
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:11.050
with him on the Nike was going to give his speech.
And I was like,
wow,
yes,

226
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.770
thank you.
And,
um,
and in the box,

227
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.160
we're a two or two of the three.

228
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.920
The founders,
the people that you know,
you know,

229
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.650
started this and uh,
and uh,
they were,

230
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.870
it was,
it was like,
I just remember,

231
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:36.340
I still remember this moment because Google in 2004 was how many,

232
00:14:36.341 --> 00:14:41.320
how many years old?
Two years old.
Like five,
six every six months.
Yeah.

233
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:42.850
But I mean,
okay,
yes.
But yes,

234
00:14:42.851 --> 00:14:46.360
the incorporation papers were filed and people started with the hype around,

235
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.270
but I'm turning and I mean in a sense,
in the sense that it,

236
00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:53.120
that everybody was using it.
That was the early,

237
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:55.350
that was the infancy right of,
of go.

238
00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.680
And I just remember thinking this is such a great moment.

239
00:14:57.681 --> 00:15:00.530
And I was thinking as I was standing up here with everybody,

240
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.210
we don't even know 10 years from now what is going to be

241
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.300
invented or how,

242
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.060
what better ways we're going to have to talk to each other reaching.

243
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:15.800
So I think it's revolutionary.
I think that this can create,
um,

244
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.460
uh,
movements.
It can involve people more in their democracy.

245
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.860
It has so many good things about it.
And the bad things about it are,

246
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.610
are,
are,
are,
are regulated by other people.

247
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.740
So if you put out something out there that's not true,

248
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.600
there's going to be a thousand people on you to correct the why that you're

249
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:39.200
telling.
You know,
it's interesting though,

250
00:15:39.201 --> 00:15:42.100
because I think with this film you did it very much in secret.
So you can,

251
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:45.800
you kind of shut off social media.
You didn't let a publicist come on with you.

252
00:15:45.801 --> 00:15:47.130
And it's very much done in secret.

253
00:15:47.131 --> 00:15:51.450
So no press release was sent out when we did the deal and we,

254
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.210
and we did,
we didn't disconnect.

255
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.350
I didn't disconnect from social media in terms of politics or news or things

256
00:15:57.351 --> 00:16:01.190
that were going on,
but I wasn't going to discuss what I was doing.

257
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.070
Certainly the one thing you learn,

258
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:09.580
how many times do you have to be burned on Google to know there are just so many

259
00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:14.570
things you want to share.
So,
so that was an easy one,
uh,

260
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:14.900
to do.

261
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.440
But we knew we would tweet about this and we would put this up and we Instagram

262
00:16:18.441 --> 00:16:20.920
it when we were done.
But,
uh,

263
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:26.300
what was interesting is that we were able to get away with it that,
um,

264
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:27.711
and I don't know,

265
00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:30.920
in 10 years we would be 10 years from now that we'll be able to get away with
it.

266
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.870
Part of it's a language issue.
Maybe somebody saw me in Slovenia and,

267
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.590
and tweeted in Slovenian,
but you were there.
But you know,

268
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:43.050
there's not a lot out there yet for people to kind of,
I mean,

269
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.250
the mechanisms exist to translate that,
but it's,
it's,
I'm,

270
00:16:47.251 --> 00:16:51.080
I'm more concerned with the fact that we would be the top story on the evening

271
00:16:51.081 --> 00:16:55.410
news and in Italy or France or whatever,
because they were,

272
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:59.240
they would see me filming and saw the camera crews would come out,
interview me,

273
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.690
but,
you know,
it would be,
it would,
you know,

274
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.240
the whole broadcast was an Italian or Slovenian.

275
00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:10.310
And because the networks no longer have these foreign bureaus,

276
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.230
you know,
if they're,
if they're,

277
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.080
if they're maybe a big one of the big three networks.
So the New York Times,

278
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.480
they've got somebody in London,
they've got somebody in Tokyo.

279
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:22.670
But in the old days,
guys,
in my time,
man,
there was somebody in Paris,

280
00:17:22.671 --> 00:17:25.820
Madrid,
Rome,
Warsaw,

281
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.100
it was everywhere and now and now corporate media that doesn't exist.

282
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:36.020
So,
right.
And so in,
in where to invade next,
you visit Italy,
France,
Finland,

283
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:40.940
Germany,
Slovenia,
not Slovakian,
Portugal,
Tonasia,
Norway and Iceland.

284
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.020
Um,

285
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.170
so how did you choose which countries would be included and were there any that

286
00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:50.100
you did film or you thought about doing and then just pull the way?
Yes.

287
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:55.150
Um,
we,
we filmed three countries that we didn't put in the film.
Okay.

288
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:59.550
Mainly because I don't think movies should be longer than two hours.
Um,

289
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.880
I think most movies are too long anyways.
Don't you agree?

290
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:07.950
And if they are longer than two hours and they should really earn it like right.

291
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.330
Um,
so I didn't mind star wars,
you know,

292
00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:15.720
being longer than two hours.
So,
um,

293
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.230
but I,
uh,
uh,
we went to Canada,

294
00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:24.231
we went to Austria and we went also to Estonia and Astonia because they,

295
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.850
uh,
they have the best mother mortality rate.
Uh,

296
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.890
the least number of mothers die in childbirth and slow in Estonia than any other

297
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:35.670
country.

298
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:40.470
Austria has lowered the voting age to 16 as half a dozen or half a dozen other

299
00:18:40.471 --> 00:18:41.304
countries.

300
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.870
And they found that 18 to 30 year olds voted a higher percentage when you get

301
00:18:45.871 --> 00:18:49.230
them starting to vote in high school.
Um,
I think that's a really,

302
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.070
really good idea,
especially if they're going to be fighting in a war,
God forbid,

303
00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:55.170
ever again in this country.
But you know,

304
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.680
there are a lot of things you're going to have to start doing at 18 and maybe in

305
00:18:58.681 --> 00:18:59.630
a couple of years leading up to that,

306
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.750
you should have a say in what's going to happen to you at 18 and a lot of 16

307
00:19:03.751 --> 00:19:06.360
year olds are not mature enough.
They won't bother,
they won't vote.

308
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.450
But the ones who are engaged,
why not have there,

309
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.710
why not give them a say in their early adulthood?
Right.
Um,

310
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.890
I mean there's so much interesting stuff in here,
but your goal was,

311
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.310
it paints a very,
very good picture of each of these countries too.

312
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:21.420
And you had said,
you know,

313
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:23.460
it was not to present a complete portrait of each of the countries,

314
00:19:23.461 --> 00:19:26.400
but they kind of pick out things that they do well and that folks signing the

315
00:19:26.401 --> 00:19:29.700
negative and none of it was actually shot in the u s she didn't know every,

316
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.320
we wanted to make a film about the u s but not shoot a single frame of film in

317
00:19:34.321 --> 00:19:37.590
the u s that was,
that was kind of our challenge at the beginning.

318
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.260
Could that be possible?
And uh,

319
00:19:40.261 --> 00:19:43.770
and tell the story of America by going to these other countries.

320
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.130
And I wasn't and I only wanted to take the guy,

321
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.850
why would I want to take a bad thing?
You know,

322
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:51.090
and I'll go to buy a new car and buy a clunker.
You know,

323
00:19:51.091 --> 00:19:53.790
I want to get a car that works.
So I don't want,
I don't want any of that.

324
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.090
All of these countries have things that don't work.
Right.
Um,

325
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.730
but that's not my mission.
My mission was gold.

326
00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:04.620
Take the things that work really well and bring them here because I think most

327
00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:05.670
of those things could work here.

328
00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:10.110
Some of them will be harder because we haven't dealt with are our racial

329
00:20:10.111 --> 00:20:14.040
question yet.
Uh,
but uh,
but some of those things,

330
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.420
we can stop poisoning kids during the lunch hour tomorrow.
You know,

331
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.800
every parent that sees this film can go to the PTA meeting next week and say,

332
00:20:22.801 --> 00:20:25.290
Hey,
you know what?
Why don't we,
why don't we do this differently?

333
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.620
They do this in France differently and it costs less.
Right.

334
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.770
<v 0>I mean,
that's,
that's one of the great things.
It was the second country visit,</v>

335
00:20:32.771 --> 00:20:33.520
which was France,

336
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.870
which is basically going in to these children's elementary school and seeing

337
00:20:37.871 --> 00:20:40.300
what they serve for lunch,
which are basically at these gourmet meals.

338
00:20:40.301 --> 00:20:43.390
There's four course meals with cheese and lamb skewers and all that,

339
00:20:43.391 --> 00:20:46.060
and just amazing,
amazing stuff.
And they meet.

340
00:20:46.061 --> 00:20:49.480
So the head chef or school will meet with a school officials.
Yes.

341
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:52.540
The answer to the mayor and the school officials and the township,
right.

342
00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:56.320
Dietitian.
And so we loved about that.
You imagine it,

343
00:20:56.321 --> 00:21:00.220
but if the people that fed us,
especially if you went to public school,

344
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:04.660
people have fed us at lunch,
were,
had the answer to a Dietitian.

345
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.800
It was be like a firing squad.
And you know,

346
00:21:08.801 --> 00:21:10.600
Michelle Obama tried to start that,

347
00:21:10.601 --> 00:21:12.990
but it kind of got some pushback and wasn't really working.

348
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.010
So why didn't that work?

349
00:21:15.011 --> 00:21:18.310
That's kind of seems like the country is moving more towards at least it seems

350
00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:20.890
like a little bit more of the healthy stuff with what?
With us,

351
00:21:20.891 --> 00:21:22.840
you have to do it differently.
I think you have to,

352
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.100
you have to do help health wise.
But you call it pizza,
no matter,

353
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.560
no matter what you make or what you feed them the day.

354
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:33.560
Don't call it lamb skewers,
just call it pizza.
And I just think of,

355
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.890
we trust rename everything pizza,

356
00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:39.730
but make it really good and tasty.
All right.

357
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:44.470
It does have to taste good,
but it tastes good and still be and still be healthy.

358
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.840
Um,
these,
but it's funny with these kids because they don't drink coke,

359
00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.160
you know,
they,
first of all,
they were,
they looked at it like it was poison.

360
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.700
Then finally the little girl next to me.
Right.

361
00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.800
I hope I didn't bully her too much.

362
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:05.170
I know every time I watch that scene I want to call child protective services on

363
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:06.004
me.

364
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:11.560
It's like I keep pushing on the glass and then she tries it and within 15

365
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:15.790
seconds,
you know her,
she was like this with her fork and I was like,
cause she's,

366
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:17.830
I'm thinking here's,
she's never had this.

367
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.480
Now she's taking too big of a gulp and literally has mainlined it right into our

368
00:22:22.481 --> 00:22:26.910
system.
It was this,
it was a,
it's a sad,
sad scene.
Well,

369
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.220
I'm embarrassed.
I'm like,

370
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:34.300
there's just some great scenes and some great interesting things that you pull

371
00:22:34.301 --> 00:22:37.210
from each country.
I'm like in Italy,
how much vacation they get.

372
00:22:37.211 --> 00:22:38.350
I think it was something like 30,

373
00:22:38.351 --> 00:22:41.850
35 days of paid vacation plus another week of national holiday.
Yep.

374
00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.450
15 days of paid holiday after getting married.
Yup.
13 months salary in December.

375
00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:49.870
Just here's a month salary.
Just pure it is for you.
Yeah.

376
00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:53.620
Because what's the use of having a vacation if you can't pay for it?
Right.

377
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.600
I mean,
most people live from paycheck to paycheck.

378
00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:59.110
So what if they give you four weeks off?
Well fine,

379
00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:01.320
but I gotta pay my mortgage that month.
I got to pay the car payment,

380
00:23:01.321 --> 00:23:04.090
I got to pay the school,
I've got to pay,
you know,
how am I going to pay?

381
00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.320
I'm not going to go anywhere.
So they,
they,
they worked that into the system.

382
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:09.970
Right.
And it was interesting because you talked about,

383
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.120
you kind of were oppressing them a little bit on the American dream and like,
Oh,

384
00:23:13.121 --> 00:23:15.130
if you come to America,
you only get zero,

385
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.530
you get zero unless you go into an employer who actually pay for itself.

386
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.491
And they were like,
oh.

387
00:23:18.491 --> 00:23:20.920
So the American dream kind of a little bit changed for them where they were
like,

388
00:23:20.921 --> 00:23:22.540
I don't know if I want to go.
Right.
Well they know,

389
00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:27.010
they think they all know America a lot by the movies and you know,
it,
look,

390
00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.960
we look good in the movies generally.

391
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.730
So I think they go in France the day that let's say you're going to move,

392
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:36.100
you got to new apartment,
you're going to move from queens to Brooklyn.

393
00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.770
That's a step up right now.
Okay.

394
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:48.830
I'm from Michigan.
So,
um,
but um,
uh,

395
00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:52.340
the day you moved from Queens to Brooklyn,
if you were in France,

396
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.140
that's a paid day off by law.

397
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.000
You should not have to miss your pay because you got to move.

398
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.200
So if you got to move tomorrow,
then a,

399
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.670
you shouldn't have to lose any money because you had to move.
I mean,
that just,

400
00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.430
it's just little things like that.
You just go,
wow,
that's kind of humane.

401
00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.160
Well,
it was interesting in a lot of it.
I mean,
there's time,

402
00:24:16.161 --> 00:24:16.851
interesting things in here,

403
00:24:16.851 --> 00:24:20.150
but some of these were actually American ideas and they brought that up a few

404
00:24:20.151 --> 00:24:24.890
times and that where it was like in Finland with,
um,
you know,
a free tuition and,

405
00:24:24.891 --> 00:24:28.280
and only three to four hours of school a day with a lunch hour and getting rid

406
00:24:28.281 --> 00:24:31.220
of standardized tests that we have here in America.
And,
um,
you know,

407
00:24:31.221 --> 00:24:33.440
and there's no good or bad schools,
they're just,

408
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.610
the rich kids are mixed in with the poor kids in the middle class and everyone

409
00:24:37.611 --> 00:24:40.370
goes to school together and it's actually illegal to actually charge tuition.
So,

410
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.060
you know,
with,
uh,
some of these illegal to charge tuition,
can you believe that?

411
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.250
That's crazy.
Yeah.
Even for college,
I said,

412
00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:49.370
don't treat me you don't have a Harvard and the minister of Education,

413
00:24:49.371 --> 00:24:51.590
she says we have 19 Harvard's

414
00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:59.000
okay.
Right.
And like the Norwegian prison.

415
00:24:59.001 --> 00:25:03.050
So you know how they treat their,
their prisoners like humans,
like humans,

416
00:25:03.051 --> 00:25:06.230
and they have to treat them because there's no life sentence and there's no

417
00:25:06.231 --> 00:25:10.130
capital punishment.
So they get a lecture from the warden and day one it says,

418
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.950
because we don't have these two things that America has,

419
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:17.090
that means you may be my neighbor someday,
you may be living on my street.

420
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.140
So it's in my best interest for that.
When you leave here that you leave,

421
00:25:21.141 --> 00:25:25.880
you're a better person and not inclined to commit crime.
So it's,
so,

422
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.400
it's not just because of the Norwegians are better than us.
They have,

423
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:32.420
there's a self interest involved in wanting to live in a safer society.

424
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.880
Well and they're very free there.
I mean for,
you guys just saw the film,

425
00:25:34.881 --> 00:25:36.030
it's its crazy cause it's there,

426
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.020
it's almost like a resort where they go to and it's very free and open.

427
00:25:39.021 --> 00:25:43.540
They could swim across the lake,
they can spend one way,
they can't swim and it's,

428
00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.830
it's very open.
They have the keys to their own doors.

429
00:25:45.831 --> 00:25:48.530
And even the cool thing was I was like,
oh this is this gotta be fake.

430
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.690
But then you went to the maximum security prison.
I was like,

431
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.850
oh that was interesting because that was even free to,

432
00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:57.740
it's a little more protected or guarded,
but it was very,
very,
um,
open and free.

433
00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.220
And they had TV and they had internet and it was,
it was just crazy.
But again,

434
00:26:01.221 --> 00:26:05.630
he said this was one of the,
what the guards were saying that it was,
you know,

435
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:10.690
this is an American idea where it was basically no cruel punishment towards the

436
00:26:10.911 --> 00:26:14.360
prisoners and stuff.
So where do we lose our way?
Or where did we lose work?

437
00:26:14.361 --> 00:26:15.260
Where are they getting that can actually,

438
00:26:15.261 --> 00:26:17.210
cause America obviously hasn't done that for years.

439
00:26:17.211 --> 00:26:21.770
So where are they getting this from?
Is this just from the pastor or,
well,

440
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:27.250
the world for a very long time has loved the United States of America and is

441
00:26:27.891 --> 00:26:32.000
looked up to us and,
and they,

442
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.720
they know that there's some,
there's a certain thing about us and our,

443
00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.140
our ingenuity and are sort of motivation and are,

444
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.000
and we're kind of all like this,
you know,

445
00:26:41.001 --> 00:26:44.220
and they're very much playing it close to the chest and,
and

446
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.130
<v 2>they know that,
you know,</v>

447
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:52.260
belled Belgium isn't going to invent the iPhone,
you know,

448
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:57.300
no offense to Belgium.
Um,
Google isn't going to come out of Hungary,

449
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.940
no offense to hungry.
But there is something unique about us that,

450
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:06.810
um,
that historically we'd been this sort of,

451
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.780
um,
and part of it is,
is the,

452
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:15.150
is the classless society that we've always tried to say we are trying to be.

453
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.380
Um,

454
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:21.380
but I think that there's so many good things about us that they admire and they

455
00:27:23.401 --> 00:27:28.170
bought a lot of it and we decided to start buying it.
Uh,

456
00:27:28.171 --> 00:27:31.950
we had an education system that was the envy of the world.

457
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.000
Now nobody would want our education system.
Nobody,

458
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.500
nobody would come here to study it.
So they just took all the great progressive,

459
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:45.300
philosophical American education ideas and just implemented them.

460
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:50.450
Um,
in Germany and Japan and Italy,
the Axis powers during world war two,

461
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.540
after the war,
after they were defeated,
President Roosevelt,

462
00:27:54.541 --> 00:27:57.270
he had just passed away.
Um,

463
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:02.060
but he had set it up so that when the war ended,
um,
uh,

464
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.233
his,

465
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.740
his team from his administration would go and write their new constitutions.

466
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.070
So in the new constitutions for Germany and Italy and Japan,

467
00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:15.900
they had universal healthcare.
They have labor rights.

468
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.830
They had,
you know,
um,

469
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.450
the college and education being a free and progressive system.

470
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.960
So they institute a lot of the things we didn't have.
Even then,

471
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.110
the part of our past that we're not,

472
00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:32.710
that we shouldn't be proud of in terms of our racial issue,
um,

473
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:35.730
how we've treated our native people.
Um,

474
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:40.820
how we've allowed capitalism to morph itself into an ugly system of greed and,

475
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:45.260
and making sure that only the very,
very,
very top get all the,

476
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:50.520
the wealth and everybody else scrambles for the crumbs.
Um,

477
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.590
you know,
that's,

478
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:55.740
there's nothing to look back and be proud of in that part of our history.

479
00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.770
So it's kind of a,
it's,
it's,

480
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:05.370
I feel bad that we've lost our way in that sense.
I mean,
I want to know,
I mean,

481
00:29:05.371 --> 00:29:06.840
looking at you in this room,

482
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.890
I was just trying to add up the total amount of student loan debt,
uh,

483
00:29:10.891 --> 00:29:14.870
in this room.
I'm sure it's in the millions.
Um,

484
00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.800
but my generation,
your parents,
um,

485
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.900
we went to school for free or nearly free depending on where you lived.
You know,

486
00:29:24.901 --> 00:29:27.030
if you went to,
if your parents went to Brooklyn College,

487
00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:32.010
they paid $35 a semester.
If they went to UC Berkeley,
they went for free.

488
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:37.380
If they went to Suny Buffalo,
they went for free.
Uh,
if they went to Anarbor,

489
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:41.380
I dunno,
they paid 500 bucks.
It was nothing.
Right?

490
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.450
Why did we allow a system to come into being

491
00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.940
that Ben sent you as 22 year olds out into the world as debtors,

492
00:29:52.941 --> 00:29:56.090
as it in a debtor's prison,
as I said in the film.
Well,

493
00:29:56.091 --> 00:29:59.060
why would we do that to our own kids?
Why did we let that happen?

494
00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.510
Why did we let the banks and the whole system a lot,
why did we,

495
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:06.440
why did we not give you what we had?
Well,
how do you,
how do you change that?

496
00:30:06.441 --> 00:30:09.200
How you go back like,
like it seems like we're too deep in.

497
00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:14.690
It does seem that way and I know and some of it seems a little hopeless.
I,

498
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:15.583
well

499
00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:22.190
there's many examples I can give where it seemed hopeless and eventually women

500
00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:26.510
could vote.
You know,
it seemed hopeless and eventually,

501
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.240
I mean,
hopeless was going back to,
oh,

502
00:30:29.241 --> 00:30:33.280
for the election when 14 states made it part of the constitution.

503
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:34.690
<v 3>Okay.</v>

504
00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:35.860
<v 2>To make it illegal.</v>

505
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:37.230
<v 3>Okay.</v>

506
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:38.820
<v 2>To marry the person you're in love with.</v>

507
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.480
<v 3>Okay.</v>

508
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.930
<v 2>If they happened to be of the same gender,
here we are,</v>

509
00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:47.980
11 years later gone.
It's like,
wow.
You know,

510
00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:51.730
like I said in the film,
it's okay.
The impossible can happen,
right?

511
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.760
Because this was a country bigoted against gay and lesbian people and then all

512
00:30:57.461 --> 00:31:00.760
of a sudden it wasn't illegal to be in love.

513
00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:05.440
And if that can happen,
I just,

514
00:31:05.441 --> 00:31:07.930
I think practically anything can happen.
And I,

515
00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:12.040
and there are some good groups that can show how we can go back to free college

516
00:31:12.041 --> 00:31:16.480
education,
at least for the state schools.
Will we ever have a system where uh,

517
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:18.910
there won't be private schools and you can't charge for tuition?

518
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:22.400
I would probably doubt that,
but we can certainly make the,

519
00:31:22.401 --> 00:31:25.480
our state institutions to be,
um,

520
00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.890
either very affordable or free for all the students.

521
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:33.460
And it wouldn't cost that much more money to do that.

522
00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:38.770
We spent 750 billion on defense.
You know,

523
00:31:38.771 --> 00:31:41.380
if we just cut that back by a third,

524
00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:43.990
that money could be used for so many good things.

525
00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:48.370
Why don't we have a bullet train from New York to La?
We are,

526
00:31:48.371 --> 00:31:52.930
we in the Brits invented the train.
Why does Taiwan have a bullet train?

527
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:58.710
Go Google the map of Taiwan right now on the northern for if you went from the

528
00:31:59.921 --> 00:32:03.970
east coast of the west coast of northern Taiwan,
you could walk it in a day.

529
00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:08.920
They don't need a bullet train.
They have a bullet train.
We have 3000 miles.

530
00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:13.510
We need a bullet train.
You know,
we can afford that if we want it to do that.

531
00:32:13.511 --> 00:32:18.310
Why don't we have that?
Yeah.
You know,
I mean,
we used to be the innovators.

532
00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:22.630
We used to do this.
I was telling the,
my saw my crew,
we came in here today.

533
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:26.260
I said,
you know,
this building has a very important history.

534
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:28.660
You guys all know the history of this building right now.

535
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.150
For those of you who are watching or listening elsewhere,

536
00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:35.220
we're in the original port authority building here.
Uh,

537
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:39.800
that goes between ninth avenue and Eighth Avenue and 15th and 16th Street.

538
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.870
Um,
by the way,
those are not,

539
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:46.820
I'm not giving coordinates out to the Trump campaign fire priority missiles at

540
00:32:46.821 --> 00:32:51.140
this moment.
But,
um,

541
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.680
but the original cable that was laid under the Atlantic Ocean,

542
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:58.220
the first cable that to bring the towel first,
the Telegraph,

543
00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:02.000
and then the telephone line came up out of the Atlantic Ocean and Undergrad and

544
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:04.640
up into this building and from here,

545
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:08.060
whatever the call or the telegraph was or whatever,

546
00:33:08.061 --> 00:33:12.980
emanated from this building that out to wherever across North America that

547
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:16.550
that's,
that's an amazing thing when you think back to it and you know,
you've,

548
00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:19.880
you've read,
read the book tubes about,
you know,
the Internet,

549
00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.470
remember the Republican senator who was add to a bunch of damn tubes,

550
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:26.900
but then this journalist thought,
well,
you don't actually,

551
00:33:26.901 --> 00:33:31.760
there's are a lot of tubes involved here and the I and sort of the sweet irony

552
00:33:31.761 --> 00:33:35.240
that Google now inhabits this building,

553
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:40.610
that the virtual tube that we're all connected to,
um,

554
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.270
in,
it's so much better and easier way than friend to bring a call or a telegraph

555
00:33:45.271 --> 00:33:48.890
and from the Atlantic Ocean that you're in this building.
I think it's,

556
00:33:48.891 --> 00:33:50.580
it's very cool.
Yeah.
Uh,

557
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.940
we'll start taking audience questions if you guys wanna start lining up the mic.

558
00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.350
Um,
but you know,
one of,

559
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.250
one of the things that when we were sitting here watching the film on things

560
00:33:57.251 --> 00:34:00.440
that got the biggest laugh and got the biggest circle out of me was the cause.

561
00:34:00.441 --> 00:34:01.370
We all know it too well,

562
00:34:01.371 --> 00:34:03.950
which is in Germany where they have basically when work is over,

563
00:34:03.951 --> 00:34:07.850
it's over and they don't bring it home with them and it's against the law to,

564
00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.130
of contact an employee while they're on vacation.

565
00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:14.030
And many companies have adopted the rule that companies can't send any emails

566
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.160
after work hours such as Mercedes,

567
00:34:16.161 --> 00:34:19.910
where they actually have computers that blocked the emails sent by bosses to

568
00:34:19.911 --> 00:34:21.710
their reports were those,

569
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:26.540
was that laughter you heard or whales and bones and Christ.

570
00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:29.270
It was so interesting because I mean that,

571
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:33.050
I mean they've changed the entire way they even work in there really.

572
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.300
The countries are caring about their people more,
right?

573
00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.940
Versus just trying to make a buck or whatever the case may be.
Right.

574
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:43.160
Social media should not be used to abuse employees.

575
00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:47.780
Social media is there to help us be better people in a better world,

576
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:52.730
not for an employer to have a tether on you until midnight.

577
00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:57.860
And,
uh,
and I just think that just seems like common sense,
decent,

578
00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:03.410
um,
you know,
behavior and it's your choice if you want to do that,

579
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:07.810
you know,
do that.
I mean if you knew the employee want to work,
you know,

580
00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.080
but again,
it's,

581
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:13.910
you need to also take some time for yourself and you need to not work at some

582
00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:16.940
point.
Let me,
can I ask you just,
I'm going,
whoa.
I mean,

583
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.990
cause this is an interesting question because like the,
the uh,

584
00:35:20.991 --> 00:35:25.040
the maternity leave,
the paid you guys,
I'm sure I've read,
you know,
you and,

585
00:35:25.041 --> 00:35:26.970
and uh,
and,
and uh,

586
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:32.110
Facebook and a lot of the social media giants have really good,

587
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:37.380
uh,
uh,
plans in terms of if you're going to have a baby or,
or,

588
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.320
um,
you know,
how much time you can take off.
And in fact,
yeah,

589
00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:44.720
<v 0>some,
I don't know who it is.
Somebody just,
you could have unlimited time.</v>

590
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:50.240
Netflix.
Netflix is,
I can that be our like are they,

591
00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:53.610
are they shitting me or when they are and they like,

592
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:58.970
or because I can imagine that would just make it worse because then you don't

593
00:35:58.971 --> 00:36:03.170
know when or how much you could take off or how much are they going to hate me

594
00:36:03.171 --> 00:36:06.650
or the boss is going to,
I'm going to get the worst job when I come back.

595
00:36:06.651 --> 00:36:10.130
Or I'm like,
you know,
is that an issue?

596
00:36:10.131 --> 00:36:13.790
Like even in a place here where you have to think about,
I think in general,

597
00:36:13.791 --> 00:36:14.750
just in America,

598
00:36:14.751 --> 00:36:17.840
I think it's just any company that I've been at where it's just you do feel that

599
00:36:17.841 --> 00:36:20.420
pressure where it's like,
oh,
I do want to take two weeks after I get married.

600
00:36:20.421 --> 00:36:23.030
I want to take a week here a week.
They're like,

601
00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.280
but it is very much in terms of American culture,

602
00:36:25.281 --> 00:36:29.180
just disconnecting in general and just trying to break away and not feel guilty

603
00:36:29.181 --> 00:36:32.040
for doing that sometimes.
So enough about me.
Yup.

604
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.860
<v 4>Hi there.
Um,
so I think,
I mean,
you can correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

605
00:36:37.861 --> 00:36:41.130
but I think a lot of us would agree that America has some of the best

606
00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:45.750
innovations,
especially in the tech sector,
um,
you know,
in the whole world.

607
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:50.340
Um,
so I was wondering if you thought that if America was to adopt some of the

608
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.020
policies like in Europe,

609
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.350
if you think that that would stifle some of the innovations that are coming out

610
00:36:55.351 --> 00:36:56.184
of America.

611
00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:59.300
<v 2>No,
and in fact,
I just said,
you know what I just said,
I,</v>

612
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:02.720
I do believe that's one of the things that's really great about us.

613
00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.250
What would it,
when you say stifled,

614
00:37:04.251 --> 00:37:08.490
like you mean the vacation thing or the or what?
Like what,

615
00:37:08.491 --> 00:37:10.850
what do they have that would stifle us here?

616
00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.500
<v 4>I'm not sure exactly,
but I know I've looked around at,
you know,</v>

617
00:37:13.501 --> 00:37:16.020
Europe just doesn't have,
if you look at like tech startups,

618
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.550
there's not that many in Europe.

619
00:37:17.551 --> 00:37:21.090
And I can sure if some of it might be that like it's already established in the

620
00:37:21.091 --> 00:37:24.720
u s but I imagine that it might just be a little bit harder and more expensive

621
00:37:24.721 --> 00:37:25.740
to start a business there.

622
00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.960
<v 2>Yeah,
well that now that I don't know about,</v>

623
00:37:28.961 --> 00:37:31.840
but I think that just imagine though if you had,

624
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:35.230
if you actually had a few weeks to not have to worry about work,

625
00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:40.090
how many people in this room have had an idea that if you just had a little time

626
00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:41.860
to explore the idea or investigate it,

627
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.930
the noodle with it to go into whatever your version of the workshop is for you,

628
00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:52.770
what great ideas or inventions are we not getting because you're,

629
00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:57.790
there's so much pressure on you to be a certain way and to work a certain way

630
00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.510
that doesn't allow that to come out.
That's what I would,

631
00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:04.270
I'm more concerned about about that and I think that if we,

632
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:09.100
if we were a little more European,
just chilled a little more.

633
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:14.260
The creativity in us.
And I don't mean just inventing the next tech thing.

634
00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:19.320
There is somebody in here that probably has got a great novel in them and or

635
00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:23.800
screenplay or movie,
they'd like them or I,
you know,
whatever.
Maybe there be,

636
00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:28.030
there's just a great poem that needs to be written in this room.
Uh,
you know,

637
00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.180
are you allowing yourself to have the time to do that and the freedom to do
that?

638
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:35.770
And Are you having the chill to do that?
I,
um,

639
00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:40.570
I guess I'm more concerned about that when you hear that they are more

640
00:38:40.571 --> 00:38:41.650
regulations there,

641
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:46.330
there's a reason they do on some level and that's because they don't want you to

642
00:38:46.331 --> 00:38:51.010
eat bad meat and they,
they want to make sure the products are,
are right.

643
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.870
And you know,
they have,

644
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.390
they're strict about certain things because they care about the people.

645
00:38:55.391 --> 00:38:57.730
So they're really,
they're concerned about that.

646
00:38:57.731 --> 00:39:01.300
They don't want polluters polluting,
things like that.
So,

647
00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.680
but about those small businesses and all that,
I don't know much about.
Okay,

648
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.553
thanks.
Yeah.

649
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:09.890
<v 5>And were you allowed to ask a question about Donald Trump or is it just</v>

650
00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:15.850
<v 2>you are not allowed?
This is a matter of course.</v>

651
00:39:15.851 --> 00:39:17.770
You can ask me,
ask me anything you want.

652
00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:22.770
<v 5>Um,
I had a moment that you as a filmmaker might relate to.</v>

653
00:39:22.771 --> 00:39:24.240
I was for holidays,

654
00:39:24.241 --> 00:39:28.500
I was in Europe and it was at a show and it was so enjoying and then I had all,

655
00:39:28.501 --> 00:39:29.850
is it in this moment of,

656
00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.890
this feels very much like the beginning of the Second World War movie that shows

657
00:39:34.891 --> 00:39:38.790
Europe before the war that everybody is just enjoying the culture.

658
00:39:38.791 --> 00:39:43.791
People are participating in opera and concert and everything and all of a sudden

659
00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:45.083
the,
you know,

660
00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:48.840
generals and called into an emergency meeting and a war is worth breaking out.

661
00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:50.310
Um,

662
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.960
my point is why are we so comfortable with believing Trump has no chance.

663
00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:00.860
What has have we as the world learn after Second World War and that we are so

664
00:40:01.291 --> 00:40:05.160
confident in nutter,
fascist government is not going to come to power.

665
00:40:05.161 --> 00:40:07.700
And another person like Hitler,
um,

666
00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:12.210
who started all these ideas but bullying,
um,
minority group,
what religious group,

667
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:17.070
um,
is not going to happen again.
Like nothing has seriously happened.

668
00:40:17.071 --> 00:40:21.450
I'm going to still very strongly believing Donald Trump doesn't have a chance.

669
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:26.480
And I have been hearing that for the last six months and now solidly leading the

670
00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:27.403
GOP.

671
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:29.590
<v 2>The reason people think that he doesn't have a chance,</v>

672
00:40:29.591 --> 00:40:31.600
and I think you're okay to think that he doesn't have a chance.

673
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:36.100
It's because everybody knows the America we live in now and it's not angry white

674
00:40:36.101 --> 00:40:38.710
guys like Donald Trump is the people.
I,
I,

675
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:44.080
I said women generally aren't going to vote for Trump.

676
00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:49.050
He's,
he's guaranteed that people of color,
uh,

677
00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:52.150
are not going to vote there.
You can look at all the polls.
I mean,

678
00:40:52.151 --> 00:40:56.160
I saw one poll where Hispanics,
it wasn't even 0%,
it was like a nightmare.

679
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.110
It was a negative number and I couldn't,

680
00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:03.460
how do you get a negative number in a pool?
So it's,
it's,
and then,

681
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:08.400
and then,
and then young people,
you are the one good thing baby boomers and the,

682
00:41:08.401 --> 00:41:11.620
and the next generation did in terms of who your parents are is,

683
00:41:11.621 --> 00:41:16.020
I think that we raised a generation of people who don't hate,
you're not,

684
00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.330
you're not haters.
You don't hate people because of their skin color.

685
00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:22.960
You don't hate people because of who they are in love with.
And,

686
00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:26.740
and we raised you.
And so it's,
it's,

687
00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.920
it's very hard for,
uh,
the,
the,
the,

688
00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:34.610
the protal fascist types to take charge.
It's like,
you know,

689
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.200
if women were voting,
would they vote for Hitler?
If,

690
00:41:37.201 --> 00:41:41.990
if black people and Hispanics voted in mass,
would they vote for Hitler?
I mean,

691
00:41:41.991 --> 00:41:44.720
not to use Hitler as the,
I only use it because you use that example.

692
00:41:44.721 --> 00:41:49.100
But I'm just saying that,
that,
that it's nothing to be afraid of,

693
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:53.390
but we should be conscious of it.
And we should no longer treat him as a joke.

694
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:57.980
You should be taken seriously and,
and,
and dealt with.

695
00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.910
Um,
and so I tweeted out yesterday when he,

696
00:42:01.911 --> 00:42:04.190
when he said that about Bill Clinton was an abuser of women.

697
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:10.340
Well actually Bill Clinton gave us the family leave act,

698
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.420
so we don't have paid maternity leave,
but we have maternity leave now.

699
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:19.370
You can take so many weeks off.
Thanks to Bill Clinton.
He was pro choice.

700
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:22.850
Um,
he had consensual sex with an adult.

701
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.170
<v 3>Okay.</v>

702
00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:27.840
<v 2>Um,
and none of our business,
frankly.</v>

703
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:29.280
<v 3>Okay.</v>

704
00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:33.390
<v 2>And then I just Hashtag uh,
Trump Trump's three wives,</v>

705
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:34.623
<v 0>um,</v>

706
00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.840
not that there's anything wrong with having three wives,

707
00:42:40.841 --> 00:42:43.690
sometimes the third one is a charm.
And I,
I make,

708
00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:46.180
I make no judgment about that.

709
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:49.240
I'm just saying I was just my way of putting it out there.

710
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.430
<v 2>I'd love to hear from them,
you know,</v>

711
00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:56.800
because this guy can't get away with,
can't get away with that,

712
00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:59.710
shouldn't get away with that.
And I'm not,
I'm not a healer.

713
00:42:59.711 --> 00:43:02.400
I haven't endorsed anybody for president.
I'm just saying though,
that,

714
00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:04.420
that if he's going to go down that road,

715
00:43:04.421 --> 00:43:07.720
people who've got to stand up against this and that'd be both not be bullied.

716
00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.533
Yes.
Thank you.

717
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:13.710
<v 6>All right.
Uh,
so growing up in Australia,</v>

718
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.353
<v 0>I'm sorry,</v>

719
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.033
I'm here now.
Right.

720
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:24.340
<v 6>It felt strong cultural,
social,</v>

721
00:43:24.341 --> 00:43:28.520
economic connections to the u s there's a lot of similarities.
Uh,
I think it is.

722
00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:32.350
There's the saying that a lot of European countries with Canada.
Um,

723
00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:37.270
but I remember watching bowling for Columbine when I was 11 or 12 or something

724
00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:41.020
and thinking what the Hell is wrong with this country?

725
00:43:41.021 --> 00:43:43.750
What's so in the,
in this movie as well,

726
00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.670
you've laid out a lot of the differences and a lot of the things that the US

727
00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.150
does differently to these other countries.
Um,

728
00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:53.450
and we can all see as differences around us education,
healthcare,
um,

729
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:58.280
guns.
What,
why is it the US is so different.
There's,

730
00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:00.640
there's so much history,
cultural,
economic connection.

731
00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:03.310
What do you think the reasons are for these differences?

732
00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.280
<v 2>Partly what I said in the phone,
because we haven't,</v>

733
00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:09.060
we have been able to deal with our two original sins that we were founded on

734
00:44:09.061 --> 00:44:11.340
genocide and we were built on the backs of slaves.

735
00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:15.420
We don't acknowledge it and we haven't fixed it as a real insult until we,

736
00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:17.880
you got to take care of that first problem.

737
00:44:17.881 --> 00:44:20.730
I think before he can move on and be a better people

738
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.470
<v 6>kind of in Australia also had serious problems.</v>

739
00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:30.350
<v 2>Uh,
well yes,
but nothing like us.
Nothing at all.</v>

740
00:44:30.351 --> 00:44:31.020
Like us.

741
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:36.020
Camera did not have a slave system like us and Britain and Canada ended slavery

742
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:41.100
before we did and and made reparations and the Canadians have continued to make

743
00:44:41.101 --> 00:44:43.200
reparations to the native people.
In fact,

744
00:44:43.201 --> 00:44:48.030
they gave them a whole province that they can autonomously run.

745
00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:52.830
I can't imagine us doing that for native Americans or,
or you know,

746
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:57.900
even though as I show almost 40% of Mississippi is black and they have an in

747
00:44:57.901 --> 00:44:59.040
what they get for that,

748
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:04.070
what they get for being 40% of the state are the most conservative redneck

749
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.100
representatives in Congress.

750
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:11.220
It makes absolutely no sense until you start to think about,

751
00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.510
well how do you suppress the vote of 40 or 40% of the state's black?

752
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:19.410
How do you get the most conservative white people to represent the state?

753
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:23.520
I think,
I think that,
that,
that,
um,
um,

754
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:27.560
a lot of our problems as to do with fear.
Um,

755
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:32.760
we were easily manipulated with fear.
Um,
it's why we have so many guns,

756
00:45:32.761 --> 00:45:36.270
I think in people's homes.
I mean,
why would you have a gun in the house?

757
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.980
You're afraid of something,
right?

758
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:42.780
You might need it for production production against whom?
Little freckle face.

759
00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:45.750
Jimmy down the street.
I don't think so.

760
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.380
I don't think you were worried about Jimmy.
What are you worried about?

761
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:54.660
Why are 90% of the guns in homes or in suburbs and rural areas not in the city?

762
00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:57.750
Why don't we have any mass shootings that are city high schools,

763
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:03.900
right?
It doesn't happen,
does it?
You know?

764
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.780
So I think that there's a lot that,
I mean,

765
00:46:06.781 --> 00:46:09.180
I think there's a much longer answer to that,
but I think that there's,

766
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.120
there are things unique about us and President Obama,

767
00:46:12.121 --> 00:46:15.710
you probably didn't see him today with his,
did you guys see it?
Uh,

768
00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.770
his press conference on guns and what he's going to do,

769
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:22.680
he broke down and cried there.
I mean,
he's had tears before,

770
00:46:22.681 --> 00:46:26.430
but I've never seen him.
He actually cried and he couldn't stop the tears.

771
00:46:26.431 --> 00:46:30.160
He tried to stop them and they wouldn't stop once he started.
Once he,

772
00:46:30.161 --> 00:46:34.920
he mentioned the,
the 26 year olds that were shot,

773
00:46:34.921 --> 00:46:36.510
21st graders shot at new town.

774
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.470
He couldn't get the thought out of his head and he couldn't,

775
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.850
the tears couldn't stop coming down his face.
You'll see.

776
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:45.000
You'll see it later and you look it up.
That was crazy.

777
00:46:45.001 --> 00:46:46.560
I did see that this morning.
And actually,

778
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.390
do you think the presidents executive action would,

779
00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:51.900
is it going to change anything?
You know,
think nothing.
No,
no.

780
00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:55.530
But his heart's in the right place.
He's a compassionate person.
Um,

781
00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.890
he doesn't really have the power it needs to have to fix this,

782
00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.650
but the biggest problem isn't the fact that,
you know,

783
00:47:01.651 --> 00:47:05.070
they have guns in Canada and they don't,
they don't shoot each other like we do.

784
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:10.450
Um,
and they have guns and lots of countries.
Um,

785
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.230
Israel is a good example.
Lots of guns and Israel,

786
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.900
but they don't go to the high schools and shoot him up.

787
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:18.470
They don't shoot each other.
There's something very unique.

788
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:21.270
And he said during the talk today,
he says,

789
00:47:21.271 --> 00:47:24.960
I don't think Americans are any more violent than other people.
Actually we are,

790
00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.710
we are more violent,
were violent collectively.

791
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.520
By the way we invade countries,
the way we drone bomb civilians,

792
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:36.640
the things that we do,
um,
are shameful.

793
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.850
And personally the way we resolve our differences,
remember,
70%,

794
00:47:42.851 --> 00:47:46.240
I think 60 to 70% of all murders are between people who know each other.

795
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.510
It's not a stranger killing you.
It's,

796
00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:52.180
it's somebody you resolving a dispute whether somebody you're mad at and you

797
00:47:52.181 --> 00:47:57.120
reach for the gun.
That's how most of our murders,
you know,
take place.
So,
um,

798
00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.670
I'll give shorter answers seeing it more people for sure.
But it really quickly,

799
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:04.720
um,
would you ever revisit something in a film like you did with bowling for

800
00:48:04.721 --> 00:48:09.610
Columbine now knowing where the country has gone with project?
No.
Sadly,

801
00:48:09.611 --> 00:48:12.520
bowling for Columbine could open this Friday and be every bit as relevant as it

802
00:48:12.521 --> 00:48:15.400
was in 2002.
That's a sad statement to me.

803
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:18.220
The only thing I would change about bowling for Columbine is I would mention

804
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:23.200
that we're safe from 51% of the population.
Women don't do this.

805
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:27.340
San Bernardino aside,
that's an incident that hasn't been explained yet.

806
00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.610
So I'll wait on that.
But women don't do mass shootings.
Women,
uh,

807
00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:36.010
don't go into high schools and spray bullets.
Um,

808
00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:39.190
when you're walking home on eighth avenue here tonight,

809
00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:43.060
stark your radars up a little bit because it's dark.
You're in a big city.

810
00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:45.003
What are you afraid of?

811
00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:48.040
The image in your mind is not a woman jumping out of the bushes to assault you.

812
00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:53.370
It's a guy.
So let's just say what it is.
We're the,

813
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:58.390
the unsafe factor comes from the 49% of the population.
So,

814
00:48:58.450 --> 00:48:59.283
so I would've,

815
00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:01.990
I would've put a little happy news and bowling for Columbine to say that we're

816
00:49:01.991 --> 00:49:03.670
actually safe from the majority of Americans.

817
00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:10.540
Native Americans generally generally are not going to kill you or harm you in

818
00:49:10.541 --> 00:49:13.900
that way.
Go women,
unless you're cheating her.

819
00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:21.540
<v 4>Michael,
thank you for the phone.
Yes.
Um,
what do you,</v>

820
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:26.580
when you make a film,
and I guess,
you know,
thinking about your portfolio films,

821
00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:28.950
what do you want those some dude,
I mean,

822
00:49:28.951 --> 00:49:33.510
in terms of affecting change,
is it to start the dialogue?

823
00:49:33.511 --> 00:49:34.200
Is it too,

824
00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:38.550
<v 2>the first thing I want to do is for you to have felt that you just spent a good</v>

825
00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:42.410
these two hours.
There was a good way to spend those two hours that I'm,

826
00:49:42.411 --> 00:49:44.430
I'm filmmaker,
so I,
you go to the movies,

827
00:49:44.431 --> 00:49:46.860
I want you to have a good time at the movies.
I want you to,

828
00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:51.180
I want you to walk up the aisle going,
damn,
that was good.
That seriously,

829
00:49:51.181 --> 00:49:55.920
that is as every film maker wants that first and foremost that at the very least

830
00:49:56.190 --> 00:50:00.180
you were entertained in entertainment can mean it kept that was thought

831
00:50:00.181 --> 00:50:04.980
provoking a,
but you laughed.
Maybe,
maybe you cried.
Um,

832
00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:09.270
maybe you've got mad.
Any of those things.
Uh,
I'm happy with,
with all of that.

833
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:12.780
If 10% of the audience commits themselves to doing something about this,

834
00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:17.340
that would be huge.
Um,
I don't expect that from everybody and I don't demand it.

835
00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.970
I really,
I really want you to,
I want you to have a good time at the movies.

836
00:50:20.971 --> 00:50:24.840
And so I make movies for you to take a date to on a Friday night.

837
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:27.860
You know,
I,
I'm serious.

838
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.200
<v 0>I was signed in the edit room that says,</v>

839
00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:33.400
remember people want to go home and have sex after watching this movie.

840
00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:40.550
It's like don't mess it up for them,
you know?

841
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:53.280
Well it seems like social media and how it allows things to be a little bit more

842
00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.280
democratic and more feedback.
But at the same time,

843
00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:59.970
over the years we've seen a decline in like public interviews that everyone

844
00:50:59.971 --> 00:51:01.980
could see.
Like in 1993 for example,

845
00:51:01.981 --> 00:51:06.981
you know Larry King Live interview between Ross Perot in Vice President Al Gore

846
00:51:07.771 --> 00:51:10.950
about Nafta.
But it's things like the transpacific partnership,

847
00:51:10.951 --> 00:51:13.890
much bigger in scope.
We've had no public debate or discussion.

848
00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:15.980
So my question is like,

849
00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:21.150
is there a risk of social media being a self selection kind of filter where you

850
00:51:21.151 --> 00:51:24.540
only get the information you want to hear and everything else has asked a great

851
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:28.740
question.
Yes.
And I think in part the good news,
like this year,

852
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:31.680
look at the TV ratings for the debates are through the roof.

853
00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:35.190
They're higher than they've ever been because there's so few moments like that

854
00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:38.850
where there aren't those kinds of shows where you have this live interaction,

855
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.970
unedited,
unsupervised,
and just go at it and,

856
00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:45.360
and I think that that's,
I think that's a really,

857
00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:48.090
I think that's a really good point.
When I,
you know,

858
00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:52.350
when I said that all social media,
I mean I think it's like she said in the film,

859
00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:58.130
are you using it to watch the Kardashians or are using it for all the good that

860
00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:01.980
it,
it could do for you.
I mean,
to test my theory,

861
00:52:01.981 --> 00:52:04.920
I had been walking around my neighborhood about political topics and making

862
00:52:04.921 --> 00:52:08.430
comics and flyers and just talking to people and everyone tells me I'm just

863
00:52:08.431 --> 00:52:12.900
wasting my time and I should be going on social media instead.
Oh No,
I don't.
No,

864
00:52:12.901 --> 00:52:16.980
no,
no.
Because,
because social media can also just be noise.

865
00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:20.850
There's so much noise.
What you're doing,
having that personal human interaction.

866
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:25.710
We're social beings.
It's why nothing has killed the movies.

867
00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:27.180
The movie theaters won't go away.

868
00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:30.990
The way record stores and video stores went away.
Theaters won't go away.

869
00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.240
That's because people want to be with other people.

870
00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:37.300
It's why restaurants will never go away.
Nobody says the restaurant's survive.

871
00:52:37.301 --> 00:52:39.600
Everybody's got a kitchen in their home now.
Well,

872
00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:45.220
because they like to go out and they'd like to be around strangers and eating in

873
00:52:45.221 --> 00:52:48.130
front of strangers.
That's who we are as humans.

874
00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:52.300
And we want to sit in a dark room with 200 other people.
You know,
you can't,

875
00:52:52.301 --> 00:52:56.020
you can't.
The video store that was,
you were taking that home to watch.

876
00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:58.830
Sometimes by yourself,
you know,
or the,

877
00:52:58.831 --> 00:53:02.770
the record or the CD you are putting in your ears.
That's not the movies.

878
00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.830
So in fact,
I honestly,
I'm,
I'm,
uh,

879
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:10.660
I'm very anti watching a movie on that laptop or on your phone.

880
00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:13.690
You are not watching a movie.
If you're watching it on your phone,

881
00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:17.170
you're watching something,
you know.
But as the filmmaker,

882
00:53:17.171 --> 00:53:21.920
it's not the way I intended.
I made this to be seen on a big screen.
You know,
I,

883
00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:26.610
I meant it to be experienced socially,
not,
not personally.

884
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:31.380
<v 2>You know,
it's,
it's,
you can watch Lawrence of Arabia,</v>

885
00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:35.280
you know,
or the current star wars on your phone,

886
00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:38.530
but you're not watching star wars.
You know,
you're not,

887
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:43.170
that's not the way they intended it to be seen.
Um,

888
00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:48.360
the u s postal service issued the Mona Lisa stamp many years ago.

889
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:54.070
That was not the Mona Lisa.
That was a stamp with the Mona Lisa and the staff.

890
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.820
We're a depiction of the Mona Lisa on the stamp,

891
00:53:57.090 --> 00:54:01.170
but that you have not seen the Mona Lisa unless you go to that museum in Paris.

892
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:04.680
So,
so you have not seen my movie.

893
00:54:04.681 --> 00:54:09.360
If you've watched it on an iPhone or on a computer screen or even on a TV
screen,

894
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:13.530
that's just not the way you need to go out to the movies.

895
00:54:13.531 --> 00:54:17.050
You need to go into a movie theater.
And,
and I'm,

896
00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:19.540
I feel very passionate about this.
In fact,
I,

897
00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:23.610
I have restored movie theaters in Michigan and I set them up as nonprofits and

898
00:54:23.611 --> 00:54:28.611
run them and I program them and went and I have really just one rule.

899
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:33.150
Other than that everybody should be able to buy soda and popcorn for $2.

900
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:38.120
That's like,
that's like rule one,
don't rip people off.
And uh,

901
00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:41.790
the second rule is if you're caught on your cell phone during the movie,

902
00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.830
you're banned from the theater for life

903
00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:49.770
is it really works.
Wow.
You know,
because I'm,

904
00:54:49.771 --> 00:54:53.220
because this is not the place for that.

905
00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:59.180
As much as I am a proponent of the devices and technology and social media or

906
00:54:59.221 --> 00:55:01.590
whatever that is,
just,
you know,

907
00:55:01.591 --> 00:55:06.591
I read some crazy statistic that 17% of guys admit to having looked over at

908
00:55:08.791 --> 00:55:12.770
their phone during sex.
What's,
Woo.

909
00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:16.380
Wow.
What's going on?

910
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:23.190
You're looking at me like I'm guilty.
Like my fiance just called.
He was like,

911
00:55:23.191 --> 00:55:27.630
so Kevin,
I'm just,

912
00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:31.260
I don't understand.
I don't understand that.
I don't,
I don't,
I don't know.

913
00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:34.320
I don't want us to become that stay human,

914
00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:38.670
use these things like she said for the good but,
but stay human.

915
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:40.163
That's a two more.

916
00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:45.070
<v 0>Um,
I,
I'm an American,
uh,
clearly who,
um,</v>

917
00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:49.870
started traveling abroad a lot several years ago and it took me a long time to

918
00:55:49.871 --> 00:55:54.340
like stop thinking America was the best at everything and to like become less

919
00:55:54.341 --> 00:55:57.790
defensive and be able to take criticism and be open minded.

920
00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:00.700
And I wonder like,

921
00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:05.400
how can Michael Moore make a movie that would like actually speak to the

922
00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:10.410
Republicans and get them to learn what like what me as a sort of a democrat or

923
00:56:12.311 --> 00:56:14.120
an open minded person would get from this.

924
00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:21.430
<v 2>I made it.
It's this movie.
It's this movie.
They've already,</v>

925
00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:26.110
the studio was already tested it amongst conservatives.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.

926
00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:31.060
Now I'm not talking about the 20% that are way over here on the,
uh,
on the,

927
00:56:31.061 --> 00:56:35.760
uh,
you know,
the far right.
They're kind of lost souls.
Okay.
It'd be,
you know,

928
00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:38.620
the people that believe that Adam and eve rode on dinosaurs 6,000 years ago.

929
00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:43.510
God bless them,
but I,
I can't help them,
but there's a whole bunch in here,

930
00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:46.000
you know,
the who call themselves conservatives,

931
00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:49.150
but they actually believe if women are doing the same work,

932
00:56:49.151 --> 00:56:52.780
they should be paid the same amount of money and they want to drink clean water

933
00:56:52.781 --> 00:56:57.781
and breathe clean air and they want their kids to go to really good schools and

934
00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:01.420
you know,
they're there for,
they're for a lot of good things.
Uh,

935
00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:02.890
they just don't like being taxed.

936
00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:06.940
They don't like sharing their money with other people.
They hate the poor,

937
00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:12.430
you know,
like it's a disease.
Right.
But they,
but on a lot of,

938
00:57:12.431 --> 00:57:16.000
but they,
but they,
at least we'll have an open mind.
And they,
they did,

939
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:19.270
they've tested this and it's tested.
I went to a screening out in Westport,

940
00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:23.650
Connecticut a couple of weeks ago and then I talked to the Republicans in the

941
00:57:23.651 --> 00:57:26.620
room afterwards and then we went out to a bar after that.

942
00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:31.900
And it was amazing the amount of epiphany's that these Republicans had watching

943
00:57:31.901 --> 00:57:33.670
this.
First of all,

944
00:57:33.671 --> 00:57:37.120
it's the first film of mine they've seen because they've been told not to see

945
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:41.260
the others.
Right.
Right.
And I,
and I've,
and I always tell a Republican,
I said,

946
00:57:41.261 --> 00:57:43.840
you know,
I don't want you to change your mind,

947
00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:47.950
but if you'll just watch any of my films,
you'll know three things right away.

948
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:49.180
I love this country.

949
00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:54.670
I have a heart and you're going to laugh at least a half a dozen times during

950
00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:57.520
the movie.
I can guarantee you those three things.

951
00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:59.860
And you don't have to change your politics at the end of it,

952
00:57:59.861 --> 00:58:04.430
but maybe it'll make you think a little bit about some things.
So,
and,

953
00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:05.820
and like you say,
you,
you,

954
00:58:05.821 --> 00:58:08.740
you reached that point where you realize we're not number one at everything.

955
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:13.430
We're not the greatest thing ever invented.
Right?
But you love this country.
Yeah.

956
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:16.510
You don't want to live anywhere else.
Well,
well,
after watching this,

957
00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.680
we're watching this movie.
You can't leave.

958
00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.570
You have to stay and help make it better.
Sorry,
one quick one.

959
00:58:25.070 --> 00:58:27.590
<v 7>I'm not sure if it's a quick one,
but,
um,
first of all,</v>

960
00:58:27.591 --> 00:58:32.390
I live in Westport Connecticut.
So I can relate to that.
And second of all,

961
00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:34.790
it's great that he make all of his movies.

962
00:58:34.791 --> 00:58:38.450
I love them and a lot of fathers and it just went to watch spike Lee's Shira.

963
00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:41.450
And I was really impressed with the movie and I wish more people would watch it,

964
00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:44.480
but the pharaoh was how Pham Te and Vanessa was an opening weekend.

965
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:47.810
And the Tarot is really small to be honest.
So my question is,

966
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:51.440
movies are awesome and the open ended articles are great,

967
00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:53.060
but beyond the movies,

968
00:58:53.061 --> 00:58:58.061
how do we reach that maybe 80% 90% of the population who just too busy to watch

969
00:58:58.881 --> 00:59:02.400
the movies or to,
to to more consumers,
more concerned with,
you know,

970
00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:05.070
making the ends meet and feed the family.
Well,

971
00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:07.680
<v 2>that's a problem.
All art suffers.</v>

972
00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:13.040
All art suffers when the majority of the population is living from paycheck to

973
00:59:13.261 --> 00:59:16.860
paycheck.
That story last week,
that,

974
00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:20.730
that the majority of Americans now,
the majority of Americans,

975
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.160
if they had an emergency,

976
00:59:22.161 --> 00:59:26.270
don't have $400 if they needed $400 tonight,

977
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:31.160
they have it nowhere.
They'd have to sell something or borrow it.

978
00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:33.130
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

979
00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:35.320
<v 2>Well,
you've got so many people working a second job.</v>

980
00:59:35.321 --> 00:59:39.760
The Germans laughing at me there.
The idea of a second job is insane to them.

981
00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:43.600
Right?
So how do you get those people to actually start?

982
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:48.990
We have to fix the economic system in this country that is driving people's

983
00:59:49.090 --> 00:59:51.700
heads into the ground.
That's what,

984
00:59:51.701 --> 00:59:56.701
that's what we have to stop this massive transfer of wealth to the upper 0.1%

985
00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:03.400
because it's making everybody else scrambled so hard and worry for their

986
01:00:03.401 --> 01:00:07.900
survival that they don't have time to go to the movies or write that poem or

987
01:00:07.901 --> 01:00:11.620
sing that song.
And we've made our,
our entertainment.

988
01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.650
So out of the reach of working people,

989
01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:18.880
what's across to go to a Knicks game,
what's it called?

990
01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:23.940
I went to youtube last summer.
There was $280 you know,
what's it,

991
01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:28.750
what's it cost to the,
I mean,
the movies are the last place and even that's,

992
01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.240
it's too much.
You know,

993
01:00:31.241 --> 01:00:35.680
I don't charge more than $8 and 50 cents at my theater and that,

994
01:00:35.681 --> 01:00:40.090
and that includes three d,
no extra charge.
That's a rip off.
You know,

995
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:42.790
I don't charge you more money because the movies three hours instead of two

996
01:00:42.791 --> 01:00:46.180
hours or two hours instead of 90 minutes,
you know,

997
01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:50.470
but that's what has to change.
There's the,
the,
the oligarchy,

998
01:00:50.471 --> 01:00:52.900
the people that exist at the top that are running the show,

999
01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.090
the small number of people that own 90% of the wealth in this country are

1000
01:00:58.091 --> 01:01:01.570
setting it up.
So the rest of us just can't frigging enjoy life.

1001
01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:06.400
And that has to change.
That has to change it.
It can change.

1002
01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:11.110
We can make a change legally too,
you know,
at that would,

1003
01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:15.550
that would just require
a Bernie Sanders.

1004
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:20.410
Imagine him as president.
You know,

1005
01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:24.460
it's not an endorsement.
I'm just saying,
I like Hillary.

1006
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:29.410
I'm just saying not going to change with Hillary.
Then again,

1007
01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:33.700
she could end up being our Pope Francis.
Like where did that come from?

1008
01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.600
All of a sudden there's a popup that says,
you know,

1009
01:01:37.601 --> 01:01:42.130
gay people aren't going to burn in hell.
So,
you know,
things can change,

1010
01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:46.450
things get better.
But I,
I really believe that,
um,
this is a great question.

1011
01:01:46.451 --> 01:01:48.050
You've raised that,

1012
01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:52.630
that the theater would be half empty for spikes film such an important movie.

1013
01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:56.680
And,
but my question maybe to you,

1014
01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:00.730
all of you and you have sex in strange ways,

1015
01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:06.190
distracted or we call it distractive sex.
Yes.

1016
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:11.290
But how do you,
Michael Moore just tweeted,

1017
01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:19.680
we're going to edit all this out.
Um,
but no,
but I would like to,

1018
01:02:19.681 --> 01:02:20.220
I'd ask

1019
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.960
<v 0>you,
your generation,</v>

1020
01:02:21.961 --> 01:02:26.670
this is the generation where you're not going to the theater as much to watch

1021
01:02:26.671 --> 01:02:31.580
movies.
Yeah.
You know,
why is that?
Why?

1022
01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:35.220
I mean,
it's a quiet,
it's not a philosophical question.
I mean,
it's lazy,

1023
01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:37.350
just lazy.
It's,
he,
it's easier to get them.

1024
01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:41.240
It's easier to watch it on the computer.
It's,
it's easier.
A Tan,

1025
01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:46.120
easily attainable.
Easily attainable.
Yeah.
And,
but there are some,

1026
01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:49.680
I think at least,
I don't know what category it falls into,
but for me personally,

1027
01:02:49.681 --> 01:02:52.440
there are some films where I will actively go out and see them because I'm like,

1028
01:02:52.441 --> 01:02:55.560
I need to see that on the big screen.
And some I'm just like,
I can wait.

1029
01:02:55.690 --> 01:02:58.050
All right.
So for an action film,
you want to see that on a big screen,

1030
01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:58.950
you want to see everything right.

1031
01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:01.230
But for this you want to see this with other people,

1032
01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:05.460
it wasn't this a different experience that plays into it as well that plays here

1033
01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:06.893
for sure.

1034
01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.390
<v 2>Or maybe the movies just aren't as good anymore.</v>

1035
01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:14.090
Maybe there's just too much crap out there when everything's a franchise and,

1036
01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:18.550
right.
Yeah.
And,
and,
and so which means that your generation,

1037
01:03:18.551 --> 01:03:22.840
we're not seeing but the next cool break or the next Scorsese over the next,

1038
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:23.951
you know,
whatever,

1039
01:03:23.951 --> 01:03:28.951
we're not seeing enough of the good films made by people in their twenties and

1040
01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:29.970
thirties.

1041
01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:31.330
<v 0>Well and uh,
I know we have to wrap up,</v>

1042
01:03:31.331 --> 01:03:32.800
but just one final point cause it was really,

1043
01:03:32.801 --> 01:03:35.410
really important and it was one of my favorite moments in the film as well,

1044
01:03:35.411 --> 01:03:36.670
was in Iceland,

1045
01:03:36.671 --> 01:03:41.671
the first woman president who really inspired so many young women and girls to

1046
01:03:41.741 --> 01:03:45.380
kind of grow up and actually be more than what,
you know,
society,

1047
01:03:45.381 --> 01:03:48.760
it kind of painted them to be Welch.
Oh these are only men's jobs or whatever.

1048
01:03:48.761 --> 01:03:51.520
And one of the most incredible things was the company boards.

1049
01:03:51.521 --> 01:03:55.510
It's by law that they have to be at least 40% women or 40% men.

1050
01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:59.650
It could be 60% women and 40% men,
or it could be 60% men and 40% of women,

1051
01:03:59.651 --> 01:04:02.470
but it has to be that.
And um,
you know,

1052
01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.350
she had said once you have three women in the boardroom,

1053
01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:07.030
that's when culture starts changing.

1054
01:04:07.031 --> 01:04:11.170
One is just a token to as a minority and three is when the group dynamics really

1055
01:04:11.171 --> 01:04:12.610
start changing.
So is that,

1056
01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:17.140
could that be something that is a big start in the us of something that we could

1057
01:04:17.141 --> 01:04:21.790
do,
um,
to really inspire the change?
Yes.
That would be a great law to pass.

1058
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:26.110
<v 2>Uh,
Germany's just past the,
there,
there are 30%.
You know,</v>

1059
01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.410
I think that w I think that we could follow the German way easier than the

1060
01:04:29.411 --> 01:04:34.300
Scandinavian or Nordic way.
Um,
but uh,
yes,

1061
01:04:34.301 --> 01:04:38.740
obviously the more women in the room,
the better.
We're where did that,

1062
01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.310
what Jenner?
That's so old.
You don't,

1063
01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:46.540
I don't where whoever thought of that idea that women shouldn't be at the table,

1064
01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:51.790
it's always better with women around.
Right.

1065
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:57.610
You know,
I,
I mean,
your generation already knows this,
you know,
we,
there are now,

1066
01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:01.960
I mean,
there are now more women in college than men there did,

1067
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.460
didn't it just last year.
Women in law school surpass men.

1068
01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:11.470
Um,
uh,
there are now more when managers have,
you know,

1069
01:05:11.471 --> 01:05:14.680
and just the low level business stuff.
I mean,
there's women,
I mean,

1070
01:05:14.681 --> 01:05:18.430
things are already changing.
Your generation has helped to make this change,

1071
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:23.320
but we're going to be better off with,
with women having a,
a strong say,

1072
01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:27.850
not a token se,
but a real,
a real strong say.
And that's not the,

1073
01:05:27.851 --> 01:05:28.840
I'm not just making a,

1074
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:34.270
like a tried to bundle all women into one group.

1075
01:05:34.271 --> 01:05:38.260
Think,
you know,
there's lots of examples of women that have done horrible things.

1076
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:44.500
Well,
a couple of women I know,
but I ain't not a whole lot,

1077
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.830
but you know,
I just think that,

1078
01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.560
that we're all going to be better off in that way.

1079
01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.020
Weren't your mother's like that then?

1080
01:05:53.021 --> 01:05:56.710
Your mother's raise you to believe that whether your men or women,
that,

1081
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.810
that it's,

1082
01:05:58.811 --> 01:06:03.160
it's crazy to walk into a room and have just a bunch of guys,

1083
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:07.330
you know,
you're never going to get the best work,
the best product,

1084
01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:11.350
the best anything.
And in tech,
this is a real issue.
You know,

1085
01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:14.920
that you don't want to shut women out of this because that next great invention

1086
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:18.160
then it can great thought's going to come from what they bring to the table that

1087
01:06:18.161 --> 01:06:20.880
you don't have as a man,
you know?
Well,

1088
01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:22.920
and they're starting to change that mean we have this whole,
you know,

1089
01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:24.100
campaign with made with code.

1090
01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.470
We're starting to teach little girls about in a fun way.
Yeah.

1091
01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:27.430
They pair it up with,
you know,

1092
01:06:27.431 --> 01:06:31.090
Pixar and Disney to do the made with code campaign and with inside out and
stuff.

1093
01:06:31.091 --> 01:06:33.850
So it was,
it was really good to kind of get these girls when they're young,

1094
01:06:33.851 --> 01:06:36.040
instead of say,
hey,
you can also be an engineer.
Hey,

1095
01:06:36.041 --> 01:06:37.600
you could do this and kind of teach him any young age.

1096
01:06:37.601 --> 01:06:41.260
So they're just not trying to figure it out when they're older.
Yeah,
I think,

1097
01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.140
I think that,
I hope that came through in the film that I really remember,
sure.

1098
01:06:44.141 --> 01:06:48.340
Big Believer in this and that and that will have a better world when it's,

1099
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:53.370
when it's a shared world and not just not just you and I because you know,

1100
01:06:54.641 --> 01:06:59.170
we have,
we have a y chromosome and not the second x,

1101
01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:04.540
it would have been an x,
but one of the quadrants fell off.
Making an a why?

1102
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.983
It's my,

1103
01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:10.660
it's my firm belief that that missing part of our second x has the volume

1104
01:07:10.661 --> 01:07:14.050
control,
has the ability to ask for directions,

1105
01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:20.200
aesthetics.
Uh,
you know,
there's a whole bunch of things that,
you know,
why,

1106
01:07:20.201 --> 01:07:23.530
why do women do better on the sats that's in there somewhere.

1107
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:28.360
So I think,
um,
and I just want to say before we close to the,
your,
your main,

1108
01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:34.210
your main dude here,
Larry.
Larry patient.
The Godfather yes.

1109
01:07:34.211 --> 01:07:38.470
Of,
of Google is a Michigander is from Michigan.

1110
01:07:39.010 --> 01:07:42.820
Anybody knew that and everybody know that in here.
Yes.
Um,

1111
01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:46.260
so just another great thing that we've,
we've given the world.

1112
01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.960
<v 1>Thank you.
Thank you very much.</v>

1113
01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:56.970
[inaudible] February 12th,

1114
01:07:57.451 --> 01:07:58.270
February 12th,

1115
