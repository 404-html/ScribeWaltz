00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.850
Hi everyone.
Welcome to talks at Google today.

2
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:15.780
It is my pleasure to welcome Alison Williams and Daniel Kaluuya for get out.

3
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.613
<v 0>Hi,</v>

4
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.070
<v 1>thanks for joining us today.
Thanks for having us.</v>

5
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.160
So let's start off with the beginning.

6
00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.810
How did you both get involved in this project?
Um,

7
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.330
I got an email and a phone call from my agent and he was like,

8
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:37.720
I'm sending you a script that Jordan Peele I wanted me to send to you,

9
00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:42.721
which triggered anxiety event number one that he knew who I was and wanted to

10
00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:44.770
potentially to work with me.

11
00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:48.910
It was mind blowing because I was a huge key and Peele fan because I'm a human

12
00:00:48.911 --> 00:00:52.840
being who has eyeballs and likes things.
Um,

13
00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:57.430
and so I,
I read the script and my agent also is like,
it's not a comedy.

14
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.300
So I thought,
oh,
that's so interesting.
So I read it and as I was reading it,

15
00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:03.790
I was already getting excited about it.

16
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.160
And then I facetimed with Daniel Daniel with Jordan for like two hours and we

17
00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:12.280
talked about Daniel and who might be part of it.

18
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.730
And it was like he was,
he was trying to convince me to do it,

19
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:17.830
but at the very beginning of our conversation,
I was like,

20
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.570
I'm so excited to do this.

21
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.150
And then he just kept trying to convince me and we had very similar experiences.

22
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.070
<v 2>Yeah,
I'll read it.
And then
this is like 12 years a slave,</v>

23
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:33.360
a horror movie.
And I was like,
I was like,
when boys would go crazy for this.

24
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:37.770
And then,
and then I emailed and they were like,

25
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.260
Jordan was to Skype with you.
And I said,
oh,
that's amazing.

26
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:44.400
I'm going to scrap the Jordan Peele does in the same and I don't even care.

27
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.580
I was,
I going to have this story forever.
And then,
uh,
and then,
then he was like,

28
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:53.790
he knows who you are.
I was like,
what even make sense.

29
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.550
And then I skyped with him and then he was watched black mirror to show.

30
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.550
I did back home a few years back.
And then like,
I was like,
Yo,
that's crazy.
That,

31
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.270
and then I realize it's Netflix is a thing out there.
And then,
and then,
um,

32
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.680
and yeah,
and he was really cool when I really,
I mean,

33
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.250
the script made me feel like I was like,
oh my God,

34
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:13.770
I can't believe you can say this.
You know what I mean?
I've got,
okay,

35
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:16.980
I definitely want to be a part of this.
And,
and Jordan just got it.

36
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.060
<v 1>Yeah.
He's,
the script is amazing.</v>

37
00:02:19.061 --> 00:02:22.690
And he'd spent about five years working on it and just kind of mulling it over

38
00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:26.680
and put it down and come back to it.
And,
um,
as a result of that,

39
00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:27.514
there was just like,

40
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.520
it was so tight and it was so well crafted and I was just instantly excited

41
00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:38.350
about it.
So Jordan not only wrote,
but he directed it.
Yes.
As you mentioned,

42
00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:43.090
most of us probably know him from his comedy background,
the work he does now,

43
00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:44.620
but what,
what was that sort of,

44
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.990
what's the most unexpected thing about having him at the helm of it?

45
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.670
And it was just kind of a daily thing where it's like,
oh yeah,

46
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.150
he's our director who takes you?
Yeah.

47
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.390
Like I got a text from Jordan Peele and I'm like,
oh,

48
00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.890
<v 2>uh,
those who I am.</v>

49
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.710
<v 1>Uh,
and uh,
yeah,
so he's just,</v>

50
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.630
he's just so smart,
man.

51
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.790
And he's so on it and he's so collaborative and that's what it was the daily.

52
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:14.270
And then sometimes he'd be Tracy Morgan or whatever,
Kara Bama,

53
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.680
we needed energy.
He just direct,
he'd be really go into some other character,

54
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.180
but he's so talented as a director and the movie is great evidence of that.

55
00:03:23.181 --> 00:03:28.181
But also like we had a firsthand daily experience of being directed by him,

56
00:03:29.091 --> 00:03:31.310
which was amazing.
And he's collaborative,

57
00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:34.790
but from when he really believes something needs to be a certain way,

58
00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:39.440
which just as actors makes us trust him so much.

59
00:03:39.441 --> 00:03:41.930
It's like having a parent that is strict when they need to be,

60
00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:46.430
but understanding and collaborative and compassionate,
you know,

61
00:03:46.431 --> 00:03:48.560
regardless.
So it's a,

62
00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:53.561
he was phenomenal to work with and I would do whatever he asked of me.

63
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.510
Yes.
Are Our jobs in this movie are proof of that.

64
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.800
I'm just going to dive into this topic because you can't really talk about this

65
00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:04.550
film without addressing race just because it's such an important part of this

66
00:04:04.551 --> 00:04:06.410
entire film and it's,
it's at Google as a whole.

67
00:04:06.411 --> 00:04:09.800
We've been having a lot of conversations about race and representation lately.

68
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.300
And I'm curious if like the process of making this film made you notice anything

69
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.150
about sort of behavior in the world in general that you might not have been

70
00:04:17.151 --> 00:04:20.630
attuned to before.
I think probably this is mostly for me

71
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.250
because it goes both ways,
right?
Because like part of part of it is like,
Hey,

72
00:04:25.251 --> 00:04:28.700
if you're of a different race and you're stepping into a scenario where you are

73
00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:30.130
the outsider,
like it's,

74
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.770
it changes things and maybe before you didn't realize that you're that different

75
00:04:33.771 --> 00:04:36.510
from other people and then your be your made hyper aware of it.
Yeah,

76
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.490
<v 2>I think,
I think it's quite,
but I do think it's,
I think there's seminaries,</v>

77
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:45.840
but I do think that being black in a,
in a,
in a different way,

78
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.700
environment is quite specific and it has his own specific specificity of,

79
00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:53.750
uh,
of weirdness.
And a,

80
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.490
and just because I don't think racism is really weird.

81
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.580
I think racism is a really weird thing to,
for people to have an a and and,

82
00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:01.060
and so,
yeah,

83
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.060
that's what the scripts at the party scene as a party scene.

84
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.100
And I was like,

85
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.860
and when everyone was kind of trying to make Chris feel welcome and comfortable

86
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:13.590
by keeping on asking the question about blackness.
And I was like,

87
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.610
I've been to that party,
I go to that point,
I'm going to bite you soon.

88
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.250
I don't know.
But I,
cause I,
it's like,
I've no doubt.

89
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.750
I know that and that and that's,

90
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.060
I don't know if any other Aviva it that's the same,

91
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.530
you know,
I don't think that's the same,

92
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:31.860
I don't think it manifest in the same way when people go,

93
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.190
I'm really cool with this.
Yo,
have you seen this basketball game and go,
Bro,

94
00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:39.150
I'm English.
I don't care about bosket boo man.
I play watch football bro.

95
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.230
And I say that kind of,
that kind of thing.

96
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.230
<v 1>Yeah.
And I,
I was,
um,</v>

97
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.530
I like to think of myself as someone who's pretty sensitive to that stuff.

98
00:05:49.531 --> 00:05:52.950
And so in the script,
obviously I,
I caught all of that.

99
00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:57.530
But I also think of myself as someone who's never done listening and learning

100
00:05:57.531 --> 00:06:00.680
and trying to understand what it's like to go through life as someone else.

101
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:02.630
I can never fully know that,

102
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:07.631
but I can do my best every day to expand what I know of the human experience.

103
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.830
And so doing this movie was fascinating for me on multiple levels because I got

104
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:16.340
to,
well,
the whole audience gets to go through the movie from his eyes.

105
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.380
And so already you're subverting what is the typical horror trope of having the

106
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.090
final girl.
And so you're all,

107
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.970
you're typically going through a horror movie through a female,

108
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:30.290
a white woman's eyes,
and you're seeing it through the male gaze typically.

109
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.890
And so in this be subverted it doubly,
not only do we have a final boy,

110
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.030
but we have a black vinyl boy,
which is not a normal situation.

111
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:40.220
And so as a result,

112
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:44.730
the screenings of the movie reveal what Jordan earlier referred to as a Warshak

113
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.310
test,
which I love because the way you react to things in the movie and when,
um,

114
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.340
are really revolutionary about your own experience.

115
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:55.610
And if a lot of people in the audience who don't look like you are laughing at

116
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:56.444
something,

117
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.260
then it's worth investigating what that is and why you might not know about it.

118
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.350
And again,
apologies for how vague we're being,

119
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:05.390
but there are a lot of spoilers in this movie.

120
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:09.980
And so a lot of our answers sound like,
um,
bad press releases,

121
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:12.650
but we're just doing our best to not spoil stuff.

122
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:15.470
We're trying to preserve the experience for one thing because watching the film

123
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:18.470
and you know,
knowing what some of your referring to I had,

124
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.310
it's just a different experience.
So it is,

125
00:07:20.311 --> 00:07:23.600
but it was actually interesting going back and seeing like the trailer again,

126
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:26.780
having seen the film and realizing this is totally a different experience then.

127
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.680
And I feel like we haven't actually seen a film like this ever.

128
00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:32.360
Possibly because you have,
you know,

129
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.650
<v 2>yeah,
that's what I was in a call.</v>

130
00:07:34.651 --> 00:07:38.670
We've shown the producer and then we just talk about life and then like,

131
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.790
and then he was like sort of by this film and took about why the budget is

132
00:07:41.791 --> 00:07:44.760
really low and took my little stuff and he was like,
the thing is about his film,

133
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.440
it's never been done before.
This is the risk.
And I was like,

134
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.250
that's why I said yes.
That's exactly what,
and that's exciting.

135
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.620
Doing stuff like that is exciting because you're like,
we don't,

136
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.730
I don't know what's going to happen off the 24th.
I don't have no idea.

137
00:07:56.731 --> 00:08:01.470
Like it's new territory,
new areas.
And that's why we're here for,
you know,

138
00:08:01.471 --> 00:08:03.090
to do stuff that's different than,

139
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.770
<v 1>yeah,
that's something that we immediately bonded over is that neither of us is</v>

140
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:11.240
particularly interested in safety as far as our careers go,
which is very dumb,

141
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.790
like from an actual longevity standpoint.

142
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:18.350
But it's selfish because we want to keep challenging ourselves and keeping

143
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:21.370
ourselves guessing in terms of what's coming next.
Um,

144
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:26.030
and so I think we both get sent a lot of roles that we felt like we've played

145
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:27.500
itches,
we feel we've scratched.

146
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:30.410
And so then this comes along and both of us were just like,
oh my God,

147
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:32.670
this is not someone I'm ever going to be sent again.

148
00:08:32.671 --> 00:08:35.630
Or if I ever seen this character before,
if I don't do this,

149
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.950
when will it ever happen?
So,
um,
but I,

150
00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:43.951
I do think that this movie more than most is a really good communal viewing

151
00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:45.980
experience for the reasons I gave before.

152
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:50.981
But also because it's told so carefully through the perspective of Chris,

153
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.930
um,
you,
the audience isn't ahead of him.

154
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.220
It's annoying and horror and the audience knows something that the protagonist

155
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.550
doesn't.
So you're literally like,
you feel

156
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.740
helpless in the way that he does if he's feeling helpless in that moment,

157
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:05.580
are empowered.

158
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.290
And so it's a really active participation movie.
We've,

159
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.070
there've been a bunch of screenings now at this point and all of them are very

160
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:18.390
vocal,
which is fantastic.
And then the second time you see the movie,

161
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.110
it's a completely different movie.
It's a totally different movie.

162
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.870
You have a different protagonists are not going to tell you who it is,

163
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.110
but you're suddenly watching the movie through somebody else's eyes.

164
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:33.470
And it's just a really cool narrative thing that Jordan did that we worked very

165
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:38.370
hard to like layer into all the performances.
Were you worried at all,

166
00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:42.180
because you said you're not concerned with safety years but,
but you know,

167
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:44.940
to take this role you have to sort of embrace certain stereotypes.

168
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.420
I feel like the entire film depends on like society as a holes.

169
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.770
Assuming things about both of you.
Like so where,

170
00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.800
where did you draw from in terms of like,
okay,
this is,

171
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:59.400
this is a moment where I really want to embrace like the kind of stereotype of

172
00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:02.250
what,
what people are expecting from like a white woman.

173
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:05.070
I'm just going to say if I,
you know,
you can call me a white woman,
that's fine,

174
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:06.820
but I feel like,
you know,

175
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.600
a white woman has like certain connotations and where you at all like,
Hey,

176
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:11.280
I really just don't want to be associated with this.

177
00:10:11.281 --> 00:10:15.690
Or having been a suburban white women my entire life,
I feel,
um,

178
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:20.580
I felt actually like I was excited to be able to play that archetype,

179
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.370
uh,
in such a kind of,
um,

180
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.510
outright way in this movie because it kind of De Thorns,

181
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:31.590
any association I have with that class,
so to speak,
going forward.

182
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.200
And it gives me a great excuse to not have to do it again.

183
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.630
So now I can kind of like I've done that.

184
00:10:36.631 --> 00:10:40.860
I did the like Marnie version of it and I mean Peter Pan is not in this category

185
00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:45.110
at all,
but you just white,
um,
English,
uh,

186
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.860
ageless flying.
Um,
boy,
but that's like a different thing entirely.
And then,

187
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.010
um,
but rose also feels like,
okay,

188
00:10:53.011 --> 00:10:55.710
now I can kind of walk away from,

189
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.830
from this version of a person.

190
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.690
And it's also why Jordan wanted me to play it as he came to the widest girl to

191
00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:06.810
play the widest girl.
And I was like,
yes,

192
00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:11.640
I acknowledge that as my mantle and I will play at dutifully.
So

193
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:16.600
<v 2>yeah,
I kinda,
I kinda,
I mean,
mean to Annetta conversation.
I really was wary.</v>

194
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.580
I already wanted Chris to be not saying,

195
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.970
I mean excluding anyone else,
any of it,

196
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.540
but I really want Chris to be a black guy that black people root for,

197
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.010
because sometimes in this kind of arena he can,

198
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.010
like in those situations,
he could be seen as like not speaking up and not,

199
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.340
you know,
so it was very wary it,
especially at that party,

200
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.940
if someone said something,
I remember there was a scene.

201
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.200
<v 1>Yeah,
you're like,
code switching too much.
It's not going to read.</v>

202
00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.750
<v 2>Yeah.
It just go,
look,
he looks like a seller.</v>

203
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.280
They will perceive it as a seller not being a sell out.

204
00:11:52.281 --> 00:11:54.870
Is that how it's in the public consciousness and,
and,
and,

205
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.530
and I was wary about that because you'd want them to go,

206
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.980
you want black beads,
which go,
I'd made that decision.
I understand that.

207
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:03.501
I understand it.

208
00:12:03.501 --> 00:12:06.270
And I think the root of it is the fact that he loved his girlfriend.
I mean,

209
00:12:06.271 --> 00:12:08.310
and he loves his girlfriend and he's like,
he's doing,

210
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.750
he's being vulnerable because of this bond.

211
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:12.670
And he has like real affection for it.

212
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:15.550
So he's willing to withstand certain comments.
And,

213
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:19.180
but he's aware that there's a comment he's not going,
Huh?
Yeah,
it's cool.

214
00:12:19.181 --> 00:12:21.280
But he's like listening to them.
I know my politics,

215
00:12:21.281 --> 00:12:24.520
I know what the situation is and I'm only choosing not to say certain things

216
00:12:24.521 --> 00:12:29.110
because out of respect,
this is how um,
arena,
so that's for me,

217
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:31.180
I w I really want it to put,

218
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:35.110
cause obviously in the interracial relationships because of the conversation in

219
00:12:35.111 --> 00:12:36.430
America,
some people think

220
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.930
that your not part of the black community because you're dating a white girl and

221
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.360
not and just kind of get into yeah,
exactly.

222
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.610
And that's such an interesting territory to,

223
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:53.630
so I had to be careful because I did want boys I grew up with like to go yo Nah.

224
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.010
Yeah,
I understand that.
I understand.
And then that's when the trailer came out,

225
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.670
how people that grew up,
we've got you,
I get that he's called pre go,

226
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.860
he's just a good guy and he's just,

227
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.190
and that's what the reaction I was reaching for.

228
00:13:06.191 --> 00:13:08.130
I didn't want him to feel isolated in that sense.

229
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.290
<v 1>And the nice thing for,</v>

230
00:13:09.291 --> 00:13:12.700
to that end is that Jordan kind of structured in this other arc,
uh,

231
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:16.970
for rose to be learning to see everything through his eyes too.

232
00:13:16.971 --> 00:13:21.890
So their relationship comes out of a metropolitan setting where it's not very

233
00:13:21.891 --> 00:13:24.800
unusual to see an interracial couple and then it goes into the suburbs.

234
00:13:24.801 --> 00:13:27.020
It's not specified which city or which suburb,

235
00:13:27.021 --> 00:13:29.780
which makes it scarier because you can't tell yourself that it wouldn't happen

236
00:13:29.781 --> 00:13:34.310
where you live cause it could.
Um,
but the,
um,

237
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.700
when they leave this contacts that they're used to being in and returned to a

238
00:13:37.701 --> 00:13:39.350
context,
it's really familiar to rose.

239
00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:43.490
She starts to look at the world that she's always known in a completely new way,

240
00:13:43.491 --> 00:13:47.270
and she's starting to observe people from without,
um,

241
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.310
with his insight.

242
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.810
And so suddenly the way that her dad is talking sounds weird to her.
He's saying,

243
00:13:53.811 --> 00:13:56.690
my man,
and she's like,
I don't think I've ever heard him say my man.

244
00:13:56.691 --> 00:13:59.990
And he's called,
he said that like 10 times as you got here.

245
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.430
Suddenly there's a bunch of things that she's noticing for the first time.

246
00:14:04.431 --> 00:14:07.790
And so they're,
at least they're partnered in that sense.
She's not saying like,

247
00:14:07.791 --> 00:14:11.120
no,
everyone's being normal.
What are you talking about?
She's like,
this is weird.

248
00:14:11.121 --> 00:14:14.540
They're being weird.
I was so sure that they weren't going to be weird about it.

249
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:18.980
Um,
and you know,
it's subtle stuff but at least roses,

250
00:14:18.981 --> 00:14:21.660
his partner and paying attention to it.
Dan,
you,

251
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.470
I'm curious because you aren't from here and as you mentioned,
like,
you know,

252
00:14:24.471 --> 00:14:26.660
people assume like,
oh,
basketball and stuff like that,

253
00:14:26.661 --> 00:14:30.290
but so much of this takes place,
like,
as you said,

254
00:14:30.291 --> 00:14:32.300
a lot of the terror of it comes from like,
it's a suburb,

255
00:14:32.301 --> 00:14:34.130
it's a very American seeming suburb.

256
00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.860
Is that something that you were just inherently like,
no,

257
00:14:36.861 --> 00:14:41.000
I totally get what's going on here?
Or did you have to do research on suburbs?

258
00:14:41.001 --> 00:14:43.810
Basically?
It just seems like such a culture difference.
Um,
and I,

259
00:14:43.811 --> 00:14:46.090
I just met me and that was like,
he was good at it.

260
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.060
I understand why you are,
this is great.

261
00:14:50.061 --> 00:14:52.050
This is all the information need.
Yeah.

262
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.330
<v 2>Like,
uh,
I had to latch on the,</v>

263
00:14:56.331 --> 00:15:00.790
onto the things that would truthful to me.
And I think there's an,

264
00:15:00.791 --> 00:15:04.160
I do think in terms of England and America,
there are parallels and I feel I'm,

265
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.060
I'm working class and so growing up black working,

266
00:15:07.061 --> 00:15:11.570
working class you you for and I'm black won't class doing a quiet middle class

267
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:12.404
job.

268
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.560
So I I I'm in some rooms that my life wouldn't have me in.

269
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.920
So you fulfill the same role in tones of it's like go into the house we went

270
00:15:25.261 --> 00:15:26.780
into in the film is similar.
Go into uh,

271
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.110
I've been to that house with someone that owns a construction company.

272
00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:31.930
I don't know why I was there.
I don't know how I got there.

273
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.760
<v 3>I really want to get into this.
Yo Yo yo yo yo yo they had like they had a room.</v>

274
00:15:35.761 --> 00:15:39.260
Yeah,
they had a room.
I know this is maybe really normal if you're rich though.

275
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.840
But like they had a room.
Yeah.
Where you just wait to eat light.

276
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.600
There's a room Nan and it's like,
it's really English.
There's not going to eat.

277
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.280
I don't even have,
we have just like a sitting room.
Yeah.
Just like I see.

278
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.030
And when you eat vibes and everything,

279
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.570
they had a room where you wait before you go into the dining room.

280
00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:59.090
A sitting room.
Is that what I it,
yeah,
I'm devastated.

281
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.910
My mother lives and Abby or the crown now obviously because of my job I opened.

282
00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.190
That's wild to me.

283
00:16:05.191 --> 00:16:08.460
Like there's just a room where you stand and wait there for like 10 minutes,

284
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.490
like every day.
And so he's like,
so that was that.

285
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.620
So that's what I'm trying to say.
You

286
00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:13.130
<v 2>Do,</v>

287
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.670
you occupy the same positions within the social ladder and a social structure.

288
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.610
And so that's identified with that in the sense that Chris,

289
00:16:20.611 --> 00:16:23.400
obviously he's a photographer so he's doing something quite autistic.

290
00:16:23.401 --> 00:16:27.900
So that opens a woe to him.
And,
and I think,
I think,
you know,

291
00:16:27.901 --> 00:16:29.720
I think a lot of people go,
I mean this is a debate,

292
00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:32.340
it's happened in England where like they don't want to see any hood dramas like

293
00:16:32.341 --> 00:16:34.980
drums out about working class.
But I think what's really honest,

294
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.440
it's something that was in Atlanta as well,
where he's like,
no,

295
00:16:37.441 --> 00:16:41.850
it's certain people's lives or the fact that you get into really crazy poor

296
00:16:41.851 --> 00:16:45.780
situations and you get into this massive mansion at the same time and you don't

297
00:16:45.781 --> 00:16:48.230
belong in,
even though I love that episode of the Jay.
Yeah,
yeah.

298
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:51.220
You don't belong in the evo spaces anymore because you've tasted that and you

299
00:16:51.221 --> 00:16:53.370
tasted that and it's just going,
I'm in the middle.

300
00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:57.660
And that's why I really identified with Chris is that because of his job and

301
00:16:57.661 --> 00:17:01.230
because of his passion,
he's meets someone,

302
00:17:01.231 --> 00:17:04.710
let grows all open to date,
someone that rose and,

303
00:17:04.711 --> 00:17:07.610
but he's not from that world and these aren't God.
I,

304
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.010
I think a lot of people around the world go free to experience and so,
and,

305
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.410
and you want to tell those stories that resonates internationally and you want

306
00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:16.951
to find the truth,

307
00:17:16.951 --> 00:17:21.390
the international truth as opposed to a specific cause that will help you to,

308
00:17:21.391 --> 00:17:24.610
to layer.
This is the specificity of the story.
You tell it

309
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.400
<v 1>you didn't know each other beforehand.</v>

310
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.340
So there's a logic train to this that follow up.
I hope.

311
00:17:30.341 --> 00:17:32.560
I hope you can follow along.
So one of the things from me,
I was like,

312
00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.230
and this is just partially because we work at Google,
I was like man,

313
00:17:35.231 --> 00:17:39.430
your character must have,
which is like zero digital footprint because you know,

314
00:17:39.431 --> 00:17:43.690
I don't know if anyone's ever been tempted to like Google when they're starting

315
00:17:43.691 --> 00:17:46.280
to date,
but um,
I feel like I'm

316
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.090
<v 3>uh,
I think</v>

317
00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.630
<v 1>thank you.
We're going to avoid this,</v>

318
00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.400
<v 3>the up.
But it's an interesting,
that's an interesting,
that's a very,</v>

319
00:17:54.401 --> 00:17:56.690
we that it's an interesting question and a lot of time thinking about that.

320
00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.390
<v 2>I realize I was dating a lot.
Yeah.
And then what he's going to be like,</v>

321
00:18:00.391 --> 00:18:03.520
cause I'm not on social media and they'll be really frustrated because they

322
00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.470
Google you like that's a thing now everyone googles everybody.

323
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:10.720
<v 3>Well you're a famous actor.
That's not a problem.
Which mean they can Google you.</v>

324
00:18:10.721 --> 00:18:13.340
You have a yes,
but I want to know the personal stuff.
They want to know

325
00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.570
<v 2>two friends and want to know what all that stuff like they want to know.</v>

326
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.180
<v 1>No.
So my question is,
where are you tempted?</v>

327
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:21.540
Did you Google each other before going into,
I'm sorry.
It was not,
yeah,
no,

328
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.960
we've run into this problem a lot.
Doing press for the movie.

329
00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:28.030
There's like a point where the we can't,
no,
I,
I don't know about it,

330
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.730
but it made me,
honestly,
the point in the film made me think about like,
hey,

331
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.120
I was already a fan of his,
because I love skins,

332
00:18:36.121 --> 00:18:40.500
which was originally at a show in the UK and he was in skins and I also loved

333
00:18:40.501 --> 00:18:42.900
his episode of Black Mirror.
And I was a big [inaudible] fan.

334
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.550
It was like a little creepy,
honestly,

335
00:18:44.551 --> 00:18:47.580
the amount that I really respected his work.
And Jordan,

336
00:18:47.581 --> 00:18:49.320
when he told me that it was going to be Daniel,
he was like,

337
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:52.290
it's this actor Daniel Kaluuya.
And he started to describe him and I was like,
no,

338
00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:55.020
no,
no.
I know exactly what you guys,
because after that episode of Black Mirror,

339
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:58.340
I was like,
who is this person?
Because it was so striking and,
and,

340
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:03.210
and beautifully done.
And so I didn't need to do a lot of googling.

341
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:06.750
I think I knew who is Ugandan cause I was curious or I am an English by way of

342
00:19:06.751 --> 00:19:10.960
Uganda in a big way.
Um,
yeah.
I mean yeah.

343
00:19:10.961 --> 00:19:13.010
It's an inappropriate for me to didn't respond kind.

344
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:17.740
<v 3>No,
no,
no.
It's best for you gone.
Right.
I'm just doing the inappropriate points.</v>

345
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.950
No,
cause this is awkward enough.
Yeah.

346
00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:24.100
<v 1>Um,
uh,
but that's how much I knew about you.</v>

347
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.580
<v 2>Uh,
I watched the first season that goes and I thought she was great.</v>

348
00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:28.700
She was so great.
Yeah.

349
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.450
<v 3>She's not good enough to keep up.
Keep watching though.
No,
you wouldn't leave me.</v>

350
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.460
That's how great cause I can invest in.
I was like,
no,
the money.

351
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:38.910
Why is she doing that?
Remember got your conversation about,
I was like,
no,

352
00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:39.920
but she did this thing.
Yeah.

353
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.290
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

354
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.240
And this is the day to day and it's because I've been through those situations.

355
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.690
She did his thing.
It's his thing and then when my friend goes,
but that,

356
00:19:46.691 --> 00:19:47.770
that's what makes it really great.

357
00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.290
That's what makes her really great because you felt it and I was like,
yeah,

358
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.440
I'll call it what Jack.
Oh,
what's it for?
A bit.
And then,

359
00:19:55.441 --> 00:19:57.580
and then I found that she was in it and I was out definitely not watching it

360
00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:01.200
because I found out she was in get up because it would make me to cell phone.

361
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:05.070
I just wanted to meet Alison do I mean and and just,
you know,

362
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.050
can you can kind of take it like the other day I met,

363
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.690
I met chance the rapper was an idiot man.
I just some silly stuff and I was,

364
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.150
I showed him a video of my friend dies and these concert lays,
it makes it weird.

365
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.560
Like do you mean now that I get weird in those situations?

366
00:20:17.561 --> 00:20:22.320
So I try and keep ignorant.
I go,
ah,
Alison,
cool,
love your work.

367
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.170
And then I haven't and I say I keep it moving.

368
00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.120
<v 1>And then we had a long car ride to go.</v>

369
00:20:26.121 --> 00:20:30.650
We went to like a cast or treat too on the water.
And so I was like,

370
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.440
I will drive Daniel.
And he was probably like,
Oh God,

371
00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:38.660
and you're pretty private dude.
But I was,
I mean pretty much,
yeah.

372
00:20:38.661 --> 00:20:41.000
You just went on like a diatribe against social media.

373
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.360
<v 2>Yeah.
No,
it's not even that.
I just don't,
I just don't post publicly.</v>

374
00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.890
<v 1>Yeah,
that was your private,
literally that's the devil</v>

375
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:47.973
<v 3>definition</v>

376
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:53.250
<v 2>because this is being normal.
And then if you'll be in public,
that's an effort.</v>

377
00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.940
That's it.
I got it.

378
00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.250
Got It all out of him and it's now I'm also going to keep it private until you

379
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:02.400
decided to just live out loud,
man.
Live your chairs.

380
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.210
You hit my truth and just be out there.
No,
I just,
I just keep it moving here.

381
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.410
<v 1>We have time for one or two audience questions if anyone wants to line up.
Um,
I,</v>

382
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:18.100
I would love to know just because independent of any of the scarier horror stuff

383
00:21:18.101 --> 00:21:22.030
that happens in this film meeting someone's family is very awkward when you're

384
00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:22.691
in a relationship.

385
00:21:22.691 --> 00:21:27.610
Have you either of you ever had a like a horror story about meeting eat friends,

386
00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:30.910
whatever,
somebody else's like input the important people in their lives?

387
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:35.220
<v 3>Yeah.
It's weird cause it's exact same thing happened to you,
right?
No,
no,
no,
no,</v>

388
00:21:35.221 --> 00:21:38.850
no,
I'm kidding.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I remembered a novel one.
You didn't,

389
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.640
we've been asked this question a lot and it's always disappointing cause neither

390
00:21:41.641 --> 00:21:45.270
of us has very awkward but yeah,
but in number one,
so I had my first girlfriend.

391
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.700
What's the play watching this play now and this is Danny and what cultured 17 no

392
00:21:50.701 --> 00:21:53.570
big deal,
you know is great.
They play at 17 yeah

393
00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.210
<v 2>18 and then a and then I came out and then like,
and then she was like,</v>

394
00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:01.920
she got a text goes no,
she got to take it from a mum.
And it was like,
Oh my God,

395
00:22:01.921 --> 00:22:04.440
my dad's here have died.

396
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.590
Found out that never knew that we would like having a situation.

397
00:22:07.591 --> 00:22:09.240
So at that found that way was go out,

398
00:22:09.241 --> 00:22:13.980
have a mum and then drove to the feet and outside right to pick her up.

399
00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:16.710
And I was like,
what?
What was happening?
Cause Oh my God,
I'm going.

400
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.240
She started crying and stuff.

401
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.190
She goes upstairs and he was just waiting outside looking for like waiting

402
00:22:22.191 --> 00:22:22.910
outside of it.

403
00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.410
<v 3>Let's say she was on,
what did she lie about where she was</v>

404
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.890
<v 2>sheets.
She told her mom because her mom was cool with it,</v>

405
00:22:27.891 --> 00:22:28.820
but the dad wasn't cool with it.

406
00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.390
And then so then I came out and I know she's mixed race

407
00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:35.503
black coffee.

408
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.540
<v 3>No,
I know what that means is she just didn't want,
I've been only in America,</v>

409
00:22:38.541 --> 00:22:42.740
people don't know what that means.
Right.
He's some fucking credit,
one drop rule.

410
00:22:42.741 --> 00:22:46.790
I don't understand this waiver,
but um,
but yeah,
so she was like,
uh,

411
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.170
so she was like,
he was outside

412
00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.050
<v 2>and I was like,
oh,
cool.
And then she had to like,
go ahead.
She goes,
okay,</v>

413
00:22:53.051 --> 00:22:55.450
I'm going to hustle without going into it.
And he just went crazy.

414
00:22:55.451 --> 00:22:58.380
It was like getting a car getting in and I was like,
ah.

415
00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.880
<v 3>Yeah.
That's a good story.
Yeah,
no,
I completely forgot about it.
Oh my God.
Yeah.</v>

416
00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:06.080
I've got nothing really.
It's all been pretty

417
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:07.303
<v 2>Smith.</v>

418
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.230
<v 4>Hi.
Thank you guys so much for coming.
[inaudible] your sweatshirt.
Thank you.</v>

419
00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:18.980
Lemonade all day.
Yep.
So my question is actually for Alison.
Um,

420
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.400
so when girls was coming out,

421
00:23:21.401 --> 00:23:24.310
there was a lot of controversy and conversation of course,

422
00:23:24.311 --> 00:23:25.450
about race and the show.

423
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:29.560
And so it's very interesting to see you now in a film that is so kind of race

424
00:23:29.561 --> 00:23:31.030
forward and really taking it on.

425
00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:35.290
I don't think I've heard kind of what your thoughts were during that
controversy.

426
00:23:35.291 --> 00:23:36.760
Like what were you thinking,

427
00:23:36.761 --> 00:23:40.810
how would you have responded to some of that critique and what do you think that

428
00:23:40.811 --> 00:23:45.811
this movie will have you kind of bringing to future projects in terms of like a

429
00:23:45.861 --> 00:23:48.000
heightened door,
maybe a different sort of a,
yeah,

430
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:51.490
<v 1>racial consciousness.
Thank you for that question.
Um,</v>

431
00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:56.020
I would say that I'm not really interested in,

432
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.170
and this is something that Lena and Jenny also share,
like going forward,

433
00:23:59.171 --> 00:24:03.760
I'm not interested in doing something that is that one dimensional racially,

434
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:08.350
um,
just as like a blanket rule,
but beyond being interested,

435
00:24:08.351 --> 00:24:13.180
it just doesn't feel reflective of my life and the demographics of the people

436
00:24:13.181 --> 00:24:15.430
that I spend time with.
Um,

437
00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.090
the other thing is that I,
um,

438
00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:21.370
this is,
um,

439
00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.130
an issue that I think about a lot and when the show came out and was getting

440
00:24:24.131 --> 00:24:26.050
that criticism,
it was something that I had noticed.

441
00:24:26.051 --> 00:24:29.620
But I also knew that due to how intimate it was for Lena to,

442
00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:33.820
since she basically wrote it all for her to have,
um,

443
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:38.020
tried to write someone else's experience,
she may have failed miserably in that,

444
00:24:38.021 --> 00:24:41.080
could have been just as bad.
So,
um,

445
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.270
I totally thought the criticism was legitimate.
Um,

446
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.610
but I also was like a baby 22 year old who is just trying to figure out what was

447
00:24:48.611 --> 00:24:51.460
happening to me and I wasn't going to like full throated Lee be like,

448
00:24:51.461 --> 00:24:56.110
here's the problem I have with this situation.
But I think she was right.

449
00:24:56.111 --> 00:24:57.490
She wrote,
you know,

450
00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.710
she wrote two characters from each part of her,
you know,

451
00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.080
cultural heritage and that felt like something she had the authority to write.

452
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:06.790
And,
um,

453
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:11.590
everything that I'm currently working on and everything that I intend to do

454
00:25:11.591 --> 00:25:16.060
going forward is,
has to do with a lot of this,
I mean,
with disability,

455
00:25:16.061 --> 00:25:20.320
with race,
with,
uh,
feminism,
all of that.
That's my,

456
00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.850
I actually like live in that,

457
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.880
in those spaces in my free time and all the work that I do extracurricularly has

458
00:25:27.041 --> 00:25:29.950
to do with all of these issues.
I just,

459
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:34.900
I prefer to let the work,
I do speak for itself rather than talk,
talk,

460
00:25:34.901 --> 00:25:39.190
talking about it.
I,
I like listening more and learning because,
um,

461
00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.650
<v 4>that's my job.
Awesome.
Thank you.</v>

462
00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.130
Hi,

463
00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:49.480
I'm Angela Lynn and I'm a really big fan of girls and when I first thank you,

464
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:53.260
okay,
you were going to be and get out.
I was like,
what is Marnie going to do?

465
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:59.210
Feeling like Alison Williams can really fucking act.
Thank you.
Oh,

466
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.273
thank you.

467
00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:06.210
One question that I have is thinking about how you felt as Alison Williams and

468
00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:10.600
as Daniel Kaluuya Kaluuya yeah.
About the film.

469
00:26:10.601 --> 00:26:11.710
So when I left,

470
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:15.370
it was a very visceral experience for me and I actually went home and cried for

471
00:26:15.371 --> 00:26:17.680
like a number of reasons.
Um,

472
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:21.970
but I'm wondering as not as actors,
but like as people,

473
00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:26.920
how did you feel about that film?
And that sounds really flowery,
but I'm sure.

474
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:32.070
<v 2>No,
no,
totally snow flurry tool.
I fell,
I,
it wasn't fun for me.
No,</v>

475
00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:35.390
it was kind of how racism feels like.
Yep.
For me.

476
00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:39.910
[inaudible] I've been there,
I've been up in that place where I'm,
um,

477
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:41.670
I've got so much rage,

478
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:47.600
I've got so rage and it mirrored how my insides are sometimes the last 20

479
00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:51.380
minutes I call it,
I know it.
And I didn't know that in the script.
I didn't,

480
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.090
I knew it,
but I didn't,
I didn't have the words for it as yet.

481
00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.930
But when I watched it and I saw it and I sort of,
and it's like,
yeah,

482
00:26:57.931 --> 00:27:02.120
get this blood because of racist,
this blood and racism,
man,

483
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:07.080
people die every day for it die every day,
but a hundred the law,
you know and it,

484
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:11.430
and every time you see it on the screen get you because that person looks at
you,

485
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.920
the person that's like your Auntie,
that person that's like a cousin

486
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.350
<v 3>go easy.
She just,
no,
I'm not.
I'm,
I'm not.
Say it to him saying that,</v>

487
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.680
hey racist to me.
She's cool.
No,
no,
I just,
I read,
she said she went,

488
00:27:22.681 --> 00:27:25.380
she was very by it.
I'm just saying it's like that's your aunt.

489
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:29.680
That's your though.
That's not,
it's really now I know when people dial out,

490
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.170
<v 2>they ain't no,
ain't no pull back from that mum that's says no son,
you know,</v>

491
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:38.390
there ain't nothing.
And so it felt like,
it felt,
it was a visceral,
it was Kinda,

492
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:42.980
it stayed in me when watching it and I was at mine like this is,
this is,

493
00:27:42.981 --> 00:27:47.981
and that paranoia and it just the arc of the paranoia and not knowing who to

494
00:27:48.741 --> 00:27:51.800
trust and not,
I'm feeling and being in the situation when no one sees you,

495
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:55.690
you know,
can you,
and for whatever reason,
you know,
when someone goes,

496
00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.460
you don't see me,
you can't get it,
can't communicate.

497
00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.510
We speak completely different languages.
Yeah.

498
00:28:00.511 --> 00:28:05.120
We're talking English Josanna and it's like I felt that I'm watching it and it

499
00:28:05.121 --> 00:28:08.630
was,
it was,
it was tough,
but it was entertained at the same time.

500
00:28:08.631 --> 00:28:10.490
So it was quite weird and I was just like,
oh man.

501
00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.670
But then I felt cool cause I was like,
this is very important,
you know,

502
00:28:13.671 --> 00:28:18.470
cause it's about a feeling it as opposed to box office and x,
y,
zed or x,
y,

503
00:28:18.471 --> 00:28:21.170
zed in it.
So I was really proud of Jordan the,

504
00:28:21.171 --> 00:28:24.330
he put his reputation on the line to make the story happen.

505
00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.750
<v 1>Yeah.
I personally,
I also felt um,</v>

506
00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.860
upset after the first time I saw it.
I was excited because it,
it,

507
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.980
I knew it would be noisy and I knew it would be disruptive and that was what we

508
00:28:36.981 --> 00:28:40.820
did it for.
After I watched it,
I was like,
this is as good as it needed to be.

509
00:28:40.821 --> 00:28:41.990
I'm so thrilled.

510
00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.290
I think it will be seen by the people who need to see it and hopefully they'll

511
00:28:45.291 --> 00:28:47.900
see it in theaters with people who don't share their background and they'll

512
00:28:47.901 --> 00:28:51.800
learn a little bit about the way they look at the world.
Um,

513
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:57.530
my experience of playing rose and going through all that she goes through,

514
00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:02.570
um,
is,
was in the moment.
Of course I had to like be her.

515
00:29:02.571 --> 00:29:06.560
So that was one experience.
But then watching it back,
it's,

516
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.920
I feel shame on behalf of a lot of people that I don't feel that I am related to

517
00:29:12.981 --> 00:29:16.190
or that it's my actual legacy.
But just as a general idea,

518
00:29:16.191 --> 00:29:18.890
I feel a lot of shame about it.
And so in that sense,

519
00:29:18.891 --> 00:29:23.891
I feel pride for having breathe life into her so that people can look at her and

520
00:29:24.021 --> 00:29:26.270
her whole family critically.

521
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:31.240
And even if rose feels like she's a victim of something bigger than she is,
um,

522
00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.640
or however you want to look at her eye,
that critical.

523
00:29:34.641 --> 00:29:37.310
I was something that I worked very hard to,

524
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.580
to breathe life into in a way that people could,

525
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:44.970
could a lot of ways about being very vague again.
Um,

526
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.780
but I,
um,

527
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:52.230
I basically worked hard to make people feel a lot of things about my character

528
00:29:52.331 --> 00:29:55.210
that we're going to be maybe uncomfortable for them.
Um,

529
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.430
and I recognize that that was my job in this movie.
And um,

530
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:04.530
my job was to be a support system for Daniel as Chris and,

531
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.130
um,
to help people live through his eyes instead of mine,

532
00:30:09.131 --> 00:30:13.660
which is what they're used to doing.
Um,
and I was very happy to do that,

533
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.120
to do my part.
Great job.
Thanks.

534
00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.210
I think that's a great note to wrap up on.

535
00:30:19.211 --> 00:30:21.940
I think this movie brings a lot of food for thought,

536
00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:24.400
and thank you so much for joining us today.
Thanks for having us.

537
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:26.280
Thank you for your questions.
