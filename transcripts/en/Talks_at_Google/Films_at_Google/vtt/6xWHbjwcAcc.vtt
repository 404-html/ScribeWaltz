00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.590
Hi everyone.
Welcome to toxic Google.

2
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:08.610
My name is Dana Han Klein and today it is my pleasure to welcome Andrew Garfield

3
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:09.720
for 99 homes.

4
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.053
<v 1>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.740
<v 0>Thank you for joining us today.
Oh,
thank you for having me.</v>

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.740
So do you mind telling us a little bit about the film?
Yeah,
sure.
Um,
it's,
um,

7
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:27.341
the,

8
00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:32.050
the 19 nine in the title is an illusion to the 99%.

9
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.980
I think that was the intention of the filmmaker remain Barany anyway.
And um,

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
it basically follows the Nash family and the process of being evicted from the

11
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.570
family home that goes back a few generations and the,

12
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.300
the man of the house,
which is somehow this guy,

13
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.770
I'm trying to get his family back into the,

14
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.800
the homestead and the measures that he is forced to take to,

15
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.750
to do that.
Um,
ah,
Gosh.
Yeah.

16
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.080
It's um,
we were talking earlier and it's,
it's a,

17
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.810
it's a true story.
Weirdly,
you know,

18
00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:21.070
it's not based on any specific person.
You know,
Dennis,

19
00:01:21.071 --> 00:01:25.720
Naf doesn't exist in the literal sense,
but I think in a symbolic sense,

20
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.760
he is a representative.

21
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.920
Him and his family are all representative of what so many different families in

22
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.520
our country.
I say our country,
despite my accent,
um,

23
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.980
which kind of betrays the fact that I was born here in California,

24
00:01:41.981 --> 00:01:45.920
in Los Angeles,
so don't challenge.
Um,

25
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.821
so yeah,

26
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:52.821
so it representative of a struggle that feels pretty endemic in our culture

27
00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:59.900
right now.
Um,
this disparity that we were experiencing,
um,

28
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.030
between the rich and the poor,
the haves and the have nots.
Um,

29
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.470
and I hope,
you know,

30
00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:09.100
the hope is that this film is going to be a small step in the conversation back

31
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:12.460
towards the knowledge,
the understanding.

32
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.890
We'll just remembering because I think we all,

33
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.090
I mean the Internet and what you guys do here at Google is the perfect example

34
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:23.740
of connectivity.
While not perfect,
might be an imperfect example of connectivity,

35
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.900
which we'll maybe get into later.
But,
um,
but,
but you know,

36
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.270
just to remember that we all really need each other.
And,
uh,
the system,

37
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.300
the current economic social system that has been created and the culture that's

38
00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:44.650
been created by us that were all willfully participating in on a moment to

39
00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:49.060
moment basis is a system that is setting people against each other constantly.

40
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.300
And,
um,
what Dennis Nash experiences,

41
00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:56.830
the character that I play is that the only way that he can put food in his

42
00:02:56.831 --> 00:03:01.831
child's mouth and put a over his kid's head is if he betrays his fellow man.

43
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.990
If he tramples on his fellow man,

44
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.610
that's a messed up system that I don't like being a part of.
I don't like,

45
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.540
I don't like participating in,
in that culture.
Um,

46
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.160
and like we were talking about,

47
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:19.810
we got to know each other a little bit earlier and,
uh,
she's really lovely.
Um,

48
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.240
from my,
from my perspective very well,

49
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.070
we both have to say that for the purposes of the cameras,

50
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.260
but I'm nowhere near too.
But,
um,

51
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.290
but we are actively participating by,

52
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.250
by going well.
Yeah,
no.
Yeah.
That's just the way the world works at this point,

53
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:39.821
isn't it?
Yeah.

54
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.610
The haves have and the have nots stone and the rich are getting richer and the

55
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:45.700
poor are getting poorer.
What can I do about it?
Well,

56
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.360
or sometimes plenty we can do about it and it gets worse

57
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.010
<v 2>that we're not even participating.
You know,</v>

58
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:53.980
we don't know that there's anything do participate in yes.

59
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.090
And therefore does it sort of guilt by ignorance,

60
00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.440
<v 0>you know?
You know,
that's such a,</v>

61
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.880
I love that you said that because it makes me think of different oppressive

62
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:05.830
regimes that we know through our history.

63
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:07.780
Like the one that comes to me because of my,

64
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.900
my Jewish ancestry is the Nazi regime.

65
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.870
I think we all know what that regime was about.
Um,

66
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.220
and it was very clearly in oppressive.
Um,
you know,
it was like,

67
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.800
you guys are subhuman,
so we're going to exterminate you.

68
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.560
We're just going to do it.
And so,
and we're not sorry.
Um,

69
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.430
the regime that we're under now,
as you just said,

70
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:30.580
there's this insidious thing where we don't know we are being tricked.

71
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.640
We don't know we're being treated as commodities or as just be a good consumer

72
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.220
and,
and shut the hell up.
Um,

73
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.260
so there's something even more twisted cause it's not like we're going to burn

74
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:47.890
you in,
in the,
in the gas chamber or you're not annoying but new.
Again,
you know,

75
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:50.110
we're gonna we're going to gas you and then just bend your body.

76
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.270
We're actually going to slowly starve view and not allow you to access the basic

77
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:58.480
human needs that you,
that you have.

78
00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.520
<v 2>Well not only that,</v>

79
00:04:59.521 --> 00:05:02.620
but we're going to put this kind of very tempting lifestyle or,

80
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.260
or way to achieve these needs and then just kind of Yank it out.

81
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.330
The American lie.
I mean the American dream.
Um,
no,
I mean as you said,

82
00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:15.240
there's no one dentist and ask,
but there are thousands of dentists,

83
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.390
Nash families or Nash families and this is kind of,
for me,

84
00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:19.710
it was one of the first times where it's like,
yes,

85
00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:22.890
you realize that this is going on at a basic level.
You read the news,

86
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:25.980
you see whatever.
But this was a way to connect with it.
That was like,

87
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.700
I was so upset and stressed watching this film and I mean,

88
00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:31.980
that is a compliment and that I was like,
oh my God,

89
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:33.840
I don't know what I would do in this scenario.

90
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.360
And I don't know what would happen.

91
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:40.710
There was just like such a desperation to the situation they were in that was

92
00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:43.670
just so frustrating to watch as an audience member and be like,
what?
So for,

93
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.740
I mean,
for you,
what was that like when you go,
you kind of go,
yes,

94
00:05:46.741 --> 00:05:48.390
so what are the options?
Right.
It's like

95
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:49.130
<v 0>the,</v>

96
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.130
my son starves and I stopped when my mother starves or I become a very active

97
00:05:56.121 --> 00:05:56.954
participant in the,

98
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.240
and I started evicting people myself and justify it.
You know,
that's,

99
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.830
that's one option.
And uh,
and,
and uh,

100
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.410
and then you kind of go,
well,
in order to do that,

101
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:15.050
I have to not feel,
in order to do that,

102
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:18.140
I have to not look people in the eye.

103
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.170
Because if I look you in the eye as I'm kicking you out of your house,

104
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.570
I'm not gonna be able to live with myself.

105
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.050
If I do happen to catch a glimpse of your eye while I'm doing this,

106
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.110
I've got to go home and I've got to have at least a six pack of beer and a

107
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:33.140
massive joint and check the hell out.

108
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.890
I've got to numb myself out in order to go back and do it again tomorrow.

109
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.390
Um,
so,

110
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.640
so that was part of my experience and I got to go to Florida and hang out with a

111
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:48.320
bunch of families and people that this has happened to.

112
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.470
And they are all so devastated and hurt and betrayed.

113
00:06:55.281 --> 00:07:00.140
They've been betrayed by the country.
They've been betrayed by the land,

114
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.730
the promised them a certain basic needs.

115
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.480
And so many of them have alcohol problems and drug problems and have had their

116
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:16.481
children taken away to foster care and the lives have literally been

117
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.860
destroyed.
Yeah.
From,
from the inside out.
And,
uh,

118
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.390
I got a text from my friend Rick today who's one of who's one of the guys that I

119
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:30.110
met with.
So it's,

120
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.170
it's still feels very close to me and I'm so glad that he did because it's given

121
00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:36.110
me the
remembering how

122
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.470
the look in these guys' eyes,
the betrayal,
the anger,

123
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:47.190
the rage,
the cell that leads to this self destruction is,
uh,

124
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.770
something that I hope,
you know,
I'm an actor.
You know,
I'm an actor.

125
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.520
I'm not going and putting people in homes and building homes and whatever.

126
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:57.650
I'm an actor.
That's what I'm here to do.

127
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.980
So I hope that this story

128
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.850
is a small little step in the conversation back towards real interconnectedness,

129
00:08:07.851 --> 00:08:12.110
real community,
not Facebook community,

130
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:17.440
but like being with each other and really like remembering we need each other in

131
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:20.810
a real way.
And so yeah,

132
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.060
<v 2>I think,</v>

133
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.680
I think there's definitely a sense of kind of humanity to the story that it

134
00:08:26.681 --> 00:08:28.150
reminds you and it again,
it is,
there's,

135
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.490
there's a ton of moral ambiguity because as you said,
you know,

136
00:08:30.491 --> 00:08:32.410
your character goes through this thing where it's like,
well,

137
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.210
when we all do the same for our families,
you know,

138
00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:37.630
if you were given the choice to save your family at the expense of other people

139
00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:40.780
or you know,
just be one of them,

140
00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:42.890
I think a lot of people would do what he did and,

141
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.650
and kind of compromise their original moral compass.

142
00:08:47.651 --> 00:08:52.630
And I don't think that necessarily the character starts out as a greedy person.

143
00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:54.550
You know,
it's just like self preservation.

144
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.180
But there is kind of an arc where it's like,
well,
what,

145
00:08:57.181 --> 00:09:00.840
how much is just like taking care of yourself and how much is going above and

146
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:04.980
beyond.
And I think that there's a temptation to,

147
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:07.590
once we're kind of at a certain level,
just be like,
oh,
well what's,

148
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:10.230
what's on the other side of that?
You know,
what's,
what's the 1%,

149
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.410
what are they the perfect word.
Yeah.

150
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:17.910
And so I think for me,
watching the film,
it was,
it was like you,
you did this,

151
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:21.270
you had this really tough task where it's like,
well,
we want to like you,

152
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.460
but you're also doing things that

153
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.880
we can link to it.
So,
I mean,
was that challenging for you to kind of keep this,

154
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.000
hold on to this kind of core or,
or did you go,

155
00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:35.250
that's where this needs to go and I need to kind of let go of that.

156
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.740
<v 0>Gosh,
wow.
How do I own so that,
I mean,</v>

157
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:45.650
we betray ourselves every day.
Um,
I portray myself every day.
I,

158
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:50.490
I do things that are not in line with who I am every day.
I,
um,

159
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.390
um,
so it's not,
it's not hard to get into small ways,
you know,

160
00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.980
I'm not saying like,
I'm going to go,
I haven't murdered anyone,
you know,

161
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.900
in the last 32 years of my life.
But,
uh,
but I played track record,

162
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.440
but you know,
like in small ways,
I compromise myself.

163
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:14.530
I do things that are not coming from that deep in integrated place.

164
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.790
And,
uh,
because I'm asked to in order to be liked,

165
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:24.740
in order to be socially acceptable,
in order to be a good boy,

166
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.240
in order to be successful in order to be accepted.

167
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.740
And I think that's right now anyway,
how,

168
00:10:33.741 --> 00:10:38.741
I'm kind of relating to where Dennis is and that question of what do we do,

169
00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:44.150
how would we do,
what would we do in that situation?

170
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.320
And maybe we are already already in that situation or have been and we have made

171
00:10:48.321 --> 00:10:52.310
certain choices that have compromised something deeper and have compromised

172
00:10:52.311 --> 00:10:53.970
someone else,
um,

173
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:59.080
in a negative way that may be we've been ignoring and not looking at.

174
00:10:59.121 --> 00:11:01.310
And that's the other thing about this,
this film is

175
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.820
it's a part of society and as a part of our culture that we really don't want to

176
00:11:07.821 --> 00:11:12.380
look at.
I've of course,
because who wants to look at people in pain?

177
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.560
It's really hard to do because then we feel empathy and then we feel sad and no

178
00:11:17.871 --> 00:11:20.630
one likes to feel sad.
Although after seeing inside out,

179
00:11:20.631 --> 00:11:25.400
I hopes people start to realize the value of sadness and the beauty of sadness.

180
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:31.010
Um,
I certainly was reminded of it.
Um,
these people saw inside out

181
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.550
<v 2>these people how can see,
um,</v>

182
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.520
so the,
so,
yeah.
So then,
so then,

183
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:43.380
and then in feeling all those emotions and feeling that empathy in that

184
00:11:43.381 --> 00:11:47.070
connectedness to your fellow man,
then you go,
Oh shit,
I've got to do something.

185
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.220
That means I've got to quit my job at Google.

186
00:11:50.221 --> 00:11:52.500
That means I'm going to stop being on the line all the time.

187
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:54.220
That means I've like,
got to live my life

188
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.120
<v 0>and I'd like deeper way.
How am I going to do that?
Like,
and that's like,</v>

189
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.490
this is just me.
I'm talking about.
I don't ever,
I don't work at Google,
but,

190
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.590
but like,
you know,
it's a challenge.
It's always a challenge too.

191
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:12.040
It's like,
it's,
it's scary.
It's scary to look at.
So,
but,
but hopefully,
again,

192
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:16.360
this film is,
is something that we'll,
we'll,
we'll outrage people like,

193
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:17.830
outraged,
like outrage.

194
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:22.831
Do I think like it made you incredibly angry that man can be so inhumane to,

195
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.620
to that fellow men.
Yeah.
Um,
so I,

196
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.400
I hope that other people have so many,

197
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.300
everyone sees it just in case they feel the same way and they go,
wait a minute,

198
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.830
how can I do something different?

199
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.920
<v 2>I think it's,
it's definitely a conversation opener.</v>

200
00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:42.130
It's a reminder because it is something that,
again,
we know what's going on,

201
00:12:42.131 --> 00:12:45.760
but it's not in your face anymore necessarily.
And,
and it's also like,

202
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:48.400
I don't think there's necessarily an understanding of how it happened,
you know,

203
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:52.270
we all know it happened vaguely,
but it's like,
oh,
this is,

204
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:56.320
this is how it actually happens and this is how it affects just somebody who's

205
00:12:56.321 --> 00:12:58.150
not trying to buy a million dollar mansion or whatever.

206
00:12:58.151 --> 00:13:01.330
Just somebody trying to like keep their home.
That's right.
Um,
so what,

207
00:13:01.331 --> 00:13:02.770
so what brought you to the project?

208
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:07.480
Because it's clearly like a very passionate role for you and it's a tough one.

209
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.240
It was a challenging one,
but I think all these things,

210
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.400
<v 0>I think as all these things that you're saying,
um,</v>

211
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.990
I feel uncomfortable in the,
in us,
in our culture,
I don't even feel right.

212
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:23.360
I don't feel,
uh,
happy,
joyous and free.

213
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.700
Let's put it that way,
unless I'm missing a Pixar movie.
Um,
you know,

214
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.510
it's really,
it's,
it's,

215
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:33.320
I find it hard to seek out that very soulful experience in the culture as it

216
00:13:33.321 --> 00:13:33.771
stands.
It,

217
00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:38.030
that doesn't feel like very common when it comes to the center of our culture.

218
00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:42.290
So I have to search a lot and I have to find my own,
my own way to it.

219
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.960
It's,
when I read this,
it was,
it,
it really hit me in this really deep way.

220
00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:49.130
And I got to page thirsty,

221
00:13:49.131 --> 00:13:53.750
which was when my family is evicted and I just was in,
I,

222
00:13:53.751 --> 00:13:58.430
it taught me a part,
like I was just bawling my eyes out and I never,
I'm not,

223
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.740
I was raised in a middle class family.
My parents were working class and they,

224
00:14:03.741 --> 00:14:07.690
and my father reboot the American lie and,
uh,

225
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.820
and was so as beautifully aspirational and wanted to provide a better life for

226
00:14:13.941 --> 00:14:17.480
me and my brother and put better in quotation marks if you didn't know what

227
00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:18.650
those were.
Um,

228
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:22.910
so what do I know about being evicted?

229
00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:27.940
But I did feel this Willy Loman ish fear pervading the household.

230
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:33.530
This like what if it all falls away and,
and,
and is this enough,

231
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.470
that thing of like,
what about a bigger house?
What about a bigger thing?

232
00:14:36.471 --> 00:14:41.330
What about a big a Mac?
What about a big,
a big Mac?
What about a big uh,
nuggets?

233
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.570
<v 2>Oh,
it's the,
would you like fries with that?</v>

234
00:14:43.571 --> 00:14:47.680
And like I don't eat fries but I want them,
well no,
we need them.
You know,

235
00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.440
you can,
what is it like a hundred chicken nuggets you can buy now?

236
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.160
The a hundred Doug challenge

237
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:57.980
<v 0>that's happened.
This is where we've got to bigger,
more,
more and more,
you know,</v>

238
00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:01.490
and like,
wait,
no,
we had all the,

239
00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:05.150
and all the abundance or the abundance in our culture is being held by this.

240
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:07.910
Like Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump and his,

241
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.360
he's saying we don't have any more getting the foreigners out of the country.

242
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.300
We don't have any more while he's holding his billions of dollars.

243
00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:18.410
It's just insane.
It's all this thing.
All this stuff is in the culture.

244
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:22.250
It's in me.
And I'm just like,
I don't know,
what do I do?
I'm an actor.

245
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.020
I don't know what I'm going to change the world.
But um,
but,

246
00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.110
but I read the script and I was like,
well this,
this could be a,

247
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.140
this could be my me doing my bit for the time being and shedding light on a

248
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.730
situation that makes me really,

249
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:43.250
really sad and really angry and it makes me want to need to do something.

250
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.150
So I act

251
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.450
you're doing like the becoming self deprecating with the whole acting thing.

252
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:51.500
But um,
you know,

253
00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:56.620
and that's the other thing that the film talks about is that not one person is

254
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.580
going to change the world.
It does not going to,

255
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:00.620
it's not going to take a fucking stupid,
sorry,

256
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:04.520
I'm going to take a superhero is not going to come down and change everything.

257
00:16:04.521 --> 00:16:05.360
It's going to be one man.

258
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:08.180
It's going to be each and every one of us doing our extraordinary thing,

259
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.890
whatever that happens to be,
whether it's gardening,
masonry,
the acting,

260
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.010
you know,
googling stuff.

261
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.340
But it takes everyone to bring their gifts to the culture.

262
00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:24.341
And I think this is something that we've not been reminded of in a long time.

263
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.900
And a community that,
that idea of true,

264
00:16:26.901 --> 00:16:29.600
true community and what that means.

265
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.420
And I think we were talking about this earlier,
right?
She's like,
we are,

266
00:16:32.421 --> 00:16:34.400
we are community that's constantly connected,

267
00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:38.360
but we are not necessarily like connected on a deeper level all the time.

268
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.170
You know,
you know what your friends are doing because they posted about it.

269
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.310
That doesn't mean you asked your friends what they're doing and how they're

270
00:16:43.311 --> 00:16:46.280
doing.
Um,
and I think it's a lot of bits,

271
00:16:46.281 --> 00:16:49.040
like it has to be in your face sometimes because like you said,

272
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:51.230
we don't want to look people in the eye and feel that.

273
00:16:51.231 --> 00:16:54.920
So we sit and watch a movie instead.
But then we'd go,
Oh man,

274
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:59.600
like I have to feel all of this and now what do I do with that?
And so,
you know,

275
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.450
it's leading to a conversation where it's like,

276
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.810
let's not forget about these things because that's how they happen in the first

277
00:17:05.811 --> 00:17:08.420
place.
Let's not be afraid of pain.

278
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.400
Let's not be afraid of our personal pain,
our collective pain.
You know,

279
00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.390
what's happening with black lives matters,
black,
black lives matter.

280
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.410
And with everything that's happening in the country with the race,
divide,

281
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.530
the poverty divide with the gay rights movement,

282
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:28.640
these are all attempts to go,
let's look,

283
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.730
let's really look and deal with the woundedness in the,

284
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.220
in the culture that we've created.

285
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.710
And only then will we start rioting.
And until then we will riot,

286
00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.060
um,
peacefully for the most part.
Thank God.
Um,
beautifully.

287
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:48.950
Um,
so yeah,
it's uh,
yeah,
I don't know.

288
00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.750
<v 2>It's awesome.
Um,</v>

289
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.260
well now I feel silly asking about the film details,
but no,
no,
no.

290
00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:01.820
It's one thing to me,
I think we've talked about briefly is this kind of,
again,

291
00:18:01.821 --> 00:18:05.810
it's the wanting more,
it's,
it's,
it's also the sense of temptation.

292
00:18:05.811 --> 00:18:09.950
I think Michael Shannon's character is their sense of temptation where he's
like,

293
00:18:09.951 --> 00:18:14.160
I'm going to pray upon the week.
And he's,
he plays the,
a realtor in the film and,

294
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.360
and one of the people who did capitalize on this kind of crazy housing boom,

295
00:18:17.361 --> 00:18:20.870
and he's still leads these like semi glamorous life.

296
00:18:20.871 --> 00:18:23.630
And I think your character definitely kind of falls into that.

297
00:18:23.631 --> 00:18:27.950
So what was it like working,
you know,
working with him on that?
Um,

298
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.830
<v 0>yeah.
Um,
well he's a powerful presence.</v>

299
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:38.890
Um,
so it was great.
It was really challenging for me,
uh,

300
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.160
to play with him.
You know,
it's like I love,
I,

301
00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:48.520
I struggle to play ping pong with people who are not as good as me.
Um,

302
00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:53.300
I don't play very well,
but when someone's better than me,
I really like I find,

303
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.280
I find,
I find things that I didn't know I can do it.
So I love that.

304
00:18:57.281 --> 00:18:58.480
I love being pushed in that way.

305
00:18:58.481 --> 00:19:03.040
So He of course he's this brilliant that goes for Laura Dunn and Norma Lomax as

306
00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:05.080
well,
you know.
Um,
so doing that with,

307
00:19:05.081 --> 00:19:08.980
with Michael specifically was awesome and the complexity of it because no one's

308
00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:12.040
happy.
He's not happy.
The guy that has it all.

309
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:17.010
And then Susan and then some,
and once more has,
is,

310
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:21.850
is trying to fill a bucket with a hole in the bottom of it with stuff.

311
00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.830
And as we all know,
and I'm,
I forget a lot of the time,

312
00:19:26.831 --> 00:19:31.750
is that stuff is not gonna fill that,
that void.
Um,

313
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.430
uh,
status,
power,
money,
all the fame rich,

314
00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.420
like the riches.
That's,
that's,
that's,
that's the mirror.

315
00:19:40.421 --> 00:19:44.650
That's the American dream stuff.
The really kind of gets in the way of,
of,
um,

316
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.240
of the stuff actually feeds us.
It's,
um,
it's,
it's Mcdonald's stuff.

317
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.480
It's a,
yeah,
it's kind of making us sicker.
Um,
so,

318
00:19:52.481 --> 00:19:55.930
and I think what Michael Does so brilliantly is he expresses that in a very

319
00:19:55.931 --> 00:19:58.990
subtle way and you kind of,
he gives a wink,

320
00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.280
he just kind of says he's asking to be saved himself.
So if we,

321
00:20:03.281 --> 00:20:05.980
if we can all find it in our hearts to,
um,

322
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.280
to somehow remember the Donald Trump is asking for saving from his own greed

323
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:16.470
and,
um,
insanity,
then I,
I think,
uh,
um,
we,

324
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.150
we can really,
we can really rescue him from himself.
Um,
but that,

325
00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.350
but that's the thing is like,
it was lost.
Like even like,
I don't think,

326
00:20:23.351 --> 00:20:26.770
I don't think the system as it stands is serving either,
neither party.

327
00:20:26.771 --> 00:20:30.500
Everyone's in prison.
In some way,
you know,
um,
the,
the,

328
00:20:30.501 --> 00:20:35.050
the 1% of the world are imprisoned in the gated communities with barbed wire

329
00:20:35.051 --> 00:20:38.890
fencing around it,
just like those who are in actual penitentiary,
he saw,

330
00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:44.290
you know,
so,
um,
so yeah,
but exploring that was really,

331
00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.880
it was really painful and,
and you know,

332
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:50.920
thank God it was with these kind of great actors.

333
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:56.290
<v 2>Um,
well there are two characters who actually kind of reject that vision.
Um,
and,</v>

334
00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.220
and Lauren and knows characters like your family.
They don't necessarily,

335
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:05.120
they're satisfied to a degree with,
you know,
what the characters have.
Yeah.

336
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.370
Um,
and there's,
you know,

337
00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:10.150
there's this wonderful moment where we're know who plays her son just rejects,

338
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.320
rejects it all,
and he goes,
he doesn't want that.
He wants his home.

339
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.120
He can feel he has the,

340
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:20.790
<v 0>he has the untarnished spirit that,
that nose.
Oh no,</v>

341
00:21:20.791 --> 00:21:23.190
that's not what this is about.
It doesn't even know it consciously.

342
00:21:23.191 --> 00:21:25.980
It's just that doesn't feel good.
This feels good.
Like,

343
00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.080
just being together feels good.
I don't care where we are,

344
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:33.180
whether we're in a motel,
a house,
the forest,
homeless.

345
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:37.450
I just want you here.
I just want,
you know,

346
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.870
real community and family and love.

347
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.060
<v 2>I think,
I think that's absolutely,</v>

348
00:21:42.061 --> 00:21:46.160
but your character does a lot of things for his family,
but I,
you know,
do you,

349
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.030
do you think it's kind of for his family,

350
00:21:48.031 --> 00:21:51.060
but maybe sometimes at their expense and also,
yeah,

351
00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:54.030
it's this kind of like he does,
he doesn't tell them a lot of things.

352
00:21:54.031 --> 00:21:56.850
He's not honest with them,
which creates a divide.

353
00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:01.860
<v 0>Totally shame.
Yeah.
There's a lot of shame in the behavior that,</v>

354
00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:02.220
that,

355
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:07.220
that my character is forced into in order to provide.

356
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.480
But then the question arises,
what,
um,
what is that person providing?
Um,

357
00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.620
he's definitely not providing a safe home is definitely providing intimacy is

358
00:22:16.621 --> 00:22:20.970
definitely not providing,
um,
a role model of compassion,

359
00:22:20.971 --> 00:22:23.040
empathy and love his providing

360
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:30.070
a bigger house and a bigger pool and less time with his dad.
And,

361
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.320
uh,
and yeah,
no,
it's interesting and it's,
it is beautiful that,

362
00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:37.170
that the mother and the son,
uh,
you know,

363
00:22:37.171 --> 00:22:40.950
the feminine and the kind of the innocent,
pure,

364
00:22:40.951 --> 00:22:45.570
innocent in the story or the other,
the emotional touchstone,

365
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.360
the kind of the ethical core is held in,

366
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:52.410
of course the woman because that's just the way of the world,

367
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.660
the Feminine Intelligence.

368
00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:00.090
And then this kind of pure intelligence.
They know this,

369
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.620
this child like vision of the world that,
that just knows,
knows what,

370
00:23:03.621 --> 00:23:07.480
what's warm and knows what's cold and those where he's meant to be.
Yeah.

371
00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.410
<v 2>Um,
I think there's,
I told you I'd bring this up.
There's a,</v>

372
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.190
there's a scene and a moment where he just,

373
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:17.980
it's this sense of shame and he sinks so low and it's willing to literally

374
00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:22.170
dealing shit too,
you know,
to do what he thinks he needs to do for his,

375
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.730
it's literally,
there's papers.
Um,
literally,
yeah,

376
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.990
I wish I was kidding.
Um,
but it's,

377
00:23:29.991 --> 00:23:34.060
it's heartbreaking and it was really distressing to watch this person,

378
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.690
but also in,
at that point,
it's very inspiring to be like,
you know what?

379
00:23:37.691 --> 00:23:39.970
This person isn't going to ask for a handout,

380
00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:44.220
they're going to do the grossest thing I've seen on film in a while.

381
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:46.040
Um hmm.
In

382
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.910
<v 0>order to kind of build this honest life for themselves at that point.
Um,</v>

383
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.590
so what was that like for you?

384
00:23:51.591 --> 00:23:54.650
Just kind of tapping into that moment because for me that was a very pivotal

385
00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.130
point.
Um,

386
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.450
you also just say it was gross.

387
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.080
I think what you said is so accurate about he doesn't want handouts.

388
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:14.140
And the majority of the families that I met while in Florida was totally willing

389
00:24:15.591 --> 00:24:18.020
to work.
They were actually,
in fact desperate to work.

390
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.210
They wanted to be employed.
They weren't,

391
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.940
they were not loafers.
They will not lazy.
They were not looking for handouts.

392
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:32.030
They were burning up inside because they weren't being given an opportunity to,

393
00:24:32.031 --> 00:24:36.950
um,
to even begin to be a man.

394
00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.560
The,
they had been stripped of all dignity in that respect.
Um,

395
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:47.420
so I think in that moment
there's real weird pride in it.

396
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:52.340
That's why I experienced it was there was,

397
00:24:52.341 --> 00:24:56.120
it was a real moment of showing up for yourself and saying,
I will shovel shit.

398
00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.140
I will,
I will do anything in order to,
to,

399
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:07.930
to make sure the ones I love have protection and survive.

400
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.400
Um,
and then if we get possible viable,
maybe we'll try and live a little as well.

401
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.200
Um,
so yeah,
no,
that moment was actually a,

402
00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.010
a nice turning point for me in terms of filming because I didn't expect it to be

403
00:25:19.011 --> 00:25:22.920
like that.
I expected it to be pretty,
you know,
but this,

404
00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:26.890
but there's some kind of an,
there's some kind of something,
you know,

405
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.930
there's something vital about going into the shit.
You know,
it's,
it's,

406
00:25:30.931 --> 00:25:33.770
it's kind of the,
the sadness,
joy thing.

407
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.540
It's like I can't get to the joy unless I really go down.

408
00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.660
It's like it was Louis Ck did something on a talk show with,

409
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.080
I think it was with Conan and it was about our small phones.
Did you get,

410
00:25:45.081 --> 00:25:49.640
anyone will see,
and he's talking about,
he's talking about,

411
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:50.420
um,

412
00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:55.420
the addiction he has to being connected and how he's on the freeway.

413
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:56.870
And it's,
um,
you know,

414
00:25:56.871 --> 00:26:00.740
there's lots of traffic and he's bored and he gets that little tingle of deep

415
00:26:00.741 --> 00:26:01.310
grief.

416
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:04.490
So he goes through his phone to try and like see who's liked a picture of his

417
00:26:04.491 --> 00:26:07.970
dog or whatever.
And just to kind of allay that feeling of grief.

418
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.020
And then he caught himself doing it and he pulls over onto the side of the road

419
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:17.590
and he just stops and he lets himself be with that feeling and the way he says

420
00:26:18.261 --> 00:26:21.980
it is hilarious.
So I'm saying in a very earnest and sincere way,
so I'm sorry.

421
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.930
So just go and look at the Lucy case version after this.
And he's just like,

422
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:28.610
he just started like bawling.

423
00:26:28.611 --> 00:26:32.090
It just starts like crying his eyes out and it's like this,

424
00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:36.350
like this well of grief that he hadn't been in tune with for so long.

425
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.850
And then he,
he,

426
00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:41.900
he said he felt this genuine sense of like pure joy,

427
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.470
real joy and not the of joy that comes from someone liking a dog picture.
Um,

428
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.270
yeah.
So it's that,
it was that for me,
it was like I just cleaned fucking shit.

429
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:55.680
And now I get to go home and play with my son.
Like that's what the feeling was.

430
00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.640
<v 2>I think it's kind of earning those emotions,
you know,
earning,</v>

431
00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:02.210
earning the highs by going through the list,
singing for your supper as they say.

432
00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:06.500
Yeah.
Um,
so we'll take audience questions in a moment if anyone wants to line up.

433
00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:08.330
Uh,
so I mean,

434
00:27:08.331 --> 00:27:11.690
what would you say was by what was the most challenging part of this role?

435
00:27:11.691 --> 00:27:16.040
I mean,
the whole thing itself is,
is clearly
a tough one.

436
00:27:16.041 --> 00:27:20.740
And it took out a big,
big,
big thing to tackle.
But yeah,

437
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.840
<v 0>the most challenging part,</v>

438
00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:27.940
to be honest,
I think the,
the,

439
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:32.990
the best Paul and the most challenging part was having had proper time with

440
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:38.160
families who have been through it and knowing the,
the,

441
00:27:38.161 --> 00:27:42.310
the grief and pain of it so,
so intimately.
And then you go,
oh boy,

442
00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:48.090
how am I going to represent this in a way that's authentic and truthful and

443
00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.390
doesn't compromise the experience of these people,

444
00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.570
these noble souls that are,

445
00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:01.390
that have their dignity stripped away by the system wherein,
um,
so yeah,

446
00:28:01.391 --> 00:28:03.220
that was really,
yeah,
it was the whole thing really.

447
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.060
Obviously I kind of woke up with that.
Oh Gosh.
Pressure,

448
00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:11.110
beautiful pressure everyday cause it's that pressure kind of provided meaning

449
00:28:11.111 --> 00:28:14.470
for me everyday showing up and it's kind of maybe a responsibility to kind of

450
00:28:14.471 --> 00:28:16.340
represent this as accurately.

451
00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:19.540
Would you say that's also the most rewarding part of this whole,
funnily enough,

452
00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.950
there we go.
The,

453
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.250
the the most difficult part is the most rewarding part and them in the deepest

454
00:28:24.251 --> 00:28:27.720
pain.
Is that the highest joy as far as I know.
Yeah.

455
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:32.350
<v 2>Thank you.
Thank you.
I'll turn it over to the audience.
Um,
hi.</v>

456
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:36.990
<v 3>I like to see a screening of your video of your movie last week and it was</v>

457
00:28:36.991 --> 00:28:39.750
really great.
Um,
there's a lot of emotional scenes.

458
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.320
So what seem do you think was the most challenging for you to film?

459
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:47.310
<v 0>Um,
their,
their eviction?
Probably was a</v>

460
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:53.370
very difficult and,
and it was,
it was,
it was cool.
I mean,
I say cool.

461
00:28:53.371 --> 00:28:55.290
It was really rewarding to,

462
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.290
to shoot the film because remain Barany the,
the,

463
00:28:59.291 --> 00:29:03.060
the director does a lot of work with non actors for the most part.

464
00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.070
And I knew that he was going to be,

465
00:29:05.071 --> 00:29:09.330
he was going to be employing nonactors for a lot of the smaller roles when in

466
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:11.550
the sequence is what I'm,
when I started evicting people,

467
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.270
they were just regular people off the street and some of who had been through

468
00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:19.230
this very thing.
So it was very emotionally visceral and it was just really,

469
00:29:19.231 --> 00:29:20.700
really,
um,
I dunno,

470
00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:25.690
added an element of reality and that life,
it was really cool.
So I,

471
00:29:25.691 --> 00:29:28.200
I kind of said,
well,
if you're going to hire a non actors,

472
00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:32.760
I need to be a non-actor as well.
And I actually,
a lot of it,

473
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.580
like that whole sequence was a totally improvised.
Um,

474
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.720
and Bobby and big house gave a DP kind of just followed us around with his

475
00:29:39.721 --> 00:29:41.470
camera.
And,
uh,

476
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:45.670
so that was another really rewarding and challenging part was keeping the,

477
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:51.540
keeping the reality or the story alive because we really didn't use this script

478
00:29:51.761 --> 00:29:52.594
all that.

479
00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.893
<v 4>Thank you.</v>

480
00:29:56.310 --> 00:30:01.260
<v 2>Hi.
So thank you for coming.
Uh,
so my question is,</v>

481
00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:06.330
you mentioned how it's important to recognize that there are these problems in

482
00:30:06.331 --> 00:30:10.380
our society and you talked about how you visited,
visited these people.

483
00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.900
Um,
so I was wondering how,
how do you keep from,
from feeling guilty,

484
00:30:15.901 --> 00:30:17.520
I guess,
about having,
you know,

485
00:30:17.521 --> 00:30:20.790
the things that we do and especially us who work at Google.

486
00:30:20.791 --> 00:30:24.120
I know we have a lot of firsts and um,

487
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:29.900
and so how do you stay in tune and recognize and have a recognition and

488
00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.330
appreciation for these problems without feeling really,

489
00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:35.490
really guilty about what you have yourself?

490
00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.100
<v 0>Yeah.
Wow.</v>

491
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:44.060
<v 4>Do you know how,
I know that's why I'm asking you.
Oh,
I was hosting the</v>

492
00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:50.510
maybe some questions about or comments about how you,
how you deal with it.

493
00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.230
Yeah.
I just try and ignore it as a smoker.

494
00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.390
This like whatever.
Um,

495
00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:01.750
no,
I feel guilty.
I feel really guilty.
I'm a privileged

496
00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:06.820
<v 0>Glenn and I'm a white male that has happened to be able to make a living from</v>

497
00:31:08.511 --> 00:31:10.790
what he loves to do.
That's insane.
That is,

498
00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:15.710
I know that obviously all of us in this room feel a similar way to that.
So yeah,

499
00:31:15.711 --> 00:31:19.430
that is a,
that is the perfect question.
How do you feel not guilty?

500
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:23.510
You give,
give yourself two things that,

501
00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:28.850
that are in service of the other,
the origins service.
You don't,
you don't,

502
00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:32.660
you don't change the world.
You don't,
you don't,
I mean,
I mean,
you can try,

503
00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.950
but then you,
you,
you,
you,
you'll fail.
But at least you'll,
you'll do your part.

504
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:40.190
So it,
so,
yeah.
I guess the question is what do you do with that feeling?

505
00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.590
It's not about,
cause I think,
I think I,
I,

506
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:47.180
I will feel guilty.
I will feel like I'm not doing enough.

507
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:52.210
I will feel ashamed unless I'm actively putting that feeling into some type of

508
00:31:53.361 --> 00:31:54.920
service for my fellow man.

509
00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:59.570
Some type of giving to and whatever.
Wait,

510
00:31:59.571 --> 00:32:02.750
I'm supposed to,
not in the way of,
you know,
for me it's,
I'm not,

511
00:32:02.751 --> 00:32:06.550
I'm not Martin Luther King.
I'm not gone.
I'm not Russell brand.
Um,

512
00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:12.000
a little bit.
I just read my mind what he's doing a lot.
Actually.
I think he's,

513
00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:16.010
you know,
I think he's,
he's doing,
he's doing his part.
Um,

514
00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:18.530
so I think the idea is we all find our parts,

515
00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.360
we all find what part we're supposed to,

516
00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:25.100
we're called to play and it will only we know what that is.
So yeah,

517
00:32:25.101 --> 00:32:26.750
how do we,
how do we do it?

518
00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:30.730
And that's a constant unfolding question and answering in a question again at

519
00:32:30.731 --> 00:32:31.251
all answering,

520
00:32:31.251 --> 00:32:35.900
but I know that I feel a little bit better and be more peaceful when I know I've

521
00:32:35.901 --> 00:32:37.430
given to something meaningful.

522
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.100
<v 4>Okay.
Thank</v>

523
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.150
<v 0>you.
Does that help?</v>

524
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.670
<v 3>Uh,
hi.
I'm again,
thank you for coming and speaking with us.</v>

525
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:53.600
Um,
yeah,
so,
oh man.
Okay.
My question was similar to hers,

526
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:57.260
but then she asked that question.
Um,
okay.
So,
uh,
I,

527
00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:02.590
I read that 99 homes is your first film as a producer as well as an actor.

528
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:06.320
Um,
I was wondering how is,
um,
how was that experience?

529
00:33:06.321 --> 00:33:11.170
Did you find you're able to like
have a greater impact on like the,

530
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.380
the mission of this movie because you were a producer as opposed to an hour?

531
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.260
<v 0>I hope so.
Um,</v>

532
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:21.440
I definitely love the film making process and I definitely feel inclined towards

533
00:33:23.131 --> 00:33:27.570
more control.
Um,
cause he doesn't like control.
Right.

534
00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:32.190
Um,
so I,
yeah,
no,
I loved it.
I absolutely loved it.

535
00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:36.600
Um,
and I,
I don't know how I impacted in the film,

536
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:37.430
but I know that I,

537
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:42.430
it felt good to be in the conversation constantly with the filmmaker and with

538
00:33:43.741 --> 00:33:48.741
the crew and felt a sense of a more ownership over one doing something as an

539
00:33:49.141 --> 00:33:52.590
actor and you kind of come in,
you do your part and then you leave.

540
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:54.490
And I don't like that feeling.
It's very,

541
00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.180
very different theater and then film because in theater,

542
00:33:57.181 --> 00:33:59.070
the actors or the community,
there's created,

543
00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.700
whereas in film crew with the community,
um,

544
00:34:02.701 --> 00:34:07.320
so I kind of miss that a lot when I'm doing what I'm doing film.
But,
um,

545
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:12.120
but yeah,
it was,
it was,
it was great.
And I hope to keep doing it because,
um,
I,

546
00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:17.050
I've,
I've had experiences with,
uh,
powerlessness in,

547
00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:20.830
uh,
in,
in,
in,
in,
in,

548
00:34:20.831 --> 00:34:23.670
in the work I've done in,
it hasn't felt all that good.

549
00:34:23.671 --> 00:34:27.630
Like I really like being involved from the ground up.
So yeah,

550
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.210
I felt really good.
Thank you.
Thank you.

551
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:36.300
<v 3>Hi.
Thank you for coming.
Um,
I saw the movie and I really enjoyed it.
Um,</v>

552
00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:37.360
I was wondering,

553
00:34:37.361 --> 00:34:41.190
so in the movie it seemed like there was a lot of emphasis put on the,

554
00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.790
the man's perspective as like breadwinner for the family.
Yeah.
Um,

555
00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:49.120
and in general,
all of the cases that we saw more in depth,

556
00:34:49.121 --> 00:34:52.190
that was the man who is trying to provide for the family and get them out of the

557
00:34:52.191 --> 00:34:53.890
situation.
Um,

558
00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:58.070
and I was wondering how when you visited people in Florida,
um,

559
00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:01.600
if that was generally the case for what you were seeing or if there were some

560
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.990
women who are trying to provide for their families and did that affect it all

561
00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.570
the representation of the character of your mother?

562
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:12.130
<v 0>Hmm.
Such a good question.
Thank you for,
um,</v>

563
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:13.743
the,

564
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:17.940
I mean this is by no means a fast sample that I,

565
00:35:17.941 --> 00:35:20.940
that I was,
uh,
engaged with,

566
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:24.900
but in the families I met was the,
the,

567
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:27.840
the male that was the breadwinner for the most part.

568
00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:33.300
And there were a couple of instances where that wasn't true.
Um,

569
00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:39.000
I really love that question.
And uh,
there there is,
uh,
there is a part of the,

570
00:35:39.001 --> 00:35:42.560
of the story of my nine homes where,
you know,

571
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:46.950
Laura Dunn's carrots and my mother is,
is,
is another source of income with her,

572
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.530
with her house stuff.
Um,

573
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:56.010
I'm afraid of,
I'm afraid that it's a misrepresentation.
Now that you asked this,

574
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.680
I'm afraid that this,
there's um,

575
00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.300
don't miss representation,
but a,

576
00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:07.570
a more limited representation than maybe we,
we,
we,
we,

577
00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:10.590
we could have done.
I really don't know.
I have to,

578
00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.980
I have to think about that already.
Thank you for bringing that to my attention.

579
00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.553
<v 5>MMM.</v>

580
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:19.980
<v 2>It's,
I mean,
ultimately it's still a film and it is a representation.</v>

581
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.940
If the story that needs to be told I needed to be this family story is film

582
00:36:23.941 --> 00:36:28.420
across,
like that's what it's gonna.
I'm sure be but about one,

583
00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:33.320
one kind of interesting part of it to me was that it was a single father.
Um,

584
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.720
yeah.
Which is an entirely different dynamic that you don't always see.

585
00:36:36.721 --> 00:36:39.810
A lot of times you see,
you know,
it's a single mother and stuff like that,

586
00:36:39.811 --> 00:36:41.210
but this was like a,
yeah,
know,

587
00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:43.110
<v 0>obviously my mother was,
you know,</v>

588
00:36:43.111 --> 00:36:46.140
in the kind of film right car to his was the breadwinner in the single mother.

589
00:36:46.141 --> 00:36:50.190
And then
that's,
um,
you know,

590
00:36:50.191 --> 00:36:53.430
I can speak to
is,

591
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.910
it's definitely inherent in me.
This,

592
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.930
this old idea and I don't know whether this is learned behavior.

593
00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:03.320
<v 5>Oh,
okay.</v>

594
00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.950
<v 0>In bread,
um,
uh,</v>

595
00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:12.070
kind of archetypal or of of that masculine energy.

596
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:17.350
I say masculine energy that lives in men and women,
um,

597
00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.880
as just as feminine energy lives in both.
Um,

598
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:25.930
I know for me as a man and the majority of the men I speak to in that I know

599
00:37:26.271 --> 00:37:27.104
intimately,

600
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:33.350
there is this pressure self-inflicted science,
saline inflicted,

601
00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:35.690
culturally inflicted,
that says

602
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:41.720
if you are not providing the money,
the shelter,
the food,

603
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.500
then you're not a man.
That's a fallacy.
Like,
I,
I,

604
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:51.230
I know that on a very deep instinctive level that that is a fallacy that has no

605
00:37:51.231 --> 00:37:54.290
bearing on manhood.
Um,

606
00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:59.740
and I think one of the things that I was excited to reflect was that pressure in

607
00:38:00.381 --> 00:38:03.050
corner,
that pressure embodied in

608
00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:07.580
the males in our culture and maybe how

609
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:13.950
that's lost its way a bit and gone a little,
a little crazy,
a little,
um,

610
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:18.470
kind of,
it's become this beast.
And I,
and I,
and I know growing up,

611
00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.250
my father felt that if he wasn't providing,
he was,

612
00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:28.370
you know,
not,
not matching up and a,
and all the men I spoke to her Florida,

613
00:38:28.371 --> 00:38:32.830
it's the same thing.
Um,
yeah,
I,
I really don't know why,

614
00:38:32.831 --> 00:38:36.800
why it's ended up that way and,
uh,
but I'm really interested in your question.

615
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.830
Can you,
can you repeat your question again just to,

616
00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.480
just in case I have missed something?

617
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:46.010
<v 3>Um,
I,
I think you answered it pretty well,
but I was just asking if,
um,</v>

618
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:50.650
the representation that men are generally the ones providing for their families

619
00:38:50.651 --> 00:38:54.370
in these cases and trying to get themselves out of these situations of eviction.

620
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:55.000
Right.
Um,

621
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.600
if that was representative of the cases that you saw and met with in Florida,

622
00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.050
and if that played into it all the character of your mother and how,

623
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.400
how she played that part.

624
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:07.840
<v 0>Right.
Let me,
I thought thank you for repeating it.
Um,
I then,</v>

625
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:11.600
as I say that was my experience and doesn't mean that is the general experience

626
00:39:11.601 --> 00:39:13.820
of these families who are going through this specific thing.

627
00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.630
I will add add to this that this,

628
00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:21.140
that what Laura Dunn brought to this,
this role.

629
00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:23.870
A lot of it was,
um,

630
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:25.820
<v 5>yeah,</v>

631
00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:28.340
<v 0>unfortunately not,</v>

632
00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.480
I'm totally in the film.

633
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:34.950
<v 5>Uh hmm.</v>

634
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:41.290
<v 0>Um,
and,
and that's a heartbreak for,
for the,
for the filmmaker.</v>

635
00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:46.310
I know because Laura is one of the greatest actors out there and what she

636
00:39:47.731 --> 00:39:52.440
brought was all this complexity and,
and a depth.
And,

637
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.140
um,
so,
so there is,

638
00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:58.140
there are some elements that are missing from the story.

639
00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:01.590
And I'm so happy that you picked up on that because that's why,

640
00:40:01.591 --> 00:40:05.340
hey you saying because it was in,
it's in,
it was in,

641
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:09.390
well it was that and the experience and there's a phrase,

642
00:40:09.391 --> 00:40:10.860
kill your darlings that,

643
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:15.300
and then it's applicable here to what the filmmaker has to do.
And ultimately,

644
00:40:15.301 --> 00:40:16.134
you know,
he,

645
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:21.710
he wanted to focus more on this tension relationship between the realtor and the

646
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:27.470
evictee.
Um,
so yes,
um,

647
00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:32.830
bomber and a cool,
I'm really glad that you were like,
well,

648
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:37.520
because that's how I fell in love was where is she?
I want her,

649
00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:42.240
was she up to what you're doing?
And uh,
and I love,

650
00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:46.890
I love where that conversation is going as well.
Um,
and,
and,
and again,

651
00:40:46.891 --> 00:40:48.720
I think of that Nina Simone Song,

652
00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:53.810
Mississippi Goddam and the slowness of change and how frustratingly and angering

653
00:40:54.621 --> 00:40:55.470
the slow

654
00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:02.000
change is in the feminist movement in,
um,

655
00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:06.390
an old progressive movements that need acceleration,

656
00:41:06.391 --> 00:41:09.280
that need the fire.
The,
so thank you and

657
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:16.050
thank you very much.
I'm with you.
This is what a feminist looks like.
Is that,

658
00:41:16.051 --> 00:41:20.160
is that the right terminology?
The right term?
So I think my last question is,

659
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:20.700
you know,

660
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:24.420
this was a wonderful addition to your body of work and you've done such awesome

661
00:41:24.421 --> 00:41:27.090
stage work.
Is there anything like,
what's up next for you?

662
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.120
What do you want to tackle next?
Uh,

663
00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:35.010
this is what my ego gets a little excited talk.
Um,
and I,

664
00:41:35.011 --> 00:41:38.790
I guess worried about that because the ego's tricky.
Um,

665
00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:44.480
anything specific?
I mean,
I know,
um,
uh,
I,
uh,

666
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:49.430
I did a movie recently.
I'm going to do another movie and then I'll do a play.

667
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:54.560
All right.
How's that?
That's great.
It's the perfect answer,
I have to say.

668
00:41:54.561 --> 00:41:56.460
Sorry,
ego.
Sorry.
I'm not going to,

669
00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:00.470
we're going to give you one little bone that you will not to chew them.
Well,

670
00:42:00.471 --> 00:42:02.580
this is a wonderful film and thank you so much for joining us.

671
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.460
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
