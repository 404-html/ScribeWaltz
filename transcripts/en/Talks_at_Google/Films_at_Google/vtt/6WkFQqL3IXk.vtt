00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.480
Hi everyone.
Welcome to talks at Google today.

2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:06.720
It is my absolute pleasure to welcome Duncan Jones,

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:08.850
Paula Patton and Toby Kebbell for Warcraft.

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.280
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.230
<v 0>Thank you.
Thank you so much for joining us today.
Thank you for happiness.</v>

6
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.770
So just in case anybody isn't aware,
could you explain to us what Warcraft is?

7
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.850
Yes.
Many years ago,

8
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.390
<v 2>actually 20 years ago,
a real time strategy game came out called Warcraft.
Um,</v>

9
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.160
that was fantastic and I was a big fan of it.
I'm from blizzard 10 years ago,

10
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.990
a game called world of Warcraft came out,

11
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.090
which is the one that most people know about,

12
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.410
which is this massively multiplayer online role playing game,
um,

13
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.030
which supposedly over the 20 years of its existence,
Warcraft,

14
00:00:56.031 --> 00:01:00.890
that is um,
100 million people have played so very well known computer game

15
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.830
<v 0>and Paula and Toby,
how did you get introduced to the world of this Warcraft?</v>

16
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.220
<v 3>For me it was,
uh,
the script.
I did not know about it.
I know I was one of,</v>

17
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.570
I was the one out and Duncan was the one who brought me into the world and to

18
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:21.170
the universe of Warcraft.
I love the script.
I am.

19
00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:23.510
That's why I want it to be in the movie.

20
00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:27.810
And then I met with Duncan and he showed me he's incredible visuals and the art

21
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.520
in the world.
He wanted to create his interpretation of that.

22
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.140
And I was blown away.
And then we also talked about character and you know,

23
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.150
we had kind of a scrape meeting and in the moment you said I'd like you to do

24
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:43.600
it.
And I said I would.
And then there were lawyers,
but in the moment,

25
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.860
<v 2>and then there were lawyers.
That's always,
it always ends up.</v>

26
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.390
<v 3>Yeah,
you can't trust it in the moment.
But I,
but I,
but we said yes.
And then,</v>

27
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.430
<v 2>I mean Paula has places,
character,
corona who's really kind of the,
the,</v>

28
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.360
the central Kay central character in the film.

29
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.890
And that we have these two sort of competing civilizations or can human and

30
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.250
Paula's character Garona is kind of the one who's stuck in the middle.

31
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:10.840
And so in some senses,
what the audience sees is through Garona his eyes

32
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.210
<v 3>has that made her so interesting to play.
And then,</v>

33
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.780
and then I got in my car and I went,
wait a minute.

34
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.500
I mean I've got to be half work,
half human and green.
I,
what have I done?

35
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.990
I don't know if I should have said yes,
the bed.

36
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.610
But then it began the most amazing adventure.
It was really incredible.

37
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.490
Then you ended up looking like this.
Yes.
So that was not so bad.

38
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.780
I,
I'll take it that big head.
Small Body.

39
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.210
<v 0>Yeah,
the dirt and one week not out yet.
I'm sorry.</v>

40
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.530
<v 4>It's not that bad from the back.
It looks like me though.</v>

41
00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:45.220
I was a steward 10 it's not,
um,

42
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.080
I got involved because I'm speaking too loud.
Is that loud?
I'll hold it here.

43
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.630
Uh,
I got involved because of motion capture.

44
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.750
I just finished planet of the apes playing Cobra and I had found out through

45
00:02:57.851 --> 00:03:02.290
sitting with legendary that they were going to do a picture using the same thing

46
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:04.150
and ask you,
you must be tired of it.
I said,
no,

47
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:05.640
it's an incredible craft or something.

48
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.550
I would love to learn more of WHO's directing this at Duncan Jones.
I was like,

49
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.250
no way is that really real?
And they were like,
yeah,
I was like,
you know,

50
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:14.710
cause sometimes you could go to do a job and they're like,
Duncan Jones,

51
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.480
you turn up and it's not,
it's my go back.

52
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.650
It's a lot of lying in these businesses is a lot of fibbing goes on.

53
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.000
Duncan Jones,
Michael Duncan Jones base.

54
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.770
Uh,

55
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.540
so I was very lucky and it's a phenomenal cast.
And so yeah,

56
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.830
I also got,
I,
I'm a console player who's,

57
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.920
I have three older.
That's too,
I have three older brothers,
uh,

58
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.530
who were all PC gamers and I'm very spit upon us as a console gamer.
You know,

59
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:48.990
it's like,
you know,

60
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.490
you don't do what I know the evil I possessed in the world.
So,

61
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.600
um,
I was very excited,
however,
to be involved and especially with the return.

62
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.470
It was a,
it was a great role and as you said,
it was the pre world.

63
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.670
It was that world before that we were telling the,
the beloved worldwide,

64
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.620
<v 2>Toby,
you may,</v>

65
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.110
you may be thought of thinking that you were involved because of the Mocap,

66
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.850
but truly,
um,

67
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.860
I was excited to work with you in particular because of the Black Mirror episode

68
00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:20.550
that you did,
which I thought was absolutely fantastic and that blew my mind.

69
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.483
Yeah.
Love it.

70
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.270
<v 5>So I'd imagine there's a great deal of sort of responsibility to the existing</v>

71
00:04:26.271 --> 00:04:26.541
players,

72
00:04:26.541 --> 00:04:30.700
but there's also the urge to bring people who aren't necessarily as familiar or

73
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:32.960
maybe like heard of Warcraft before.
Um,

74
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.110
did you find that motivating or maybe a little intimidating?

75
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.480
<v 2>Um,
I kind of felt a responsibility to,
I mean,</v>

76
00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.520
I wanted to do the movie and,
and God,

77
00:04:43.521 --> 00:04:47.240
how many times in your life do you have the opportunity to make a film on this

78
00:04:47.241 --> 00:04:50.990
skill scale?
You know,
creating a world on this scale.
Um,

79
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.020
but I felt a responsibility as a fan of the game and as someone who really

80
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.360
wanted to see a movie,

81
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.390
not only based in the Warcraft universe but just see gay,

82
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.630
I see a film based on a game that didn't suck.

83
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.540
<v 4>I don't want to disrespect</v>

84
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.520
<v 2>all the people who've made movie based on games.</v>

85
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.320
It's an incredibly hard thing to make a movie.
Yeah.
And actually finishes,

86
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.590
you know,
deserves respect just for getting it made.
But,
um,

87
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.830
I felt like the emphasis of,

88
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.900
of of film has to be about telling a story that the audience wants to watch as

89
00:05:29.331 --> 00:05:31.850
opposed to trying to,
in some way,

90
00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:34.940
viscerally recreating the experience of playing a computer game.

91
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.610
That's not what a movie based on a video game needs to be.

92
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.550
There needs to be a movie that you actually enjoy watching and characters you

93
00:05:40.551 --> 00:05:43.170
care about.
And,
and knowing,
you know,

94
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.490
understanding that the setting of the film and understanding where you're trying

95
00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:47.630
to get to by the end of it.

96
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.580
<v 5>So are you saying you are not a fan of the Super Mario brothers movie that is</v>

97
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:53.920
not an excellent video game adaptation?
Rob Kazinsky

98
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.320
<v 2>constantly dissing that movie.
And I think that that's a little unfair.</v>

99
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.680
<v 5>Um,
I think,</v>

100
00:05:59.681 --> 00:06:03.070
I think one of the great things about this game in particular is that both sides

101
00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:04.900
of heroes,
you know,
it's not a black and white,

102
00:06:04.901 --> 00:06:08.190
like these are the bad guys and these are the good guys.
Um,
how,

103
00:06:08.191 --> 00:06:11.520
how do you sort of adapt that to cinema?
Cause I'm sure fans of the game and,

104
00:06:11.521 --> 00:06:15.040
and film fans are going to be torn.
I hope

105
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.060
<v 2>they all,
I mean,
I think,
I think what,
what Toby and Paula Do,
who,
who,
you know,</v>

106
00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:20.470
Toby's plays an old character.

107
00:06:20.471 --> 00:06:23.890
Paula plays a character who's kind of in the middle of the two worlds.
Um,

108
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.120
you know,
I wanted to,
I thought if we're going to make this movie,

109
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.620
one of the things that fantasy films tend to do is they're trope is that the

110
00:06:32.621 --> 00:06:35.440
humans,
the hobbits,
the cute ones,
those are the good guys.

111
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.010
Everything ugly is a bad guy.
Not that you're ugly.
Yeah.

112
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.370
<v 5>Okay.</v>

113
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.940
<v 2>But the,
the idea was,
okay,
let's,
let's make a war movie and let's,</v>

114
00:06:44.941 --> 00:06:48.210
let's show the conflict from both sides and let's get the audience to care about

115
00:06:48.211 --> 00:06:53.211
the characters on both sides and see the heroes on both sides and understand

116
00:06:53.521 --> 00:06:56.670
that there's conflict arises,
not because there's good and bad necessarily,

117
00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.110
but because there's a situation that doesn't seem to have a,
uh,
an easy solution.

118
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.940
And that's why,
and that's why the conflict happens.

119
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.330
The orks have lost their home world.
They have nowhere else they could go.

120
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:11.250
They've invaded this world that's rich and fertile and it has lots of space,

121
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.220
but there happens to be a civilization which already exists there.

122
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.640
And that's the humans and the,
and the other races which are based on as Roth.

123
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.380
<v 5>And Paula,
I would say your character,</v>

124
00:07:19.381 --> 00:07:22.260
even more so than Toby's is caught in between the two sides.

125
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.280
Were there any things that you drew on from,
you know,

126
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.630
obviously we don't live in a fantasy world,

127
00:07:27.631 --> 00:07:31.210
so method acting might be a little tougher,
but were there any things that you,

128
00:07:31.211 --> 00:07:33.330
you really felt like you connected with in this?

129
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.270
<v 3>Absolutely.
Um,</v>

130
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.880
I think that's what made her a character I wanted to play because I found her to

131
00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:42.820
be so complex and also evolve so much,

132
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.700
which is rare for character to do in a movie.
But I have to say,
I didn't know,

133
00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:48.161
um,

134
00:07:48.161 --> 00:07:53.161
how well and how believable it would be for us to imagine that you could watch a

135
00:07:53.171 --> 00:07:56.210
movie and there would not be a good bud,
good boy,

136
00:07:56.211 --> 00:08:00.970
a good guy or bad guy or the right being or the wrong being.

137
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.410
And Duncan,
I don't know what,
to me it's like very unique.
Don't you think,
Toby?

138
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.000
I can't remember a movie I've seen that pull that up and it really does work it.

139
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.380
And that's what makes this film so different is that if you are,

140
00:08:14.381 --> 00:08:16.660
heart is not pulled by the oryx.

141
00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:21.160
And honestly by Toby's incredible performance that mean Durotan and his

142
00:08:21.161 --> 00:08:23.670
relationship with his family,
eh Ha,

143
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:28.180
moves you and you can't help but be moved and then there's of course you up help

144
00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:31.870
yourself cause you're human and you like humans,
right?
I mean,
most of us,

145
00:08:31.871 --> 00:08:34.810
I don't like all of them.
Yeah.
We're basically human.
I said,

146
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.460
so then you're going to find it.

147
00:08:36.461 --> 00:08:40.810
But I think I just need to say that that's really special.
And so that for me,

148
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:43.450
I think I also play the part that we all feel,

149
00:08:43.451 --> 00:08:46.330
which is that none of us sometimes,
well,
I was a nun.

150
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:51.320
A lot of us don't feel like Youi belong,
you know,
in this world.
I know.
I don't,

151
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.850
<v 2>I mean,
I think that would,
that was certainly a key to your character.</v>

152
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.210
Just a sense of belonging and,
and who,
who,
who deserves,

153
00:08:57.211 --> 00:08:58.440
who's earned your loyalty.

154
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.880
<v 3>Yeah,
absolutely.
I think that that's,
I,
I have,
um,</v>

155
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.590
I had been born into a world of suffering and pain as this labor gold on,

156
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:12.390
and then I find myself in the human world and I'm,
and I'm embraced by them,

157
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:17.250
but I'm not sure how much are and,
and how real it is.
And,
um,

158
00:09:17.251 --> 00:09:20.820
and you'll have spoiled.
I know exactly.
I was trying,

159
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.930
but as he as be Paula,
yes,

160
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:29.300
I'm the light has had its challenges and his blessings and um,

161
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.630
you draw on those challenges and to play a character like this,

162
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.230
<v 5>speaking of sort of the humanizing of orcs,
there's one scene,</v>

163
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.520
I hope we can talk about it,
but it's the very beginning.
And Toby,

164
00:09:40.521 --> 00:09:44.590
your performance is just,
it's so human and it's,

165
00:09:44.591 --> 00:09:49.190
it's interesting to see these massive hulking orcs with really human emotions

166
00:09:49.191 --> 00:09:52.760
and like sensitivity.
What was,
what was that day like for you?

167
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.790
<v 4>Uh,
like every day it was a,</v>

168
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.210
I mean,
but in a good way in the sense that every day on set was a,

169
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.480
it was a very nurturing process of being,
you know,
the very lovey thing to say.

170
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.480
But it was a very loving process.
You know,

171
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:12.060
it was a big group of us as all cause we were all very happy in a,

172
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:14.460
in a family and a team.
And then even our Hoffling,
we,

173
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:16.790
it's like having a half sister.
She real system,
right?

174
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.130
<v 5>I embrace and uh,
I didn't get to embrace it.
Yeah.</v>

175
00:10:22.131 --> 00:10:24.670
Isn't that a bad joke?

176
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.520
<v 4>So,
so it's a process of,</v>

177
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.060
I think everyone's a little tired of seeing the good guy,
bad guy thing.
I mean,

178
00:10:32.061 --> 00:10:35.270
even with everything,
I try and do those,
you know,

179
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.540
everyone good can be terrible cause the behaviors,
the terrible thing,

180
00:10:38.541 --> 00:10:40.800
not the person,
you know.
So,
uh,

181
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.640
we were more looking at what the behaviors were of these characters.

182
00:10:43.641 --> 00:10:46.460
And I was lucky I got to play with a wonderful actress.

183
00:10:46.461 --> 00:10:49.010
She played my wife and I was a father,
so it was a very easy,

184
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.850
a lot of my friends and older brothers are having children.
So it was it.
Yeah,

185
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.360
<v 2>it's fun when you get to work on a scene like that.
My wife is,</v>

186
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.550
is quite pregnant and we're going to have our first kip next month.

187
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:03.580
But in the scene that I think you're talking about Durotan play by Toby and

188
00:11:03.981 --> 00:11:06.830
Draka,
his wife played by Anna Galvin,
who's fantastic.

189
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.940
She's very pregnant at the time and,
and uh,

190
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:16.060
she wants to go with t with a Durotan on this,
in the salt.

191
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:20.630
This,
um,
uh,
basically excursion into this new world.

192
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.320
And he says,
can you,
can you hide your fat belly?

193
00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.220
And she says,
only if you can hide your fat head.

194
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.160
Now these are the kinds of things that I as a husband would love to say to my

195
00:11:31.161 --> 00:11:33.590
wife but never would.
So as a director,

196
00:11:33.591 --> 00:11:35.780
I get to write these things and say them in the film,

197
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.650
then she knows with love that,
that it's meant for her.

198
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:41.870
<v 5>The true fantasy film.</v>

199
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.930
I'd love to talk about the visuals of the orcs because that scene in particular

200
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:52.460
really sold it for me because I feel like you guys kept very true to the maybe

201
00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:53.800
more art style of the game,

202
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.550
but you had to sort of humanize them because the game is a little more cartoony.

203
00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:01.480
Um,
just as a byproduct.
I'm sure it's like computer rendering limitations,

204
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.720
but this is a weird thing to notice.
I was like,
they have chest hair,

205
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.590
like gave like realistic test hair,
but it's such a human thing.

206
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:14.050
Um,
and,
and I know Ilm worked on the film and they are just real life wizards

207
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.520
<v 2>did some amazing stuff.
They built these,
uh,
these,</v>

208
00:12:17.521 --> 00:12:22.340
these simulations down to the way muscles jiggle.
So that,
I mean,

209
00:12:22.341 --> 00:12:26.430
did they did huge amounts of work specially on facial capture and I'm Toby could

210
00:12:26.431 --> 00:12:30.870
speak to that having been through different versions of that process,
but,

211
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.070
but just the amount of detail they got into what,
you know,
whether it's the,

212
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.970
like you say how,
how the hair works on the body,
um,

213
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.780
how the hair works on the head.
Obviously the muscle jiggle and fat juggle.

214
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:47.100
There was multiple layers of,
of simulation that they were doing,
um,
for every,

215
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.600
every movement of every org.

216
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.480
<v 4>Yeah.
I mean they work tirelessly and basically all we are at dots.</v>

217
00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:56.170
At the end of the day,
our image disappears in these dots motor,

218
00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:58.930
that incredible character that they've drawn,
they've created.

219
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:04.170
So we're the sort of spirit personality element of their incredible hard work.

220
00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:05.910
But yeah,
they work tirelessly.
Ilm,

221
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.510
<v 5>does that change your approach at all just because you are manifesting this sort</v>

222
00:13:09.511 --> 00:13:11.970
of entirely different physical character?

223
00:13:11.971 --> 00:13:14.850
Or is it just the same way you would approach a role in your face?

224
00:13:14.851 --> 00:13:17.270
It was going to be directly translated.

225
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.110
<v 4>The way you're trying to translate your emotions,</v>

226
00:13:19.111 --> 00:13:22.250
you will approaches acted the same,
but you have to lose a lot of your pride.

227
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.850
You walk around in gray pajamas,

228
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.580
well everyone else is in Kulana with great songs and great facial hair.

229
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.730
You clean shaven in a,
in a special needs hat.
It's uh,

230
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.290
it's,
it's,
you know,
you lose your pride,
but that's important,
you know,

231
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.300
so that's the only element of the changes.

232
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.730
<v 5>And Paula,
you,
I guess it was an advantage or disadvantage,</v>

233
00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:46.840
but your character has to be as physical as some of the ORCS,

234
00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:49.720
but you didn't have the advantage of with CG,
you know,

235
00:13:49.721 --> 00:13:51.610
being able to like have some extra muscle.

236
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.410
So what was the training process like for this?

237
00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:55.210
Like I assume it was a very physical role.

238
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.980
<v 3>It was,
it was very,
uh,
it was daunting.
It was challenging.
Um,
but I,</v>

239
00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:03.850
but I raised it.
It was something that I ended up loving.
Um,
yes,

240
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:08.140
I first they wanted me to aesthetically look like I could potentially be an org.

241
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.450
And,
uh,
so that meant a lot of protein in my diet and a lot of workouts.

242
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.000
So that was,
what was it,
six days a week,
two and a half hours a day,

243
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.540
which was [inaudible] at the beginning I thought I was going to throw up,

244
00:14:19.541 --> 00:14:22.210
I didn't know how I was going to do it,
but he just kept on.

245
00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:25.540
And then we added a sore training and knives and,
and,

246
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.320
and then we started to happen is the fear of how am I going to play half work,

247
00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:30.154
half human.

248
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:35.250
And this warrior started to dwindle a bit because this physical accomplishment I

249
00:14:37.901 --> 00:14:39.640
had to make,
you know,
for the film,

250
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.710
we started making me feel like I could be a warrior a bit.
Do you know,

251
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.520
not that I could do everything that go wrong.
It does,

252
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.960
but just the idea that you could potentially do it was an empowering.

253
00:14:49.961 --> 00:14:51.440
And then I also learned how to ride a horse,

254
00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:56.090
which I had never really done before.
And,
um,
so by the time I got to set,

255
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.960
I'm scared to death still.
Like,
I remember the day I had my trailer was like,

256
00:14:59.961 --> 00:15:04.760
Oh my God,
I don't,
and um,
um,

257
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:10.130
but
I will,
I had given that much work over.

258
00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:13.250
I was like,
someone's going to see this body.
I'm getting naked somewhere.
Okay.

259
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.900
That's what's going to happen.
Bad role.
I might be a bad performance,

260
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:21.860
but I'm getting naked.
I'm sorry.

261
00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:26.050
It's one of the guys.
Yeah.
I'm not gonna lie.
It's true.
And um,

262
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.320
but then it was also the last bit though would be they gave me tests and these

263
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:37.980
contacts that really obscured by vision and with all of the things that I

264
00:15:37.981 --> 00:15:39.880
learned and everything that Duncan,

265
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.510
I talked about the inner work and the character.

266
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.660
And then I felt like I could go out and play or,
but there,
but so it,

267
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.790
people were like,
you have to spend all those hours in makeup.
It isn't fair.

268
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.180
It wouldn't you rather be in a pajama.
And I would say,
no,

269
00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:58.070
not for me because I love costumes.
I liked the way that that makes you feel.

270
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.930
And,
um,
and I really admire Toby and all of the York's pipe,
frankly,

271
00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:04.730
because they do look ridiculous,

272
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:09.800
absolutely ridiculous and so much so that they just seem so other than they look

273
00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:11.090
like aliens that you really,

274
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.570
I realized I never did talk to them because they did not seem human.

275
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.500
To be able to come in a room in Blue Bj's head to toe,

276
00:16:21.501 --> 00:16:22.730
I mean you've got to see it

277
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.780
on your face and then pretend to be fearsome,
um,

278
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.120
is like amazing.
I'm sitting,

279
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:37.200
he overcame that outfit and became fierce and that's why it went talk to him.

280
00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:38.940
<v 2>It's pretty hard to take.</v>

281
00:16:38.941 --> 00:16:41.100
Clancy Brown is fear some though when he's on our board,

282
00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:45.700
he's on a rocking horse and he's supposed to be a huge terrifying orc.

283
00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.400
The Kurgan from Highlander,
you know,

284
00:16:47.401 --> 00:16:50.400
this is a guy who should be filling it with fair and he's in his self phone,

285
00:16:50.401 --> 00:16:51.234
pajamas

286
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.400
<v 3>behind the scenes.
I've heard this story.</v>

287
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.980
I do have to say one thing I very much appreciated about this film is that

288
00:17:00.981 --> 00:17:04.750
wasn't like a Damsel in distress story and all the women in it are very bad ass.

289
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:06.320
Uh,
so thanks for that.

290
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.021
I'd love to talk about,

291
00:17:12.021 --> 00:17:15.710
so you do have so much room to play with CG and cinematography and stuff like

292
00:17:15.711 --> 00:17:15.891
that,

293
00:17:15.891 --> 00:17:19.800
but I felt like there were a lot of shots that you wouldn't expect to see in a

294
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.760
roaring fantasy epic.
Um,

295
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.070
can you talk about sort of the process of working with the cinematographers and,

296
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:26.370
um,

297
00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:27.910
<v 2>I worked with Simon Dugan.</v>

298
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.870
I'm on this film who had just come off of great Gatsby,

299
00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:34.230
so he'd kind of been involved in something that involved a lot of special

300
00:17:34.231 --> 00:17:37.920
effects work and postproduction and,
and building a film in Lez,

301
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.240
which funnily enough,
we were trying not to do as much as possible.
We,
uh,

302
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.510
Gavin bouquet was our production designer and he built these extraordinary

303
00:17:45.511 --> 00:17:46.860
beautiful film sets.

304
00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:50.250
So it was wherever possible even we were doing motion capture,

305
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.200
we would have these live action film sets to,
to shoot him.
Um,
but you know,

306
00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:58.140
their work,
there were times when we were building things in layers and,
and,

307
00:17:58.141 --> 00:18:01.620
and Simon and I kind of broke it down as much as we could.

308
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.910
But the nice thing about having as many live action sets as we had is we were

309
00:18:05.911 --> 00:18:10.080
still able to be quite improvisational,
you know,
on the set.
Um,

310
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.270
I didn't have tons of storyboards.
I,

311
00:18:12.271 --> 00:18:14.400
there were animatics but we didn't always stick to them.

312
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.670
A lot of the time we'd get on the set and we break things down and we'd work
out,

313
00:18:17.671 --> 00:18:21.000
you know,
what,
there's a better way to do this.
And we do that on the day.
Um,

314
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:24.990
so it was kind of both unique and a little scary.
Um,

315
00:18:24.991 --> 00:18:28.290
certainly scary for the producers because we were kind of working certain things

316
00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:29.190
out on the day.

317
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:30.061
<v 3>That's so true.</v>

318
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:33.570
That was what it really was amazing that way people have been asking me what it

319
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:35.130
was like and was it really technical?

320
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:39.240
I guess it was like forget that bit because the sets were incredible and I

321
00:18:39.241 --> 00:18:41.490
didn't feel locked down.
Like you can't move.

322
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:46.680
And I had a real person to look at and have feel their soul and I don't know.

323
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:50.600
Right.
It didn't,
you did it,
but more than I have ever done it.
But yeah,

324
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.370
that's what made it such an organic experience.

325
00:18:53.371 --> 00:18:56.910
I feel like that transcends on screen too.
Just that human element.

326
00:18:56.911 --> 00:18:57.790
Don't you think that

327
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.270
<v 4>gun by saying earlier there was like the everyday it was just everyday was the</v>

328
00:19:01.271 --> 00:19:04.060
same,
but that's what I meant.
It's,
it was so inclusive.

329
00:19:04.061 --> 00:19:05.650
It was like doing a full performance.

330
00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.180
The fact that we now get to stand in front of Paula or Travis or Kim,
you know,

331
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.760
whoever we're doing the scene with,
I mean me and Paula,

332
00:19:12.761 --> 00:19:17.761
we had to learn the ok-ish dialogue with a very specific more specific than if

333
00:19:18.281 --> 00:19:19.480
you were doing say a year ago

334
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:23.600
<v 3>p and accident like no,
no it's
not.</v>

335
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:27.780
I would really love to hear the difference.
The actual,
I just,

336
00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.180
that wasn't Jibberish I just said,

337
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:33.260
did you just like a fan somebodies mother or clearly,
but yeah,

338
00:19:33.261 --> 00:19:37.240
so I mean it was absolutely like doing any [inaudible] doing a great film.

339
00:19:37.241 --> 00:19:40.240
It was just on a massive scale.
So you kept,
I kept turning up and going,
did we,

340
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:42.790
did we do that?
How did we,
did we finish that day?

341
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.250
<v 2>Language stuff you guys did was,
it was really impressive.
It really was.</v>

342
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.190
There's a scene in hunt for Red October and I don't know if you've seen that

343
00:19:49.191 --> 00:19:50.940
film,
you've youngsters,
but there's a,

344
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:53.580
there's a scene from a hunt for Red October where,
uh,

345
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:58.250
I think it's a Sam Neil who's talking Russian.
Um,
we're into submarines,

346
00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.780
right to start the movie.
He's talking in Russian.

347
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.120
I know as the camera kind of moves in and closes in on him,

348
00:20:02.121 --> 00:20:06.950
he starts speaking English and it's just really clever trans transition from one

349
00:20:06.951 --> 00:20:11.010
language to the language that the audience understands.
Um,
and,
and you know,

350
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.630
getting rid of the subtitles but still allowing you to feel like,
oh yeah,

351
00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:17.810
this is happening with this group of people who don't speak English.
Um,
and we,

352
00:20:17.811 --> 00:20:22.130
we kind of used that guy again and elaborated on it a little bit for a meeting

353
00:20:22.131 --> 00:20:25.820
between Durotan and the humans.
And Corona was doing the translation.

354
00:20:25.821 --> 00:20:27.710
So you both had a big challenge.

355
00:20:27.711 --> 00:20:31.880
You had a massive challenge cause you were speaking to different fake languages

356
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.210
and and starting in one and then having to transition to the other halfway

357
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.900
through a camera shot where we,

358
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:41.750
we're Toby speaking in org and then as the camera moves in he starts speaking in

359
00:20:41.751 --> 00:20:44.000
English.
Um,
so the,

360
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:48.240
the special effects stuff was difficult but actually kind of stuff

361
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.840
that's really tricky to try and get the timing right to make sure that the

362
00:20:51.841 --> 00:20:54.530
language sounds right and then an end to get the time,
you know,

363
00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.430
to just do it all in all at the same time.

364
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.130
<v 3>I remember being just,
I think that moment,
you know,</v>

365
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:04.320
this was a long movie to make it and I remember we'd been waiting on this and he

366
00:21:04.321 --> 00:21:08.000
goes,
no,
no,
I want you to learn.
Arkish I was like,
wait,
what?

367
00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:13.110
And the other bit too where it's Jibberish and then wait,
you ADR,

368
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:17.010
anybody does what I'm doing with these tusks in your mouth as well.

369
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.140
So you have a meeting at the same time.
And I just remember just being okay,

370
00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.620
just fear sweat.

371
00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.020
<v 5>Um,
what Dunkin for you.</v>

372
00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:30.920
So your first full moon is one of my favorites of all time.
And,

373
00:21:30.921 --> 00:21:35.060
and it's a very sort of,
um,
somebody saw it.
Yeah.

374
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.133
It's,

375
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:42.470
it's very self contained in a sense like set and scale wise and the actors wise.

376
00:21:42.471 --> 00:21:44.690
And then source code is sort of a step up from that.

377
00:21:44.691 --> 00:21:49.691
And then you just went completely all and what's next?

378
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:55.760
<v 2>Uh,
little little film called little smaller film,
more like source code sized.
Um,</v>

379
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.560
I'm going to do a film that I've been my don Quixote,

380
00:21:58.561 --> 00:22:01.280
which is this Scifi film called Mute.
Um,

381
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.950
that's based in Berlin and I'm doing it with Paul Rudd and Alexander Skarsgard.

382
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.400
Um,
and a couple of other very cool people who haven't been announced yet,

383
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.350
but we'll be shooting that towards the end of the year.

384
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.850
<v 5>Um,
I'd love to know for all you,
there's such a huge fan base for this,</v>

385
00:22:13.851 --> 00:22:16.520
like what's been one of the best fan interactions that you've had

386
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.370
<v 3>so far from</v>

387
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.300
<v 4>this fruit?
From this,
but yes,
uh,
from you,
you should talk about music</v>

388
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.950
from a film that hasn't been done yet.
Yeah,
no,
fair enough.
Cause I just,

389
00:22:30.951 --> 00:22:33.470
cause I had a very strange occurrence.
I was in Shreveport,

390
00:22:33.471 --> 00:22:38.471
Louisiana and a guy came up and his girlfriend brought him over and was like Joe

391
00:22:38.571 --> 00:22:40.640
and show him and he pulled down his pants

392
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.750
and on his cheek and top thigh,

393
00:22:44.751 --> 00:22:49.130
he had Johnny quit as rock and roller with the guns.
And he was like,
you know,

394
00:22:49.131 --> 00:22:50.570
this guy was like,
well yeah,

395
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:54.980
I mean I played that guy and he would not believe it.
He just,
no,

396
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.290
I mean he was screaming and swearing off as mine.

397
00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:02.960
Why did you show me that you're English?
I was like,
oh,
all right.
Yeah,

398
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.770
I mean for this and no one knows yet.
I think we're waiting

399
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.000
<v 3>for that.
But yeah.
Yeah,
I know I don't,
I don't,</v>

400
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.890
the fun is yet to come.
Let's see.
Cause see,

401
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.600
<v 2>we'll be doing the conventions in like 40 years time.</v>

402
00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.190
The three of us will sit in there.

403
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:26.110
<v 5>People coming up with a corona,
tattoos.
I mean,
you're a toy now.
You've</v>

404
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.850
got to be a little surreal.
Oh yeah.
Okay.

405
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.140
<v 3>Chorus where you see things like that.
It's unreal.
Absolutely.
But haven't,
I mean,</v>

406
00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:39.880
I don't think anybody's put two and two together to have,
you know,
a fan

407
00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.430
<v 4>when the movie comes out,
whenever we can,
when the movie comes out,</v>

408
00:23:42.431 --> 00:23:45.590
there'll be some Google searches going to fuck around with the test.

409
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.080
<v 2>The fan fiction fan pictures.
And Colonel,
did I ever,</v>

410
00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:54.050
<v 0>um,
everyone we have an audience,
Mike,
if anyone wants to ask a question,</v>

411
00:23:54.051 --> 00:23:57.470
if you guys want to line up in the middle,
um,
I,

412
00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.590
this might be a tough question for you,
but you have a little one on the way.

413
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:03.410
Yeah.
Do you have a preference if they go alliance or hoard?

414
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.100
Uh,
do I have a preference?
Yeah.

415
00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.380
<v 2>Connie and I hope they go home.</v>

416
00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.870
<v 0>You heard it here</v>

417
00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:16.860
<v 2>Mayans,
because then they're much,
much better behaved.
Right?</v>

418
00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.500
But better behaved will be.
Yeah.
Elias.

419
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:24.920
<v 4>Yes.
Hello.
Question is for Dunkin,</v>

420
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:28.490
uh,
moon and source code where amazing.
Uh,

421
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:33.080
and then I saw a trailer for Warcraft and then I saw your name on it and then I

422
00:24:33.081 --> 00:24:34.190
was like,
what happened?

423
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.520
<v 0>Oh,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa.</v>

424
00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:41.270
Let's say that that came out wrong.

425
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:48.910
<v 4>What I mean is I didn't expect that I like,
and um,</v>

426
00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:51.060
and I didn't know what to think at first.
And then,
uh,

427
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.440
like yesterday or two days ago,
I read something on the Internet,

428
00:24:53.441 --> 00:24:58.150
which I'm sure is a credible source for things that said that like,
um,

429
00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.250
you were imposing all these different,
uh,

430
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:04.900
interesting new artistic visions on things like limiting the ILM guys to like,

431
00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:09.610
uh,
not change the expressions of the CG characters with the mocap characters.

432
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:10.280
Um,

433
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.390
<v 2>yeah.
Don't mess with Toby's MOCAP.
Yeah.
So rule number one.</v>

434
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.890
So I'm interested just like what,

435
00:25:16.891 --> 00:25:20.990
what did turn you onto making a big epic film based on a video game

436
00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:23.630
<v 4>and,
and then how have you,</v>

437
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.690
what are some other ways that you've made it your own that's different from like

438
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.680
industry standards?

439
00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:29.373
<v 0>MMM,</v>

440
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:36.320
<v 4>gees.
Sorry,
not to jump on it,
but it's hard for him to sit,
but,</v>

441
00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.820
but as an act to watching,
you know,

442
00:25:37.821 --> 00:25:40.190
what's incredible about a really good director of the high,

443
00:25:40.191 --> 00:25:44.000
high level is they know when to say no,
not always about the yeses.

444
00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:47.540
And you often see Dunkin a situation with people and it's like,

445
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:49.400
I hate to use this because it's so violent,

446
00:25:49.401 --> 00:25:51.560
but if you're shooting a gun at someone,
nudges your elbow,

447
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.410
it may be a millimeter here but it's two feet off over there.

448
00:25:54.411 --> 00:25:58.310
So he was very good about keeping a very steady aim constantly.

449
00:25:58.311 --> 00:26:02.000
And that felt amazing for us as actors.
I think that's very important.

450
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:05.620
<v 2>It's weird.
All of Toby's metaphors involves shooting guns,</v>

451
00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:08.560
<v 0>love restraint,</v>

452
00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:13.350
that works for that too.

453
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.400
<v 2>Mood,
mood in source code.</v>

454
00:26:16.401 --> 00:26:19.510
Obviously we'll sort of more like capsule pieces where you know,

455
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.280
once in a moon base once I'm trying.
Uh,
but,

456
00:26:22.281 --> 00:26:25.700
but each one of them had individual challenges.

457
00:26:25.701 --> 00:26:29.430
Obviously with moon we have one actor performing with himself and uh,

458
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.590
there's a technical puzzle that needs to be solved for that source code had a

459
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:36.830
different puzzle,
which was take a loop of story,

460
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:40.790
try and keep it interesting and different each time it's retold.
Um,

461
00:26:40.791 --> 00:26:45.620
so I've always looked for,
I've always looked for difficult projects and,
and,

462
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.730
and with Warcraft,
I was a fan.
I've been,

463
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:50.970
I was truly a fan of all the Warcraft games right from the very beginning.

464
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.370
I love fantasy movies.
You know,
when I was growing up,

465
00:26:53.371 --> 00:26:58.170
I love Scifi and fantasy and this was an opportunity to make a big fantasy film

466
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.850
and hopefully try and reach the same level that I felt like Peter Jackson's

467
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:07.440
original Lord of the rings trilogy had had basically set it for all fantasy,

468
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.720
but at the same time give it its own,
you know,

469
00:27:09.721 --> 00:27:13.800
make it a little bit more room in the fantasy genre because I think fantasy is a

470
00:27:13.801 --> 00:27:17.310
lot more constrained in what people are used to.

471
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:21.750
Then science fiction for instance,
which has loads of sub genres.
Yeah.
Um,
so yeah,

472
00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:22.480
that's what we were trying to,
yeah.

473
00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.730
<v 3>I don't know anything about technical anything,</v>

474
00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.750
but I tell you that it's like nothing I've ever seen before because of that.

475
00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.710
It's,
these visitors go on and on and I have a vantage point.
I keep talking,

476
00:27:32.711 --> 00:27:33.880
I don't know how this is,

477
00:27:33.881 --> 00:27:38.080
but I watched an imax and I watched it like an audience member and I was,

478
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.110
I'm real,
I don't know exactly what you did,

479
00:27:41.111 --> 00:27:45.070
but you clearly did something different and new and clearly the way that you

480
00:27:45.071 --> 00:27:47.710
feel about the CGI characters,
that not knowing that,

481
00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:51.580
cause I was Kinda don't take this the wrong way.
Turned on by an org,

482
00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:56.050
which I was like,
oh my God,
why do I think Dorian is hot?
Because heavy,

483
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:57.320
<v 0>he like maybe</v>

484
00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:05.530
the Brad Pitt of books,
but the work he did

485
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:10.260
<v 3>just sort of push them to the limit.
And I guess the nose too and all of it.</v>

486
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.330
It makes it seem like something I've never seen before and uh,

487
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:19.290
it's magnificent really.
I have to say that
I'm super excited.

488
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.240
Oh good.
Without spoilers.

489
00:28:21.241 --> 00:28:24.990
I will say there were moments that reminded me visually of like playing games.

490
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.290
Okay.

491
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.210
<v 0>But not in a way that took me out of the film.
I was just like,
oh,</v>

492
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.190
this would be like if I was playing like from,
you know,

493
00:28:29.191 --> 00:28:31.650
it kept it a Flagstar one or the remote too.
I was like,
yeah,

494
00:28:31.651 --> 00:28:35.130
this reminds me of like why that type of character would make that type of

495
00:28:35.131 --> 00:28:37.110
attack.
It was super nerdy

496
00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.450
<v 2>before you noise if you're going to make a,</v>

497
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:42.130
if we can make a film based on a game,

498
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.680
don't try and give people the same experiences playing the game,

499
00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.540
but but still as a,

500
00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:51.780
as a fan and a player of those games where where there were moments for the

501
00:28:51.971 --> 00:28:55.870
camera to do things or to set things up in a way that are reminiscent of the

502
00:28:55.871 --> 00:28:57.700
experience.
We tried to do it in a,

503
00:28:57.701 --> 00:29:00.940
in a way that doesn't draw people who don't know the game out of the film,

504
00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:06.100
but you know they're the,
it is full of Easter eggs.
It is a,
yeah.

505
00:29:06.101 --> 00:29:07.150
There's a lot of Easter eggs in it.

506
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:12.970
<v 6>Some of you think that we're approaching the end of days in our own world have</v>

507
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.440
different political thanks for that.
Yeah,

508
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.430
<v 0>go ahead.</v>

509
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:22.340
<v 6>I'm really curious how much you might've included concepts from current world</v>

510
00:29:22.971 --> 00:29:27.210
events in a,
and you're thinking about about that,
about this world?
It's

511
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.960
<v 2>strange.
We've,
we've had a lot of,
um,
we've been doing a lot of press lately and,</v>

512
00:29:31.961 --> 00:29:35.350
and obviously we do domestic press and then you do international press and

513
00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.340
talking to the journalists on the international press.
A lot of them,

514
00:29:39.341 --> 00:29:41.530
especially the Europeans have asking.

515
00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:46.210
So how has the immigration situation in Europe and in Germany and France played

516
00:29:46.211 --> 00:29:47.590
into what you've done with Warcraft?

517
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.080
Obviously we were making the film three and a half years ago,

518
00:29:50.081 --> 00:29:53.830
so we had no idea what,
what,
what's the situation in Europe is going to be.

519
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:54.731
But you know,

520
00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:59.731
people will obviously pick up and read into things that are happening in the

521
00:29:59.741 --> 00:30:00.574
real world.

522
00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:05.580
Certainly our story follows very universal themes about the idea of one group of

523
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:10.780
people losing their home and having to find a new home in a place where other

524
00:30:10.781 --> 00:30:15.220
people already exist.
So,
you know,
there's that,
but it's no more than that.

525
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.510
And that existed in,
in Warcraft Lore for 20 years.

526
00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:23.830
That's the very premise of that universe is that these two very,

527
00:30:23.831 --> 00:30:25.350
very different races have had,

528
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.840
I've been fighting because they can't find a way to coexist.

529
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:30.123
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

530
00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.020
<v 7>Hello.</v>

531
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:37.020
I'm a huge fan of moon and source code and I was wondering how you found working

532
00:30:37.571 --> 00:30:39.340
with an existing Ip,

533
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.720
both in terms of expectations from the licensed holders and the fans versus

534
00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:44.950
making your own things.

535
00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.490
<v 2>There's a certain responsibility,
um,</v>

536
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:54.970
to try and incorporate as much as of the,

537
00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
of the trunk of the idea of what Warcraft is and the lore and the characters as

538
00:31:00.101 --> 00:31:02.170
possible.
At the same time,

539
00:31:02.171 --> 00:31:06.880
I want Paula and I want Toby and I want everyone else involved to be able to

540
00:31:06.881 --> 00:31:10.360
create their characters because they're not going to feel real and less,

541
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:15.370
you know,
Toby knows why he's doing what he's doing and believes it and feels it.

542
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.600
And the same for Paula,

543
00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:21.130
why she feels like she doesn't fit in this society or that society.
Um,

544
00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:26.050
so you're,
you're constantly playing a,
uh,
you know,
I'm,

545
00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:28.720
I'm,
I'm the chief chief diplomat of the movie.

546
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:33.930
My job is to make sure that blizzard feel heard and that we are creating

547
00:31:35.021 --> 00:31:38.230
something which feels true to what they,
you know,
to a,

548
00:31:38.231 --> 00:31:42.040
to a legacy that they have 20 years worth of storytelling.

549
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:46.150
And then also deliver a film that the studios and the producers feel like an

550
00:31:46.151 --> 00:31:50.020
audience beyond just the fan base is going to enjoy.
And at the same time,

551
00:31:50.021 --> 00:31:50.740
letting my,

552
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.740
my cast feel like they can additively put their themselves and what they feel

553
00:31:56.651 --> 00:31:59.890
about their characters into the movie.
So you know,
you do,
you do,

554
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:04.090
you do end up doing a lot of diplomatic work and,
and hopefully,
you know,

555
00:32:04.091 --> 00:32:06.580
you get to put a little bit of your own stuff in there at the same time.

556
00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.350
<v 7>So two questions.
One,
because we were here at Google,</v>

557
00:32:12.351 --> 00:32:15.680
I wanted to know if there's any thoughts of doing a source code to with,

558
00:32:15.681 --> 00:32:17.750
you know,
more actual source code in it,

559
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.270
but more seriously,
uh,

560
00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:29.080
this one's got a lot of CG obviously and a lot of world construction,
uh,

561
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:31.850
as you know,
film professionals.

562
00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:37.540
Do you guys see more of this virtual reality entertainment intersecting with

563
00:32:37.941 --> 00:32:42.200
what you will be to do over the course of your remaining careers?

564
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:47.470
<v 4>Well,
you've just a couple of been her,
which is,
yeah.
Which is all live action.</v>

565
00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:52.090
All live action.
Pretty much.
Yeah.
We're pulling for real horses,
that whole thing.

566
00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:52.690
Um,

567
00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:56.920
I would like rather though to speak on our motion capture because it's a funny

568
00:32:56.921 --> 00:32:57.820
time right now.
You know,

569
00:32:57.821 --> 00:33:02.821
it's a very few select group of people who understand that what you do motivates

570
00:33:03.851 --> 00:33:07.240
that incredibly beautifully drawn,
created character.

571
00:33:07.241 --> 00:33:10.210
So it's basically a skin that is lifeless,
that has the dots.

572
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.880
Preston speaking on the,
on the code.

573
00:33:12.881 --> 00:33:16.930
So the information that we give,
it's,
it's not a,

574
00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.750
it's not a path that's going to lead you to great fame,
but it's,

575
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:25.060
it's going to be vitally important for telling these stories because even now I

576
00:33:25.061 --> 00:33:28.900
watched a nice guys last night and they pan over the freeway,

577
00:33:28.901 --> 00:33:30.460
come to him sitting in a car,

578
00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:34.660
they're all computer generated cars and that just saves a vast amount of money.

579
00:33:34.661 --> 00:33:39.661
So you can tell a good story without having to get 86 cars from.

580
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.670
And that in turn can put people out of business.
But you know,

581
00:33:42.671 --> 00:33:45.070
things need to be rendered and captured.
And I think there's,

582
00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:49.870
there needs to be some conversations about ownership of movement.

583
00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:53.430
<v 2>I had a conversation with Jeff White at Ilm about could you have,</v>

584
00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:54.360
not that you'd want to,

585
00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:58.500
unless you wanted Ryan Gosling to play Toby Kebbell and a movie,

586
00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:04.110
could you have his scanned and then have another actor play that body in a

587
00:34:04.111 --> 00:34:06.330
movie?
Have we reached the point where the,

588
00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:10.410
the fidelity is so good that an actual physical person,
you know,

589
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:13.290
it could be played by someone else and they didn't have an answer,

590
00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:18.110
which was kind of interesting to me that no one,
I mean,
I guess the,

591
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:22.200
I guess the reason no one's done it because the obvious choices you hire Toby

592
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.800
Kebbell but I don't want to hire Toby Kebbell Ryan goes does,

593
00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:29.670
but I want Ryan Gosling to play as Toby Kebbell in a movie.
How can you know?

594
00:34:29.671 --> 00:34:34.460
Can I do that?
Uh,
I don't know.
We may never know.
Very good.

595
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.700
Might have just given them an idea is about,
you might have done,

596
00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:38.571
<v 7>why don't we,</v>

597
00:34:38.571 --> 00:34:41.590
we've got at least one Oscar winning effects person here in the audience.
So

598
00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:43.743
<v 4>cool.</v>

599
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:49.900
<v 7>Uh,
so Warcraft is a world with like a lot of lore and backstory.</v>

600
00:34:49.901 --> 00:34:53.890
Like you could probably make dozens of movies across like the whole series a,

601
00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:58.480
was it difficult to try to explain it without spending too long?

602
00:34:58.481 --> 00:35:01.930
Just like setting up why everyone's here and why they're doing what they're

603
00:35:01.931 --> 00:35:02.764
doing.

604
00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:03.730
<v 4>Okay.</v>

605
00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:04.900
<v 2>I think working with blizzard,</v>

606
00:35:04.901 --> 00:35:09.460
we were able to agree early on that there was no way we were going to be able to

607
00:35:09.461 --> 00:35:13.480
tell the this big gap that Begat,
that Begat,
that begat that story,

608
00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:15.280
which is what you know,
you end up with.

609
00:35:15.281 --> 00:35:17.830
And Warcraft because they've been making these games for 20 years.

610
00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:21.790
So we went to what seemed the most sensible point,
which is the,

611
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.950
the first contact story between ORCS and humans.
Um,
and then we chose a very,

612
00:35:26.951 --> 00:35:30.310
very thin slice of that story.
So this is literally,

613
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.740
the ORCS are about to go through the doc portal.

614
00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.690
So there were about to leave their home world.

615
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:38.130
We understand why they have to leave their home world and they're invading this

616
00:35:38.131 --> 00:35:41.220
new world.
And I think by choosing that very thin slices,

617
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:46.370
we're able to fill that slice up with all of the detail that it needs to in

618
00:35:46.651 --> 00:35:50.040
order to feel real and to not feel like you're being shortchanged.

619
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.160
It also actually happens to work very nicely for an audience who may know

620
00:35:56.011 --> 00:35:59.910
nothing about Warcraft because it's simple enough and I think we're,
it's a,

621
00:35:59.911 --> 00:36:03.540
it's a,
it's a situation that an audience beyond Warcraft can understand

622
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:07.340
<v 4>and at the same time have a great deal of friends and I'm like,
just be patient.</v>

623
00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.970
Hopefully there'll be more successful.
Your bit you love will come along,

624
00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:11.953
you know what I mean?
So,

625
00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.910
<v 3>yeah.
Thank you.
We'll take our last audience question.</v>

626
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:20.260
<v 8>That's one of our question about the motion capture and it's sort of the</v>

627
00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.060
interaction.
Do you guys,

628
00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.440
do you have some thoughts on whether it's harder to play opposite emotion

629
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:31.280
capture person or to be the motion capture person playing without actually

630
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:33.650
having hold up props and things?

631
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:38.580
<v 4>Uh,
we're,
we're quite enjoyed working with you.
Thank you.
I enjoyed it.</v>

632
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:42.730
She said very,
very dedicated,
very fee.
I mean,
by the way,
their worst.

633
00:36:42.731 --> 00:36:44.990
She did have strings on her back when she leapt on that hot,

634
00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.330
but I saw them slack.

635
00:36:46.331 --> 00:36:50.950
I'm certain I saw them haven't very dedicated,
very hardworking.

636
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:55.210
I,
I just had that I've caught at the right point.
So from planet of the apes,

637
00:36:55.211 --> 00:36:58.300
we would do a version with the humans.
I mean aversion,

638
00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:03.010
36 versions of let's say 36 takes with the humans so that everything was

639
00:37:03.011 --> 00:37:05.590
technically right and they got everything.
And then we'll do a clean slate,

640
00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:09.730
which is where the humans who were in the scene or just the sets that are in the

641
00:37:09.731 --> 00:37:13.960
scene,
I shop clean so the plate can have everything added later on.

642
00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:15.320
<v 8>Okay.</v>

643
00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:19.900
<v 2>But,
but it's easy,
easy if you,
cause you get to look,
pull a pattern.</v>

644
00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.130
You'll cause she has to look.
John and yourself a pajamas.

645
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.440
<v 4>Tyler,
I'm Catholic and English</v>

646
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:28.900
was it

647
00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:33.973
anyways,
sorry.

648
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.680
<v 3>So that's the thing is that um,
I don't know,</v>

649
00:37:38.681 --> 00:37:42.210
to me it's all a game of make believe.
That's what I love about acting,

650
00:37:42.211 --> 00:37:46.320
so I can easily in my mind,
ah,

651
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:49.440
go past the blue pajamas in the blue and the dots and,

652
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:54.330
and it didn't affect the performance for me.
I mean,
I just,
I was Toby,

653
00:37:54.331 --> 00:37:58.410
he was giving me this character.
He was connecting to me through his eyes,

654
00:37:58.411 --> 00:38:02.580
through soul and,
and vice versa.
And so it worked.
I mean,

655
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.150
I was so thankful because honestly I didn't know what I was getting myself into.

656
00:38:06.151 --> 00:38:07.500
I've never done a movie like this.

657
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:11.160
I didn't know if it was going to be a tennis ball and a big blue room.

658
00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:14.810
I didn't know how it was going to go down.
And then I was so,

659
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:20.280
so happily surprised that it wasn't that.
Yeah.
I think that just like life,
right?

660
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:21.900
You think you don't like certain people you,

661
00:38:21.901 --> 00:38:26.130
but you get past any of it by looking through and you see their heart and their

662
00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:28.310
soul and nothing about the exterior mount.
Okay.

663
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:31.000
<v 2>I think it really helped that the producers really worked,
you know,</v>

664
00:38:31.001 --> 00:38:35.380
helped us out in that they kind of structured things so that by the time were

665
00:38:35.381 --> 00:38:38.920
ready for those scenes where Paula and our other human cast,

666
00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:41.600
we're going to be interacting with our motion capture costs.

667
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:46.800
We had started to receive work from Ilm that actually showed proof of concept

668
00:38:47.171 --> 00:38:49.750
that this was actually going to work and it looked like this and it was amazing.

669
00:38:49.751 --> 00:38:50.690
And the and and the,

670
00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:54.280
the faces looked real than they look like the performances that are actors were

671
00:38:54.281 --> 00:38:54.850
giving.

672
00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:56.820
<v 4>So I think you always have help it,
you haven't burned out,</v>

673
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.860
but you always had a life size statue.
Yeah,
the oryx.

674
00:38:59.861 --> 00:39:04.210
So that was always on set to remember for scale and mass.
We had that on onset.

675
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.100
So you always know that that was way before.
And so that's the thing,

676
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:11.260
that's the adjustment is we are now allowed to interact with the actors.

677
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.380
Whereas before we would have to go into a volume with the cameras and just do

678
00:39:14.381 --> 00:39:17.200
the performance and watch a tape of them,
you know.

679
00:39:17.201 --> 00:39:20.140
So now we get to do the live thing.
It gives it a real performance.

680
00:39:20.141 --> 00:39:21.700
It gives it more genuine feeling.

681
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:24.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

682
00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:28.000
<v 5>So I think my very last question is,
uh,
so the game world of Warcraft,</v>

683
00:39:28.001 --> 00:39:30.400
I feel like changed people's lives.
Like people got married,

684
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:33.810
like met and got married off of this game in the real world.
Yeah.

685
00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.180
I think people hold it in a dear place in their hearts.

686
00:39:37.181 --> 00:39:39.700
And so what's one thing that you hope people take away from the film?

687
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.983
<v 1>The trash.</v>

688
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:48.650
<v 0>And we're done.
All right.
Thank you so much.
And now
look,</v>

689
00:39:48.651 --> 00:39:50.420
I think one of the things that was great about the game

690
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:55.110
<v 2>of Warcraft,
both the,
the old one in the world of Warcraft was the heroes can,</v>

691
00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.890
you can,
you can play as the euro on all sides.
And,
and I love,
I just like,

692
00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.070
I liked that idea that,
that you can be the hero.
You know,

693
00:40:02.071 --> 00:40:05.790
no matter where you come from,
most unexpected people,
the most unexpected places,

694
00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:10.390
um,
that,
that's where the heroes can be.
And I know that sounds a little,
you know,

695
00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:14.660
I dunno,
I like optimistic wishful thinking.
I like that.
Yeah.

696
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.830
<v 5>Hi.
I get to romantic.
Well,
thank you all.
Some would,
oh,</v>

697
00:40:19.831 --> 00:40:23.730
sorry.
Did you?
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
All right.
I'm going.
Um,
yeah,

698
00:40:23.731 --> 00:40:25.720
so thank you all so much for joining us.
And we'll see.
Warcraft is it,

699
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:31.040
