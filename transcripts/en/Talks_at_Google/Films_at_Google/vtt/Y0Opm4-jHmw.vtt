00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.720
Hello everyone.
Welcome to talks at Google.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.750
I'm Kevin Bell can today we have Ben Dickinson and Reggie watts for creative

3
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:10.794
control.

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.140
<v 1>Let's go.</v>

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.410
<v 0>And middlemen.
Hello.</v>

6
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.520
Hello her Clark.

7
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.960
So welcome guys.
Oh,
it's so good to finally be here in the future.
Yes,
I hear you.

8
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.670
I was waiting for so fucking long.
That was like,
was it 15?
Oh God.

9
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.790
Okay.
All right.
Uh,
we had him in a terrible conference room upstairs,

10
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:45.740
so my apologies.
No windows.
It's okay,
man.
So,
uh,
Ben,

11
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.640
you wrote and directed this film,
so creative control,
uh,
uh,
you know,

12
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:54.560
it was a huge hit over in south by southwest and it was picked up by Amazon

13
00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:58.190
studios.
So tell us about the film and,
uh,
just the plot line of the story.

14
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.950
The movie takes place in a tech ad agency,
uh,

15
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.780
where a guy is trying to sell,

16
00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:10.781
testing out the first generation of augmented reality glasses system,

17
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.580
like a fully immersive ar system.

18
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.260
And in the course of,
uh,
playing around with them,

19
00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:19.094
he

20
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.380
makes some very lifelike avatar of his best friend's girlfriend he's obsessed

21
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:28.930
with and it works out great.
There's no,
there's no problem.

22
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.700
No drama at all.
No problems are caused.
And um,

23
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.940
can you get his a weird sexual needs worked out and his relationship with his

24
00:01:34.941 --> 00:01:36.400
girlfriend is totally functional and,

25
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.550
and move is actually only 20 minutes walk and it's actually just an

26
00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:44.780
advertisement for augmented the company that's making the glasses.

27
00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:46.460
It'll come out in the future.
So

28
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.830
where'd the idea come from this film?
Um,

29
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.140
frustration like were most writing comes from because writing is so hard.

30
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.500
If the only reason you would do it is if you just have like screaming demons,

31
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:06.680
like climbing inside your brain,
like I have to get this out.
Um,

32
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.310
so that's why I wrote it because I was just pissed.

33
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.670
I was just pissed off.
But where'd the idea come from?

34
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:17.300
So where was the judge of that?
Of I just the collective unconscious,

35
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:20.590
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
No,
no.
Honestly Google glass came out.
Did someone,

36
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.410
did you guys know what?
You're a king,
what was it?
11 2011?
Yeah.
Nobody remembers.

37
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.450
No.
Have you guys been forbidden about talking about it every day?

38
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.890
Just like it never happened.
Never happened.
You're like,
yes,
we agree.

39
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.950
It's just for engineers.
Okay,
well,
in an alternate reality,
uh,

40
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.030
there was this product called Google glass,
which was wildly successful

41
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.800
when it came out.
Um,
I was like,
I see where this is going.

42
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:45.620
Like this has got to be basically an immersive smartphone,

43
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.580
but kind of really not in your way.
Um,

44
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.260
so it seemed obvious that was happening.

45
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:55.630
And so I started researching it and talking a lot with,
uh,

46
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.070
my friend Jake Lodwick,
who was in the movie who started,
um,

47
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.410
we started talking about just what will we want it to be like,
what would be an,

48
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.090
and the funny thing is that at the movie is a satire.
And,
uh,
but we,

49
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.210
the research and development of the,

50
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.870
of the tech aspect was a labor of love.
And like,
we were like,

51
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.140
we really wanted this technology.
So it's funny that then I'm like,
oh,

52
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:22.690
but it's a sad story.
And then,

53
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:25.450
so Reggie and I talked about a lot to everybody who I know who's super into

54
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:28.530
futurism type stuff was sending the article,

55
00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:30.930
like every article who was coming out.
Um,

56
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.150
but I mean it's kind of hot and now it feels obvious,
right.

57
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.520
Where you were you guys friends before,
they didn't know each other before.

58
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.290
We don't like each other now.
No.
Yeah,

59
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.910
we knew we worked on several projects together.
Yeah.

60
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.170
Cause you were in music videos and Chet phones before that.
Right?
Yeah.
Merging.

61
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:51.220
I did a fuck shit stack video together.
Yup.
I'm still proud of that.

62
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.050
<v 2>You kind of at that video,
it's real dumb.</v>

63
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.290
Well,
so it should say,
so you've started the phone with me and you're the lead.

64
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.430
David,
I,
I didn't mention that.
So you do,
you start in the film,

65
00:04:04.431 --> 00:04:09.020
but you also Reggie playing Reggie,
Reggie in the film.

66
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.530
And so when you're creating that,
were you,
was that just an idea that you'd like,

67
00:04:12.531 --> 00:04:15.230
oh,
I have to get them in there or oh,
I have this role.
Oh,

68
00:04:15.231 --> 00:04:18.520
you'd be perfect for it.
I wrote it for Reggie and it wasn't,

69
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:19.520
he wasn't in the initial

70
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.160
<v 0>a couple of drafts.
Um,
there was,
there was something else in that place.</v>

71
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:27.370
It took time for me to realize that I needed,
uh,

72
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.950
some comic relief.
Uh,
but also,
um,

73
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.410
I think Reggie has a really great way is a great relationship with technology in

74
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:40.130
general.
And,
um,

75
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.570
since I was kind of pointing out some of the darker aspects,

76
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:48.571
I wanted to that to be balanced out with this kind of court gesture character.

77
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.920
And also I mentioned that earlier,

78
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:55.030
like just narratively its functional because the main characters are all very

79
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:58.930
self serious and are very wrapped up in their neuroses.

80
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.310
So to have like a court jester come in and sort of shift the whole,
um,

81
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.350
the scale kind of in a way the scale of the,
can you talk about your role?

82
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.480
<v 2>It's phenomenal.
Oh thanks.
So,
um,</v>

83
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.100
I mean yeah,
I mean you know,

84
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.060
Ben just described it as myself of slightly in the future,
uh,

85
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.450
in this particular context where I'm kind of brought in inside of the movie as

86
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.500
my character has myself brought into the movie to kind of show what what's

87
00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:32.590
possible with the technology,
um,

88
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.010
and to kind of drive it to some limits or maybe break some limits.
So,
um,

89
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.490
yeah,
it was,
uh,
it was pretty simple really.

90
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.750
I just kind of showed up and just riffed like I normally rift and um,

91
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.300
Ben was there to,
you know,

92
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.850
kind of steer it a little bit and try not to laugh and try it.
Yeah.

93
00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:53.510
Try Not to laugh so many times he just be like,
and be like,
all right,

94
00:05:53.511 --> 00:05:56.960
this being recorded
with film.
There's also

95
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.910
<v 0>heck,
you have to go back to films to leverage one thing that you haven't,</v>

96
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.980
you have,
sorry guys.
We're hold production.

97
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:08.350
I'm going to go to film school for a minute.
Yeah.
Uh,
I mean it was a bit,
yeah,

98
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.910
it was very simple,
very straight forward.
Very,
very easy.

99
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:14.690
I understood exactly what the technology was about and uh,
something I've,

100
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:18.350
I've thought of her.
It was easy for Reggie to imagine himself,
you know,

101
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.710
a lot of time in the movie,
he's a Hologram,
you know,
kind of like,

102
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.470
kind of like the emperor and empire strikes back.
Just going to,

103
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.730
it's like,
I know who you are.
The same guys,
the,
anyways,

104
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.760
wait,
what?
Some of the best,

105
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:38.720
some of the funniest lines in the movie are,
are Reggie just made up on set.
So

106
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.240
you didn't really write that.
You were just kind of saying,
hey no,
he's just real.

107
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.480
He'll script for the movie.
We just showed up every day.
We just

108
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.620
so naturalistic.
I mean,
but you could've put him say,

109
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:56.000
hey this is what we're trying to get out of it,

110
00:06:56.001 --> 00:07:00.500
but kind of go with it and improve it.
And the movie has a lot of master shots.

111
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:02.760
There's a lot of scenes that are all one shot in the movie.
Um,

112
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.470
but for the scenes that Reggie's and I tended to do coverage too.

113
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.420
So just so I can get,
um,
when he does sort of a stream of consciousness,

114
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:15.320
I have to be able to like loop stuff together sometimes with time in the movie.

115
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:19.700
So,
and that was uh,
it was great because the movie's so formerly rigorous.

116
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.300
But then when Reggie comes in everything kind of breeds a little bit.
Like,

117
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.330
oh there was one of my questions actually was about the one shots and stuff like

118
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:30.290
that.
Cause it's funny cause it's,
you necessarily don't know some of the first,

119
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:34.140
but you feel like,
oh my God,
like you're really,
really engaged.
So what was,

120
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.350
what would cause those are difficult to do.

121
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:39.380
So what was the planning for that and the decision just to do them?

122
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:41.030
Was it more of a challenge just for yourself?
Like,
Hey,

123
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:45.410
can I do this or was it just,
yeah,
some of it's just,
yeah,

124
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.940
just being lazy and not wanting to do coverage.
Yeah.
Seeing if I can pull it off.

125
00:07:49.941 --> 00:07:54.650
But,
um,
more importantly than that,
when you watch in movies,

126
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:58.130
we have time,
but it's not used very often.
Usually.
Um,

127
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:03.310
the editing is used in a way to kind of keep you in a trance a little bit.

128
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.430
There's like always forward momentum and stuff.
Um,
but when you shoot a scene,

129
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:09.890
especially of people talking in one shot,

130
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.220
you have the sense of it being more like real life,
you know,

131
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.380
that you're in a suspended moment of time.
Um,

132
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:21.770
and I think that has a subconscious effect,
um,
for,
for an audience,

133
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:26.420
even if they're not aware,
you just,
it just feels different.
And um,
yeah,

134
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:29.810
it makes it,
it makes it feel a little bit more real in some ways.
Just like,

135
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:33.680
it's like the people are real.
Um,
for sure.
And we were,

136
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:34.940
we were talking about this upstairs too,

137
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:38.750
was just about virtual reality and where it's going and with the stuff with

138
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.420
cardboard and oculus and Samsung and stuff like that.

139
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:43.220
So you guys are so you love it.

140
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:47.900
We were talking about that and where you that much into it beforehand as well or

141
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.960
was this just something you kind of stumbled upon?
Cause it was an idea,
um,

142
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.620
and to our air and uh,
yeah,

143
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:58.320
I didn't get into it until I needed it to as a narrative device in a movie.

144
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.750
And it wasn't even in the original and the original draft,

145
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.670
the component of ar glasses with kind of like a little flourish,

146
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.590
you know,
like,
uh,
it was like a theme.
Um,
but then when I was writing it,
you know,

147
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:12.090
movies kind of want to be,

148
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.140
as much as I always think I'm making more like a European art house movie.

149
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.190
I just,

150
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:22.190
I think I just love star wars when I was a kid and I always have this attraction

151
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:25.840
towards,
um,
even if I'm trying to deconstruct narrative,

152
00:09:25.841 --> 00:09:30.660
it always seems to just kind of lean in the direction of genre even.

153
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:35.140
And so there's a lot of ideas in the,
I mean there's a,

154
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.850
there's a lot of ideas and worlds I'm trying to balance in the movie in order to

155
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:43.110
do that.
Um,
I just needed this through line.

156
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.630
And so then the,
the glasses became really the plot in a way I didn't expect.

157
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.150
Right.
And just by writing it in Reggie,

158
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:53.970
what was your experience with Vr and cause you're really into it.

159
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:58.900
You seem to love it.
Yeah,
I'm very into it.
Um,
uh,
yeah.

160
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.980
<v 2>I mean,
ever since I was a little kid,</v>

161
00:10:00.981 --> 00:10:04.130
I was listening to the idea of being able to,
you know,
uh,

162
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.330
immerse herself in a reality convincingly and feel like you're actually there

163
00:10:08.331 --> 00:10:13.331
and experience some other form of a living without,

164
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.400
without moving anywhere or,
you know,

165
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.050
just putting on something and suddenly you're there.
Um,

166
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:25.160
and then when lawnmower man came out and all of that stuff,

167
00:10:25.161 --> 00:10:26.420
like the promise of like,
yeah,

168
00:10:26.421 --> 00:10:29.600
we'll be in these weird suspended chairs and put it on these,

169
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.420
these things and somehow we'll feel like our bodies and it.
But anyways,

170
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.860
I was just always very interested in transporting myself to other realities that

171
00:10:36.861 --> 00:10:41.150
seem just purely imaginative aside from actually just using your imagination.

172
00:10:41.151 --> 00:10:43.070
So when the,

173
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.320
when the second round of Vr came around and you know,

174
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.180
maybe the mid two thousands where the promise of like,
Oh,

175
00:10:50.181 --> 00:10:51.560
we fixed the parallax problem,

176
00:10:51.561 --> 00:10:54.470
the problem where people put on these headsets and get really,

177
00:10:54.471 --> 00:10:58.070
really dizzy cause it's not functioning the way our eyes work in the real world.

178
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.030
Once they fixed that all sudden something promising started to emerge.

179
00:11:02.031 --> 00:11:03.200
And now we're,
you know,

180
00:11:03.201 --> 00:11:08.180
we're in that moment where we're about to have access to really powerful pieces

181
00:11:08.181 --> 00:11:12.140
of hardware.
And it's just the beginning.
So VR and Ar,

182
00:11:12.141 --> 00:11:15.010
which essentially is just an evolution of Vr,
um,

183
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:20.590
is a very exciting to me because it hopefully can provide some interesting

184
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.480
transparent technological wizardry in our life that doesn't make us feel like

185
00:11:26.481 --> 00:11:30.740
we're taking wrenches to technology and constantly trying to fix it all the
time.

186
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:36.080
And the movie actually explores a lot of the pitfalls of augmented reality and

187
00:11:36.081 --> 00:11:37.100
kind of the dangers of that.

188
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.420
<v 0>What scares you about the current place we're in with Vr?</v>

189
00:11:42.421 --> 00:11:46.080
Ar Robots,
uh,

190
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.780
like they get through an robot.
Thanks for mentioning robot.
I mean,

191
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.280
I mean the doomsday scenarios are,
uh,

192
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.840
easy to talk about an imagine with all of that stuff.
Um,

193
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:04.060
I don't know.
I'm what excites you then?
What excites me?

194
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.870
What excites you about it?
Um,
well,
it's happening.
Yeah.

195
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.750
So
it's true.
I'm trying to,
I'm trying to be interested in the world around me.

196
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.910
Um,
if I can,
we can move on.

197
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.220
Terrible question.
No,
it's not.
You know what?
I don't know.
I don't know.

198
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:26.860
I was just thinking,
I was just thinking about my yard and just

199
00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:34.430
why am I here?
It's probably just dripping.

200
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.490
I got what I got excited about Vr at Sundance this year.
Uh,
we had,
uh,

201
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:42.790
we did a VR project,

202
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:47.910
like a 10 minute short film that was at Sundance this year and I kind of was

203
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:49.510
like,
Eh,
I mean I like doing it,

204
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.630
but once we went to Sundance and I saw a couple of other pieces that people were

205
00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:55.900
doing in the breadth of what people are doing,
um,
in Vr,

206
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.950
I actually did get really excited and it made me feel like a little kid again.

207
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.160
Um,
which,
you know,

208
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.800
if you could sell feeling like a little kid again in a pill,

209
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.330
you'd be rich.
I remember,

210
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.320
I remember a kid on the back of the bus telling me about my lawnmower man.

211
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.140
That was the first time I ever encountered.
And then I remember him being like,

212
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:20.890
yeah,
and then like doing like virtual reality and they're like having sex.

213
00:13:20.891 --> 00:13:25.780
And I was like,
Whoa,
this movie's so amazing.
Like nothing like this.

214
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.540
And then the movie that I imagined,

215
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.840
it was so much better than when I finally got to see it.
Oh my God,

216
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:36.810
that was really disappointed.
I was really disappointed when I came and started

217
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.480
the VR.
It doesn't work very well.
You know Reggie's actually in La.

218
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.620
He projected his consciousness.
Reggie Pod,

219
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.250
I'm just soliciting slightly over here.
Remember it a science fiction,

220
00:13:51.251 --> 00:13:56.230
like young adults science fiction book from the 80s
and they,

221
00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.690
they sort of,
it's all about telepresence.

222
00:13:58.691 --> 00:14:01.690
Like they shoot a kid's consciousness to a body on Mars.

223
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.870
We can visit as ont or something like that.
Oh No,

224
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.050
maybe I just made it.
That was awesome.

225
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.500
I thought it was awesome when I was a kid cause quickly Google it,

226
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.330
Richard,
you know,
you're one of the most,

227
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:21.530
you'd owe God some kind of one of the most unique comedians and artists and

228
00:14:22.121 --> 00:14:25.870
musicians and where so it really showcases in the movie.
It's phenomenal.

229
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:28.960
And it's like,
well this is,
this is completely,
this isn't the Reggie,

230
00:14:28.961 --> 00:14:31.660
I know you were playing like a heightened version of yourself,

231
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:36.490
but where do these influences come from for you simply and comedically?

232
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.090
I mean a lot,
a lot of it just come.
I guess if I think of the,

233
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.550
the basic essence of where it comes from,

234
00:14:42.551 --> 00:14:45.340
it's just being able to transport your imagination,

235
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.220
to transport yourself through imagination,

236
00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:52.250
like reinterpreting the environment around you,
about seeing things differently

237
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:57.250
<v 2>to full immersion or watching a television show or a movie or making,</v>

238
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.670
you know,
being a kid and playing with Gi joes and the dirt.
Um,

239
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.610
like all of anything that incorporates and engage is my imagination.

240
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.900
And that's technology.
That's art,
it's conversations,

241
00:15:08.901 --> 00:15:09.810
it's colors,
it's,

242
00:15:09.811 --> 00:15:14.811
it's really any input that you have access to as a biological organism.

243
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.890
So for me,
it's just,
um,

244
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.140
it's a nonstop interest in,
uh,

245
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.770
life and possibility and reality and,
and most importantly,

246
00:15:27.771 --> 00:15:29.660
connecting with people I don't like making,

247
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:33.940
I don't like being involved in things that are just one sided or cold.
Um,

248
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.400
I like to take things that engineers come up with,
um,

249
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:42.350
who have their own set of criteria and imaginative process and take that and

250
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:47.000
figure out a way to connect people with that technology that's still engages

251
00:15:47.001 --> 00:15:50.690
that feeling that you're talking about feeling like a little kid again because

252
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.040
otherwise it's just a bunch of,

253
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.300
it's just a bunch of stuff that you think is cool but are ultimately not really

254
00:15:56.301 --> 00:15:59.770
that interested in and well,
yeah,

255
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.650
I was just thinking about a technology debt that sets us up and allows us to

256
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:08.470
play as opposed to technology that's designed to be addictive and um,

257
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.620
I think we don't talk about that enough.
Like,
and a lot of times an op Ed,

258
00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:16.250
it's like,
or p people,

259
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.340
people don't realize that the addiction is intentional I think.

260
00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:24.300
And they blame themselves a lot of the time.
You know,
it's just,
it's,

261
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.610
so is that your process is really just trying to like tap into that inner child

262
00:16:28.611 --> 00:16:30.320
and the inner interest and stuff.
It's like,
how do you,

263
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.410
like when you're coming up with a new sets,
a new

264
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.240
album,
whatever the case may be,
what is that to come up with that?

265
00:16:38.241 --> 00:16:39.440
Do you lock yourself away in a room?

266
00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:43.640
Are you going around and watching other artists and trying to get ideas or,
no,

267
00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:44.090
I'm,

268
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:49.090
I'm always going for the absolute absolute laziest way to create anything,

269
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:55.530
which is,
uh,
I think it's underrated,
underrated and to,

270
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.840
it really is,
it really is because for me,
like if I'm like,
if someone's like,

271
00:16:59.841 --> 00:17:04.730
hey man,
you want to record a song in the studio?
Uh,
usually I am,

272
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:09.740
I just say,
okay,
make sure that the mic is set up in advance before I get there.

273
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.240
I'm just going to show up.
I do a bunch of stuff on the microphone.

274
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:16.880
I'm going to quickly adjust things,
structured things very quickly,

275
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.000
and I'm going to let an expert who will my trust aesthetically kind of finish

276
00:17:21.001 --> 00:17:25.780
the idea because I don't want to waste time again,
bogging myself down and,

277
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.730
um,
in technical particulars that I could,

278
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.020
but my role is to really just channel creativity and to surround myself with

279
00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:35.780
people that are so good at what they do,

280
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.670
that it's very easy for them to understand what's happening when I put something

281
00:17:40.671 --> 00:17:44.750
out there and,
um,
or to utilize me in a way like Ben did in this,

282
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.930
in this movie where he's like,
I know this guy does,

283
00:17:46.931 --> 00:17:50.400
I know what he likes and let's just put them in this situation.
And yeah,

284
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.890
of course it's going to work out,
you know?
So for me,

285
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.260
creativity or like thinking about like an album or anything,

286
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:59.040
I want to make it the quickest way possible with the least amount of time

287
00:17:59.041 --> 00:18:03.940
required for filmmaking film that.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,

288
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:08.100
I mean it's funny because,
no,
no,
no,
no,
but,
but that reminds me like,
oh,
even like,

289
00:18:08.101 --> 00:18:10.590
uh,
like for instance if I'm doing a television,

290
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.800
a comedy Bang Bang or something like that and they're like,

291
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:18.120
your mark is here and I start waving my arms and they're like,
oh,

292
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:20.650
I actually could you just make sure your arms are a little bit higher if I'm

293
00:18:20.651 --> 00:18:23.640
like,
this is moving in the wrong direction.
It's moving in the wrong direction.

294
00:18:23.641 --> 00:18:23.941
It's like,

295
00:18:23.941 --> 00:18:28.410
it's like the production or technology should be in service of imagination.

296
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.230
So you should be prepared for anything to happen.

297
00:18:31.231 --> 00:18:33.000
You should have contingencies to be able to,

298
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.420
to make sure that creativity can express itself in the maximum way.

299
00:18:36.421 --> 00:18:40.120
That's not to say that being a total dick and like ruin things like,
but just,

300
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.720
but just like,
we are not prepared to hear.
No,
no.

301
00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.520
It's like I'm laying over here.
Me.
This is California,
right?

302
00:18:47.521 --> 00:18:51.090
Everyone's just like either word.
Hey,
it's Cali man.
It's close to humble.

303
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.400
I don't know.
I don't know what that means.

304
00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.840
It's great though.
They go back

305
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.780
<v 0>on just the,
you know,
you went from,
uh,
the short,
you know,</v>

306
00:19:05.781 --> 00:19:10.230
film narrative and for format and music videos unit first winter,

307
00:19:10.231 --> 00:19:13.650
which was very,
very much smaller in scale.
And then you went to this,

308
00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:18.630
which was way grander,
way more complex.
That's a huge jump.

309
00:19:18.631 --> 00:19:22.860
Was there,
was there difficulties there or were you nervous or anything?
Oh yeah,

310
00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:24.660
I was terrified for like a whole year.

311
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:29.770
I was just in a state of constant panic for about a year.
Um,
okay.

312
00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.980
So,
yeah,
I mean it was worried.
Yeah.
What was the,

313
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.450
what were the struggles in trying to adapt to that bigger format,

314
00:19:36.451 --> 00:19:40.350
the craziness of it and just trying to get this film made?
Well,
I mean it's,

315
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.930
it's just magnified.
It feels like the same experience.

316
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:45.610
You have slightly more people on set obviously,
but,
um,

317
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.830
I've done some pretty big commercials and stuff,
so like I'm familiar,

318
00:19:49.831 --> 00:19:53.190
I'm like comfortable with having a lot of people around when you're trying to do

319
00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:57.400
it.
Um,
yeah.
I don't know.
Uh,

320
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.180
I think one thing that I haven't thought about this a lot,

321
00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:05.181
but one thing that's difficult when you move to a bigger size production is

322
00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:10.470
everything is much more organized and it has to be because you've got trucks

323
00:20:10.471 --> 00:20:14.460
full of lights and shit and um,
you're on location and it's crazy and you were,

324
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
so the script becomes this sort of Bible in a way,

325
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.270
but not just for the words.
I represents a certain amount of time,

326
00:20:24.271 --> 00:20:25.560
a certain amount of hours.

327
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:30.540
And what tends to happen that I think is unfortunate and I tried to figure out

328
00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:32.760
how to fight it,
is that uh,

329
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:37.620
the script comes to concrete and you'll have an,
you know,
daddy's like,

330
00:20:37.621 --> 00:20:40.290
she missed that line.
She knew that and I'm like,
it doesn't matter.

331
00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:41.550
Like we're trying to get the scene.

332
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:46.230
But even I got into that mentality where I'm just shooting the script that I

333
00:20:46.231 --> 00:20:50.230
wrote in the past rather than responding to what's happening right now.

334
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.840
Because even though there's this huge apparatus,

335
00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.400
you are still at a certain moment in time in a certain place with actual human

336
00:20:57.401 --> 00:20:58.234
beings.

337
00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:02.530
And you're trying to get at an essence in the particular words that you wrote.

338
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.070
I mean,
unless you're doing some very highly tuned comedy writing,

339
00:21:06.071 --> 00:21:09.130
like the Coen brothers or something,
which I'm not a,

340
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:10.810
but even then you have to be,

341
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:15.760
it's very difficult to get back into the present moment.
And you have a lot of,

342
00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.020
you know,
guys around,

343
00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:20.200
you might've been three hours lighting it and they're going to be grumpy if you

344
00:21:20.201 --> 00:21:22.060
decide to change the shot at the last minute.

345
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.510
But you just have to do it and let the be like,
be grumpy at who,
um,

346
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.850
and,

347
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:32.350
but also to push yourself out of that comfort zone when you're in a bigger,

348
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.040
when you know,
when you just have more,
there,
you have more people supporting you.

349
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.480
Um,
and that can sometimes feel like a burden.
Um,

350
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.970
but actually it can be liberating if you remember to keep it fresh.

351
00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:47.800
And actually I learned so much about I'm doing that,
not just creatively,

352
00:21:47.801 --> 00:21:51.080
but just in my life from hanging around Reggie,
slight,

353
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.170
slightly less than erotic around Reggie.

354
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.600
I'm not saying you're responsible for me.
It's a little bit.
Thank you.

355
00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.070
Thank you for channel.
Yeah,
he just sucks it out of my brain.

356
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:04.480
Um,

357
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.090
so what was the biggest thing that you took away from this film that's going to

358
00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:11.290
help you learn on your next film specifically?
I'll actually on the next one,

359
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:15.650
I actually want to go back to being a little looser with,

360
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.560
with how I shoot it.
I mean,
as it,
you know,

361
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:21.550
this one is very precise and I still want to do that,
but I,
I,

362
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.860
I want to start playing a little bit more jazz and the next one

363
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.640
and I'm dialing the writing can always be a better writer.
I gotcha.

364
00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.660
And was there anything that was not in this film that you really want to get in

365
00:22:34.661 --> 00:22:37.300
there but had to be cut because of timing?
Oh yeah.

366
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.840
There's like six scenes that are cut out,
but I really like,
um,

367
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:46.110
it'll be on the DVD specialists.
There you go.
Does anyone use DVDs anymore?
How,

368
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.190
how do you like look at Dvds,
specials in commentary?
That's so hard.

369
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:57.040
I mean an apple,
it does.
Like if you buy a movie that you do get those extras.

370
00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.010
I just rewatched it and Google places.
Oh,
you do?
Okay.

371
00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:03.650
Have you watched the passenger last week?
Oh No,

372
00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:08.110
I can't get it in there.
Yeah.

373
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:13.810
Gotcha.
Um,
what was the toughest scene to film?
Because like I said,

374
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.880
as soon as I started seeing the one shots,
I was like,
Oh God,

375
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.780
that one must have been,
but what,
what was the toughest thing to get right.
And,

376
00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.850
and film the toughest thing to get right was the last scene of the movie.
Yeah.

377
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:27.700
Um,
and we actually reshot him,
um,
completely re shot.
It was cause the,

378
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:31.210
you didn't like the original idea or just wasn't sure it was the same scene,
but,

379
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.073
um,

380
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.340
I miscalculated what the ending needed to be.

381
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:40.200
It was the same scene but with a different energy.
Basically.
W I don't know,

382
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.290
I don't want to ruin it,
but,
um,
you know,
the,
that big fight at the end,

383
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.920
uh,

384
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.360
why when I reached out and I definitely rewrote it to be funnier and less full

385
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:51.194
of hatred.

386
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.360
So the honestly I realized what I did was I like,

387
00:23:56.361 --> 00:23:59.540
I realized there needed to be more love in that scene in general.

388
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:03.770
And um,
I was being,
I was being too,

389
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:10.550
the first time I shot it,
I was,
um,
I was being too cynical.
I gotcha.
I mean,

390
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.550
I didn't agree with myself in retrospect.

391
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.170
It's good that you could see that though and be like,
oh,

392
00:24:15.171 --> 00:24:17.750
we got to re shoot this as well.
It was hard to admit,

393
00:24:17.751 --> 00:24:20.810
but then when I finally admitted it and then dumped some cold water over my head

394
00:24:20.811 --> 00:24:24.920
a few times,
I was able to go on,
we should be a clu challenge.

395
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:31.670
Right.
Is that a challenge to promote civil,

396
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.740
uh,
civil rights?
Right.
I've heard of that.

397
00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:42.290
How do you feel the future of Vr and film?
We'll cross paths.

398
00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:46.640
Do you think they'll combine in any way?
I don't.

399
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.160
I don't know that I would want to spend an hour and a half,

400
00:24:49.161 --> 00:24:51.680
two hours in a Vr headset.
Um,
so I think,

401
00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.700
I think even if you were in like a projected room,
that sounds too long.

402
00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:01.210
So I think more likely it's going to a new narrative forms will,

403
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.313
will emerge,

404
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:07.160
will be on my desk and they'll be a little shorter than movies I think.
Yeah.

405
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.270
I think Vr is,
does is definitely its own thing.
It's,
it's um,

406
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:16.250
it's really,
it's really its own thing and that's exciting.

407
00:25:16.251 --> 00:25:19.630
That's actually refreshing as opposed to being another type of screen and other,

408
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.030
yeah.
Like another delivery device,
another delivery of cram it in another whole,

409
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.880
cram it in there.
No,
it's just like its own thing.
It's great.

410
00:25:25.881 --> 00:25:29.900
It's like there is a new thing,
there is a new thing.
It's that,
yeah.

411
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:35.480
And it's exciting because uh,
it is very much up for grabs how we want to use it.

412
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:37.320
Yeah.
Yeah.

413
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.340
<v 3>Then you mentioned that the original draft as good didn't really have as much of</v>

414
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.990
kind of ar in it.
Um,
I'm wondering,

415
00:25:44.991 --> 00:25:46.640
it's like the technology became a bigger part of it.

416
00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:51.320
Did the storyline shift and then make you go,
hm.
I mean that technology,

417
00:25:51.321 --> 00:25:54.740
this relationship with don one way when it turned out differently.

418
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.870
And how's that kind of like parallel to how you think about like,

419
00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.470
I guess transition to like real life and might affect relationships?

420
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:05.120
<v 0>Yeah,
that's an interesting point.
Um,
in some ways,</v>

421
00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:09.500
uh,
you could tell this story without technology.

422
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.750
I probably hasn't been done during the French new wave like 10 times.
Uh,

423
00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.340
basically like the guy has,

424
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:20.180
is not happy at home and then he has a fantasy about how it would be better

425
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:24.100
another way and either carries out that fantasy or just imagines that there's

426
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:28.590
that.
Um,
was that cue what Cq?
Cq?
Yeah.
Yeah.

427
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.570
Which was an individualist that time.
But,

428
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.900
and then there's that Romer movie called a love in the afternoon,

429
00:26:35.901 --> 00:26:40.901
I think is the whole movie is just about middleclass French guy imagining

430
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.850
cheating on his wife.
And at the end he just not to,
it's a great movie.

431
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.420
I just ruined it.
It's really subtle.
So I think,

432
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:51.120
I think you could tell that story without technology,

433
00:26:51.121 --> 00:26:54.690
but I will say this in the earlier drafts,

434
00:26:54.691 --> 00:26:57.870
the movie was really more like compare contrast David Juliet,

435
00:26:57.871 --> 00:27:00.210
like he's in technology,
she's into yoga,

436
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.780
he's like doing this fantasy world that she's kind of like trying to get more

437
00:27:03.781 --> 00:27:05.400
into robotics,
but it's also a fantasy world.

438
00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:07.860
And it was much more literary in that way.

439
00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:11.220
Like I was really trying to show two points of view,
having an argument.

440
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.430
But then once the technology thing came in,

441
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.500
Juliet gets like marginalized a little bit.

442
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.760
And that's part of my frustration sometimes with with film narrative.

443
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.440
If it was a TV show,

444
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.650
I could have been like third episode is all from Juliet's point of view.

445
00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:28.620
Do you know what I mean?
So,
um,
yeah,

446
00:27:28.621 --> 00:27:32.850
in a weird way the technology did marginalize the human relationship for me to

447
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:34.800
tell the story about technology,

448
00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:38.250
marginalizing human relationships as my human relationships were being

449
00:27:38.251 --> 00:27:42.270
marginalized by making this film.
So

450
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.170
thanks.
Thanks for asking.
I feel better.

451
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:52.430
<v 4>Um,
so I saw the movie last night and I loved it and I really loved how like</v>

452
00:27:52.431 --> 00:27:55.940
natural,
a lot of those scenes were.
And some were like cringe worthy.
How,

453
00:27:55.941 --> 00:28:00.430
like national day where it was cringeworthy awkward,
like,

454
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.390
Oh God,
no.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
It's really,
I say that,
oh,
you're going to say that?
No.

455
00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.510
Um,
but I wanted to know how do you take it?

456
00:28:08.511 --> 00:28:11.950
So a lot of people were kind of talking after the movie and seven saying it's,

457
00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:16.250
it's kind of a 2016 version of her.
Like,
how do you take that?

458
00:28:16.251 --> 00:28:17.810
Is that a compliment?
Is,

459
00:28:17.811 --> 00:28:21.440
did it have any part in how you came up with certain things or do you play off

460
00:28:21.441 --> 00:28:22.770
of it at all?
Well,

461
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:24.210
<v 0>we shot the movie before hurricane out.</v>

462
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.700
I didn't have the chance to respond to it and that way,
um,

463
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.050
I knew it was coming out and I was like,
blah,
blah,
uh,

464
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.520
her as a romance.
I mean,
I mean from a standpoint of literature,

465
00:28:35.521 --> 00:28:38.830
it's like on the opposite end of the spectrum of s as a satire,
um,

466
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:42.600
even though they're describing a similar phenomenon.
So,
um,

467
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.830
in a way I welcome the comparison because that movie cost like 40 times more

468
00:28:46.831 --> 00:28:49.330
money.
And you know what I mean?
It's like,
I'll take it,
like compare,

469
00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:52.500
compare it away to her.
Um,

470
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:56.820
but I think it's an interesting double feature,
uh,

471
00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.750
because yeah,
they're really a tech,
you know,

472
00:29:00.751 --> 00:29:02.810
approaching it from a different point of view.
Um,

473
00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:07.170
there's no political reality in her whatsoever,
from what I can tell.

474
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:11.460
It's just not concerned with politics or economics,
um,
that much.

475
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.900
And I mean,

476
00:29:12.901 --> 00:29:17.640
really what's weird about her is that it's [inaudible] she's an authentic AI,

477
00:29:17.641 --> 00:29:20.790
right?
So that means that the company that's selling or a slave traders,

478
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:22.620
cause she's conscious,
you know what I mean?

479
00:29:22.621 --> 00:29:26.160
Like there's all this other stuff in there that's,
you could just look at it.

480
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.710
You can just be more negative.
It can be a negative Nancy,

481
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:33.360
watch her and then you'd make my movie,
but we'll actually,
it's not so great.

482
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:37.560
Yeah.
Plus plus the plus the construct in the movie is,

483
00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:41.470
it's just a composite.
It's not alive in any way.
Well,
that's important too.
Like,

484
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.030
uh,
yeah,
there's no authentic AI.
And my movie,
it's really just,

485
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.920
just his own fantasies projected back at him,
which is kind of like a different,

486
00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.630
he has an authentic Joaquin as I like to call them.
Has A,

487
00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:00.760
has an authentic relationship,
a real relationship with an AI.
Uh,
but in my movie,

488
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:04.510
David is just in a relationship with something that he's creating.
So he's uh,

489
00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:06.550
created,
uh,
it's,
it's a Pygmalion,

490
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:10.590
the sex scenes.

491
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:15.190
Is that just awkward or was it awkward to pretend to masturbate in front of

492
00:30:15.191 --> 00:30:15.680
entire crew?

493
00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.580
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
It's weird to ought to be the director of,</v>

494
00:30:20.581 --> 00:30:23.130
be like,
okay guys,
that was a great shot.
Now I'm going to

495
00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:30.270
sit down and do the most private thing.
Pretend

496
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.020
that was a trip.
Yeah,
that was really weird.

497
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:40.890
Like you wrote,
it is funny.

498
00:30:40.891 --> 00:30:42.230
It is funny to suddenly,
yeah,

499
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:46.330
<v 0>be a naked like on a couch.</v>

500
00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:51.610
Getting like having an entire crew film.
You,
you see where I'm going with this.

501
00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:55.750
It's like,
it's like the most masturbatory

502
00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.553
<v 1>pause</v>

503
00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:02.620
dude.
Max Mass.

504
00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:09.830
<v 0>It was mostly like,
how have I put myself in this situation?
It's amazing.</v>

505
00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.810
It was needed for the film most.
Yeah.

506
00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.760
The most narcissistic moment of my entire life.
There we go.
Really Weird.

507
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:18.930
<v 3>Hey guys.
Next question though,</v>

508
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:24.200
is really the related to writing and how,

509
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:29.090
I mean with all that filmmaking takes with the writing and all the steps,

510
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.671
the process,

511
00:31:29.671 --> 00:31:34.671
how do you be your own boss and how do you set goals for yourself and deadlines?

512
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.033
Um,

513
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:40.890
<v 0>um,
I take a lot of naps.
Um,</v>

514
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:45.440
I have a completely erratic,
a sleeping schedule.

515
00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:51.460
I vacillate between drinking lots of red wine and not drinking at all for a

516
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:53.930
week.
Don't forget that we'd know

517
00:31:56.530 --> 00:32:01.430
smoking weed with Reggie reg.
Well,
eating it,
eating it.

518
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:06.440
Um,
promethazine over over a peanut man.

519
00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:11.480
Got The permit.
The scene going on.
I don't know.
No,
I don't.
I,

520
00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.130
I'm terrible.
I'm terrible at staying on schedule.

521
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.830
But once you have a bunch of people involved in money's getting spent,

522
00:32:18.831 --> 00:32:23.210
you just have to,
you just kind of like get taken along for the ride.
The,

523
00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.800
the early part

524
00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:30.920
of generating the energy to make that happen.
I don't know.
I don't know.

525
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:32.790
<v 3>Do you think that it helped?
I mean,</v>

526
00:32:32.791 --> 00:32:36.180
do you think that it helped after you go your first pres project off the,

527
00:32:36.181 --> 00:32:40.130
off the ground and it kind of built momentum and you got in,
you became known.

528
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:44.990
<v 0>Do you think it helped kind of being,
being accountable to more,
more people?</v>

529
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.160
I mean,
it just Kinda gets rolling and then when you first start off,
you're like,

530
00:32:49.161 --> 00:32:51.260
I had this idea.
It's only in my mind,

531
00:32:51.261 --> 00:32:54.830
but I'm pretty sure you're going to love it.
But after you've made a few things,

532
00:32:54.831 --> 00:32:58.310
you can be like,
the New York Times says that I'm a person was a name.

533
00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.300
You know what I mean?
That you should,

534
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.410
you should know about and it starts to become more concrete for people.
Um,

535
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.040
so yeah.
So then you're just starting off with a little bit more of a platform,

536
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:11.660
a way to give people a context to take you seriously.

537
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.090
And that's,
uh,
yeah,
that's

538
00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.050
part of part of life

539
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:23.270
moving through life and things and lots of it.
Yeah.
I mean,
going off of that,

540
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:29.240
you know,
balancing writing,
directing,
enacting is that,

541
00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:32.630
it's got to be incredibly tough.
Yeah.
I wouldn't recommend it.

542
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:34.850
I wouldn't recommend that anyone do that.

543
00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:38.370
But you didn't want anyone else playing that star role that was oh no,
no.

544
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:41.470
I asked disease to do it.
It was the first person I asked was,
is he's an sorry,

545
00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.600
really,
that he didn't do it and he was,
he was like,
he said no.

546
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:49.040
And then I asked a bunch of other people and they all said no.
And then,
uh,

547
00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.810
one guy sort of said yes.

548
00:33:50.811 --> 00:33:54.430
And then I talked to him like these are known actors that I was talking to when

549
00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.400
one guy sort of said yes,
but then I did a phone call with him,
um,

550
00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:03.110
and he was the opposite of cool.
So I was like,
don't want to do that.
Um,

551
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.250
so then I started,
then I was auditioning like New York theater actors,

552
00:34:07.251 --> 00:34:10.520
but at that point,
um,
these actions under the name,
so they had,

553
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.900
there was no value being added to the film from a standpoint of distribution or

554
00:34:14.901 --> 00:34:17.090
raising the money.
So at that point I was like,

555
00:34:17.091 --> 00:34:20.600
I know a real efficient way to do this.
I can play the role myself.
And I,

556
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:24.330
I felt that I could do it.
You did great.
Thanks.
No,

557
00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:27.850
it was just interesting the balance,
but I can't even imagine.
That's hard.
Yeah.

558
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:32.000
That's like schizophrenia because I'm directing and I'm like analyzing it and

559
00:34:32.001 --> 00:34:37.001
then I'm in the scene acting trying to pretend that it's real and not analyze

560
00:34:37.401 --> 00:34:41.110
anything.
And then watching playback,
that was weird.
Yeah,
it helps.

561
00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.580
I think it helped me like get go crazy a little bit,

562
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.930
which my character goes crazy.
So it was like a,
yeah,

563
00:34:47.931 --> 00:34:52.280
it was like method filmmaking,
straws to filmmaking.

564
00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:58.880
<v 5>So Reggie is a really interesting to hear you like kind of talk about how,</v>

565
00:34:58.881 --> 00:34:59.140
you know,

566
00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.940
you're creative force and that's like your strong suit and you surround yourself

567
00:35:01.941 --> 00:35:04.580
with a team of very talented people to help you,
um,

568
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:06.720
help it stuff and producing a,

569
00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.040
at what point did you realize in your career that that's what you needed to do?

570
00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:12.790
Was there a time when you tried to do it all and like how,

571
00:35:12.791 --> 00:35:13.880
how did you discover that?

572
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:16.520
<v 2>I mean,
yeah,
that's a,
that's a good question.</v>

573
00:35:16.521 --> 00:35:20.360
That there definitely was a point at which I was like,
you know,

574
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.070
the music I would make,
I would,
I would,

575
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.400
I would record it and I multitrack it and I would eat it and I would do,

576
00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.010
I would do the whole production process.
But then,
you know,

577
00:35:28.011 --> 00:35:30.590
I work with an amazing producer and then I realize,
oh,

578
00:35:30.591 --> 00:35:34.460
I'll have to do is just like play it,
play the play the idea or you know,

579
00:35:34.461 --> 00:35:39.461
explain the vibe that I want to bring across and kind of someone got it and then

580
00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:42.700
also added a little bit of their own thing and I loved it.
And,

581
00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.270
and then that freed me up to do more creatively.

582
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:49.410
And so expanding that are the early times like making films,
you know,

583
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.300
early video,
Internet,
video times.

584
00:35:51.301 --> 00:35:55.530
I was definitely doing that myself and experimented with editing and I just got

585
00:35:55.531 --> 00:35:56.970
bored of editing.
It was,

586
00:35:56.971 --> 00:36:00.510
it was a lot of hard work and I started like losing focus as to what it was that

587
00:36:00.511 --> 00:36:02.490
I was making.
And then when I worked with an editor,

588
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.610
someone who just had a mind for that,

589
00:36:05.611 --> 00:36:07.920
I could see it from the outside and be like,
oh,
that was great.
Oh,

590
00:36:07.921 --> 00:36:12.440
I wouldn't have thought of doing that.
So realizing that creativity,
like the,

591
00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.990
the only thing that I can do is just protect my creativity.

592
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:17.250
And by protecting that,

593
00:36:17.251 --> 00:36:21.630
I mean making sure that I can maximize it at all times and having a modular

594
00:36:21.631 --> 00:36:24.930
system of experts that I can form different,
you know,

595
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.820
kind of protein structures to,

596
00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:31.470
to express creative ideas in the various mediums and,

597
00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.340
and the most difficult medium,
the most complex medium would be film.
And,
uh,

598
00:36:35.341 --> 00:36:39.900
and that's something that luckily working with Ben and friends of his that I've

599
00:36:39.901 --> 00:36:44.901
worked with have yielded results where I really trust this system of people that

600
00:36:46.411 --> 00:36:51.210
I'm working with.
How can I then continue that journey?
Um,

601
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.510
uh,
that usually requires a lot of inner,

602
00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.280
a great amount of energy and resources to create.

603
00:36:56.281 --> 00:37:01.281
So that's an exciting thing to realize and to free yourself from.

604
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:05.880
I think a lot of,
a lot of it is about tuning,
um,
tuning up communication.

605
00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:09.450
It's like those protein connectors are,

606
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.420
is communication between you and the team.
And like,
um,

607
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.050
just like in any relationship,
the better the communication,

608
00:37:16.051 --> 00:37:19.350
the more creativity can flow.
Cause there's,
there's more,

609
00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:24.080
there's more avenues you have to travel on.
And it's like,
yeah,

610
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:26.310
building yourself a team of people with whom you're having,

611
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:30.090
not only are you communicating that you're having an amazing conversation with

612
00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:33.570
all these different people,
um,
and he trusted their aesthetic.
Exactly.

613
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:36.660
Because trusting aesthetics is like a,
it's a difficult thing.

614
00:37:36.661 --> 00:37:38.310
Someone can technically be incredible,

615
00:37:38.311 --> 00:37:42.840
but they may not understand where you're coming from or at least resonate on a

616
00:37:42.841 --> 00:37:47.080
similar frequency where they can then join,
join forces with.
Yeah.

617
00:37:47.081 --> 00:37:51.670
Some of it is just energetic frequencies.
Yeah,
that's what I mean.

618
00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.580
Like with tuning it up,

619
00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:56.190
you got to like fine tune those relationships and make sure that you're

620
00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:00.900
communicating in multiple levels,
you know?
Yeah.
Like the dream,

621
00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:05.550
the dream world,
very important.
Very important to be exactly like it.

622
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:11.780
<v 3>I'm wondering how technology actually impacted the act of making the film
itself.</v>

623
00:38:11.781 --> 00:38:11.900
Like,

624
00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:16.900
were there any particular technologies that in their new that had a big impact

625
00:38:17.151 --> 00:38:21.170
on making the film or did augmented reality actually impact the film itself?

626
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:23.800
<v 2>Oh,
that's a great question.
Um,</v>

627
00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:26.230
there's a couple of shots in the film that are from the point of view of the

628
00:38:26.231 --> 00:38:31.060
glasses and that was GoPros.
Um,
but you're,
yeah,

629
00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:35.890
we were able to shoot I think at that time,
four k on the Gopro.

630
00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.080
<v 0>Um,
so when we struck it down it actually looks pretty good.
Like the,</v>

631
00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.730
the quality was pretty good.
Um,

632
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.000
so wouldn't have been able to do that a few years before that.

633
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.420
Definitely just having just camera that I can mount on the head to be the

634
00:38:49.421 --> 00:38:53.710
glasses was huge.
Um,
I mean I haven't,

635
00:38:53.711 --> 00:38:58.420
I still haven't played around with a real ar system.

636
00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:02.230
Reggie and I are going to go to at tomorrow and check it out.

637
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:06.880
I took the hollow Lens.
You did?
Yeah.
It's great.
Yeah,
it's really good.
No,

638
00:39:06.881 --> 00:39:10.360
but that was all I,
I haven't experienced it still to this day,

639
00:39:10.361 --> 00:39:12.520
so it could be her sing to see,

640
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.580
having seen the movie and then wearing hololens are just like,
oh yeah,

641
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.800
that's very,
very possible.
I mean,

642
00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:20.260
the graphics are more dull and the colors are very good,

643
00:39:20.261 --> 00:39:23.260
but like at least it stays rock solid no matter where you move,

644
00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:26.530
the things that you see are staying in place.
And that's,
yeah,
that's pretty cool.

645
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:30.490
Yeah.
So I'm looking to get paid as a consultant if anybody wants to.

646
00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.360
Okay.
Well,
thank you so much for meeting

647
00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:39.640
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
