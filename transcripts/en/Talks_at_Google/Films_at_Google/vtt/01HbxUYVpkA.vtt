00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.210
Welcome to talk to Google.
Ah,

2
00:00:02.211 --> 00:00:05.020
I am very pleased today to welcome and to the and Joe Russo,

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.020
directors of the new marvel film,
Captain America Civil War.

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.230
Please join me in a massive round of applause and welcoming Anthony and Joe

5
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.680
Russo.

6
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.680
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.620
<v 0>I am.</v>

8
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.940
I spent good as money yesterday on these actual bobbleheads so hopefully some of

9
00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:33.500
that goes back to you eventually.
Unfortunately you caught it that good.
I'm,

10
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.440
hello gents.
Thank you so much for joining us today.

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.760
I will kick off by asking,
can you hear me in the women if I don't use the mic?

12
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.913
Yes,
yes.
Okay,

13
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.700
so I mentioned community and [inaudible] at the top.

14
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.780
I saw the movie last week.
It's very good.
Okay,
well I'm mean treated is,

15
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.200
did you glean much from working on those very much ensembles,

16
00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:56.990
TV shows to working on a big ensemble movie?

17
00:00:56.991 --> 00:00:58.200
What do you don't want to TV show that

18
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.020
<v 2>ensemble work is very important.
I mean,
look,
even at our first movie,</v>

19
00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:04.960
welcome to Collinwood was also at a large ensemble movie.

20
00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:08.410
I mean for whatever reason,
Joe and I are really drawn to ensembles.

21
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.720
I think part of the reason is,
you know,
we're like,
we're film Geeks,

22
00:01:10.721 --> 00:01:15.010
we like movies that you can,
uh,
watch multiple times and kind of geek out on him.

23
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.560
And I think one thing that ensemble storytelling gives you,

24
00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:19.930
it gives you a number of different access points to a story.

25
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.870
And I think you can maybe sort of choose to choose,

26
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.500
choose which character you want to say kind of like side with or access the

27
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.070
story from.
And I think that's part of the fun of ensemble story telling.

28
00:01:30.071 --> 00:01:33.760
But I think also with our shows like community and arrested development,

29
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.810
you know,
those shows we like to play with,
um,

30
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.250
sort of ideas of genre and what your expectations of genre we're and how can we

31
00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:45.130
subvert sort of genre expectations and storytelling.

32
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.350
And that was something that was very,
uh,

33
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.550
very important to us and how we approached the storytelling and civil war.
But,

34
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.500
so this is an audience that hasn't seen the movie,

35
00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:57.760
so we have to remember my question is,
will be free of spoilers.
Okay,
good.
Uh,
so,

36
00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:00.730
and how did you make sure that each character had his moment to shine?

37
00:02:00.731 --> 00:02:04.600
I'm interested in sort of the story boarding process because Marvin is very much

38
00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:08.970
an ensemble piece.
You've got Kevin Fygi who's the kind of overarching producer.

39
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:11.410
Then you've got the directors and the writers as well.

40
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.860
So how do you work as a team to bring a movie to fruition?

41
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.240
<v 3>This is,
we,
um,
we sit in a room with Markus and McFeely,
uh,
um,</v>

42
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.540
uh,
you know,
a conference room for a month or two.

43
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.930
And we talk about what we want to accomplish with the film,
what,

44
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.950
what teams we want.

45
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:31.790
This is usually before we decide on what story we're telling themes that we
want,

46
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.730
uh,
um,
we want to say about the characters,

47
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.070
what characters are interested in working with.

48
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.430
And then once we have a story that we're happy with an,
you know,

49
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:44.150
Kevin comes into the room,
uh,
we talk it through with him.
He,
you know,

50
00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:47.570
he gives us thoughts and,
uh,
um,
particularly on this one,

51
00:02:47.571 --> 00:02:51.800
it was very complicated because we're adding,
um,
uh,
you know,

52
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:54.480
Tony Stark is the character to the film.
Uh,

53
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.030
Robert Downey was not under contract to do the movie.
Uh,
it is not insignificant,

54
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.000
uh,
um,
to bring him on board a film like this.
So,
uh,
we had to,

55
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.650
you know,
ask Kevin to,
uh,
to go work his magic and,

56
00:03:07.651 --> 00:03:11.770
and figure out a deal with Robert secondarily once that was accomplished.
I mean,

57
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:13.990
I think we're incredibly greedy on this project.

58
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.800
We then went and asked him if he could figure out how to get Spiderman from
Sony,

59
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.230
uh,
at which is a,
you know,

60
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.260
a unprecedented deal where you're having to corporations who are competitors

61
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:30.100
sharing $1 billion piece of Ip,
uh,
with each other.
Uh,

62
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:34.450
and that was an incredibly complicated deal.
It took many months.
Um,
and,
uh,

63
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:38.290
and so,
you know,
from a process standpoint,
once we,

64
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.610
once we agree on what we want,
the,
uh,
the,
the story to be a,

65
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:46.510
we then start layering the script with Markus and McFeely.
They do a draft.

66
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:47.430
They come back in and,

67
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.810
and we very meticulously go through the script and tracking each character.

68
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.320
So I'll spend two days talking exclusively about Captain America,

69
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:58.960
then we'll spend a day talking about the Tony Stark arc and then a day talking

70
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:00.460
about scarlet witch and you know,

71
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:05.460
making sure that each character has some movement,
no matter how incremental,
uh,

72
00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:08.170
so that they are different at the end of the movie than where they started the

73
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:08.580
film.

74
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.410
<v 0>And I think very much at the end of the movie,</v>

75
00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:14.340
it's fair to say a number of the characters on a very different place to where

76
00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:16.770
they started.
And did you,
I mean,

77
00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:18.690
when you told we need to get the character's hair,

78
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.080
or as you're planning through to infinity wars,
is that kind of,
you know,

79
00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:25.670
the Johnny's they're going to take,
I'm intrigued with,
with ant man,
as I said,

80
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.570
I don't want to spoil it,
but you know,

81
00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:30.840
you're playing with someone else's counter.
Yeah.
And so how does that

82
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.380
<v 3>demystify the process at marvel?
A little bit.
It's,
you know,
it's,</v>

83
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.650
it's wide open.
You can tell whatever story you want to tell,
whatever,
whatever.

84
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.640
You know,
Kevin's only agenda is that the,
that the stories are good stories.
Uh,

85
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.460
but there's a,
and he's very good about,
um,
uh,
you know,
uh,

86
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.100
each process being very hermetic.
You know,
the,
it's,
it's,

87
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.920
it's a very healthy and,
and humble approach,
which is a,

88
00:04:57.921 --> 00:05:00.590
if we don't make this movie the best movie that it can possibly be,

89
00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:03.830
then we might not get another movie.
So it's not,
you're not,

90
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.600
you're not planning too far ahead.
However,
uh,

91
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.150
it is a little bit like United artists over there right now because a lot of the

92
00:05:11.151 --> 00:05:14.000
other directors are very good friends of ours and a,

93
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.160
we're texting each other and emailing each other constantly.

94
00:05:16.161 --> 00:05:17.900
And we're all have a collective goal,

95
00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:21.140
which is to tell the best stories that we can.
Uh,
and,
uh,

96
00:05:21.141 --> 00:05:24.850
so there's a constant dialogue going on.
And,
uh,
Anthony,

97
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.460
just by nature of our relationship are our collaborators.
What's,

98
00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:33.030
what we have to do every day,
talk things out with people.
So we enjoy the,
uh,

99
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.740
the process of engaging other directors is what we did for years as executive

100
00:05:36.741 --> 00:05:40.640
producers and television where we would supervise directors who would come in

101
00:05:40.641 --> 00:05:45.020
and work on the show.
As we engage,
we enjoy that process of engagement,

102
00:05:45.021 --> 00:05:48.050
but it's very wide open.
Uh,
it's about as a,

103
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.180
it's about as healthy as a,
uh,
a studio experiences you can have in the business.

104
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:54.920
I think that's the secret.

105
00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:57.560
I think that that's part of the secret to their success,
frankly,
is they do,

106
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.010
I mean it

107
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.230
<v 2>is,
you think it's a,
Oh,</v>

108
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.940
it's unprecedented in the sense that it's serialized storytelling,

109
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.901
but there's a very,

110
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:06.890
very big discipline about one movie at a time and letting that movie become

111
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:09.890
whatever it wants to be.
Yeah.
So Infinity Ward's too,

112
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:12.800
which I did the math I think is the 22nd film,

113
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.810
some something of that plus ATV chosen,
so forth.
So that isn't set in stone now.

114
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.220
There's still a process before we,
before you get there.
Oh,
very much.
Yeah.
Yeah.

115
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.750
We're just in the midst of that process now.
We don't even,

116
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.540
Markus and McFeely are right now working on a,

117
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:28.610
there are about to turn in the first draft to us.

118
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:32.990
So we're just at that point of filling both back to back.
We are there,

119
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.980
we are doing both back to back.

120
00:06:34.981 --> 00:06:37.970
And I think that might create a little bit of a misconception that the movies

121
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:39.410
are very,
very different from one another.

122
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.960
The reason why we're blocking those two movies together to shoot his,

123
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:44.210
because the cast is so massive.
Yeah.

124
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.880
And there are so many different people involved in that movie.

125
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.060
It just became justically and financially sensible to block work for the actors

126
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.360
in that manner.
So that's,
that's sort of why the,

127
00:06:55.361 --> 00:06:57.290
those movies are being approached that way.
Okay.

128
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.520
Well we'll lift up to the full one minute.

129
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.700
I just wanted to ask you about what you think about kind of digital mediums and

130
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:05.450
Netflix and youtube and do you see those environments to play with in particular

131
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:09.020
thinking youtube and kind of short,
tall,
short?
Well,
you know,

132
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.920
I think it's changing.
Yeah.
Changing

133
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.240
<v 3>the business.
And I think if you're looking at,
um,
um,
you know,</v>

134
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.970
features,
uh,
um,
they're under a lot of pressure at the moment.
I think,
you know,

135
00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:21.630
we've all understood storytelling,
uh,

136
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.640
f for the last hundred years in film as being a two hour closed ended experience

137
00:07:27.101 --> 00:07:30.220
in the 80s that we introduce equalization,
uh,

138
00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:34.300
with movies like star wars and jaws and the advent of the blockbuster.
Uh,

139
00:07:34.301 --> 00:07:37.690
and I think it's getting more and more difficult to lure people out of their

140
00:07:37.691 --> 00:07:41.650
homes because one,
the content is better.
Uh,
you know,

141
00:07:41.651 --> 00:07:44.990
now that TV has been freed from the shackles of the Nielsen ratings.
A,

142
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.950
you're not trying to,
uh,
appeal to advertisers.

143
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.810
You're trying to appeal to the audience and the audience can be incredibly niche

144
00:07:52.811 --> 00:07:53.800
as long as the,
you know,

145
00:07:53.801 --> 00:07:58.690
when you have cash rich companies like Netflix and Amazon,
uh,
um,

146
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.550
because valuations are,
you know,
many times that have studios,
uh,
um,

147
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.440
you know,
their,
their only agenda is a cultural conversation.
Uh,
it's,
you know,

148
00:08:08.441 --> 00:08:12.100
that there is no metric really,
uh,
for,
to gauge success,

149
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.700
which radically changes what you can do in terms of content.

150
00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:19.780
As long as that content is provoked,
you know,
provokes a conversation,
uh,

151
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:24.070
it's successful.
Um,
and you know,
features,
you know,
if you,

152
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:25.330
if you need to go see a movie,

153
00:08:25.331 --> 00:08:29.440
and I think this is why you're seeing it was massive branded films is to go see

154
00:08:29.441 --> 00:08:33.490
movies.
Now it costs a lot of money.
You're going to spend a hundred pounds,

155
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.240
you know,
at the drop of a hat,
you gotta get a babysitter,
uh,
you know,

156
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:41.620
two of you go out to the theater,
a dinner popcorn.
This is a,

157
00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:43.690
this is a very expensive event,
uh,

158
00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:47.440
that is trying to compete with the media in your home.
And,
um,

159
00:08:47.441 --> 00:08:51.380
and I think technology is going to change,
uh,

160
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:56.530
the way that we perceive content much faster than it changed over the last

161
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:01.140
hundred years very quickly.
And I think as I've got four kids myself,
we're all,

162
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:06.250
Eh,
you know,
age from 19 to 10.
So I've got a spread in the demographic,
uh,

163
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.660
and just watching their viewing habits and,
and you know,

164
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.130
I mean they're a majority of the content that they view is either on youtube or

165
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:16.290
on vine.
So their,

166
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.250
their sense of narrative as much shorter than my sense of narrative and their

167
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:24.690
ability to absorb content is much more significant than my ability to absorb

168
00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:29.410
content.
So I think that is going to radically alter,
um,

169
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.590
uh,
how we tell stories moving,
moving forward.

170
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:36.420
And I think VR is going to blow everything wide open,
uh,

171
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.560
in the next 10 years because I think that is an experience that a is next level.

172
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:45.380
Uh,
and uh,
and,
and again may alter,
um,
uh,

173
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.570
storytelling moving forward.
If you have any questions,

174
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.240
I've lots of questions putting it all right.
If I give you,

175
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.343
do you wanna start here?

176
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.120
One of the fortunate people has she seen the movie and it's fantastic.

177
00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.090
Best one I've seen so far.

178
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.290
I just want to ask a quick question in terms of the movie itself,
um,

179
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.080
all those civil war,
do you ever find that as,
as brothers with Dominic?

180
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.180
Did you guys have a confrontation between yourselves?

181
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.050
We're directly to the direction that you want to go at one point when,

182
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:12.933
when shooting

183
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.881
<v 2>and we look,</v>

184
00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:17.420
we've been working together for a long time and are directing processes evolved

185
00:10:17.421 --> 00:10:21.440
over many years.
I mean,
we have a very,
uh,
you know,
we,

186
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.410
I think maybe every directing team does it differently.
Just the,

187
00:10:24.411 --> 00:10:27.290
in the same manner that every director works differently from another director.

188
00:10:27.291 --> 00:10:28.220
It's very much based on,
you know,

189
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.120
sort of like what's your personalities are and sort of how you think and how
you,

190
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.990
how you create a Joe.
And I just have like a nonstop dialogue between ourselves.

191
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.320
We kind of saw our way through what our vision is,
how we want to achieve it,

192
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:44.210
how we want to execute it,
how to surprise ourselves.
Um,
but we do.
Yes,
it,

193
00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:47.930
it does often take the place of a,
you know,
take it,
you couldn't,

194
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.450
can't turn into arguments frequently as part of our process.

195
00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:52.880
We're very comfortable with that part of our process.
I mean,

196
00:10:52.881 --> 00:10:55.940
one time a director friend of ours was sitting behind us at the monitors were

197
00:10:55.941 --> 00:11:00.140
where we work while we're directing.
And,
uh,
he said,
uh,
at the end of the day,

198
00:11:00.141 --> 00:11:02.750
he was like,
man,
it was so weird sitting behind you guys because,

199
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:03.430
<v 4>yeah,</v>

200
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.370
<v 2>you guys are you guys the conversation you have with one another.</v>

201
00:11:06.371 --> 00:11:09.700
It's like the same conversation that I have in my head with myself when I'm

202
00:11:09.701 --> 00:11:14.260
directing myself.
But as you know,
I think any,
any creator,
any artists,
you know,

203
00:11:14.261 --> 00:11:18.430
goes through a process of,
of second guessing what they're trying to do,

204
00:11:18.431 --> 00:11:21.370
trying to figure out what they're trying to do,
uh,
liking what they're doing,

205
00:11:21.371 --> 00:11:23.710
not liking what they're doing.
You know,
it's,
you know,

206
00:11:23.711 --> 00:11:27.670
so we get to externalize that process between us and,
uh,
uh,

207
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:28.810
we saw through it that way.
Yeah.

208
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.633
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

209
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.930
<v 3>See if it was a big fight between super rooms and there's a bigger fight to be a</v>

210
00:11:43.241 --> 00:11:45.230
university that's Marvin went to you universe.

211
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.270
So when they announced that there will be super warm and then there'll be Batman

212
00:11:49.271 --> 00:11:52.360
versus superman and they're going to be in the same year.
And everyone was like,

213
00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.920
well,
which better?

214
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.310
<v 2>So my question is did you guys go watch Batman,</v>

215
00:11:57.311 --> 00:12:00.550
Superman and did it influence your decision during the move like daughter do

216
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.700
Batman versus Superman.
That should be awesome.
We shouldn't make our move

217
00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.090
any way.

218
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.020
Like how much influence do you want?

219
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.030
A huge,
I mean look,

220
00:12:13.031 --> 00:12:16.360
we're film geeks so we weren't the kind of guys that grew up filmmakers playing

221
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.520
around with cameras.
We grew up film nerds,

222
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.150
like we grew up around this corner from a cinema tech and we geeked out on

223
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:24.160
foreign films and art house films and every kind of film.

224
00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:26.500
That was sort of our thing.
So yes,
we are fans,

225
00:12:26.501 --> 00:12:30.070
we've been fans are the of the con comic or in other genres,
but no,

226
00:12:30.071 --> 00:12:33.700
I think that we might have a little bit of a disappointing answer for you in the

227
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:35.650
sense that,
look we,

228
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.340
we sort of developed our instincts about where we wanted to go on this story

229
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:42.100
telling this story.
Just thinking about where we were,

230
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.360
where we had taken the character in winter soldier,
where Captain America was.

231
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:51.160
There were specific narrative reasons that led us to civil war that we can go

232
00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:53.110
into later.
But um,

233
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.890
the other thing is that we're not really aware,
you know?
Yes.

234
00:12:56.891 --> 00:12:59.560
Bet You know that Batman versus superman was being developed,

235
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:01.960
but that's at another company.
There's no,

236
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.550
there's no overlap between these companies.

237
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:06.640
We basically have no idea what they're doing with the idea,

238
00:13:06.641 --> 00:13:08.470
how they're shaping it,
how they're executing it.

239
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:10.510
They have no idea how we're shaping it,
you know,

240
00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:13.750
there's just no connection between the two projects and I'm sure they were

241
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:16.150
following their instincts and what they thought they should do.

242
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.850
We were simply following our instincts in what we wanted to do.

243
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:22.510
We were very much thinking about how do we follow up winter soldier and what's

244
00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:25.450
the right timing in the marvel cinematic universe for a story.

245
00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:29.470
That's how we arrived at the issue of civil war.
We felt it was the right time.

246
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.280
We've watched these characters now at develop into a bit of a surrogate family

247
00:13:33.281 --> 00:13:36.970
with one another over the course of several films and they have a very specific

248
00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:39.790
purpose,
very specific abilities that bond them together.

249
00:13:39.791 --> 00:13:41.590
And very thick relationships that they developed.

250
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:46.210
We felt it was time for a family fight and that's why we,
we gravitate to it,

251
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.990
the civil war.
So yeah.

252
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.440
So secret wars,
the book as well.
Right.

253
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:59.480
And it's a great book with no,
there are many movies like that,

254
00:13:59.481 --> 00:14:00.620
like watchmen for example,

255
00:14:00.621 --> 00:14:05.030
that they changed quite significantly the ending of the movie and stuff like

256
00:14:05.031 --> 00:14:07.040
that.
So how much freedom,

257
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:11.440
freedom do you have changed the role of the book too?

258
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:16.250
Cause I guess menu of the viewers,
the audience will have read the book,
right?

259
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.310
Yeah.
We'll expect,
yeah.

260
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.530
<v 3>Yeah.
We have the ultimate freedom to change whatever we want.
And I think,</v>

261
00:14:20.531 --> 00:14:24.460
I'm Dan,
I'm a comic book Fan.
I started collecting when I was 10 years old,
uh,

262
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.730
as a comic book fan.

263
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:30.750
I'm not particularly interested in going to the theater and seeing a literal

264
00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:35.500
adaptation of a book.
And I'd read the book.
So,
you know,
and what,
what,

265
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.460
what manner or capacity?
I'm going to be surprised by the storytelling.
Uh,

266
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:42.370
we are working in the marvel cinematic universe,
uh,

267
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:47.350
which is not the publishing side of things.
Uh,
and,
uh,
a very different medium.

268
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.950
Uh,
we have two hours to tell stories.
They have,
you know,
months and months,

269
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.790
sometimes years,
multiple issues,
multiple,
uh,
writers,
you know,

270
00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.510
offshoots,
you know,
crossovers.
Um,
so for us,

271
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:04.430
we just take the concept of the book,
uh,
especially in the civil war case.

272
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:08.590
We're taking the idea behind it,
which is that,
uh,
you know,
the,

273
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.530
that the Avengers need to be regulated by a government authority.
Uh,

274
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.010
but we take that idea and we apply it to where these characters are now in the

275
00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:20.840
marvel cinematic universe so that we can exploit our storytelling.
Um,
so,

276
00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:24.440
you know,
we definitely owe a debt to the book in that regard.
But,
um,

277
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:29.450
we're also very careful to not,
uh,
tell the story in a way that you're,
you know,

278
00:15:29.451 --> 00:15:32.000
you could predict how do you read the book?
What's going to happen in the movie?

279
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.060
I love the word you should watch family.
I did feel like a family film.

280
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.750
I battles people clamoring for the crossovers with a TV show in the Netflix and

281
00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:41.960
so forth.
But for me,
it didn't feel like that was the right place to happen.

282
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:45.520
It was just that those couches,
knowing each other and fighting felt like divine.

283
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.790
It's a surrogate family.
And yeah,

284
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:51.680
both Cap Antonio are patriarchal figures in very different ways,
you know,
uh,

285
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:56.000
and their,
their,
their personality types,
uh,
are that,
you know,
there's a,

286
00:15:56.030 --> 00:16:00.170
there's a,
there's a polarity.
Um,
um,
cap is a,

287
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:05.330
uh,
you know,
uh,
it really morally centered,

288
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.670
uh,
um,
uh,
strong,
uh,
uh,
individual who,
you know,

289
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.960
you could say his flaws that he's stubborn to a fault.
Uh,
and a,

290
00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:19.310
and Tony is,
um,
you know,
is this a warring,
uh,
you know,

291
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:24.370
inside him as a war going on between his narcissism man is a desire to help

292
00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:27.800
humanity and do good.
Um,
uh,
so I think,
you know,

293
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:32.990
with what was interesting about civil war was both characters that get

294
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.360
alternately been illustrated as patriarchal and this family called the Avengers.

295
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.420
And what would happen if these,
uh,
these two patriarchal figures,

296
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.520
you got mad at each other and uh,

297
00:16:43.521 --> 00:16:47.870
and chose different sides on a very critical issue that was threatening to push

298
00:16:47.871 --> 00:16:49.850
the family apart.
And that's really what the movie's about.

299
00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.930
<v 5>Yeah.
Um,
yeah.
So I'm going to assume,</v>

300
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:02.370
I'm going to ask what's it look like cause we need come into it.
You know,

301
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.050
he's like the big data is new.
So does he have any kind of,

302
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.270
just pulled you aside and say when should you do this?

303
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:12.760
<v 2>The best way to describe it is I just like to tell our,</v>

304
00:17:12.761 --> 00:17:14.420
our first experience with Stanley.

305
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:18.330
So we're shooting the winter soldier and we're getting ready to,
uh,
you know,

306
00:17:18.331 --> 00:17:21.480
we're going to,
it's the day where we're going to shoot his,
see his cameo scene,

307
00:17:21.481 --> 00:17:23.580
which is,
I don't know if you remember,
you saw that movie.

308
00:17:23.581 --> 00:17:28.581
He's working as a night watchman at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington DC when

309
00:17:29.431 --> 00:17:31.890
someone breaks in,
in the middle of the night and steals caps,

310
00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.910
World War II uniform this there.
And so,
you know,
we come in and he's a,

311
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.160
so we set the scene up.
It's very simple shot.

312
00:17:38.161 --> 00:17:41.370
It's just him walking through the museum with a flashlight.

313
00:17:41.371 --> 00:17:43.710
He notices the missing thing and he has a funny line.

314
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.240
So we've never met him before.
Uh,
he's coming from orange,
Cleveland shooting.

315
00:17:48.241 --> 00:17:51.690
He's coming in from the airport and all of a sudden it's very important that

316
00:17:51.691 --> 00:17:55.980
everything be ready to go the second he walks on set.
So he,
we,

317
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.920
we get the shot set up.
We knew,
we know.
Everyone knows what they're doing.

318
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:00.720
He walks on set.
He's like,
how you doing?
How you doing?

319
00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:03.150
And he shakes everybody's hands real quick talking.
Boom.

320
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:05.040
He gets right on the mark.
We call action.

321
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.850
He walks to the scene about three or four or five times.
We've got it.
Okay.

322
00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:11.940
I see you have,
I got to go.
Bye Bye.
Hey,
you guys are fantastic.
Bob.

323
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.940
I think go boom.
He's gone.
That stay on that.
That's it.

324
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:18.160
That's pretty much the experience of standing.
Yeah.

325
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.590
Putting a question at the back.
Yeah.

326
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.830
With the soldier,
which,
uh,
super successful,

327
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.930
so much that,
uh,
on this very,
those actions,

328
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.970
they had no qualms with it whatsoever.
Precedent.
No.

329
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:37.990
How was,

330
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:42.880
how was building up to that and do an author on other Captain America thing?

331
00:18:42.881 --> 00:18:46.210
How would the pressure on that?
Well,
it's interesting.
You

332
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:50.450
<v 3>look,
there's certainly can be a lot of pressure if you allow it.
Uh,</v>

333
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:55.170
because the fan base is quite large,
quite passionate and very vocal.
Uh,

334
00:18:55.171 --> 00:18:58.560
but they also speak with really disparate voices and everybody wants something

335
00:18:58.561 --> 00:19:00.610
different from the movies.
Um,

336
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.130
so if you try to listen to the public,

337
00:19:04.131 --> 00:19:06.960
you're gonna wind up making a mess of a film.
Uh,

338
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:12.020
we learned very early on in our careers that we always did our best work when we

339
00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:16.850
were trying to make work that please us.
And then we would hope that,
uh,

340
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.300
everybody else,
uh,
uh,
um,
enjoyed,
enjoyed it as well.
Uh,

341
00:19:21.301 --> 00:19:24.480
and we always said our worst work when you try to anticipate what the audience

342
00:19:24.481 --> 00:19:28.230
wanted.
Um,
and also you just,
when you do that,

343
00:19:28.231 --> 00:19:31.650
you don't sleep as well at night.
So,
um,
you know,

344
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.630
with a movie like this,

345
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:38.240
I think because there are two of us with a very zen approach to the filmmaking,

346
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:43.200
which is looking at,
you know,
uh,
we've been hired to do this job,
uh,
you know,

347
00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:45.660
we're going to go out there and make a movie that we're proud of and we're happy

348
00:19:45.661 --> 00:19:50.550
with.
And this was not an easy movie to make.
A from a,
um,
uh,
you know,

349
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:55.290
uh,
um,
it was a complicated film.
There's a,
it's very subversive and tone.

350
00:19:55.291 --> 00:19:59.280
The third act is,
um,
unpredictable and,
uh,
and as you know,

351
00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:03.330
very dark elements to it,
uh,
and,
uh,
and,
uh,
created a,
uh,

352
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.440
a real fight inside marvel.
So this was from willing the movie into existence,

353
00:20:07.441 --> 00:20:10.020
willing Robert into the film,
Willing Spiderman in the movie.

354
00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:12.300
It was Herculean and scale.

355
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.750
But ultimately those were the things that we wanted to tell the story that we

356
00:20:15.751 --> 00:20:20.490
wanted to tell a and a and,
and we knew that,
you know,
um,

357
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.160
just from a,
uh,
you know,

358
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.960
personal integrity standpoint that if we fought to win those things and we won
a,

359
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.160
that when the movie came out that,
you know,
again,

360
00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:32.790
we would just feel better about the work that we did and sleep better at night.

361
00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:37.350
So that's ultimately our goal is to just please ourselves.

362
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:40.380
And You keep your fingers crossed that the translates to an audience

363
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.900
<v 2>for hair.
Yeah.
I,
um,</v>

364
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:49.450
I've seen a lot of gag reels from the movies and it seems like they're all,

365
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:54.660
they all like to goof around and have fun wanting to know how hard it is to work

366
00:20:54.911 --> 00:20:57.760
with them when they like to mess around that much.

367
00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.770
It didn't feel like kindergarten or anything.

368
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.550
Every time you see one of those gag reels,

369
00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:07.300
like art editor just showed us the one we're going to use for the DVD.

370
00:21:07.301 --> 00:21:09.280
It's like I'm always surprised like I'm like my God,

371
00:21:09.281 --> 00:21:14.281
there's so vulgarity lady Frasee and every other gag involves Anthony Mackie.

372
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.990
I mean,
look,
it's very interesting.
There are a number of what you know,

373
00:21:19.991 --> 00:21:24.640
Joe and I worked in comedy for years,
so we like to create a set,

374
00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:26.650
we love improvisational performers.

375
00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:31.360
We like to create an environment on set where people feel very open to express

376
00:21:31.361 --> 00:21:36.320
themselves and to be experimental and to be be surprising and it,

377
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.100
but also feel well supported and well connected to everybody else.

378
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.400
It's the environment we try to create among our crew as well.
We really love,

379
00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:45.700
like Joe was saying earlier,
we love the pro process of collaboration,

380
00:21:45.701 --> 00:21:49.360
so we try to create like a family like environment on set where everybody feels

381
00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:52.660
very welcome and invited to contribute in every way they can.
That's it.

382
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.640
That's what we feed off of,
but yeah,
some,
you know,
some,

383
00:21:55.641 --> 00:21:57.400
some actors have very different processes.

384
00:21:57.401 --> 00:22:02.401
Some people like to be a very focused and quiet and they sort of like our,

385
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:06.070
that Chadwick Bozeman for instance,
is very much like that.
He's a very,

386
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:10.870
very much a method actor.
He plays Black Panther in this movie.
Um,
he,
you know,

387
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:13.240
he's,
he's an American actor,
but he did a very,

388
00:22:13.241 --> 00:22:18.220
very specific African accent for the character.
And he would stay in accent,
uh,

389
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.550
the entire time we were shooting,
we'd never speak in his normal voice.

390
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.200
So here's a guy who's kind of keeping in character,
keeps pretty quiet,
you know,

391
00:22:26.201 --> 00:22:29.830
between takes,
doesn't really socialize much pleasant,
you know,
friendly but,

392
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.980
but very quiet.
And then there's other people like Anthony Mackie,

393
00:22:32.981 --> 00:22:35.230
like Joe was just talking about who,
you know,

394
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.940
the second Anthony Mackie gets on set,

395
00:22:36.941 --> 00:22:39.910
it's like he's doing a standup routine for everybody involved in the,

396
00:22:39.911 --> 00:22:43.360
in the production,
which is a very entertaining,
it really helps the energy flow.

397
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:44.590
But you have,
you know,

398
00:22:44.591 --> 00:22:47.560
we have a wide disparity of like how people like to work and Joe and I,
again,

399
00:22:47.561 --> 00:22:48.394
as directors,

400
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.940
you try to create an environment where everybody feels comfortable and welcome

401
00:22:51.941 --> 00:22:54.640
to work in the way they,
they can.
Sometimes it's hard to balance,

402
00:22:54.641 --> 00:22:58.030
but I think over time we've developed a sense of how to keep things balanced.

403
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.080
So if you've got time for one more question,
so someone's got the mic over here

404
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:04.850
<v 6>or</v>

405
00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.590
<v 2>over here.
Yes sir.</v>

406
00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:13.820
<v 6>Um,
I guess we're very passionate about technology and sometimes older than</v>

407
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.110
passionate of,
and I'm guessing,
um,

408
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.540
you might have 30 on zero views,
a certain tag.

409
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:24.870
How do you kind of resolve conflict?

410
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.910
<v 2>Some more buffaloes?
Yeah.
Um,
you know what,</v>

411
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.030
it's really a

412
00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.533
<v 6>okay.</v>

413
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.280
<v 2>It's really just,
we just argued the concept out.
Uh,</v>

414
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.930
and whoever has the better argument wins.
Um,

415
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.080
it's usually that's I think how we try to,

416
00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.390
you talked about honors trailers earlier,

417
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.100
how we try to logic proof the work that we're doing

418
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.060
<v 3>is we argue through every story point now,
you know,</v>

419
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.630
different movies at different requirements.
So,
you know,

420
00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.410
a winter soldier is a political thriller,
which the plot based film.
Uh,

421
00:23:57.411 --> 00:24:02.250
the concept behind political thriller is that the lead character is,
uh,
is,
uh,

422
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.570
not caught up with the events that are actually occurring in the storytelling

423
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:09.290
there behind the events.
Uh,
and typically by the end of the second act,

424
00:24:09.291 --> 00:24:11.540
they catch up with the plot of the movie,
uh,

425
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:14.170
at which point they can then engage the villain and the feet development of

426
00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.000
third act,
civil war is very different because it's a,

427
00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:18.470
it's a psychological thriller,

428
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.280
a that turns on the character choices that the characters make.
Uh,

429
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:28.190
and it's all leading towards a very cathartic,
uh,
a moment.
Um,
uh,
so,
you know,

430
00:24:28.191 --> 00:24:32.610
for us it's uh,
uh,
the priorities are different.
Like in,
in,

431
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:36.140
in,
uh,
winter soldier plot is a priority.

432
00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.990
So all the work that we put into arguing about our,
our,

433
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.050
our process had to do with the plot and,

434
00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.360
and trying to airtight the plot as much as possible.

435
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:49.340
A civil war is character driven and the choice,
you know,
the choices and the,
the,

436
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.440
the moments in the movie turning on character.

437
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.980
So a lot of our time and energy spent arguing about the characters and the

438
00:24:54.981 --> 00:24:57.410
choices that they're making.
And do we have fidelity of the characters?

439
00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.480
Is there a proper motivation for the characters in Franklin?

440
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:04.220
This movie plot is a secondary,
a secondary issue?

441
00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.790
Yeah,
I think I'm also,

442
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:08.811
<v 2>you know,</v>

443
00:25:08.811 --> 00:25:12.320
I think there's a lot of different types of directing teams and but there it is

444
00:25:12.321 --> 00:25:16.490
striking how there seems to be a an uncommonly high percentage of them that are

445
00:25:16.491 --> 00:25:20.790
siblings,
right among directing teams.
And I think that,
you know,
there,

446
00:25:20.791 --> 00:25:24.320
there is a uniqueness in that relationship and that you do get to difficult

447
00:25:24.321 --> 00:25:27.860
parts in the process where you have a difference of opinion and it's not

448
00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:31.790
something you can necessarily logic through or are arrive at some sort of

449
00:25:31.791 --> 00:25:32.900
objective answer.

450
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:37.280
It just boils down to like who is more passionate about their point of view at

451
00:25:37.281 --> 00:25:40.610
that given moment.
If you have to choose go down road a or road B.

452
00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.950
And I think that,
you know,
maybe with siblings you have,

453
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.170
you have that ability to like submit your ego at times because you have that

454
00:25:48.171 --> 00:25:51.440
conditioning of growing up in a family together where you had to operate as a

455
00:25:51.441 --> 00:25:55.010
unit,
you know,
for part of your life.
So you have that default you can go back to,

456
00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:57.260
and I think it helps in the creative process to,

457
00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.620
to give us a flexibility with one another perhaps.
No.
Okay.
Well,

458
00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:01.910
