1
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.260
[inaudible]

2
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.930
<v 0>chatting earlier.
So,
uh,</v>

3
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.060
I want to start from the beginning of where free solo kind of came to be.
Right.

4
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.020
Um,
I wanted to see,
oh man,
I didn't get my own phone.

5
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.930
So where did the beginning of free solo star tell us kind of the story that

6
00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:35.960
actually set and project into motion the project.
Uh,

7
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.180
well first of all I just wanted to say thank you again for coming out and it

8
00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:44.380
means a lot to see everybody here and so enthusiastic.

9
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.670
Uh,

10
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.670
I didn't necessarily make films because I think about who's going to see them so

11
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:52.780
much.
But uh,

12
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.830
to see you out here is very heartwarming.
So thank you.
Um,

13
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.160
I did want to ask real quickly,
how many people here have seen free solo?

14
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.760
That's pretty good.
Yeah,
some people place.
That's great.

15
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.500
Awesome.
Well,
uh,
yeah,

16
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.630
so this project or the film,
I guess,
uh,

17
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.850
to give it some context was originally an idea that I came up with about,

18
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.861
you know,
three,

19
00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:31.490
four years ago after a film I made called [inaudible].

20
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.220
And just out of curiosity,
how many people here have seen mirror?
Oh,

21
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:40.990
that's pretty good too.
Okay.
So I,
uh,
was,

22
00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:45.730
it was really just a character portrait of Alex and really his accomplishments

23
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.880
even before he presold of El cap color already easily worthy of making a film

24
00:01:52.451 --> 00:01:52.901
about.

25
00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:57.820
And Really Alex as a character is always very interesting to me.

26
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.400
Uh,
because you know,

27
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.130
I've been filming and shooting in the mountain world and kind of in the vertical

28
00:02:03.131 --> 00:02:06.040
space and Yosemite for 20 years.
And,

29
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.690
and also outside of that in the ski and snowboard World Base,

30
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.350
you know,
a lot of the different,
uh,

31
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.320
what people call extreme or adventure sports

32
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.793
<v 2>and</v>

33
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.980
<v 0>you know,
many of the top athletes at the top of their careers,
uh,</v>

34
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.940
over the last 20 years.

35
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:31.941
So I've seen a lot of different incredible athletes and Alex is,

36
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.230
was just,
you know,

37
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.000
an anomaly really among like a peer group of anomalies.

38
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.200
And he really,

39
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:45.201
really stood out in the sense that what he did was

40
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.100
almost like he had a superpower,
you know,

41
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.410
like there are athletic feats that are due to talent and training discipline.

42
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:57.030
And you know,

43
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.350
people might be predisposed to excel in that particular respective sport.

44
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:07.180
But what Alex was able to do mentally just seemed

45
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.050
<v 1>okay,</v>

46
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.570
<v 0>not from this world,
you know?</v>

47
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.640
And so I really kind of wanted to examine his motivations and take a deep dive

48
00:03:16.701 --> 00:03:19.670
in as a,
as a character.
Yeah.

49
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.240
We didn't talk about making it about El Cap.

50
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.170
Alex came to us with Al Cap and my wife and directing partner Chai,

51
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.220
uh,

52
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.870
was essentially hanging out with Alex because I knew him very well.

53
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:40.150
I had been traveling and climbing with him for 10 years,

54
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.480
but she didn't know him very well.
So she kind of was just,
you know,

55
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:48.481
meeting with him to get a sense of his character and if he'd be a good subject

56
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:52.570
for a future documentary.
And he told her,
he's like,
oh,

57
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.100
that's like I'm interested in making a documentary.
That'd be great.

58
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.600
Uh,
cause I'm thinking about free soloing El cap and my wife,

59
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.770
so casual,
it's not a climber and she,
you know,

60
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.800
she's from Manhattan and she's like,

61
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.810
oh yeah,
that sounds great.

62
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.630
<v 1>You know,
we really have something</v>

63
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.190
<v 0>thing to anchor the film.</v>

64
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

65
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.060
<v 0>So I uh,
I called her that evening.
I was out on a shoot somewhere and I was like,</v>

66
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.090
how'd your conversations with Alex go?
What do you think?
She's like,

67
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:32.710
he's a very interesting character.
Uh,
and it's great.
He's going to go free.

68
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:33.610
So I'll cap.

69
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.770
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.460
<v 0>I almost fell out of my chair because I was like,
he said what?</v>

71
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.500
And he's never spoken to his friends about it,

72
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.570
you know?
And we were,

73
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.350
we didn't even really talk about it amongst ourselves just because it seemed

74
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:54.454
like

75
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.400
we didn't even want to put it into the ether because we could kind of tell that

76
00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:01.590
everything he was doing was leading.
I mean,

77
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.050
he'd basically free soloed everything else that was,
uh,

78
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.400
of significance except for el Cap.
Yeah.

79
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.280
So it was kind of out there,
you know,

80
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.160
and we didn't even really want to talk about it,
but,
uh,

81
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.130
so then when he presented it to us,
you know,
we,

82
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.510
we actually had to take six months off.
We,

83
00:05:23.511 --> 00:05:27.450
we stepped away from the film because we weren't sure we wanted to make that

84
00:05:27.451 --> 00:05:28.051
film.
Yeah.

85
00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:31.150
Maybe you can talk about that a little bit more during those six months.
I mean,

86
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.250
it's some of that like the moral side of it,
which you can't really film him.

87
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.270
Maybe talk,
talk a little bit about your time.
So you know,
for those of,

88
00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:39.961
you've seen it,

89
00:05:39.961 --> 00:05:44.961
part of the film kind of tries to tackle the ethical issues around the making of

90
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.700
the film because,
and,

91
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.710
and it's really in some ways a dilemma that documentary filmmakers kind of have

92
00:05:53.581 --> 00:05:56.340
to address no matter what.
It's,

93
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.560
if we are supposed to be these objective observers,

94
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.120
uh,
when we bring a camera into a situation,

95
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.070
it necessarily changes,
uh,
what you're observing.

96
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.030
And I think it's called the Hawthorne effect.
You know,
by observing something,

97
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:17.330
you change the dynamic within what you're observing.

98
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:20.870
So it,
in this case,

99
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.900
the issue was a little more serious because we were worried that the,

100
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.740
that we could potentially either push him into doing something you wouldn't

101
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.610
normally have done,
as some of us called Kodak courage.
You can like,

102
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.380
oh,
someone's got a camera,

103
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:43.310
I'm gonna jump off this cliff and the water that's too shallow or whatever.

104
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:45.860
I mean,
um,
he,

105
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.160
or even worst case scenario while we're filming something would happen in which

106
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:54.050
we ended up killing him.

107
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.860
And so that obviously took some time to digest and we really had to look at a

108
00:07:04.071 --> 00:07:07.190
few big questions.
Uh,
and I,

109
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:11.660
I talked to a lot of my mentors in particular,
John Krakauer,

110
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:15.520
the author is a good friend of mine,
someone I look up to and,

111
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.640
and he has a very good perspective on life.
So I asked John about it and he said,

112
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.530
look,
is he gonna is he going to do this even if you don't film it?

113
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.540
And I said,
yes,
he very likely we'll try to do this even if we're not there.

114
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.820
And he said,
do you think this is an important moment?

115
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:39.710
Should it be documented if he does do it?
And of course,

116
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.210
as a filming,
here we are.
I said yes.
And it also came down to,

117
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:48.380
do you feel like you're in the best position to do it safely?

118
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.660
Because if someone else,
you know,
do you feel like that?
Yeah.
If he,

119
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:58.430
if you feel like you're the best to do it and you're just spending 10 years with

120
00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:03.431
him and really getting to know him and having a really good working relationship

121
00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:07.880
and trust between each other.
You know,

122
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:10.580
I know his decision making process,

123
00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:14.400
I understand his process in general.
Uh,

124
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.010
when it comes to free solo,
he's very methodical.
He's not,
you know,

125
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:21.560
people always assume he's a daredevil,

126
00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:26.561
like he is just pulling off a stunt that that to him is totally unacceptable to

127
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:30.860
him.
It's a craft.
It's like,

128
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.400
it's something that deserves the tension and kind of discipline of,

129
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.910
you know,
you know,
craftsmanship like yeah,
fine,
fine craftsmanship and,

130
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.490
and I know that he doesn't climb for the camera,
you know,

131
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.850
and you certainly don't become a climber for the money and the fame,

132
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.990
uh,
you climb because you,
you love it.

133
00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.760
And you know,

134
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:04.500
I know that he doesn't care about being famous at all.
You know what I mean?

135
00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:08.910
He's,
he just,
he just wants to climb and do his thing.

136
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:12.270
And so having that kind of pure intention there was also,

137
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:18.300
<v 3>no,
that's great.
So,
obviously last 30 minutes of the film,</v>

138
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.810
Sam actually climbing,
right?
Going up the route.
Um,

139
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.140
you're following along with him.
And when I first watched it,

140
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.860
probably most people,
you know that he makes it like that's not a surprise.

141
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.910
I'd probably be terrible if you didn't know that going into it right now.

142
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.430
You know,
I,
I've,
I've heard that people,

143
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.390
<v 0>there are people that have gone into this film not knowing that</v>

144
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.460
<v 4>and that</v>

145
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.623
<v 3>horrible,</v>

146
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.100
<v 4>but,
but so with that,
I think that takes</v>

147
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.800
<v 3>a very,
um,</v>

148
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.120
a certain touch on the editing and filming process to still be able to build

149
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:59.121
that tension and excitement of we know the outcome but my hands are still

150
00:09:59.221 --> 00:10:00.700
sweating.
I still feel like I want to throw up,

151
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.020
maybe talk about the accident postproduction it filming side of it,

152
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.680
what went into setting it up to people,
see

153
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.640
<v 0>what it is.
So I think a couple things,</v>

154
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:15.530
I mean we went into the film knowing that we want to make a verite film,

155
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.730
which,
you know,
just to bring people into the moment,
you know,

156
00:10:19.731 --> 00:10:21.410
the scenes aren't constructed.

157
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.940
A verite film making is really challenging me is you have to really spend so

158
00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:27.350
much time filming and you're,

159
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.710
and you're there constantly to the point where your subject's eventually you

160
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.950
just kind of surrender to the camera and they don't care anymore.

161
00:10:33.951 --> 00:10:37.520
You just kind of disappear.
And that's kind of like the best case scenario.

162
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:42.200
But you know,
your film with tooth film with someone for two years.
So,

163
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.220
uh,
you're just kind of compiling these moments.

164
00:10:46.221 --> 00:10:48.890
And the reason I'm talking about it because it does come back to your question,

165
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.470
is that
in that kind of filmmaking,

166
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.530
you're really trying to connect people with your subject.
I mean,

167
00:10:57.531 --> 00:11:02.531
films really for me are about creating empathy and it's also about transporting

168
00:11:03.501 --> 00:11:07.640
people into a world that they might not know of.
Um,
in some cases it,

169
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.833
you know,

170
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.970
allows a clarity on misperceptions of,

171
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.140
uh,
of a subject or a topic.
Uh,
so these are all things that we hoped for,

172
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.530
but ultimately,
you know,

173
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.310
your hands aren't going to sweat as much if you don't care about your character.

174
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.520
And so really making the film in a cinema verite film was to get people to,

175
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.600
you know,
really empathize with this character who,
you know,

176
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:42.320
Alex,
uh,
is this,
you know,
he was,
uh,

177
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.550
essentially he was this very shy,

178
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:51.580
scared kid who was more scared to talk to ask for a climbing that he was to go

179
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:57.730
free solely.
Yep.
You know,
and,

180
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.310
and that always struck,
you know,
China and I,
uh,
you know about his story.

181
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.510
It's not like he doesn't feel fear and it's not like he's completely on a
motive.

182
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:11.470
Like inside somewhere in this person is,
you know,

183
00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:16.471
the same beating heart we all have and has the same kind of fears and challenges

184
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:20.810
that we all face in our lives and act out.
But,
you know,

185
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:25.690
really getting people to understand that he didn't just come the superhero that

186
00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:27.160
could free Solo el Cap.

187
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:32.161
Like he worked through all of these fears methodically,

188
00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:35.770
you know,
I mean,
for those that you've seen the film,

189
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.580
there's this part where he's like,
I was scared of different vegetables.

190
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:40.630
I didn't want to eat them.

191
00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:45.631
But then I made myself systematically eat every vegetable until like I could eat

192
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.120
vegetables.
He says,
I didn't know how to hug people.

193
00:12:52.121 --> 00:12:56.970
I was 23 or 24 and nobody ever hugged me.
And,

194
00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.690
but it seemed like people enjoy hugging me

195
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.370
<v 4>each other.
So I decided</v>

196
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.880
<v 0>to go out and figure out how to hug people.</v>

197
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.740
And I was there for a lot of that process.

198
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.990
<v 4>I met him in his early twenties and he used to come up and be like,</v>

199
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:18.040
and you feel like his fingers in the middle of your back just like tapping you.

200
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.470
And He'd be like,
Alex,
Alex,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

201
00:13:21.471 --> 00:13:23.000
You got to bring it in when you got it

202
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.590
<v 0>are double hand.
And he's just,
you know,</v>

203
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:30.430
I think it's,

204
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:35.290
it's really a beautiful story about this person evolving.

205
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:36.850
And then he needs Sani of course,

206
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.160
and falls in love while we're in the middle of this production.
So,
yeah,
I mean,

207
00:13:42.161 --> 00:13:47.161
the whole film feels so intimate as you're watching him and Sonya,

208
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:49.660
she's leaving for that last time.
She's crying in the car.

209
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.420
And when I was thinking about that like,
man,

210
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.630
terrible is that the last time you're ever going to hug him or heavy

211
00:13:55.631 --> 00:14:00.631
conversations when people are talking about someone that they love and maybe not

212
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:07.780
ever seeing them again.
And,
and those are very real conversations,

213
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:12.730
uh,
that work captured.
But again,
back to your original question,

214
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.740
you know,
it really was about building this connection with Alice.
Um,

215
00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:23.590
so that when he got there and then of course,
you know,
we built up the climb,

216
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.940
all the kind of sections of the climb that are important in the narrative,

217
00:14:27.941 --> 00:14:32.941
like the free blast and the boulder problem and the for the people has seen the

218
00:14:33.401 --> 00:14:33.731
film.

219
00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:38.731
I mean everybody knows that there's a thumb hole on the boulder problem.

220
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.590
It's very scary.
Um,

221
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.310
but you have to kind of give that a certain treatment as well too.

222
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:50.440
So as I said,
very intimate experience for the viewers and for the crew.

223
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:51.890
And also I think

224
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.030
<v 3>an intimate experience for you and Chai with free soloing.</v>

225
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.360
So maybe prior,
I think you may be a free soloed before,
right?

226
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:03.470
If free solids and things after filming this project,

227
00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:07.850
how has your views on free,
solo maybe evolved or changed or are they the same?

228
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:08.690
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

229
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.690
so I guess really it's about what are my views on risk ultimately?

230
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.290
Uh,
you know,
I have two small children,

231
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:19.730
two and five,

232
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:21.183
<v 5>uh,</v>

233
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.030
<v 0>very cute
jump up by my gel,</v>

234
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:29.710
pump it down on my head in the morning and when I haven't had any sleep,
but,
uh,

235
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.020
they really,

236
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:37.080
it's the film didn't necessarily make me change my evaluation or assessment of

237
00:15:39.641 --> 00:15:44.170
risk for myself or my crew.
I think that happened,

238
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.910
you know,
years ago,
uh,

239
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.750
before I had children because a lot of people say,
does having children change,

240
00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:57.010
you know,
your,
your outlook on risk.
And really,
I think I had my chain,

241
00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:02.070
my outlook on risk change in order for me to have children.

242
00:16:02.321 --> 00:16:07.321
So I feel like I'm pretty conservative even though most people look at what I do

243
00:16:08.741 --> 00:16:10.360
and think it's not conservative.

244
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.473
<v 5>Uh,</v>

245
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:17.510
<v 0>but I also think risk is a relative thing.
So you know what,
it might look very,</v>

246
00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:21.350
very scary to someone.
Um,

247
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.120
to me,
yeah,
if I'm doing something,
it could look very scary to someone,

248
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:30.800
but for me it feels very in control and,
and uh,

249
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:35.350
easy.
Hmm.
So,
um,
yeah,
so there's this

250
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.210
<v 3>scene in the movie,
it's like two minutes long.
We're,</v>

251
00:16:37.211 --> 00:16:40.680
Alex is talking through each pitch kind of shows them training as he's

252
00:16:40.681 --> 00:16:44.160
practicing.
He's like pitch one talking about the free book,
free blast,

253
00:16:44.161 --> 00:16:47.070
slap going all the way up.
So he has it memorized,
right?

254
00:16:47.071 --> 00:16:48.660
He hasn't written down every single move,

255
00:16:48.661 --> 00:16:50.910
every single thumb hole Betty asked to do.

256
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.890
And you also hint at a little bit in the film around the performance that

257
00:16:55.891 --> 00:16:58.980
yourself and the film crew had to put in.

258
00:16:58.981 --> 00:17:03.240
So I'm curious if you can share what did,
what was your version of that?
You know,

259
00:17:03.241 --> 00:17:04.140
were you,
yeah.

260
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.780
<v 5>Okay.
Yeah.</v>

261
00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.520
<v 0>Well first of all,
Alex,
not only new,</v>

262
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:13.700
all the moves perfectly on a lot of sections.

263
00:17:13.701 --> 00:17:18.701
He would purposely do them incorrectly so that if he ever did make a mistake,

264
00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:23.060
it would feel at least familiar,
you know?

265
00:17:23.061 --> 00:17:26.660
So that's how detailed he went into it.
Um,

266
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:31.820
he wore the same clothing the entire time.
We were filming,
uh,

267
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.230
you would think it was because of continuity as a filmmaker,

268
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:39.830
but it was really because he knew that that's what he was going to wear that
day.

269
00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:42.110
He was going to solo it.
Uh,

270
00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:47.290
and so he never wanted to have to deal with that variable of well waking up in

271
00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:51.510
the morning and the like,
do I want to wear the green shirt or the red shirt

272
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.210
or you know,
on the client,
he'd be very familiar with what he's wearing.
So he,

273
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.010
he really loved her,

274
00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:03.920
like kind of reduce any sort of variables on any sort of level.
Uh,

275
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:08.280
but in terms of our crew,
you know,
the first criteria on this,

276
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:13.350
the to be on the high angle team was that you had to be an elite professional

277
00:18:13.351 --> 00:18:18.120
climber.
Uh,
and you know,
just the kind of,

278
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.530
the volume of work that we are going to be doing and high angle terrain meant

279
00:18:22.531 --> 00:18:27.531
that I just couldn't ever have to worry about them making bad decisions up

280
00:18:28.021 --> 00:18:31.920
there.
And so,
uh,
the other criteria,
of course,

281
00:18:31.921 --> 00:18:34.020
they had to be great cinematographers,

282
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.980
meaning there's like three people in the world that get caught.
Um,

283
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.990
all of which I've known and worked with for many years as well.

284
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.800
They're kind of like my crack team,
like go to,

285
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.970
we have like a really heavy high stakes shoot.
I,

286
00:18:50.971 --> 00:18:54.390
I'm sure when they see my fuck my name come up on their phone,
they're like,

287
00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:58.500
oh boy,
because we've done,
we've been all over the place.

288
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.750
But they are in,

289
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.580
in a lot of ways like Alex,
uh,
you know,

290
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.870
in the Ha kind of upper echelon of climbing,
it's all about the details.

291
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:13.950
It's all about anticipating problems.
It's all about,
you know,

292
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.090
making hard decisions,
um,

293
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:22.130
when the stakes are high and staying very calm when things are a very tenuous.

294
00:19:22.741 --> 00:19:27.720
So the team,
the makeup of the team is hugely critical.

295
00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:32.490
Uh,
and they also were Alex's friends so that it had these,

296
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:37.270
there's an emotional layer to it that was also challenging.
Um,

297
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.690
as well as a technical layer.
The technical layer,

298
00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:43.680
obviously being that we had to move very quickly all the time.
Uh,

299
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.000
they were professional climbers,
meaning that not only were they very fast,

300
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.970
but we've all spent time on both sides of the camera.

301
00:19:50.971 --> 00:19:55.080
So we're very sensitive of what it feels like when someone else is filming you,

302
00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:00.380
how that works and what we hate about bad slow camera teams,

303
00:20:01.561 --> 00:20:01.800
you know.

304
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.800
So we were always fast and on time and never had to have him a way.

305
00:20:07.121 --> 00:20:11.220
It always felt very natural for him whenever he was moving.
Uh,

306
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.400
cause we know what it's like to be on the other side.

307
00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:20.400
And essentially he practiced for two years to climb the route and we spent two

308
00:20:20.401 --> 00:20:23.060
years practicing shooting the climbs.

309
00:20:23.061 --> 00:20:27.990
So by the time he went for our choreography,
for how we were going to shoot,

310
00:20:27.991 --> 00:20:28.824
it was

311
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.960
going down to the part where he's talking about the boulder problem.

312
00:20:33.961 --> 00:20:35.620
He says autopilot.
Yeah,

313
00:20:35.621 --> 00:20:38.790
it was probably the same thing for you was the same for us because you know,

314
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:43.680
you can't let your mind wander into the what ifs.
There's so much to think about.

315
00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:48.220
You've got all your climbing equipment and safety systems and you're changing

316
00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:51.700
lenses on the wall,
you know,
you're pulling focus,

317
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.730
double checking batteries.
He Kinda,
you know,
I mean,

318
00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.340
and you're coiling all these ropes,
right?
So when you're filming climbing,

319
00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:02.380
you can't have ropes in your frame,

320
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:07.630
which means that as he's climbing up and you're moving up,
uh,

321
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.040
you're,
you're hauling ropes.

322
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.510
So if you start filming 1500 feet down the wall and he's,

323
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.470
and you're moving with him as he climbs up that 1500 feet,

324
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.470
well you're carrying 1500 feet of rope by the time you get to the top of that,

325
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:28.120
which is a lot of weight.
And so,
you know,

326
00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:31.030
everything has to be clipped off carefully.

327
00:21:31.031 --> 00:21:33.790
Cause if like one end of the rope starts to unravel,

328
00:21:33.791 --> 00:21:38.350
the whole thing can shoot down the wall and potentially knock off Alex.

329
00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:40.840
So there's just tons of stuff to think about.

330
00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:44.530
And the director was that he just stay focused on your job.

331
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.800
Don't let your mind wander.

332
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.660
Don't forget to press record.

333
00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.053
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

334
00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.530
<v 0>totally happens.
It totally happens.
And uh,
and that,</v>

335
00:21:57.531 --> 00:21:59.060
so that was kind of the technical side.

336
00:21:59.061 --> 00:22:04.061
But the emotional side was that we had to be totally neutral around Alex.

337
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:09.270
You know,
cause you couldn't be encouraging or discouraging,
you know,

338
00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.490
you were,
we were,

339
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:15.610
we had an obligation as a film maker to kind of maintain neutral space for him.

340
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.610
Uh,
but still be as Fred.
Yeah.

341
00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:24.480
So there's also a part as he's preparing to actually do the final one where he

342
00:22:24.481 --> 00:22:28.070
succeeds in doing it where you're talking through if something goes wrong,

343
00:22:28.071 --> 00:22:31.670
what do we do when someone says just call nine one one,
tell him what you know,

344
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.573
climber,

345
00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.490
did you have discussions as a team or between child yourself or with Alex?

346
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.500
This,
maybe it's pretty morbid,

347
00:22:39.501 --> 00:22:42.470
but I'm sure people are wondering if he had fallen,
what's it?

348
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:45.440
We're going to scrap the project.
Never released this.
Never tell anybody.

349
00:22:45.441 --> 00:22:47.650
Or is it we tell the story.
Yeah,
no,

350
00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:51.620
I mean we had to address this before we launched into the production.

351
00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:55.360
So these conversations are happening three years ago.
You know,

352
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:59.090
what happens in the worst case scenario,
uh,
you know,

353
00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:03.200
we didn't necessarily have a clear answer,
but we've addressed it.

354
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:04.750
And then the issue is that you,

355
00:23:04.751 --> 00:23:09.751
you can't really know what you're going to do in regards to this situation until

356
00:23:11.481 --> 00:23:16.340
you're in it because I think there'll be a lot of inputs that tell you whether

357
00:23:16.341 --> 00:23:19.170
or not it's appropriate or not.
And you know,

358
00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.450
it's very sensitive to a lot of different people,

359
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:27.780
stakeholders like his family and uh,
you know,

360
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.220
Alex would just be like,
oh,
you guys should just make it,

361
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.010
<v 4>you know,
cause you would've wasted all this</v>

362
00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.900
<v 0>shooting and there wouldn't be,
you might as well make,
you know what I mean?</v>

363
00:23:39.901 --> 00:23:41.400
He's very practical.

364
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:45.350
I think people are seeing the bill understanding a very practical,

365
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.130
pragmatic and he,
so I think,
you know,

366
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.370
it would have been a very difficult film to make.
Uh,

367
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.750
but we would have probably made it and I certainly wouldn't trust anybody else

368
00:23:56.751 --> 00:24:00.950
with the material.
Um,
but that being said,

369
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:06.320
we never anticipate if we had anticipated that he was going to fall,

370
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:09.020
we would certainly never been in the project.

371
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.560
The whole idea was that we trusted that he would either turn around or decide

372
00:24:15.831 --> 00:24:20.831
not to do it before he would ever go up there and you know,

373
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:24.280
try to force himself to do it and fall off.
You know,
if,

374
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:29.150
if I ever felt like that was the case,
I would have run away from the project.

375
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.370
Yeah.
Yeah.
So your,
your other projects,
like when you're rude,
the,

376
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:35.460
the other things that you've worked on,
I feel like the,

377
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.800
the risks are obviously still there,
no oxygen,
very cold,

378
00:24:39.801 --> 00:24:44.801
but it feels potentially less immediate than something like the incident with

379
00:24:44.931 --> 00:24:45.561
free soloing.

380
00:24:45.561 --> 00:24:50.561
And I think the motivation behind a film and the people in Meru climbing that it

381
00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:56.120
seems different than Alex's motivation and,
or is it the same?

382
00:24:56.121 --> 00:24:57.890
Maybe you can go into that.
I mean,

383
00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:02.390
I think there are certainly similarities.
Uh,

384
00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.453
<v 1>yeah,</v>

385
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:05.590
<v 0>in the sense that</v>

386
00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.000
these are both like free soloing and Alpine climbing in the mountains at

387
00:25:12.001 --> 00:25:15.690
altitude and the cold,
you know,

388
00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:20.610
they're just not what most people kind of imagine being really fun.

389
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.680
Something that you'd really want to pursue and spend your life,
you know,
doing.

390
00:25:25.681 --> 00:25:30.540
But you know,
sometimes you don't get to choose,
you know,
what,

391
00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:36.120
you know,
your passion is it,
sometimes it chooses you.
And,

392
00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.990
and if you know,
if you're lucky,

393
00:25:39.991 --> 00:25:44.810
then maybe you are a doctor or a lawyer or,
I mean,

394
00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.990
I dunno,
Hedge Fund manager,
I don't know.
I'm certainly not a client,

395
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.760
but,
well not certainly I have other opinions about it,

396
00:25:53.761 --> 00:25:55.560
but you know,

397
00:25:55.561 --> 00:26:00.561
it's when you find something that gives you meaning and purpose and it's

398
00:26:02.401 --> 00:26:06.780
something that you,
that moved to,
uh,

399
00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:07.950
and you and,

400
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:12.950
and there's nothing else that can really feed that like climbing can,

401
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.460
um,
then in that sense they're very similar.

402
00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:23.100
They're just what you love and,
uh,
what you get meaning out of.

403
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.520
Yeah.
So,
you know,

404
00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:29.310
to what degree should we be pursuing that?
I mean,

405
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.530
that's probably up for debate,
but

406
00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.830
it is deeply satisfying.
And,
and you know,
we,

407
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:42.390
we call it a trick.
He used to doors as a useless,
you know,

408
00:26:42.391 --> 00:26:47.391
you're like chasing this thing that probably doesn't do that much for the world,

409
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:53.030
but it is about the pursuit of perfection and excellence and,

410
00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:59.440
and dreaming like outside of what you think is possible and really pushing

411
00:26:59.441 --> 00:27:04.390
yourself in ways that you might've been afraid of doing before.
Yeah.

412
00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.200
So it's a lot about exploration as well.
Yeah.
And there's a,

413
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:12.630
when Alex first tries and on the free last slap,
he bails out,
um,

414
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.560
after he's talking to Peter Croft and he's like,
no,

415
00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:20.820
I bailed when Peter was like,
no,
it's best thing you could've done.
Um,

416
00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.360
but you can tell on Alex's face,
he's so disappointed in himself and he says,

417
00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.890
it sucks.
I just needed to end,
you know,

418
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:33.040
like it's this goal that he feels like he can attain,

419
00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:37.320
but it's still so far away.
I'm still like a year until he actually did it.
Yeah.

420
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.960
And is that something that was tough on your end because that was a very

421
00:27:41.961 --> 00:27:46.760
difficult scene to film because you're so,
you know,

422
00:27:46.761 --> 00:27:48.730
we're also his friends.
Yeah.

423
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:52.550
The film aside and we care deeply about Alex.

424
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:57.610
And when you see someone who has a great dream and they've put so much into it,

425
00:27:58.161 --> 00:28:02.210
I mean really,
he's been putting years and years in the back of his mind.

426
00:28:02.211 --> 00:28:06.710
He's been thinking about this.
And to have him really try and fail,

427
00:28:06.711 --> 00:28:11.210
I mean that's,
that's always hard as a friend to see.
Uh,

428
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.820
and so we've,
we felt a lot of compassion for them,

429
00:28:13.821 --> 00:28:18.710
but yet then you had to separate yourself as a filmmaker and,
you know,

430
00:28:18.711 --> 00:28:21.560
film this awful moment,
you know,

431
00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.770
that he's just kind of really distraught and you could see it in his body

432
00:28:24.771 --> 00:28:29.300
language.
He's all hunched over,
hunched over and disappointed.

433
00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:32.290
Um,
so those,
those moments were always difficult to,

434
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:35.630
that was a very difficult cause.
None of us wanted to film it.

435
00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:41.620
I was really happy that our Veritate DP was there filming it because we all want

436
00:28:42.021 --> 00:28:46.250
it to hide,
you know?
Um,
but those are the moments where,
you know,

437
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:50.780
it's an important moment.
You have to capture it.
And,
uh,

438
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.250
and it plays in the film.
You could,
you know,

439
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.870
that's like a classic verite moment where you can feel the moment,

440
00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.380
nobody has to explain to you that he's disappointed or anything like that.

441
00:29:00.381 --> 00:29:03.520
You can see it.
And that's like one of those,
you know,

442
00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:09.230
beautiful moments,
I think about Veritas filmmaking.
Yeah.
Yeah.

443
00:29:09.231 --> 00:29:10.800
That was something that when I was watching it,

444
00:29:10.801 --> 00:29:14.130
it felt like seeing like a little kid going up to someone that really looked up

445
00:29:14.131 --> 00:29:17.400
to and it's like,
you know,
I couldn't live up to it.
Yeah.
That was 10.

446
00:29:17.401 --> 00:29:22.380
It was the worst that Peter was there.
The guy that he like looks up to the most,

447
00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.900
that just is,
you know,
and him and Peter saying,

448
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.910
you don't ever have to go for it.
You know?
And he's like,
I know Sony.
She's like,

449
00:29:31.911 --> 00:29:35.020
you just don't have to be on like,
he's like,
I know.
I just needed to end the,

450
00:29:35.021 --> 00:29:39.230
you know,
and um,
and I get that too,

451
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:43.870
because sometimes it makes a lot of sense,
these big objectives.

452
00:29:43.871 --> 00:29:47.560
And then sometimes you step back and you're like,
what am I doing?
You know?

453
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:51.550
And I think that those are probably existential questions everybody runs into

454
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:54.430
occasionally.
But,
uh,
he kind of,

455
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:57.940
he kind of perseveres and pushes through it.
Yeah,

456
00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:00.820
I think that's something maybe everybody's asking you.

457
00:30:00.821 --> 00:30:02.530
I asked you when we were getting lunch,
what's next?

458
00:30:02.531 --> 00:30:04.570
But is there something like that for you?

459
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.320
Maybe not necessarily so like tortured soul,
I just need this to end,

460
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:09.040
but there is,

461
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.540
is there something for you and chai that you're kind of striving for on a,

462
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.660
on a filmmaking or climbing size or something like that?

463
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:20.800
I think we just want to make great films,

464
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:25.480
you know,
and tell great stories and really kind of connect people.

465
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:27.763
<v 2>And</v>

466
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.580
<v 0>I think that's,
I can't,
I already said this,
but you know,</v>

467
00:30:32.581 --> 00:30:36.530
a friend of ours called calls,
films empathy machines,
you know,
you,

468
00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:40.620
you're just trying to create a connection between the subject and um,

469
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:45.510
the viewer and transport someone and hopefully bring to light it.

470
00:30:45.511 --> 00:30:49.030
Documentaries in particular,
you know,
they can really bring to light,
um,

471
00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:53.400
a lot of different political,
environmental,
social issues that

472
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.150
are important to highlight these days.

473
00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:01.260
And the long format seems to be having a moment right now,

474
00:31:01.261 --> 00:31:06.261
like documentaries this year there've been more kind of bigger box office

475
00:31:06.271 --> 00:31:11.271
documentary releases this year than we've ever seen before.

476
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:15.690
And I can't tell if it's just a product of the moment.

477
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:20.420
Um,
kind of our news cycles being so,
you know,

478
00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.300
while we fast and,

479
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.950
and people not being able to keep up with it.

480
00:31:25.951 --> 00:31:30.951
And then having this kind of long form journalism in a way making a comeback

481
00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.840
because people want to see depth

482
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.450
<v 2>and,
and you know,</v>

483
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.910
<v 0>connect with somebody that actually has some,</v>

484
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.860
I mean I know that that's probably typical film in general,

485
00:31:43.861 --> 00:31:46.740
but it feels like an escape from something,
like you said,
the new cycle,

486
00:31:46.741 --> 00:31:48.790
just everything going on now.
It's so crazy.

487
00:31:48.791 --> 00:31:52.860
And to get to see something like Alex resoling this,

488
00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:55.560
it's so far from,
at least to me,

489
00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.390
something that seems normal and you get to experience it and just such an

490
00:32:00.391 --> 00:32:05.310
intimate way.
So I think that,
I also think it's,
it's nice to see something,

491
00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:10.340
a little lifting these days and to see someone actually doing something like

492
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:17.870
there's like a very real physical challenge was a very real mental challenge and

493
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:22.860
you know,
someone trying to do it and doing it,
you know,
it's very,

494
00:32:22.861 --> 00:32:27.030
it's a little bit more tangible than a lot of things that come up.

495
00:32:27.031 --> 00:32:31.140
So I think that's why it's having a moment.
Yeah,
definitely.

496
00:32:31.141 --> 00:32:34.370
So we were also talking at lunch about,
um,

497
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:38.520
kind of the types of people and the types of climbing that they like.
Um,

498
00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:43.100
and climbing is very quickly growing in popularity,
very popular here.

499
00:32:43.101 --> 00:32:44.930
Look at all these people.
Um,

500
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:49.790
but how have you personally seen in your own climbing career through making this

501
00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:52.640
film kind of climbing evolve?
And what are your thoughts on that?

502
00:32:52.641 --> 00:32:55.610
Where do you see it going?
I mean,

503
00:32:55.611 --> 00:32:59.540
I started climbing because I loved being outside.
I love the adventure.

504
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:04.080
I love the movement.
I love the kind of physical,
you know,

505
00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:09.350
problem solving,
mental problem solving of it.
And,
uh,

506
00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:12.050
but the main part being,
wanting to be outside,
but it's funny now,

507
00:33:12.051 --> 00:33:15.840
there's so many climbing gyms and everybody's climbing inside.
Um,

508
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:21.740
which I actually love doing.
I went and climbed for a few hours this morning.
Uh,

509
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.480
the movement is still amazing,
but I,

510
00:33:23.481 --> 00:33:28.481
I've always tied it to like exploring the world and going on these wild

511
00:33:29.511 --> 00:33:34.310
adventures.
Uh,
but I,
I dunno,
I think climbing,

512
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:40.160
I love the fact that people are enjoying climbing and then it's becoming more of

513
00:33:40.521 --> 00:33:44.060
a mainstream activity,
I guess.
Uh,

514
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:47.510
I think it's fun to,
it's a good way to hang out with your friends.

515
00:33:47.511 --> 00:33:52.130
It's a good way to kind of go out and literally be able to interact with an

516
00:33:52.131 --> 00:33:56.420
environment or landscape,
um,
as an activity.
I think it,

517
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:58.580
it,
at least for me,

518
00:33:58.581 --> 00:34:03.020
it opened my mind to try and to go out and seek these places where I could go

519
00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:07.350
and climb.
So it's been like a great vehicle to do,
uh,

520
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:11.860
a lot of fun stuff with my friends and my family.
Um,

521
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:15.740
so I think it's great.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
So you,
you talk about climbing outside.

522
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.450
What are some of your other projects?

523
00:34:17.451 --> 00:34:22.250
I know with Alex actually you had that expedition Antarctica coming up,

524
00:34:22.251 --> 00:34:23.990
right?
Do you want to talk a little bit about that?

525
00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:29.330
Alex and I went on an expedition to Antarctica,
you know,

526
00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:32.270
last winter,
last December.

527
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.390
And Alex is still climbing a lot.
You know,

528
00:34:35.391 --> 00:34:38.660
he broke a speed record on the nose this spring.
You know,

529
00:34:38.661 --> 00:34:43.370
a lot of people are wondering what he's going to do next.
And uh,
I think he,

530
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:46.100
there's just a lot of different expressions of climbing.

531
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:50.600
Climbing isn't just for him free Solo and their sport climbing and bouldering

532
00:34:50.601 --> 00:34:55.570
and all these different types of climbing.
Um,
and you know,

533
00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:58.520
I think we all enjoy all the different aspects of it.

534
00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:03.620
And a part of the other thing about people climbing and getting people to really

535
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:08.660
enjoy being outside is I find that,
you know,

536
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.960
people are much more in tune and it with the environment and environmental

537
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.190
issues when they love being outside.

538
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:20.780
And I think that that's a really good thing.

539
00:35:20.781 --> 00:35:25.070
I think that there's potential for more environmental stewardship just because

540
00:35:25.071 --> 00:35:27.770
people learn,
you know,
you want to protect what you love.

541
00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:32.980
And I think when people get out and spend a lot of time and under this blue sky

542
00:35:34.341 --> 00:35:36.860
or under the stars are in the wilderness,

543
00:35:36.861 --> 00:35:41.080
that's a good wilderness therapy for everybody.

544
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.010
We all need,
yeah.
I mean,
last thing,
I guess before we go to that,
what,

545
00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.750
what do you have to plug what,
I mean,
obviously free solar boat.

546
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.080
What else is going on with you?
Uh,
no.

547
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:55.360
<v 3>Tell us about the whole,
cause I don't know if many people know,</v>

548
00:35:55.361 --> 00:35:58.540
like what actually happens when you release a film.
Oh yeah.
So a bit.

549
00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:03.410
<v 0>I'm essentially on like the press junket or tour,
uh,</v>

550
00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.840
which is like four months long,
you know,

551
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:11.370
so I haven't been home since the end of August and I've kind of just been,
um,

552
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:15.910
and,
and it's in support of the film and it's,
uh,

553
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.150
it can feel tedious,
but of course,
you know,

554
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:24.250
the film's done very well and we couldn't be happier.

555
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:29.410
Uh,
so just trying to feel grateful and,
and roll along with it.

556
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.353
Um,

557
00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:35.820
obviously I really appreciate people enjoying the film and connecting with the

558
00:36:36.011 --> 00:36:36.844
film.

559
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
It's definitely gone far beyond what I ever imagined it would do.

560
00:36:42.311 --> 00:36:46.900
So we're just very grateful for it.
Yep.
Great.
Okay.

561
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:50.000
<v 3>Yes.
We'll do some audience questions now and just take it in the front.</v>

562
00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:57.940
<v 0>Hi,
thanks so much for being here.
Um,
and you know,</v>

563
00:36:57.941 --> 00:37:00.970
climbing is a pretty esoteric sport and it's very rare that it kind of breaks

564
00:37:00.971 --> 00:37:04.470
into the mainstream.
And so I think like taught me to climb up dawn wall or,

565
00:37:04.471 --> 00:37:07.360
or Alex's climber a few of those occasions.
Um,

566
00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:11.350
what do you think the impact of the success of your film is going to have on the

567
00:37:11.351 --> 00:37:14.890
future of climbing?
Like what people do,
how many people get into the sport,

568
00:37:14.891 --> 00:37:19.840
what risks they take?
Yeah,
I think,
I can't tell,
you know,

569
00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:20.880
it's the chicken or the egg thing.

570
00:37:20.881 --> 00:37:24.570
I can't tell if the film is doing well because there's been this huge surge and

571
00:37:24.571 --> 00:37:27.600
the interest in climbing,
but certainly with this film coming up,

572
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:32.660
it's definitely hit a broader audience than we've ever seen before.

573
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:39.570
And I feel good about people wanting to climb.

574
00:37:39.571 --> 00:37:43.130
And being interested in climbing for some of the reasons I said.
Uh,

575
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:48.210
but you know,
it's also about beyond climbing.

576
00:37:48.211 --> 00:37:52.920
I hope people get something out of that story,
you know,
about taking,

577
00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.700
um,
you know,
facing their fears and,

578
00:37:56.701 --> 00:38:00.930
and really trying to achieve what they never thought possible before.

579
00:38:00.931 --> 00:38:05.400
And I think that he embodies that.
It's such an incredible way that,
um,

580
00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:10.620
that's more of my kind of hope with it beyond climbing,

581
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:11.903
I guess.

582
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:13.463
<v 3>Great.
We're going to take,</v>

583
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:17.370
will switch between Doerries so that people weren't able to make it in person.

584
00:38:17.371 --> 00:38:20.520
So when you can see it up top,
but when editing this together,

585
00:38:20.521 --> 00:38:24.360
where they're creative decisions made around portraying this solo as dangerous

586
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.910
as to not oversimplify the act of soloing,

587
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:31.560
if you worry about the repercussions of newer solo hours upping their game after

588
00:38:31.561 --> 00:38:32.394
seeing this film.

589
00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:37.360
<v 0>Yeah.
So we really just in some ways,</v>

590
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:38.283
uh,

591
00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:44.310
are kind of emos always restraint and we certainly didn't have to make this the

592
00:38:46.031 --> 00:38:48.060
free solo seem more

593
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:49.880
<v 4>scary than it already was.</v>

594
00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:55.070
<v 0>Uh,
because you know,
you try to be objective,
you try to,</v>

595
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:58.910
as a filmmaker,
you try to kind of tell the story.
It is as it is.

596
00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.390
You want to give an honest representation of what it is.
Uh,

597
00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:07.100
so we were very restrained on,
on how we covered it.
I mean,

598
00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:12.980
my crew when they saw the film,
we're all like,

599
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.440
that is so restrained.

600
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:20.270
Like compared to like what being our leader,
the mass because yeah,

601
00:39:20.271 --> 00:39:23.330
I mean it's hard to cover a 3000 foot climb.

602
00:39:23.331 --> 00:39:28.331
Like the number of difficult moves on that wall that aren't in the movie.

603
00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:34.420
I mean that that climb is in some ways notorious and terrifying to think about

604
00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:38.630
even as a professional climber,
even with a rope.
And you know,

605
00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:42.710
I mean when we were filming on that last week before he did it,

606
00:39:42.711 --> 00:39:47.711
there was a team from Germany sponsored by Adidas or Adidas and they were,

607
00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:53.380
they spent five days on the wall and they never climbed every pitch clean,

608
00:39:53.511 --> 00:39:58.511
meaning that they fell multiple times on several of the difficult pitches and

609
00:39:59.151 --> 00:40:02.540
never climbed some of those pitches clean without falling.

610
00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.990
And then they spent five days at,
like,

611
00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.500
he climbed it in three hours and 56 minutes.

612
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:15.590
So it's not like,
I mean it's,
it's just beyond.

613
00:40:15.591 --> 00:40:18.500
So in some ways it's very restrained.
Um,

614
00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:22.820
I think we give people the sense of the magnitude and that's what we really

615
00:40:22.821 --> 00:40:24.320
tried to do.
Uh,

616
00:40:24.321 --> 00:40:28.370
in terms of like worrying about repercussions of newer solo hours either the
way,

617
00:40:28.371 --> 00:40:31.880
Alex,
you know,
I have,

618
00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:37.420
I didn't worry about that as much just because free soloing is kind of a self

619
00:40:38.871 --> 00:40:39.770
regulating

620
00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:43.240
<v 4>activity.
You know,
you can be like,</v>

621
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.960
<v 0>no,
what?
I want to go free Solo el Cap.</v>

622
00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.960
And then you go to the base of El Cap and then you look up at it and you're
like,

623
00:40:48.961 --> 00:40:49.794
whoa.

624
00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:51.280
<v 4>And then you</v>

625
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.640
<v 0>climb like 15 feet up off the ground and you're like,
wait,</v>

626
00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:59.530
I can't actually physically move up any further and this is really scary them to

627
00:40:59.531 --> 00:41:00.364
go back down.

628
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:05.920
So I mean there's like self regulating in a way.
Um,

629
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:07.810
but you know,
I,

630
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.830
I have thought about a bit more about,
you know,

631
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:15.440
if people are going to push themselves as free solo lists,

632
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.240
I just hope everybody,
yeah,

633
00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:24.160
I mean I shouldn't say the Darwin awards.

634
00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:27.710
<v 4>There's certain</v>

635
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:28.923
<v 0>you know,</v>

636
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:34.280
activities that might happen that you just cannot be held for how responsible

637
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.810
<v 4>for it.
But do you have any plants actually released the full four hours?</v>

638
00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:42.530
Do you have any,
you know,
people have asked that.
We do cause we have,

639
00:41:42.531 --> 00:41:44.170
we certainly have the whole

640
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:48.980
<v 0>thanks shot from the long Lens.
Um,
and then pieces all up and mountain rude.</v>

641
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:50.730
But people have asked this,

642
00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:56.150
you guys ever gonna maybe some day if I see it released on Netflix for hours

643
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:02.790
<v 4>climbing horn,
maybe do.</v>

644
00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:07.820
Well maybe I should release that if it happens because of this room [inaudible]

645
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.900
room.
Cool.
All right.
Audience Question.

646
00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:16.860
So my question is about actually Maru and your first attempt.

647
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:22.510
So you mentioned that there were several times where you used the team near,

648
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.670
near,

649
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:28.080
near the top of you guys set several lines and proceeded to cross those lines

650
00:42:28.081 --> 00:42:30.390
several times before finally turning back.

651
00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:33.000
How do you go about making those decisions,

652
00:42:33.001 --> 00:42:35.280
setting those lines and deciding which ones you will cross in,

653
00:42:35.281 --> 00:42:38.520
which once you move out across?
Yeah,

654
00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.500
that's a good question

655
00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.670
because some of it feels,

656
00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:47.443
<v 5>mmm,</v>

657
00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:51.070
<v 0>it's hard to articulate like this specific guidelines,</v>

658
00:42:51.071 --> 00:42:54.730
but I mean that's what experience comes from I think.

659
00:42:54.731 --> 00:42:58.540
And you really have to follow your instincts.

660
00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:03.790
A lot of it,
a lot of those instincts also come from,

661
00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:08.590
you know,
knowing that you have to step outside of yourself.

662
00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:10.493
<v 5>Uh,</v>

663
00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:16.940
<v 0>certainly the ego plays a role in making sometimes bad decisions.</v>

664
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:21.430
Uh,
so you really have to kind of step outside of yourself,

665
00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:26.970
kind of be objective about the actual variables or inputs that you're getting.

666
00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.360
I mean,
the thing about it in the mountains am in life,
I guess,
you know,

667
00:43:31.361 --> 00:43:34.630
there are variables you can control and there are variables you can't control.

668
00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:38.920
And a lot of it is identifying which is which.
Uh,

669
00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:43.300
and you know,
our assessment,
that's,

670
00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:44.800
that's always very important.

671
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:50.190
And that meaning that when you identify the variables that you do control,

672
00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.420
that you,
you know,

673
00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:58.740
take great efforts in managing those variables to the best that you can.

674
00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:02.470
Uh,
in terms of crossing those lines,

675
00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:06.190
it's kind of an ongoing assessment of the risks.

676
00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:08.380
And you know,

677
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:13.710
sometimes you set align and when you get to it and you look around and you are

678
00:44:14.411 --> 00:44:18.070
being objective about the inputs that you're getting,

679
00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.980
oftentimes they're telling you to turn around,

680
00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.410
but sometimes you get to that line and you're like,
oh,

681
00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:28.440
actually we still have some margin and we'll now set another line as kind of a

682
00:44:30.011 --> 00:44:33.900
marker whether,
yeah,
that's,
I guess it would be,

683
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:37.890
sometimes it's a physical line or an intellectual line,
but you know,

684
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.580
and then you kind of take the necessary steps to get to that next line and then

685
00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:44.350
you make another evaluation.
Um,

686
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:48.590
I think it's hard because people sometimes assume that you draw the line,

687
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.550
then you're breaking a,

688
00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:53.940
you're doing something that you don't want to do or shouldn't be doing by

689
00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:56.610
crossing the line.
But it's actually because you've gotten to the line,

690
00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:01.080
made another evaluation and then decided to move forward.
Um,

691
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:05.370
eventually you get to the edge of that line or you get to the edge,

692
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:09.210
you get to that next line and you look at it again and you think,
okay,

693
00:45:09.211 --> 00:45:11.160
this is a turnaround moment.

694
00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:14.010
So I remember there's a part in the film where you say,

695
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:18.360
Alex just constantly pushing the edge and eventually he could find that edge.

696
00:45:18.361 --> 00:45:19.194
Right?
And that's,

697
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:23.970
and that's something that you deal with a lot and in the world that I live in,

698
00:45:23.971 --> 00:45:28.710
but it's,
it's kind of hard to articulate,
uh,
all the different reasons why.

699
00:45:28.711 --> 00:45:33.240
And when you turn around,
uh,
clearly it's based on,
you know,
the risk reward.

700
00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:35.310
Um,
or if the stakes are too high.

701
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:40.270
But know those are evaluations that you're making,
you know,

702
00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.040
all the time.
Yeah.
All right,
we'll do a,
another dory question about another

703
00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:47.650
<v 3>high stakes thing.
So at one point in the film,</v>

704
00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.560
Alex said he didn't want cameras on him for the boulder problem.

705
00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.880
I think he said no one needs to see that.
Obviously that part was filmed.

706
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:57.940
And it was epic.
Is that something you discussed with Alex prior?

707
00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.410
It take some convincing.

708
00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:05.540
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
uh,
I'm glad people are paying attention.</v>

709
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:06.913
<v 3>No,</v>

710
00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:10.670
<v 0>very,
it seems like everybody that works here pays very good.</v>

711
00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:11.853
<v 3>Okay.</v>

712
00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:15.620
<v 0>It is.
Uh,
but yes,</v>

713
00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:19.510
he does say that he doesn't want anybody to film it at one point.
Uh,

714
00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:21.830
then he goes up,

715
00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:27.220
he fails on that one attempt and his realization and learning from it is that,

716
00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:32.480
okay,
if I'm going to climb in front of my friends,

717
00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:36.470
it just means I have to be way better prepared in the film.

718
00:46:36.471 --> 00:46:38.130
It's kind of portray that,
you know,

719
00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:41.570
he turns around because of too many people around and the cameras and stuff,

720
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.840
but he actually just wasn't really ready.
Uh,

721
00:46:44.841 --> 00:46:49.250
his ankle was still swollen and it was really cold that he couldn't feel his

722
00:46:49.251 --> 00:46:53.570
toes.
Um,
but he did realize,
look,
I just have to be better prepared,

723
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:57.560
which we all thought it was great.
Uh,

724
00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:02.720
so as he got closer and closer in his training to the day that he actually went

725
00:47:02.721 --> 00:47:06.920
for it,
you know,
it was a very ongoing,
open conversation.
The thing is,

726
00:47:06.921 --> 00:47:11.921
is I was never pushing for it because I didn't need to push Alex and say,

727
00:47:13.341 --> 00:47:15.010
we really want a camera that we were like,

728
00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:19.430
he knows exactly what I,
you know,

729
00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:22.700
what this is all about.
And that of course,
you know,

730
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:25.970
if possible we'd have a camera there,
but if not,
that's fine.

731
00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:30.040
That's the whole that thing where,
you know,

732
00:47:30.041 --> 00:47:34.120
you could never let the needs of the film,
you know,

733
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:37.270
outweigh the needs of Alex and his experience,

734
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:38.860
which is how we went into the film.

735
00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:43.720
We were very clear with him and with the crew and with our executive producers

736
00:47:43.721 --> 00:47:47.680
and with the studio that this,
you know,
the film,

737
00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:52.980
so you understand the needs of the film will never outweigh his safety and his

738
00:47:53.171 --> 00:47:58.170
experience.
So,
um,
eventually you had that conversation and he was like,
yeah,

739
00:47:58.171 --> 00:48:02.570
I'm,
he's like,
definitely,
that's fine.
That's not going to bother me.
Uh,

740
00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:05.110
but I don't want a person there.

741
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:09.730
So we put remote cameras there and,
and uh,

742
00:48:09.731 --> 00:48:13.570
it was fine.
And,
and the reason being that clearly he didn't,
you know,

743
00:48:13.571 --> 00:48:15.520
if he felt that he didn't want his friends to see it,
but

744
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:17.980
<v 2>he knew that</v>

745
00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.130
<v 0>she wouldn't be stressed,</v>

746
00:48:21.131 --> 00:48:24.700
but we would be projecting fear onto him,

747
00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:28.300
which would then change how he was feeling in the client.

748
00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:32.680
And so that's why we had a fixed cameras.
Yeah.
Throughout the film,

749
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:37.210
generally when you were shown,
um,
you were kind of always stressed,

750
00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.473
<v 4>just</v>

751
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:44.280
<v 0>you were at least for his final attempt where he succeeds,
you were at the top,</v>

752
00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:47.460
you weren't really filming where you kind of just driving?
I was actually,

753
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:53.460
uh,
it does look like I was at the top because I was actually filming the Enduro

754
00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:55.140
Corner,
but I,

755
00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:00.060
so I was also shooting in National Geographic assignment for the magazine.

756
00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:02.550
During the two years we were producing and directing this.

757
00:49:02.551 --> 00:49:06.870
So I had a still camera bolted to the top of my film camera.

758
00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:10.980
And so I've,
after I found him on the enduro corner,

759
00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:13.680
I was shooting stills simultaneously.

760
00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.460
Then he goes up and he traverses that,
uh,

761
00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:21.840
we didn't have enough cameraman to shoot.
Uh,

762
00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:26.040
I had one on the top,
basically my Veritate DP when shot,

763
00:49:26.041 --> 00:49:30.360
I'm going to the base and then ran all the way around and up to the top.
Um,

764
00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:32.740
yeah,
it's a long,
yeah,

765
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:34.603
<v 4>wait,</v>

766
00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:38.850
<v 0>that's the basic expectation now that you have to be able to move like that.</v>

767
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:44.020
But I didn't have a still photographer up there obviously for you're shooting in

768
00:49:44.021 --> 00:49:46.770
a two year assignment of Alex free solely or cap,

769
00:49:46.771 --> 00:49:50.940
you kind of have to get topping out.
So I,
I was,

770
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:54.390
as soon as he crossed above me and over on the traverse,

771
00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:59.660
I had to put all the camera on equipment and the way and jog up to the top,

772
00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:04.830
but it's like
close to a thousand feet or 800 feet.

773
00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:08.880
And so I'm just going as fast as they can and he's around the corner.

774
00:50:08.881 --> 00:50:10.200
I can't see him.

775
00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:14.970
But the whole ground crew was watching in the long lens and they said we were

776
00:50:14.971 --> 00:50:15.590
like going.
Right,

777
00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:19.220
<v 4>exactly.
They're like,
oh Jimmy,
go.</v>

778
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:25.390
<v 0>Then the lines intersected at one point.</v>

779
00:50:25.391 --> 00:50:28.100
So right when I,
to this one anchor,

780
00:50:28.101 --> 00:50:32.600
I looked down and Alex is like scampering up the rock and I was just like,
Alex,

781
00:50:32.601 --> 00:50:34.440
I was like,
you just give me six weeks.

782
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:35.323
<v 4>Second,</v>

783
00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:39.680
<v 0>he pulled out his phone,
you live in his lane and he just said,</v>

784
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:44.160
I'm about to break four hours.
And we didn't say another word.

785
00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:46.220
<v 4>I knew what that meant.</v>

786
00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.830
<v 0>I was like,
Alex does not want four hours in one minute.</v>

787
00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.970
<v 4>Okay.
So I just turned around and I juggle</v>

788
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:59.560
to the top and that's why I'm like sweating profusely while is that too?

789
00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.860
Um,
constant hair falling out.

790
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.460
So I had to get to the top

791
00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:10.690
<v 0>and shoot the photos of him tapping out.
I beat him by like,
uh,</v>

792
00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:11.710
like a minute or something.

793
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:13.350
<v 4>Good word.
Yeah.</v>

794
00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:13.911
<v 0>All right.</v>

795
00:51:13.911 --> 00:51:18.830
So probably have time for one more in person question.

796
00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:22.840
<v 6>Hi there.
Thanks for coming.
Um,
my questions are two part.</v>

797
00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:27.900
One is how has your relationship with Alex change since the,
you know,

798
00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:31.860
the filming process and ending this with him and maybe more philosophically,

799
00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:35.370
how do you think Alex has relationship with climbing has changed after he's

800
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.960
finished?
Um,
this climb.

801
00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:42.320
<v 0>Uh,
well my religion with Alex is about the same.</v>

802
00:51:42.321 --> 00:51:47.321
Like we ha he likes to throw me under the bus every so often and I like to throw

803
00:51:47.661 --> 00:51:49.250
him under the bus.
That resa no,

804
00:51:49.251 --> 00:51:53.240
but we've always had like a very good relationship and I think Alex,

805
00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:55.700
actually I think we are closer.

806
00:51:55.701 --> 00:51:59.590
I mean through the process certainly has brought us closer.
Uh,

807
00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:04.600
I also think that he is really appreciative of what the film is cause he didn't

808
00:52:06.351 --> 00:52:09.620
ever really care about the film he carried about free soloing El Cap.

809
00:52:09.621 --> 00:52:14.000
He knew that we were doing our thing.
Um,
but I think he's been surprised that,

810
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.361
you know,

811
00:52:14.361 --> 00:52:19.040
how well it's been received and that people really feel inspired by him,

812
00:52:19.041 --> 00:52:22.490
are connected to him.
Uh,
and

813
00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:23.860
<v 1>okay.</v>

814
00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:27.850
<v 0>You know,
I,
I think he enjoys that.
Uh,
he,</v>

815
00:52:27.851 --> 00:52:32.230
he loves going to watch the end of the film because,
you know,
it's like,

816
00:52:32.231 --> 00:52:32.861
he's like,
oh,

817
00:52:32.861 --> 00:52:37.861
I get to relive the best moment of my life on this huge screen with all these

818
00:52:37.871 --> 00:52:39.000
people all the time.

819
00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:41.840
<v 4>Uh,</v>

820
00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:45.230
<v 0>but his relationship to climbing though,
and free soloing,</v>

821
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:49.340
I mean he is still,
you know,

822
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:53.630
going to climb as much as he possibly can cause he loves climbing.
Uh,

823
00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:58.540
is he going to be pushing for huge free solos?
I,
you know,

824
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:03.320
I don't know.
Yeah,
I think he's just like most climbers.
Like you're,

825
00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:05.150
you have to be kind of motivated,

826
00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:09.380
inspired to climb something to really go after it.

827
00:53:09.381 --> 00:53:13.430
But I think that he has in soloing oh,
cap.
I mean,

828
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:19.680
there isn't like a hole.
There isn't a whole lot elsewhere.
You can go with it.

829
00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:22.410
Um,
he's,
he's free soloing El Cap,

830
00:53:22.411 --> 00:53:24.960
so I think he'll probably

831
00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.030
focus his energy and all the different expressions of climbing that are out

832
00:53:30.031 --> 00:53:34.050
there and enjoy it as moment.
And then he's really,
his whole thing too is like,

833
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:37.910
he's like,
fame is useless unless you can use it for good.
That's,

834
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:42.540
so he's pivoting a lot of the attention towards his Honnold foundation,
uh,

835
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:45.570
you know,
which does solar projects around the world and,

836
00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:50.640
and that is something that he,
you know,
really believes in.

837
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.530
So,
yeah.
That's great.

838
00:53:52.531 --> 00:53:55.290
So I think that it's probably all the time we have for questions.
I mean,

839
00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:59.610
but the remaining few minutes that we have,
anything you want to plug pitch?
No,

840
00:53:59.611 --> 00:54:00.570
not really.
I mean,

841
00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:05.250
I just hope you all enjoy the film and I really appreciate,
again,

842
00:54:05.251 --> 00:54:09.150
that you follow the work and that you're going to see it and that you came out

843
00:54:09.151 --> 00:54:12.660
to see me today,
I guess.
Let me,
that's awesome.
So thank you so much.

844
00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:18.640
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
