00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.170
Introducing the director of this documentary.
Sabaah follow Jaan.

2
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.213
<v 2>How are you?</v>

4
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.630
Thank you everyone for coming and taking the time out of your busy day.

5
00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:27.080
I'm sure everybody has lots to do,
so it's great to see you all.
[inaudible]

6
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.130
<v 0>so before we jump into the movie,</v>

7
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.570
I've just got a few contexts that in questions and I think would help kind of

8
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:39.830
inform the audience about bit about who you are and how some of these things

9
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:44.810
started.
Um,
I understand that you are from,
uh,
southern California,

10
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.870
south central Los Angeles to be exact.

11
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.350
Can you talk a little bit about your upbringing and how your upbringing against

12
00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:58.931
the backdrop of the 1992 riots shaped some of your outlook for this movie?

13
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.260
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,</v>

14
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:05.340
so I was born and raised on 41st and figure out what,

15
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:07.050
which is very close to USC.

16
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:12.051
It's probably to USC what Harlan would be to Columbia in a sense of kind of

17
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:16.740
being two different worlds right next to each other.
And so the riots happened.

18
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:20.970
I was two years old.
I don't really remember much,
but when I was four,

19
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.140
my mom moved us to Hawaii where we lived until I was about nine years old.

20
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:29.490
So for that little period of my childhood,
I grew up using rainwater,

21
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:31.950
solar power,
you know,
eating from the land,

22
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:35.190
just being really connected to nature and for my mom,

23
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:38.670
I think that was her way of trying to give me a better life.

24
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.160
I was homeschooled during that time,
you know,

25
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:44.610
she wanted to find something that was different than the options that were

26
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:47.520
available when you're a mom in south central La.

27
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:50.880
So when I came back to the mainland,

28
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.970
I remember very clearly I started public school and about the second grade and I

29
00:01:56.371 --> 00:02:01.371
was so disturbed by segregation and it was so obvious to me because I had kind

30
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:06.240
of been in this,
you know,
outside context and I was like,

31
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:09.960
why is it the other people who are picking up the trash are brown and all the

32
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:12.450
people who drive nice cars are white.
And you know,

33
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:15.930
these things were just very jarring to me because I hadn't really seen them.

34
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:20.760
I hadn't really grown up thinking that that was normal.
And so,
um,

35
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.511
you know,

36
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:26.340
as I got older I kind of thought that the way that I would make a difference was

37
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:29.610
to become a doctor,
be a successful person,
you know,

38
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:33.480
eventually one day give back to my community.
So I,
uh,

39
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.630
graduated from Columbia in 2013 and I was premed there.

40
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.450
I took the MCAT,
I was working at a nonprofit that did reentry,

41
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:46.080
working with people who are incarcerated to try to help them get their lives

42
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:49.560
back together.
And,
um,
you know,

43
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:51.420
medicine just wasn't really speaking to me.

44
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.660
My brother's a doctor and he was going through the process and loving it and

45
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:57.450
feeling fulfilled and feeling like he was moving toward his goals.

46
00:02:57.451 --> 00:03:01.750
And I was kind of forcing myself along trying to be this person,

47
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:05.440
trying to be this kind of savior kid that I thought I had to be.

48
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.130
So when Mike Brown was killed,
um,

49
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.160
it really just called to something like really deep inside of me and all of

50
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:16.600
those questions that I had about my path and about how I could get involved in

51
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:18.610
this kind of idea that I would,
you know,

52
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:22.030
be a doctor and make scholarships for kids and maybe one day,

53
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:26.170
like write a book that someone would find it turned into a movie.
Um,
you know,

54
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:31.171
all that seems so silly in comparison to this life or death situation.

55
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.420
And it was like,
you know,
you can't,
I just felt like I couldn't sit it out.

56
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.480
So I got to Ferguson about a month after Mike Brown was killed actually with one

57
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:44.290
of your fellow Googlers,
Jayna London,
who's here.
Um,
we went,

58
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.480
we were actually just doing community service.

59
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.740
I wanted to interview people at the protest to show that there was going to be a

60
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:55.060
longterm traumatic effect and try to look at it from a public health approach

61
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:58.120
because those were the sort of skills that I had at the time.

62
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.350
And then really quickly,
it kind of grew larger than that.

63
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.160
And those little,
my little pamphlets were not really useful.

64
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:09.370
It's the middle of the night and there's tear gas and pepper spray flying.

65
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:13.420
So that's how we sort of organically just started rolling and asking questions.

66
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.100
Got It.
Got It.
So you and your code director,
Damon Davis,

67
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.470
uh,
you had never worked together before.
No.
Um,
in fact you would never even met.

68
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.930
Can you talk us through how you two met and decided that you wanted to make a

69
00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:33.100
movie together?
Hmm.
Yeah.

70
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:36.700
So about two weeks after we got out there,

71
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.360
we started filming and we knew we had to see it through and we didn't know what

72
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:43.660
format it was going to be in.
We didn't know if it was going to be,
you know,

73
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.050
some kind of ongoing thing where we're putting out short bursts and trying to

74
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:50.830
give like a counter news narrative.
But then we couldn't keep up with that cycle.

75
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.280
And I'm,

76
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.380
Damon was somebody who is really well respected in Saint Louis visual artists.

77
00:04:56.381 --> 00:04:58.090
He's got work in the Smithsonian.

78
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.220
He recently had an exhibit at the was just like really all around bright and

79
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:07.840
artistic,
artistic person.
So once we decided it needed to be a feature,

80
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.560
we decided that we needed to work with someone who was from there because we

81
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:16.210
didn't want to make a movie that showed this place as though this was always how

82
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:17.270
it was,
you know,

83
00:05:17.271 --> 00:05:22.271
like it seemed like this whole city of Saint Louis got to reduce to got reduced

84
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.740
this moment in Ferguson.

85
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.910
And so we wanted to work with someone who could take us deeper than what we were

86
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:29.310
already seeing.
Um,

87
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.800
and we kind of just started putting feelers out and Damon's name kept coming

88
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:35.140
back.
Damon Damon Damon,
till about three months in,

89
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.500
we connected and you know,
he came on,

90
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:41.650
he's such a professional artist and strong person.
He was like,
okay,

91
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:44.990
so I'm going to come on board,
but I have to direct this.
And I was like,
well,

92
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.240
I'm working on this for a couple months but maybe we can,
you know,
share and,

93
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.680
and I was really glad that he did kind of assert himself in that way because he

94
00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:57.500
was such a mentor to me as far as how to be a professional artist,

95
00:05:57.501 --> 00:05:59.210
how to protect your ideas.

96
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:03.560
And your subjectivity while still trying to sell your product.
And um,
you know,

97
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:07.190
just has always been so clear and so committed and also brought that level of

98
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:11.390
accountability that it seemed like other media outlets really didn't have in the

99
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:13.480
way that they were reporting the story.
Got It.

100
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.000
<v 0>So you talked about Damon and in the fact that he's from the Ferguson area,</v>

101
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.310
can you talk to me a little bit more about how important it is to have an

102
00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:28.311
African American man from Ferguson as well as you as an African American woman

103
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.170
telling this story about what happened?

104
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.380
<v 2>I think it's really,
really important.
Um,
you know,</v>

105
00:06:37.381 --> 00:06:38.910
the fact that we're a man and a woman,

106
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.840
what we didn't really touch on directly in this film,
but that,
you know,

107
00:06:42.841 --> 00:06:45.810
I'm sure everyone is familiar with is a lot of that tension,

108
00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:50.750
that gendered tension that happens within social justice movements.
Um,

109
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.380
where,
you know,

110
00:06:52.381 --> 00:06:57.000
typically it's kind of the CIS Hetero Lens that says anybody who's outside of

111
00:06:57.001 --> 00:06:59.640
that identity,
if they're advocating for themselves,

112
00:06:59.641 --> 00:07:01.650
they're taking away from the greater good.

113
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:04.290
They're taking away from the real issue.

114
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.900
And so that was definitely at play here.

115
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:12.210
And we try to counteract it by just representing these different lanes and

116
00:07:12.211 --> 00:07:16.200
allowing them to sit side by side and showing how none of these people are

117
00:07:16.201 --> 00:07:17.820
really working against each other.

118
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.120
And we also felt like our collaboration was an opportunity to sort of model what

119
00:07:23.371 --> 00:07:25.830
does it look like for people to,
you know,

120
00:07:25.831 --> 00:07:29.370
work through this conditioning that we have worked through these kinds of
issues.

121
00:07:29.371 --> 00:07:31.860
And there definitely were struggles and,

122
00:07:31.861 --> 00:07:34.500
and difficult conversations that had to be had.
Um,

123
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.130
but they meant just always continuously stepped up to the plate.

124
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.170
And I think through our relationship,

125
00:07:40.171 --> 00:07:43.500
I feel like we learned a lot about those tensions and it,
at least for me,

126
00:07:43.501 --> 00:07:45.000
it's been a really critical experience.

127
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.800
<v 0>Sure.
So in this whole experience,</v>

128
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.250
is there anything that you feel like you learned about yourself?

129
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.780
If you think about a movie,
it always has an arc.
What's your personal arc in the,

130
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.960
the,
the making of this documentary?

131
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.450
<v 2>Really good question.
Um,
I mean I've learned so much about myself,</v>

132
00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:07.900
but one thing is just,
you know,

133
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.660
it maybe it's a woman thing.
I don't know,
maybe it's me,

134
00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:14.650
but I kind of have had this hesitation about telling people what to do.

135
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:20.010
So when you're a person with a strong vision whose title is director and is

136
00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:24.030
hesitant to tell people to do,
you know,
it's,

137
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.220
it's tough and also a woman and it's hard.

138
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.770
A lot of times it's hard for men to follow women's lead.

139
00:08:29.771 --> 00:08:32.840
And I don't mean that in a,
in a sense that they're always bigoted,

140
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.100
but I just think that there's something about that there's not,

141
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.700
it's not just like riding a bike for us collectively.

142
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:44.730
And so just really stepping into that lane as a director and owning authorship

143
00:08:45.941 --> 00:08:48.430
and,
and looking at this film,
you know,

144
00:08:48.431 --> 00:08:52.780
and it's like 80% done and trying to figure out,
okay,
where's my voice in here?

145
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.850
Where am I in here?
And,

146
00:08:53.851 --> 00:08:57.480
and being okay with and being okay with telling my editor know it.

147
00:08:57.481 --> 00:08:58.550
And it has to be this way.

148
00:08:58.551 --> 00:09:02.400
It being okay with pushing back on producers and people who are older than me

149
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:06.510
and kind of just being centered in the idea that I could have a vision and that

150
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:09.690
I could see it through and for them that that wasn't wrong.
You know,

151
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:13.290
there's like a lot of shame that comes along as a woman with,

152
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.670
with exerting are well over a situation when other people disagree.

153
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.410
Um,
and you know,
I don't think that kind of hierarchy is always necessary,

154
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:25.920
but sometimes in a film process a director has to say this is what it is.

155
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:30.921
And so just finding the ability to do that and to try to do that graciously and

156
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:34.110
to sort of accept that,
you know,
you,

157
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:38.430
you don't always get to be everybody's best friend and the nurturing provider

158
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:42.930
and also the one who's steering the ship.
And so that was just,
you know,

159
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:43.890
that's been a learning experience.

160
00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:46.470
Something that I'm still learning and figuring out how to grapple with.

161
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.523
<v 0>Okay.</v>

162
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:52.780
So the film has received rave reviews at Sundance.

163
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.990
Congrats.
Thank you.
Um,

164
00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.840
talk to us a little bit about the nuts and bolts of how this got made from a

165
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.930
business perspective.
How did you get the financing?

166
00:10:01.931 --> 00:10:06.880
How did it gain attention and traction to be acquired by a major studio?

167
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.860
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,</v>

168
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.430
I mean a lot of that felt like it was really the universe.

169
00:10:12.431 --> 00:10:17.260
Like a lot of things really just sort of happen in these ways that felt a lot

170
00:10:17.261 --> 00:10:18.011
bigger than us.

171
00:10:18.011 --> 00:10:22.480
And so I credit first and foremost the people of Saint Louis for what they did.

172
00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:25.390
And they created this moment in the situation.

173
00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:29.950
They dramatize this issue in a way that everybody had to pay attention.
Um,

174
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.180
and I also credit the documentary film community are our supporters,

175
00:10:34.181 --> 00:10:36.320
Macarthur Ford,
um,

176
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.420
thresh hold Sundance Tribeca,
firelight media lab,

177
00:10:40.421 --> 00:10:43.750
which is a lab for first and second time they'll makers of color.

178
00:10:43.751 --> 00:10:48.550
I mean really we had no idea until we connected with our first producer Flannery

179
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:53.170
and she introduced us to fire light and then this kind of floodgate of

180
00:10:53.171 --> 00:10:57.760
documentary funders open and we didn't know that they were there and everyone

181
00:10:57.761 --> 00:10:59.840
was so receptive to the idea.

182
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:04.240
Two young black first time filmmakers being the ones to tell the story.

183
00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:05.620
And we told them,
you know,

184
00:11:05.621 --> 00:11:09.050
we need x hundred thousand dollars from music licensing and we want to do an

185
00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:12.700
animation that we were gonna do and people continue to respond and continue to

186
00:11:12.701 --> 00:11:14.800
trust us.
And I think,
you know,
it was,

187
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.650
I think it was the strength of the material is the strength of what people were

188
00:11:17.651 --> 00:11:19.750
doing out there.
But it was also sort of,

189
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.800
I think my experience as a go at the Columbia call center,

190
00:11:23.801 --> 00:11:27.340
just kind of making those cold calls and raising that money,
you know,

191
00:11:27.341 --> 00:11:29.860
and not being afraid to ask for what it takes.

192
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:34.090
And we were talking earlier about project management and a lot of times people

193
00:11:34.091 --> 00:11:38.170
struggle in documentary especially because they don't want to ask for everything

194
00:11:38.171 --> 00:11:38.921
that they need.

195
00:11:38.921 --> 00:11:42.160
They want to figure out a way to minimize it and ask for as little as possible.

196
00:11:42.161 --> 00:11:45.550
And there's a lot of sticker shock and a big part of our strategy,

197
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.360
my strategy was I'm not going to try to do something with less than what I need

198
00:11:49.361 --> 00:11:53.710
to do it.
That's just a set up for failure.
So,
um,
yeah,
was a lot.

199
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:57.310
It was just a combination I think of of everything coming together at the right

200
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:58.210
time.
Okay.

201
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.760
<v 0>So let's start to zoom into the,
the actual movie.
Um,</v>

202
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.610
now that you've made it,
what do you want people to,

203
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:12.480
to take away from the movie after they've seen it?

204
00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:19.570
<v 2>I would want people to leave the film feeling shaking and feeling unnerved.</v>

205
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:24.920
And I don't,
we,
we were really particular not to be prescriptive.

206
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.320
We didn't want to tell people what to think,

207
00:12:27.321 --> 00:12:31.400
how to think exactly what to do next because there is no formula.

208
00:12:31.401 --> 00:12:36.050
There's nobody in the middle of St Louis who can tell some body in this room how

209
00:12:36.051 --> 00:12:37.310
they need to live their life.

210
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:42.970
But I think in the barrage of information and facts and figures and perspectives

211
00:12:44.781 --> 00:12:48.560
and buzzwords,
we lose sight of what's human about this.

212
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.200
We lose sight of kind of that emotional compass that we have that allows us to

213
00:12:54.231 --> 00:12:57.380
discern and know and feel what's right.

214
00:12:57.381 --> 00:13:01.520
And I think in the context of so much information overload and chaos,

215
00:13:01.521 --> 00:13:05.810
we really wanted to make something that could bring people back to Earth about

216
00:13:05.811 --> 00:13:07.580
it.
Um,
and,

217
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.640
and hopefully be sort of a guidepost to encourage people to move in the right

218
00:13:13.011 --> 00:13:16.370
direction and make the choices that they have to make in their everyday lives

219
00:13:16.371 --> 00:13:18.740
and whatever sacrifices that you know,
may take.

220
00:13:18.741 --> 00:13:21.050
And it will be different for each of us.
You know,

221
00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:24.650
not all of us is going to go and be in the street and make it that particular

222
00:13:24.651 --> 00:13:25.311
sacrifice,

223
00:13:25.311 --> 00:13:30.260
but I think everyone probably every day has an opportunity to make a decision

224
00:13:30.261 --> 00:13:32.300
about where they stand on something important.

225
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.940
<v 0>Right.
Thank you.
During the movie,</v>

226
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.940
you followed a number of activists.

227
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.200
Why did you select those particular activists and how did you gain their trust?

228
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.913
Um,

229
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.800
<v 2>so we followed like seven people in depth.</v>

230
00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:56.190
So a lot of the people you see like Kayla,
like Tori,

231
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.020
we've spent a lot of time with them.

232
00:13:58.021 --> 00:14:02.820
Tef Poe and a lot of that didn't make it into the film ultimately because we

233
00:14:02.821 --> 00:14:04.290
only had a certain amount of time.

234
00:14:04.291 --> 00:14:09.230
And David and Brittany stories ended up being the most developed as far as an RF

235
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.140
from beginning to end.
So that was sort of a practical choice.

236
00:14:13.141 --> 00:14:16.800
We really wanted to include as many people as possible and we knew that we were

237
00:14:16.801 --> 00:14:20.130
risking,
um,
from a storytelling perspective,

238
00:14:20.131 --> 00:14:23.550
we knew that that was a technical risk because the more people you include the

239
00:14:23.551 --> 00:14:25.920
last step that you can get in the right amount of time.

240
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:31.310
But we felt like it was important not to make this into like a MLK Rosa parks

241
00:14:31.701 --> 00:14:35.970
situation where there's one messiah figure who's,
because that's not what it is.

242
00:14:35.971 --> 00:14:37.980
That's not what it was.
And you know,

243
00:14:37.981 --> 00:14:39.660
that's not what the solution is going to look like.

244
00:14:39.661 --> 00:14:44.100
So we followed people who are taking different perspectives from each other.

245
00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:46.980
We've followed people who were bringing something different to the table,

246
00:14:46.981 --> 00:14:47.814
each of them.

247
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.680
We wanted to show that this movement is an ecosystem and that there are myriad

248
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:53.420
ways that you can participate.

249
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.960
<v 0>And how did you gain their trust because you followed them.</v>

250
00:14:56.961 --> 00:15:01.961
It's such an intimate way and they had to really put a trusting you to ensure

251
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:05.960
that you are going to portray them in the most responsible light.

252
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.943
Um,

253
00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:13.570
<v 2>I think consistency was a big thing at first.
It wasn't there at first.
You know,</v>

254
00:15:13.571 --> 00:15:16.960
we would get them when they were outside and then we would have meetings.

255
00:15:16.961 --> 00:15:17.900
Sometimes they would show,

256
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:21.340
sometimes they went in and then eventually it got to the point where we could

257
00:15:21.341 --> 00:15:24.100
show up at their house at five o'clock in the morning and film and getting out

258
00:15:24.101 --> 00:15:29.050
of bed.
And so that just took time and consistency.
And you know,

259
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:34.230
we were always very upfront about where we stood and we weren't out to vilify

260
00:15:34.541 --> 00:15:35.860
anyone in particular.

261
00:15:35.861 --> 00:15:40.480
We were really seeking the humanity in the situation and we were really guided

262
00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:44.350
by the idea that life is precious,
that all life is precious,

263
00:15:44.351 --> 00:15:48.640
that human life is more precious than PR,
than property.
Um,

264
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.640
and I think just that being clear to people by the way,

265
00:15:51.641 --> 00:15:54.100
that we were behaving by the questions that we're asking.

266
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.580
And also having Damon again was a huge part of it because here's someone that

267
00:15:57.581 --> 00:15:59.410
can wake up,
they can go to his house,
you know,

268
00:15:59.411 --> 00:16:03.760
it's not someone just parachuting in and out.
Um,
so yeah,
it was just,

269
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:08.500
it was an organic process and I think as not being kind of media train probably

270
00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:11.080
helped in that sense because we were really just people.

271
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.240
They are trying to figure out what,
what's going on.

272
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.020
<v 0>And now that the movie is out,
are you still in touch with any of them?</v>

273
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.960
What's their sense of how the movie came out?

274
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.850
<v 2>Everyone has been very excited about the movie.</v>

275
00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:28.180
We showed it to them before the premiere.
We had people,
you know,

276
00:16:28.181 --> 00:16:29.920
I don't know if anyone's involved in activism,

277
00:16:29.921 --> 00:16:33.790
but social movements are not always the most fun and friendly.

278
00:16:33.791 --> 00:16:35.800
After a while there's a lot of tension,
a lot of passion.

279
00:16:35.801 --> 00:16:40.801
So we had people who hadn't even been in the room together for over a year who

280
00:16:41.051 --> 00:16:45.610
were thanking us for including them in the same story together and remembering

281
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.870
why they initially got involved.
And that was just,
that was the reward for me.

282
00:16:49.871 --> 00:16:50.110
Like,

283
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:54.220
even before we had gone to Sundance to have that feedback and to have the people

284
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.370
who made this possible say,
yes,
this is what I lived through.

285
00:16:57.371 --> 00:17:02.140
This is what my experience was like.
Um,
that was just a really powerful feeling.

286
00:17:02.141 --> 00:17:02.974
Yeah.

287
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.820
<v 0>I Miss President Obama.</v>

288
00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:16.170
<v 1>True,
true.
I don't even have a question.
I just want to,</v>

289
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:24.280
<v 0>there's one point in the documentary where he shown,
and uh,</v>

290
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.170
the quote is something like,
um,

291
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.600
I don't want to seem like I'm putting my thumb on the scale one way or the

292
00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:35.360
other.
What do you think about that?

293
00:17:35.361 --> 00:17:40.361
I know he came under a lot of criticism because people expected him to do so

294
00:17:40.671 --> 00:17:41.504
much more.

295
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.130
Do you think there's anything more that he could have done and what would that

296
00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:49.980
have been?
Um,
know,
I really

297
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.980
<v 2>cannot imagine what it would be like to have to make presidential decisions.</v>

298
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.550
Um,
I can't imagine where he would have to be weighing in that situation.

299
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:04.440
But at the end of the day,
you know,

300
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:10.020
historically the federal government has really been the only protection black

301
00:18:10.021 --> 00:18:12.270
folks have from racism in this country.

302
00:18:12.271 --> 00:18:15.720
So when a president takes a hands on,

303
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:20.750
hands off approach in the context of the default being racism and there hasn't

304
00:18:20.791 --> 00:18:24.990
been any particular event,
treaty w you know,

305
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.980
reconciliation that I've heard of that would suggest that racism is over.

306
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:34.370
So not putting your finger on the scale is standing back on a really unbalanced

307
00:18:35.011 --> 00:18:38.730
scale.
And you know,
I don't know what he could have done.

308
00:18:38.731 --> 00:18:42.390
I don't know where he should should've done.
I'm an artist,
I'm not a politician,

309
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.020
but I think he should have done something.
Um,

310
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.990
and I think that by not coming,

311
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:54.530
I think he really limited his chance to actually understand what was really,

312
00:18:54.871 --> 00:18:59.130
really at play and maybe say something or do something that would have felt more

313
00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:02.310
in touch to the people who were seeing this side of it every day.

314
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.020
Cause he never came.
And I,

315
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:07.080
and that was a big thing for people in the ground that he never showed up.

316
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.240
He never treated this like a state of emergency.
And it felt like a Katrina.

317
00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.990
It felt like one of these events where people were just being abandoned.

318
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.850
And I think in that moment,
you know,

319
00:19:17.851 --> 00:19:21.240
I think everybody's aware of the limitations of the,
of the president.

320
00:19:21.241 --> 00:19:23.850
Nobody thought he was going to swoop in like Batman,

321
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.530
but it would have been great to have some official acknowledgement of this and

322
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:32.910
kind of elevate the issue rather than,
you know,

323
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.600
he maintained a distance from this movement and as a result of the movement

324
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.860
stayed in this sort of far,
you know,
fringe counter.

325
00:19:40.861 --> 00:19:43.950
So now we're talking about things like the all right in the alt left,

326
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.670
but there's no,
there's absolutely no parallel there,
you know,

327
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.490
so when you don't get that kind of official endorsement,

328
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.670
it just leaves you feeling more vulnerable than ever.

329
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.610
You just finished talking about kind of comparing it to Katrina and when I

330
00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:04.500
looked at it,
um,
there was someone who,
who compared it to the West Bank.

331
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:09.570
There was a lot of fear,
chaos,
violence and certainty.

332
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.230
Was there any point during the filming of this movie,

333
00:20:13.231 --> 00:20:15.330
particularly since you were so close,

334
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.170
where you felt like that you were in danger?
But yeah,

335
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.890
I always felt that I was in danger.
Um,
and you don't,

336
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.550
and especially as a documentary filmmaker without a press pass and as a black

337
00:20:26.551 --> 00:20:31.140
woman,
you don't get rid of as press.
And so I always had to be really,

338
00:20:31.141 --> 00:20:35.400
really cautious.
It was interesting,
you know,
we have a very diverse team,

339
00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:40.401
so it's interesting being down there with a white or white looking camera man

340
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.250
because he could move in spaces that I couldn't move and he could go behind the

341
00:20:44.251 --> 00:20:46.470
police line and film from over their shoulders.

342
00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.430
But it wasn't safe for me to do that.
Um,
I was arrested,
pepper spray,

343
00:20:51.431 --> 00:20:55.840
tear gassed,
you know,
all the different things.
Taunted the police and you know,

344
00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:57.850
and it was very personal at times.

345
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.750
So you had to be careful not to get identified and flagged for,
you know,

346
00:21:01.751 --> 00:21:05.560
next time you were out there.
Um,
you know,
it's,

347
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.900
it's gloves off,
especially when it gets to be nighttime.

348
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.600
And then when the cameras are gone,

349
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.190
it's really gloves off and you feel like you're out there with a bunch of men in

350
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:19.510
black who have a bunch of toys.
And to them it's a video game.
Like you can,

351
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:22.120
you can just feel it.
You know,
they're,
they're in their squad,

352
00:21:22.121 --> 00:21:27.121
they've got their commands and there's this some sort of reverie in the air when

353
00:21:27.581 --> 00:21:28.810
they're,
when they're doing this,

354
00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:30.910
when they're kind of bearing down on people like this,

355
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.500
not on behalf of every single cop.

356
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.850
But when you saw the footage of the non indictment and that unified command,

357
00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:41.260
I mean it's still really unclear who those officers were,

358
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.810
what police departments they came from,

359
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:48.310
whether they were in Saint Louis or from the larger area in Missouri who is

360
00:21:48.311 --> 00:21:51.490
ultimately in control in the chain of command.

361
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:56.500
So you just have a bunch of people in a completely anonymous black uniforms with

362
00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:00.850
outrageous artillery and you don't even know if something happens,

363
00:22:00.851 --> 00:22:04.270
who would you go to later because there's literally nothing that you can do in

364
00:22:04.271 --> 00:22:05.870
the moment.
So,
um,

365
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:10.890
it was really terrifying and I really hope that people can read it outside of

366
00:22:11.231 --> 00:22:16.231
the context of a racial dialogue and understand what it means for democracy when

367
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:20.470
local police have that level of power,
there is no threat to match that,

368
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.790
which means that functionally,
you know,
that stuff is for crowd control.

369
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:27.910
That stuff is for us when people decide that they don't like what their

370
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:30.550
government is doing.
And that's really,

371
00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:34.900
really destabilizing to any potential of democracy because just the knowledge

372
00:22:34.901 --> 00:22:39.490
that that's out there discourages people from coming out discourages people from

373
00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:40.324
dissenting.

374
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.050
And all of the most horrible things that have happened in history had been
legal.

375
00:22:44.051 --> 00:22:48.670
It's our responsibility to dissent and to protest when things are are wrong.

376
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.840
That's what we're supposed to do with citizen.

377
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:55.850
So when you have a forced so powerful that it even negates our capacity to

378
00:22:56.471 --> 00:23:00.850
disrupt if we feel it's necessary,
um,
it's,

379
00:23:00.851 --> 00:23:05.380
it's not a good sign.
And so I hope that people can see that threat.

380
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.910
That's a threat to everyone,

381
00:23:06.911 --> 00:23:09.970
even if they are to the point where they're seeing black folks as part of

382
00:23:09.971 --> 00:23:10.804
everyone yet.

383
00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.013
<v 0>Got It.</v>

384
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:18.280
One theme that came out in the movie is this whole concept of we're humans.

385
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.633
Um,

386
00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:26.170
you featured many children in the movie all interspersed throughout.

387
00:23:26.661 --> 00:23:28.880
There were many scenes of,
of,
of children.

388
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:33.410
And to me there's almost nothing more human than kind of being a child.

389
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:38.780
Was this having many children in the movie?
Purposeful.

390
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.150
And what were you trying to accomplish with that?

391
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.270
<v 2>Um,</v>

392
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:47.150
it was purposeful but it was also something that happened really organically and

393
00:23:47.151 --> 00:23:51.320
kind of later in the process.
So I think when we,
when we filmed the last scene,

394
00:23:51.321 --> 00:23:56.321
it was November of 2015 we continue to film until April of the next year.

395
00:23:58.821 --> 00:24:01.790
But we knew in that moment that that was going to be the ending scene of the

396
00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:02.624
film.

397
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:07.040
And when can I got up there with her mom and with Alexis and did that chant.

398
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.600
I mean you could just feel the energy in there.

399
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.690
There was just something about that that was like,

400
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.060
this is everything that this is about.

401
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:18.650
And so from there we decided that children were going to be a really big focus.

402
00:24:18.651 --> 00:24:21.770
And then as we look back through the footage and what we had already recorded,

403
00:24:21.771 --> 00:24:25.370
we realized that,
oh my God,
kids are everywhere.

404
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.520
They're watching all of this,
they're absorbing all of this.

405
00:24:28.521 --> 00:24:33.521
And they're just silently and quietly learning about what it means to be a black

406
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:36.860
person,
what it means to be American,
what you know.
And,
and,

407
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:42.370
and they also have such clarity even in their kind of immaturity that we felt

408
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:47.150
like that was the way to remind people that this is a universal story and that

409
00:24:47.151 --> 00:24:49.040
this is something that concerns all of us.

410
00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.260
<v 0>I thought it was very effective.
Um,</v>

411
00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.570
so near the end of the documentary,

412
00:24:55.690 --> 00:25:00.210
part of the outcome of this was that there was a DOJ report.
Um,

413
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.210
it showed that

414
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:08.140
African Americans fundamentally have been treated unfairly for very,

415
00:25:08.141 --> 00:25:12.160
very long time in Ferguson.
Now that the report is out,

416
00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.750
do you think anything is going to happen?

417
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.580
<v 2>I mean,
you know,</v>

418
00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:21.440
this current attorney general revoke the consent decrees.

419
00:25:21.441 --> 00:25:24.560
So that was kind of the point of,

420
00:25:24.561 --> 00:25:28.640
of going the art route is that we didn't feel like these facts and figures we're

421
00:25:28.641 --> 00:25:31.610
going to do anything.
The police chief,
we ended,
we did an interview,

422
00:25:31.611 --> 00:25:32.361
the police chief,

423
00:25:32.361 --> 00:25:36.560
it just didn't make it into the film because he was giving us talking points and

424
00:25:36.561 --> 00:25:40.250
wasn't really weighing in on the meat of what we were trying to get at.

425
00:25:40.251 --> 00:25:42.890
But one thing that he did say was that,
you know,

426
00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:46.130
you can make up facts and figures to prove anything and anyone who really knows

427
00:25:46.131 --> 00:25:48.830
what's going on can look at that report and poke holes in it.

428
00:25:48.831 --> 00:25:52.210
So he had written it off before it was even,
you know,

429
00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.600
if I was hot off the presses.

430
00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.710
And that is a true statement about facts and figures,

431
00:25:57.711 --> 00:26:01.790
but it doesn't negate the fact that this racism is real.

432
00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:05.300
It doesn't negate the fact that if you ask anybody walking down the street,

433
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.090
probably in any country in America,

434
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.450
any black person will tell you that racism is real.
That is still happening.

435
00:26:11.451 --> 00:26:13.310
And I'll tell you what the experience is like.

436
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.310
And I find myself frustrated constantly.

437
00:26:16.311 --> 00:26:21.311
Every time I see a new study proving what people have been screaming out

438
00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.640
forever.
It's like how,
when do we get the benefit of the doubt?

439
00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:29.150
When do we get trusted,
when,
how much is enough?

440
00:26:29.151 --> 00:26:31.340
How much evidence do people see,
how,

441
00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:36.420
how many bodies need to drop on camera before we stop looking for proof that

442
00:26:37.251 --> 00:26:39.290
it's real and start doing something about it.

443
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:43.500
I think that a lot of these kind of procedures at this point with all that we

444
00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:47.570
already know are,
you know,
are delay tactics and it,

445
00:26:47.571 --> 00:26:50.940
and it's a form of oppression that comes through bureaucracy.

446
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:55.380
Everything takes so long and it's so slow and it's so complex and it's so

447
00:26:55.381 --> 00:26:59.460
layered that nothing can get done and a lot of the things that need to be done

448
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.500
are really common sense things.
And so we really wanted to,

449
00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:07.770
to encourage people to start thinking with their hearts again and understanding

450
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:12.150
the limitations of these systems and the ways that we can participate outside of

451
00:27:12.151 --> 00:27:16.920
them and,
and kind of shore up what our administrations are not doing for us.

452
00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:24.280
<v 0>Another impactful part of the movie to me was there was a female African</v>

453
00:27:25.071 --> 00:27:29.120
American police officer and fundamentally the,

454
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:34.160
the protesters were telling her that she was on the wrong side and you could see

455
00:27:35.661 --> 00:27:40.661
the emotion in her eyes as if she knew that she was on the wrong side.

456
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.033
Um,

457
00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:49.010
do you have any perspective from African Americans in law enforcement that were

458
00:27:49.011 --> 00:27:52.790
in Ferguson,
even though it may not have been shown on camera?

459
00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.320
What was there?
What was there since?

460
00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:56.971
<v 2>Well,</v>

461
00:27:56.971 --> 00:27:59.940
I think one thing that's really important to remember is we all learn in the

462
00:27:59.941 --> 00:28:00.900
same classroom.

463
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:05.190
So just because somebody can be the same complexion as me doesn't mean that

464
00:28:05.191 --> 00:28:07.260
they're going to have the same opinions as me.

465
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.520
And it doesn't mean that they're not going to have bought into stereotypes about

466
00:28:11.521 --> 00:28:12.870
what it means to be black.

467
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.430
There's something that happens where we can tell ourselves that we're different

468
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.670
and if we are those few people like someone like me,

469
00:28:20.671 --> 00:28:25.140
I could easily have gone through my life,
you know,
gone and gotten my education,

470
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.090
gone on to become a doctor and said,

471
00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:30.030
why doesn't everybody else just pull up their bootstraps and get it together

472
00:28:30.031 --> 00:28:33.780
like I did.
But I wouldn't have been recognizing,
you know,

473
00:28:33.781 --> 00:28:37.380
the fortune and the luck and the hard work that my mom did and all the people

474
00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:41.520
who had to recognize my potential and all the scholarships and all,
you know,

475
00:28:41.521 --> 00:28:43.230
and so it,
it,

476
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.720
there has not been a cut and dry response across the black law enforcement where

477
00:28:47.721 --> 00:28:48.554
I've spoken to.

478
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.960
But the ones who see the issue do talk about the culture in the locker room.

479
00:28:54.241 --> 00:28:57.210
They do talk about the norms that happened behind closed doors.

480
00:28:57.211 --> 00:29:00.600
They chewed talk about people not taking these training seriously,

481
00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:02.940
showing up to it like,
Oh God,
we have to do this.

482
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.470
And there's that cone of silence because your,
your job is on the line.

483
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:12.110
Your reputation is on the line.
You know,
sometimes your safety can be online.

484
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:16.720
As a black police officer,
it really is a catch 22.
And there officers,

485
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.730
even here in New York,

486
00:29:17.731 --> 00:29:22.080
I don't know if anybody has been following this unfolding case about the nearly

487
00:29:22.081 --> 00:29:26.400
a million illegal summons that were issued in New York,
but you know,

488
00:29:26.401 --> 00:29:29.520
there are police officers who had been pushing back on that and a lot of times

489
00:29:29.521 --> 00:29:33.960
they don't get support as whistle blowers.
I think,
you know,
for whatever reason,

490
00:29:33.961 --> 00:29:36.420
I think people of color don't get seen as whistleblowers.

491
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.990
Even when they make these kinds of declarations and they put themselves in

492
00:29:39.991 --> 00:29:42.310
harm's way to talk about this kind of stuff.

493
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:47.220
They don't get the kind of political cushion that,
uh,
you know,
at Edward Snowden,

494
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:50.980
Chelsea manning or somebody deep in these systems who comes out with this

495
00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:54.250
information.
They don't get taken like that.
And it's like we wait,

496
00:29:54.251 --> 00:29:56.590
we wait for another study,
we wait for another report.

497
00:29:56.591 --> 00:30:01.591
We wait for a white validated institution to agree that this is real.

498
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.740
Um,
so yeah,
it was,
you know,

499
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:08.590
would have been terrific I think to get a black cop on camera to talk about this

500
00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:09.490
and to really go there.

501
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:13.930
But I think that if we search ourselves and imagine what it would be like when

502
00:30:13.931 --> 00:30:18.340
your bread and butter is also something that is systemically compromise and

503
00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:19.390
complicit.
You know,

504
00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:22.180
I think we can imagine what she might've been feeling in that moment.
Right.

505
00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.160
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

506
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.590
<v 2>One of the quotes from the movie is</v>

507
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.430
this isn't your daddy's civil rights movement.

508
00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:36.410
Can you kind of compare and contrast maybe the 60 [inaudible] civil rights

509
00:30:36.411 --> 00:30:40.370
movement with the civil rights movement that's going on today,

510
00:30:40.371 --> 00:30:44.630
specifically black lives matter.
And maybe tell us what that quote meant to you.

511
00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:49.540
Well,
you know,
the biggest different is one of 'em.
I was alive for him,

512
00:30:49.541 --> 00:30:53.960
one of them I wasn't.
And so in a very literal sense,
you know,

513
00:30:53.961 --> 00:30:57.770
this is our kind of turn in a dark way,

514
00:30:57.771 --> 00:31:02.090
but I think you know,
the biggest evolution,

515
00:31:02.091 --> 00:31:07.010
I think what that quote and that context is referring to is the fact that during

516
00:31:07.011 --> 00:31:08.090
the civil rights movement,

517
00:31:08.091 --> 00:31:12.680
respectability was a tactic was a tool and I think it was effective in certain

518
00:31:12.681 --> 00:31:16.160
ways.
And the,
you know,
the very famous protest,
I am a man,

519
00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:21.580
it was about proving that black people could participate in society in a way

520
00:31:21.891 --> 00:31:23.870
that was above animal.
Because that was,

521
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.980
that's what we were fighting against at that time was the perception that we

522
00:31:27.981 --> 00:31:31.160
were literally inferior,
physically inferior,
you know,

523
00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.940
all kinds of crazy eugenics theories and things that,
you know,

524
00:31:34.941 --> 00:31:37.130
we're still fighting the strands of those today.

525
00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:41.540
We're still fighting these ideas that there are some inherent inferiority that

526
00:31:41.541 --> 00:31:45.530
black people have.
But at that time,
I can only imagine that would have been very,

527
00:31:45.531 --> 00:31:50.240
very prevalent.
So it would make sense to show up in a suit and say,
I'm a man,

528
00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:54.410
look at my humanity.
You cannot deny my humanity since we've,

529
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.410
we did that.
We came to that conclusion.

530
00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:01.340
Now it's like I don't need to be in a suit.

531
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:06.320
My pants could be sagging.
You know,
I might be selling a cigarette outside.

532
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:09.560
I might be,
you know what I'm saying?
I might have a criminal record,

533
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.630
I might be carrying a gun,

534
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:15.440
but still my life matters still.

535
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:19.700
The police do not have the right to execute without due process.

536
00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:24.790
Still it is not good enough to say I thought a phone was a gun and that I think

537
00:32:26.241 --> 00:32:27.560
is the leap that is really,

538
00:32:27.561 --> 00:32:32.480
really difficult for Americans of all different races who are in sort of a

539
00:32:32.481 --> 00:32:34.340
middle ground.
It's really,

540
00:32:34.341 --> 00:32:39.341
really difficult for us to take that leap to actually prize the of human life

541
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:45.170
over decorum over property,
over,

542
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:45.561
you know,

543
00:32:45.561 --> 00:32:50.561
some sense of fear and to also separate these fears in this kind of boogey man

544
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.870
from what actual black people are.

545
00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:58.871
Because I s w there is no black kid in America who's reaching across a cop's lap

546
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:02.150
into the window to get a good,
nobody's doing that.

547
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.830
And the fact that that's even believable to people shows that this kind of

548
00:33:06.831 --> 00:33:09.160
specter of what blackness is,

549
00:33:09.161 --> 00:33:14.161
is more present in people's mind and any real idea of what a black everyday

550
00:33:14.421 --> 00:33:15.170
person isn't.

551
00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:20.170
So I think this iteration in the movement is saying you don't have to like us.

552
00:33:20.271 --> 00:33:22.640
You don't have to agree with our demeanor.

553
00:33:22.641 --> 00:33:24.380
You don't have to agree with our tone of voice.

554
00:33:24.381 --> 00:33:27.050
You don't have to agree with our music,
our style of dress,
anything.

555
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:30.320
You just have to recognize that we are breathing,

556
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:34.190
that we are standing or hearts are beating,
we have spirits,
we have souls,

557
00:33:34.191 --> 00:33:35.690
we love each other.
We love our family.

558
00:33:35.691 --> 00:33:40.340
That is all the justification and we need to be able to be here and be safe.

559
00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:47.440
<v 0>There's a saying that you need people on the table and you need people at the</v>

560
00:33:47.991 --> 00:33:51.920
table.
Um,
and I,
I think it kind of means,
you know,
you,

561
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:53.990
you need people actually approach day,

562
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:59.410
but then you need people actually at the table working across many different

563
00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:04.040
demographics to impact change.

564
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:08.600
How do you think that happens in a more scalable way?

565
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:13.520
What are the concrete reforms that they need to make?
They need to be made to,
uh,

566
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:17.060
enhance change.
Hmm,

567
00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:20.060
<v 2>that's tough.
I mean,</v>

568
00:34:20.061 --> 00:34:25.061
I really don't like to talk about things that I'm completely unqualified to talk

569
00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:28.310
about,
but you know,
like in Saint Louis,

570
00:34:28.311 --> 00:34:31.250
Saint Louis is divided up into 91 municipalities.

571
00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:34.970
Ferguson is six miles wide and there are 91 mayors,

572
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.450
91 police chiefs,
91 tax bases,

573
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:43.750
91 different little tiny pieces that would have to all be reformed in order for

574
00:34:44.211 --> 00:34:48.440
St Louis to be reformed.
And you know,

575
00:34:48.441 --> 00:34:53.150
multiply that times however many cities and each city has a particular set of

576
00:34:53.151 --> 00:34:56.480
issues.
So I think it's about really getting hyperlocal.

577
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:59.210
I do agree that all solutions are necessary.

578
00:34:59.211 --> 00:35:01.760
I'm very skeptical of politics and politicians,

579
00:35:01.761 --> 00:35:05.510
but I do recognize that there is a need for an organized,

580
00:35:05.511 --> 00:35:09.950
the administration of some sort and there's a need to put pressure to them so

581
00:35:09.951 --> 00:35:14.300
that they make the right choices and decisions.
But I think that,
you know,

582
00:35:14.301 --> 00:35:17.870
there's something to be said for wholesale change and I don't know what that

583
00:35:17.871 --> 00:35:22.070
looks like.
I don't know how long that takes.
But you know,

584
00:35:22.071 --> 00:35:27.071
the fundamental setup of the country is on genocide,

585
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:28.850
you know,
and,
and that language,

586
00:35:28.851 --> 00:35:31.460
it's in the constitution about white male property owners.

587
00:35:31.461 --> 00:35:35.270
Like just because you added something doesn't mean that that's not there.

588
00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:37.650
You know,
and it doesn't mean that anybody has forgotten.

589
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:38.970
And as long as that is there,

590
00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:41.910
they're going to be people who feel like that's what it really meant.

591
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.970
That's the original meaning.
That's the original intent.

592
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:47.460
And so you see these people who feel victimized,

593
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:51.840
like something has been taken from them.
But if you look at our legal,
you know,

594
00:35:51.841 --> 00:35:53.850
our,
our documents and our history,

595
00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:58.530
it has and they feel that way because we have never invalidated what happened.

596
00:35:58.531 --> 00:36:02.670
We've never said that was wrong.
There has never been an official apology.

597
00:36:02.671 --> 00:36:06.750
There have never been any reparations.
There's never been any redistribution.

598
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:11.070
And so to think that from that,
from this vastly skewed,

599
00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:12.630
I don't know what the stats are now,

600
00:36:12.631 --> 00:36:16.350
but it was something like at a take a hundred years for the average black family

601
00:36:16.351 --> 00:36:20.970
to catch up to the average white family,
248 years.

602
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:24.960
Thank you for the average black family to catch up to the average white family.

603
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:29.520
So if you think there's a reform that's going to do 248 years of work in

604
00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:32.190
anybody's lifetime,
I'd be shocked.

605
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.720
And given the fact that people don't even want it and are not actively seeking

606
00:36:36.721 --> 00:36:38.850
that kind of piece.
Um,

607
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:43.860
so I think that we just have to be visionary and we have to be brave and,

608
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.300
and you know,
I'm peaceful.
I don't want bloodshed.

609
00:36:48.301 --> 00:36:52.230
I don't want anybody to be hurt.
The whole point is the value of life.

610
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.410
So it's going to take a lot of imagination.

611
00:36:55.590 --> 00:37:00.480
It was going to take a lot of community,
a lot of strength in numbers.
Um,

612
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.050
and we're going to have to figure out something out.

613
00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:04.200
We're going to have to figure out something that hasn't been tried.

614
00:37:04.201 --> 00:37:08.280
What we can't keep leaning on the same structure that brought us to this point

615
00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:13.410
and expecting us to take it,
expecting it to take us in a different direction.
Um,

616
00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:18.530
and I think we do have to recognize too that we are a silent majority and there

617
00:37:20.701 --> 00:37:24.240
are a minority of that silent majority is actually vocal.

618
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:29.010
But I do firmly believe that most of the people in this country would want for

619
00:37:29.011 --> 00:37:31.230
things to be right or most of the people in the country,

620
00:37:31.231 --> 00:37:34.560
if they understood information better would feel differently.

621
00:37:34.561 --> 00:37:38.100
And so that's something that gives me hope that change is possible.

622
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.110
And I think that unfortunately the dark forces in this country will continue to

623
00:37:43.111 --> 00:37:47.430
push us until we have no choice but to come together and do something.

624
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:50.070
So I really just try to encourage people to,

625
00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:54.060
to be visionary and to imagine and to know there's so much that we haven't
tried.

626
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:57.510
There's so many tactics,
there's so much that we can do for one another.

627
00:37:57.511 --> 00:38:01.770
There's so many resources that we can pull out of ourselves.
And you know,

628
00:38:01.771 --> 00:38:05.580
those things kind of just happen in these times.
But I don't know what it takes.

629
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:08.280
You know,
I really don't,
I can't say that.
I do wish I did.

630
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.250
So in the spirit of sharing,
I feel like you've indulged all of my questions.

631
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:18.770
I want to open up the floor to anyone who might have questions or to Mike's on

632
00:38:19.111 --> 00:38:23.040
the side.
Um,
could we begin lining if anyone has any questions?

633
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:26.750
Cause I've got okay.

634
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:31.100
<v 3>Well my question was about the mainstream media in the beginning.</v>

635
00:38:31.101 --> 00:38:33.830
You talked about you were trying to keep up with the cycle,

636
00:38:33.831 --> 00:38:36.120
but you guys couldn't really keep up with a,
um,

637
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:40.420
just what are your thoughts about alternatives to mainstream media that,

638
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:45.160
that is telling some of these stories and more real time?
Um,

639
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.690
that's about that possibilities.

640
00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:51.970
<v 2>Um,
yeah,
I think alternatives to mainstream media are really,
really important.</v>

641
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.540
I have not watched cable Knuth for really long time.

642
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.470
I don't get my news from there.
The only reason I really go to cable news,

643
00:38:59.471 --> 00:39:03.760
it's to look at however it did kill with Lee.
They're portraying anything.
Um,

644
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:08.620
and so places like democracy now,
NPR,
Pro Publica,

645
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:11.430
I mean I'll just hire a AP.

646
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.930
There are a lot of places out there who tried to do really,

647
00:39:13.931 --> 00:39:18.730
really good and actually balanced coverage because somehow balanced,

648
00:39:18.731 --> 00:39:22.330
I think in the mainstream media has become conflated with bias toward the

649
00:39:22.331 --> 00:39:26.020
establishment.
And like if you're not taking the establishment side,

650
00:39:26.021 --> 00:39:28.870
then you're alarmist and your extremist and you're unbalanced.

651
00:39:28.871 --> 00:39:33.520
And so it's a very weird media scape out there in the cable world.

652
00:39:33.521 --> 00:39:38.260
And I really recommend that people find those other sources and also find who

653
00:39:38.261 --> 00:39:42.100
are the activists and organizers and grassroots folks that you like and trust.

654
00:39:42.101 --> 00:39:44.590
And if you pay attention and do a little quick,

655
00:39:44.591 --> 00:39:46.680
I'm sure I don't have to tell anybody here how to use the internet,

656
00:39:46.681 --> 00:39:48.670
how to move past that,
but you know,

657
00:39:48.671 --> 00:39:50.890
find the sources that you can trust and you know,

658
00:39:50.891 --> 00:39:52.630
they're out there and we kind of,
it's kind of,

659
00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:55.240
I feel like in this strange middle phase,

660
00:39:55.241 --> 00:39:59.930
you kind of have to get your news guerrilla style because I don't trust the,

661
00:39:59.931 --> 00:40:03.670
the corporate outlets too much.
Thank you know this person.

662
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:07.610
<v 4>Hi.
Hi.
Saba.
So proud of you.</v>

663
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:11.550
So going Sarah Ferguson was like one of the most,
um,

664
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.300
memorable experiences of my life and I was just there for a couple of days.

665
00:40:14.301 --> 00:40:17.660
So every time I see you talk about this film and see how you've created

666
00:40:17.661 --> 00:40:20.930
something that will last forever to educate,
so many,
I just get teary eyes.

667
00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:25.850
So thank you for being here.
Thank you.
So question just,

668
00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.780
I mean,
in terms of your goals with the film,
um,
you know,

669
00:40:29.781 --> 00:40:34.070
I know this is so enlightening to so many people seeing this,
but you know,

670
00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.760
how does it feel when we know there's still so much work to be done?
Um,

671
00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:41.830
so I'm on you all's mailing list,
you all email out about,
you know,
um,

672
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:45.950
other injustices all over for Charlottesville most recently and other things,

673
00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:50.870
I guess,
you know,
creating this,
um,
how do you continue to keep going,

674
00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.350
you know,
in the fee knowing that things aren't going to change immediately.
Um,

675
00:40:54.351 --> 00:40:57.870
so I'm really interested in like your self care and how you keep going,
uh,

676
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:59.870
with promoting this given just

677
00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:05.300
<v 2>right now.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Um,
that's a really good question.</v>

678
00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:09.980
And I had a really,
I've had a really hard,
like last two weeks,

679
00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.850
I remember I was on Twitter and this is something that I had said in some

680
00:41:13.851 --> 00:41:16.160
interview.
I said like,
you know,

681
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:19.820
I do this even though it hurts a lot of the time because it's better than being

682
00:41:19.821 --> 00:41:23.270
numb.
And then I see this quote get published with a tweet.

683
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:27.170
And I was just like,
I do.
I even really feel that way.

684
00:41:27.171 --> 00:41:30.230
Like this is really a lot and really painful.

685
00:41:30.231 --> 00:41:35.231
But I have to remember though that there's something egotistical about that.

686
00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:41.330
There's something a little self centered about that way of thinking.
Um,

687
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:46.010
because it was never my responsibility to change the whole entire world.

688
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.890
And Life is not a movie where,
you know,

689
00:41:48.891 --> 00:41:53.150
you make the right choices and then everything is magically okay.
Um,

690
00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:57.800
nobody saves the world.
We either all do or it doesn't get saved.

691
00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:00.380
And so it's really about,
for me,

692
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.560
humbling myself to that and,

693
00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:08.610
and really completely accepting the limitations of my power as an individual and

694
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:14.870
putting my trust and my hope and my faith in my community and the people that I

695
00:42:14.871 --> 00:42:16.580
care about and the people around me.

696
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:21.640
And that's an every day constant remembering process cause everything conditions

697
00:42:21.741 --> 00:42:25.070
us to believe that we can be problem solvers.
We can be the leaders,

698
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:30.050
we can do it if you just,
anything is possible.
But you know,

699
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.400
when it comes down to this,

700
00:42:31.401 --> 00:42:34.730
I think that's when the limitations of reality really,
really hit you.

701
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.830
And so figuring out how to be a part of this and how would it be satisfied and

702
00:42:39.831 --> 00:42:44.831
how to feel fulfilled and how to not be constantly traumatize knowing that

703
00:42:45.411 --> 00:42:49.910
there's only so much that I can do.
Um,
that's everyday struggle.

704
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.640
That's the personal growth.
That's,
you know,

705
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.470
that's just the constant battle of it.

706
00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.920
I don't think that there is any way out of it.
Um,

707
00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.310
but I just recognize the fact that everything is not in my power.

708
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:05.900
I can only control what I control,
how many people I can reach.

709
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:11.150
And it's funny though because in sort of surrendering to that,

710
00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.980
I've been able to reach more people than I've really ever thought was possible

711
00:43:15.981 --> 00:43:19.640
there or knew that I could.
So it's interesting,

712
00:43:19.641 --> 00:43:23.360
I mean I think it's just a little bit of faith.
It's a little bit of faith and,

713
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:26.270
and,
and humility and just kind of trying to be,

714
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:31.790
so does end about it and know that it's okay if I work is just a drop in a

715
00:43:31.791 --> 00:43:33.830
bucket.
Even if I don't see anything.

716
00:43:33.831 --> 00:43:37.970
Or if one little girl comes up to me and as a young film maker and thinks she

717
00:43:37.971 --> 00:43:41.300
can do it,
like that's good,
that's,
that's satisfactory.

718
00:43:41.301 --> 00:43:44.420
Having these people who lived through this to see this and say,

719
00:43:44.421 --> 00:43:47.450
this reflects what I went through,
that's enough.

720
00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:52.250
And the rest of it I think is this sort of,
you know,

721
00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:56.690
it's all wrapped up in society and identity creation and who am I am a leader,

722
00:43:56.691 --> 00:43:58.700
am I making a difference?
All these kinds of questions.

723
00:43:58.701 --> 00:44:01.910
But we don't ever know the outcome of our lives.

724
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:05.570
We don't ever get to see the full ripple effects of what we do at while we here

725
00:44:05.571 --> 00:44:07.970
on earth.
We just have to believe that it matters.

726
00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:16.210
<v 5>Thank you.
I would definitely describe feeling shaken from watching the movie.</v>

727
00:44:16.211 --> 00:44:18.340
It was great.
I'm curious,
and you,

728
00:44:18.341 --> 00:44:21.320
I think you were kind of touching on this and maybe it's more just your,

729
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:25.390
I'm still thinking through,
but what are you going to do next?
Does it,

730
00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.810
you kind of are starting to describe yourself as a filmmaker as it make another

731
00:44:28.811 --> 00:44:32.100
film or go back to med school.
Yeah,

732
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.430
<v 2>no,
I'm letting my house myself off the hook for med school.</v>

733
00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.880
I kind of like,
I took the,
so you get three years for this course.
I'm,
I right,

734
00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:44.430
two years.
Biggest on announce out where you're going to med school.

735
00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:46.420
So I'm not doing that.
Um,

736
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.800
I'm actually writing a fiction series,

737
00:44:49.801 --> 00:44:54.450
which is still very new and fresh.
So when I say too much about it,
but,

738
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.230
um,
I want to go into some fiction because I think you can do some really,

739
00:44:58.231 --> 00:45:01.650
really powerful storytelling when you have that freedom.

740
00:45:01.651 --> 00:45:06.330
But also just to be of a lightened up a little bit.
Like it's a lot,

741
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.210
you know,
these are all real people whom I love very much.

742
00:45:09.211 --> 00:45:13.200
So I don't know that I'm ready just yet to make a whole nother family.

743
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:14.543
Um,

744
00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:19.050
so I want to get into some fiction and I want to tell stories that really

745
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.100
I always want to be in working in the private.

746
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:27.210
I want to bring the political into the private and think about the ways that

747
00:45:27.211 --> 00:45:29.700
these things,
you know,
play out for us.

748
00:45:29.701 --> 00:45:34.230
I want to explore those questions about feminism and that achy feeling as a

749
00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:35.750
woman of being in charge,

750
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:38.610
having to be in charge of getting to be in charge of how have you think of it.

751
00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:42.850
I want to explore these things in the ways that are small and,

752
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:46.770
and universal and recognizable to us because I think that,
you know,

753
00:45:46.771 --> 00:45:50.670
while the stream of politics is moving and while all that change has to be

754
00:45:50.671 --> 00:45:52.350
happening,
it has to be pushed for,

755
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:56.550
there's a spiritual evolution that also has to be taking place inside

756
00:45:56.551 --> 00:45:59.940
individuals and households in the hearts and minds.
Um,

757
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.600
and I think all of that work is part of one stream.

758
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.320
So that's where I started seeing myself.

759
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:07.103
<v 1>Okay.</v>

760
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:09.670
<v 6>Hi,
thank you so much for coming.
Um,</v>

761
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:13.170
I apologize if this question's already been asked.
I got here a little bit late,

762
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:18.990
but I think one thing that I'm hearing you say especially about means media is

763
00:46:18.991 --> 00:46:19.824
that like,

764
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:24.830
we just don't and can't trust it because the entire industry has been corrupted.

765
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:27.630
The issue that I have,
um,

766
00:46:27.631 --> 00:46:31.680
is sort of that they're all right and sort of just like the right wing side

767
00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:34.200
feels the exact same way about mainstream media,

768
00:46:34.201 --> 00:46:37.950
but instead of seeking out sources that speak truth,

769
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:42.980
they go to like the Donald reddit pages and Breitbart and like sources like that

770
00:46:43.141 --> 00:46:48.141
that are honestly just complete fiction and it has completely skew their reality

771
00:46:48.421 --> 00:46:49.620
of the world.

772
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:54.950
How do you sort of like take truth and penetrate those audiences that also don't

773
00:46:55.051 --> 00:46:59.160
trust mainstream media,
but like they responded to that like,

774
00:46:59.161 --> 00:47:00.930
did mistrust in a completely different way?

775
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:06.360
<v 2>Um,
that's a really good question.</v>

776
00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:13.420
I remember I was looking up the fake news epidemic and there was a thing on NPR

777
00:47:13.431 --> 00:47:18.170
with a guy who had started fake news sites and he talked about how he targeted

778
00:47:18.171 --> 00:47:22.910
them toward the right because people on the left didn't really buy them.
Um,

779
00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:24.200
and so,

780
00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:25.830
<v 1>okay,</v>

781
00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:30.820
<v 2>I think I understand why you grab onto the mistrust of media as a common</v>

782
00:47:30.821 --> 00:47:33.160
denominator and perhaps the jumping off point.

783
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:36.300
But I think that the,
the,

784
00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:39.100
the most important factor here is confirmation bias.

785
00:47:39.101 --> 00:47:43.330
And it's something that we all probably participate in every day.

786
00:47:43.331 --> 00:47:46.920
It's something that we need to really watch out for.
Um,

787
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:50.950
getting into that echo chamber and responding to information that validates your

788
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:54.790
beliefs and believe in that information must be more true because you already

789
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:56.620
believed that.
Um,

790
00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:00.220
but I think the difference between the right and left is that,

791
00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:04.450
at least on the surface,
our values are about,
you know,

792
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:05.890
positivity and sharing.

793
00:48:05.891 --> 00:48:10.000
They're not about this being for one particular set of people.

794
00:48:10.001 --> 00:48:15.001
So when you have confirmation bias plus an preexisting bias about people,

795
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:20.410
you know,
that's a recipe to spiral down into a rabbit hole of misinformation.

796
00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:24.940
So,
um,
I don't know how you tap into that.

797
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000
I think that news and information should probably be regulated in some way,

798
00:48:31.061 --> 00:48:35.500
but it feels like a really scary time to think about asking for any sort of

799
00:48:35.501 --> 00:48:38.740
regulation.
Um,
and you know,

800
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:43.150
I certainly can't walk into some meeting or bar and be like,
hey,

801
00:48:43.151 --> 00:48:47.120
you should check out democracy now.
I don't know.
So,
um,

802
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:51.270
I kind of am like,
I'm very much,
um,

803
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:56.580
about starting small and I think that I want to see what we can do.

804
00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:57.341
You know,

805
00:48:57.341 --> 00:49:00.880
I want to see what happens if everybody in my spear actually gets on the same

806
00:49:00.881 --> 00:49:04.090
page and does something tangible,
um,

807
00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:07.570
and moves past the point of sort of talking about what we should do and actually

808
00:49:07.571 --> 00:49:10.330
starts to do something.
Maybe it's leading by example,

809
00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:13.690
maybe it's showing what it looks like to be in community,

810
00:49:13.691 --> 00:49:16.780
when be it's showing what this new world looks like and how inclusive it can be

811
00:49:16.781 --> 00:49:20.680
and how positive it can be and allowing people to take that on for themselves.

812
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:22.210
You know,
I'm not sure,
but

813
00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:28.650
<v 0>in the spirit of maximizing the time,
I've got one last question.
Okay.
Um,</v>

814
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:32.940
here at Google we talk a lot about what it means to be an ally.

815
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.380
You talked about your camera man,

816
00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:40.850
and in his ability to do things and have conversations that you were unable to

817
00:49:41.251 --> 00:49:44.460
have in moving spaces that you are unable to.

818
00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:48.840
Can you talk about what it means to be an ally?
Or if someone said,

819
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:52.200
how can I be a better ally?
What would be your answer to that question?

820
00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:57.320
<v 2>Um,
I don't believe in allies.
I think that,
you know,</v>

821
00:49:57.321 --> 00:50:00.420
a couple of years ago when Obama first got elected,

822
00:50:00.421 --> 00:50:02.280
we were talking about being post racial.

823
00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:06.000
A lot of people say saint people who wouldn't be allies with saying,

824
00:50:06.001 --> 00:50:10.710
I don't see color.
I just see people as human beings.
I just love everybody.
Well,

825
00:50:10.711 --> 00:50:14.130
if you love everybody,
the not your brother getting shot down in the street,

826
00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:18.240
that's your family,
that's your cousin.
You know,
that could be,

827
00:50:18.241 --> 00:50:22.140
that's a reflection of you.
When I see somebody,
when I think about Sandra Bland,

828
00:50:22.141 --> 00:50:23.400
I think about myself.

829
00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:27.060
I feel like I died a little bit when I see Mike Brown and Tamir,

830
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:32.410
I'm scared for my cousins and so if we really are one human family,

831
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:35.900
then you should be scared like that too.
And if you're scared of like that too,

832
00:50:35.901 --> 00:50:40.670
then there's no need for allyship then we're in this and that's how it was with

833
00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.110
all of the white folks on my team,

834
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.590
particularly the ones who continue from beginning to end.

835
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:47.900
There was no question of allyship.
You know,

836
00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:50.780
there may have been moments where we had to talk about this something.

837
00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:52.670
You don't understand that something that you do,

838
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:54.650
but I looked up and we were shoulder to shoulder.

839
00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:58.070
There was not time to talk about it.
There was nobody.
They were asking me,

840
00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:00.830
what can I do?
How can I help?
They were putting their skills.

841
00:51:00.831 --> 00:51:03.440
The rubber was hitting the road before I could blink.

842
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:07.760
And that's the kind of participation that white people need to be taken because

843
00:51:07.761 --> 00:51:10.700
if we have to figure out,
okay,
what do these shoots going to do?

844
00:51:10.701 --> 00:51:13.370
Where are you going to do what?
When do we have time for self care?

845
00:51:13.371 --> 00:51:14.600
What do we have time to heal?

846
00:51:14.601 --> 00:51:18.810
When do we have time to actually look at the internal issues that we have with

847
00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:19.220
Danelle?

848
00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:22.940
When do we have time for anything if we have to also problem solve for other

849
00:51:22.941 --> 00:51:27.170
people and I think that,
you know,
I've grown up,
grown up,

850
00:51:27.171 --> 00:51:31.400
lived around my people my whole life or most of my life.
Brilliant,

851
00:51:31.401 --> 00:51:34.310
brilliant people,
very much,
you know,

852
00:51:34.311 --> 00:51:37.940
with all the access to education and culture and all these things,

853
00:51:37.941 --> 00:51:41.240
deep critical thinkers like I know so many brilliant white folks and then when

854
00:51:41.241 --> 00:51:45.890
it comes to this all problem solving goes out the window and I know it's out of

855
00:51:45.891 --> 00:51:49.580
discomfort.
I know it's out of uncertainty and not wanting to do the wrong thing,

856
00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:52.130
but that's what happens when the rubber hits the road.
You fuck up,

857
00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.790
you make mistakes.
You say the wrong thing,
it gets awkward,
it gets weird.

858
00:51:55.791 --> 00:51:59.780
That's anything probably that we've ever done and do well.
By this time.

859
00:51:59.781 --> 00:52:03.110
There was probably a point where we were bad at it.
We were awkward at it.

860
00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:06.830
You know,
everybody has a car accident at some point.
Everybody has a weird date.

861
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:08.630
This is no different.

862
00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:13.810
And so I just challenge people to step up and not just relinquish their capacity

863
00:52:14.181 --> 00:52:18.020
and their agency and their involvement because it's uncomfortable and so

864
00:52:18.021 --> 00:52:21.440
stressful and so weird.
There's all these feelings and guilt around it,

865
00:52:21.441 --> 00:52:23.090
but it's,

866
00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:27.260
we don't have time to be gradually pulling people along like jump in.

867
00:52:27.261 --> 00:52:30.110
We're all human beings.
This is happening to us.
You know?

868
00:52:30.111 --> 00:52:34.430
I think when we take that framework and be really honest,
not to say that,

869
00:52:34.431 --> 00:52:36.620
you know,
if you're white,
you noticed to be black,

870
00:52:36.621 --> 00:52:41.330
not to make assumptions would be really honest and look to see how this is

871
00:52:41.331 --> 00:52:45.560
affecting you and how you know you're actually centered in it.

872
00:52:45.561 --> 00:52:47.570
Like take your own stance kind of thing.

873
00:52:47.571 --> 00:52:52.340
Because I also don't like feeling like somebody fighting on my behalf.

874
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.940
I feel like I'm fighting for everybody.
I feel like I'm fighting on your behalf.

875
00:52:55.941 --> 00:53:00.310
So how,
you know what I mean?
So yeah,
that's,
that's my stance on it.
I think.

876
00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:02.840
I like for people to just get their hands dirty about it.

877
00:53:02.841 --> 00:53:07.841
I respect somebody who will make a mistake trying over somebody on the sidelines

878
00:53:08.601 --> 00:53:12.740
asking me what to do.
Thank you for joining us today.
