00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.710
Welcome to toxic.
I'm Jennifer van Fossen.

2
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.930
<v 0>Today we are so lucky to have a group of actors and actresses with us from Tali.</v>

3
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.280
Please join me on stage.
We have Charlene,

4
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.570
<v 2>Farron,
Mackenzie Davis,</v>

5
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.830
Ron Livingston and director Jason Reitman.

6
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.130
<v 0>We are so glad to have you all here with us today.
Thank you for joining us.</v>

7
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.990
We really are.
Well,

8
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.920
I saw the film last week with my husband and Gosh,

9
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:44.820
there were so many things that I could relate to being a parent,
being a mom.

10
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.910
And the one thing that struck me in particular is there's this one scene,

11
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.690
Charlene,

12
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.290
is where your character Barlow is pulling into the parking lot and trying to act

13
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:59.310
like everything is great and okay.
And she's struggling with our kids and,

14
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.560
and she,
she walks in I think is to the principal and says,
ah,

15
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.440
it's just such a blessing.
Yeah.
And this really is for all of you,

16
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:09.740
but I'd love to start off just by tell.

17
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.410
Tell us about the importance of that authenticity and the characters that you

18
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:14.244
have in this film.

19
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.100
<v 3>Um,
I mean,
I guess I don't want to speak for all of us,
but I will,</v>

20
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.940
I must,
I think,
I mean,

21
00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:30.941
we definitely all discuss just how raw and honest this was,

22
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:34.940
this portrayal of parenthood.

23
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.720
That is definitely not something that I've ever read in a script.

24
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.600
And in my,
you know,
over 20 years of doing this,

25
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:46.601
I've might have partaken in that false portray motherhood on a film.

26
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.440
I think there was something about this that was just so,

27
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:53.690
and maybe it's also different now that I have kids.

28
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.380
I can't imagine making this film.
And before I had kids,

29
00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:59.600
because there was so much of this that I,

30
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.820
I could just feel inside my own bones.
Um,

31
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.670
and through all the,

32
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.660
the horror of the truth of what it takes to be a parent,

33
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.190
there's this utter beauty,
um,
that comes with it.

34
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:17.150
And I think,

35
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.620
I think that's would definitely draw me to it.
I mean,

36
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.000
Jason wasn't really negative part of deciding to do this film,

37
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.230
but the story really.
Yeah.
You know,
here's one you oh yeah,
it was,
yeah,

38
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:33.380
it was like the story's good enough that I can deal with Jason again.

39
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.100
Yeah.
So,
so brave.

40
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.380
I nobody knows how brave I am.
Hmm.

41
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.660
<v 0>To,
to that point of dealing with Jason Again,</v>

42
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.290
this is your sort of your third film and what some have said is even sort of a

43
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.490
trilogy,
Jason With Juno and young adult,

44
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:58.360
what you did with Charlie's and it's like Lord of the rings.
Just like that.
Yeah.

45
00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.950
Yeah.
What's,

46
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.940
what's important to you about these three films in the sequence of them
together?

47
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.230
<v 4>I mean,
uh,
you know,
when I met Diablo over a decade ago now,</v>

48
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:12.850
I don't think I could have ever guessed that we were starting this trajectory

49
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.661
with each other,

50
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:18.100
that we're somehow we were going to be in a kind of storytelling marriage.
And,

51
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.791
uh,

52
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:23.170
and now of course I just hope it continues for the rest of our lives and that we

53
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:25.380
keep on making movies like this.
Um,

54
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.530
I remember your anniversary cause that's a big part of it.
Oh fuck.

55
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.830
I blew it already.
I remember the first time we met,

56
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.360
we met at this place called the father's daughter,
uh,
in over on Fairfax,

57
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:40.720
near the grove enabled bar in there.
And shorter to dirty Martini.

58
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:45.721
I ordered a diet coke and it was just very on par for our relationship going

59
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:48.490
forward.
Um,
but you know,

60
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:53.491
Juno was a movie about growing up too fast and young adult was a movie about,

61
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.290
uh,
growing up a little too slow.

62
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.970
And this is a movie about that moment when you realize that you have to grow up

63
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.830
and you have to turn a chapter on your life and create room so that your child

64
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:08.660
can occupy the space that you were occupying.
Yeah.

65
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.010
<v 0>And tell us a little bit more about,
you know,</v>

66
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.970
what attracts you to this and to Diablo is writing.

67
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.960
<v 4>Uh,
you know,
um,
it's funny,
you know,</v>

68
00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:22.050
surely Diablo and I are all around the same age and although we,
you know,

69
00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:24.240
we came from different places,
uh,

70
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.070
there's some sort of connective tissue that when Diablo right to script the,

71
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.600
she's articulating things that we've all been feeling.
Um,
and,
and,

72
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.700
and this is something that Diablo does really well.

73
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.100
She writes about an idea that we can all relate to,

74
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.250
which is not knowing where you're supposed to be in the arc of your life.
Uh,

75
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.550
I think we all often have this feeling like,
am I behind?
Am I ahead?

76
00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:51.330
Am I doing this at the right time?
What was I supposed to do by now at this age?

77
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.520
Uh,
whether it's work with family,
uh,
you know,
uh,
you have you bought a house yet,

78
00:04:56.521 --> 00:05:00.120
have you done this or that?
And so much for writing is about that.

79
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.580
And for whatever reason,
I think it connects all of us.

80
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.420
<v 0>Yeah.
So to that point,</v>

81
00:05:05.421 --> 00:05:10.250
I'd love to speak to the dynamic between the two characters of Marlow and of

82
00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:14.960
Tele Mckenzie,
which she play and the dynamics that you explore.

83
00:05:14.961 --> 00:05:17.720
And there's relationships between women,
right?
There's,

84
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.990
there's episodes of judgment or younger self versus older self kind of feeling.

85
00:05:23.571 --> 00:05:26.300
So tell me about the dynamic between these two women.

86
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:28.690
<v 3>Um,</v>

87
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.460
I mean it was an interesting role to play because of,

88
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.440
um,
the,
uh,

89
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.340
space that a documented in somebody else's life.

90
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:44.341
And trying to find out how you can be your own sort of shoulder to cry on and

91
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:50.800
support system without becoming like a really malevolent force in that person's

92
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:53.980
life.
Um,
I dunno,
I thought it was,

93
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.920
I mean when I think we'll just reiterate the same things over and over it,

94
00:05:56.921 --> 00:06:01.921
but just a really honest approach to how lovely and Shitty it can be to be

95
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.230
female.
And I haven't had kids,
but I have been a woman my whole life.
And um,

96
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.940
there were so many things that it felt like Diablo was telling secrets from my

97
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:17.750
own life and you were like,
how do you know about it?
Um,

98
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.460
and yeah,

99
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:23.990
I just thought it was like a lovely female friendship that was really honest and

100
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:28.680
not,
um,
you know,
sugary sweet.
But,
um,

101
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.180
do you want to say anything?
I mean,

102
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.880
having been the younger one in the relationship?

103
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.500
No,
you said it so beautifully.
I totally agree with you.
I mean,
I think Diablo,

104
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.760
he doesn't know how to not write honestly.

105
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.590
And I think she loves that space where we all live.

106
00:06:52.591 --> 00:06:55.620
Whether you're a woman or a man that's maybe not so pretty.

107
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.380
And I know for myself,
I'm very much,

108
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.650
I'm fascinated by that space.

109
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.670
And so to have a writer and a filmmaker who really wants to go and explore that

110
00:07:07.951 --> 00:07:12.810
space,
it's really,
it's having to get a job like that were,
you know,

111
00:07:12.811 --> 00:07:13.800
all of us get,

112
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:18.890
we get to live in the skin of real people who are going through maybe not so

113
00:07:19.141 --> 00:07:24.141
nice things and maybe are not behaving and the best possible ways that they

114
00:07:24.151 --> 00:07:26.400
could in those moments in the bed.
But it's,

115
00:07:26.401 --> 00:07:31.030
but it's human and it's exploring that human condition.

116
00:07:31.031 --> 00:07:32.280
And I love that

117
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.020
<v 0>one.</v>

118
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:39.020
Another moment I remember from the film is there's an episode in a coffee shop

119
00:07:39.361 --> 00:07:42.880
where you are clearly very,
very pregnant.
Yeah.

120
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.230
And you're ordering a DECAF and yeah.

121
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.820
How dare I facing all this judgment from this woman who's giving you sort of

122
00:07:50.821 --> 00:07:52.350
dirty looks and yeah.

123
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.070
Can you talk about that judgmental part that you sort of explore there,

124
00:07:56.071 --> 00:07:59.280
that women do face pretty constantly in society?
Yeah.

125
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.130
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean,
I,</v>

126
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:06.630
I think that we definitely live in a world where we're just so hard,

127
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:11.310
especially on parents because all of a sudden they're carrying this other little

128
00:08:11.311 --> 00:08:15.120
human and I feel like the world almost feels like they can step in and have a

129
00:08:15.121 --> 00:08:16.680
judgment because it's not really you.

130
00:08:16.681 --> 00:08:20.820
It's that little person that they don't even know that's living inside of you.

131
00:08:20.821 --> 00:08:25.440
And I definitely have been with,
I didn't have pregnancies myself,
but just,

132
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.120
you know,
with my adopted kids,

133
00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:29.760
like I remember a mom pulling me aside and she was like,

134
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:35.570
you should not be using formula and I can like hook you up with some real breast

135
00:08:36.901 --> 00:08:40.900
milk.
And it was just like,
ah,

136
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.930
and my kids are fine as of right now.
They're still good.

137
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.830
They're doing okay from the formula.

138
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:52.830
<v 0>Um,</v>

139
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:57.000
so I'd love to go a little bit deeper on that because the last movie that I saw

140
00:08:57.001 --> 00:09:01.520
you in was atomic blonde,
right?
Very different type of a female little later.

141
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.850
Yeah.
It was a real super like kick ass by maybe.

142
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.980
And,
and you have a production company,

143
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.600
Denver and Delilah that was written up in variety not long ago for really

144
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:15.270
backing those powerful female centric stories.

145
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:20.510
So can you talk a little bit about how you pick your roles and how your company

146
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.230
decides on its projects?

147
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.600
<v 3>Yeah,
we,
um,
we have a,</v>

148
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.820
a cool little thing going on with Denver and Delilah.
We,

149
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.270
we're definitely fortunate enough to be in a place where,

150
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:35.603
um,

151
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.830
we do have a little bit more of a luxury where we can greenlight things that

152
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.040
might not get greenlit.
Um,
you know,

153
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:48.830
a film like atomic blonde,
uh,
very easily could've,
you know,

154
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.670
been a male driven film.
Um,

155
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.060
and to be able to have a little bit of that,

156
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.830
to be in that position where you can actually take a film like that and,

157
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.590
and get a studio like universal to back it,

158
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.850
that's a really nice place to be in an I,
I don't ever take that for granted.

159
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.010
You know,
we're also trying to,
we do a lot of television and,
and,

160
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.650
and film.
And so we're really trying to,

161
00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:18.651
not just with female stories but really paying attention to um,

162
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.580
you know,
bringing women into the positions.

163
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.010
They're just very strong and right now.

164
00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:30.120
And so we have a lot of projects that are maybe not directed by females,

165
00:10:30.121 --> 00:10:34.230
but they're all female producers and uh,
and,

166
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:38.740
and so I think being in that position where you can kind of put your foot down

167
00:10:38.741 --> 00:10:39.720
and you know,

168
00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:43.590
I was just on a film that we produced and I walked on and our sound department

169
00:10:43.591 --> 00:10:47.130
didn't have one woman on it and we had a bunch of female actresses on it.

170
00:10:47.131 --> 00:10:48.930
And I was like,
guys,
what?
No,

171
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.670
like we need a lady here to be dealing with the bra strap.
Like,

172
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.290
um,
it's just a nice place to be in an,
and for me as an actor,

173
00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:00.960
it's not necessarily always so that I can star in it.

174
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:05.961
It's nice that I can kind of take ownership and and guide a little bit of the

175
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:11.031
stuff that I do want to explore that you do get tired of kind of waiting around

176
00:11:11.131 --> 00:11:15.510
for a filmmaker or a writer to come around and hand you something like that so

177
00:11:15.511 --> 00:11:18.750
you can kind of step in and develop things that you're interested in.

178
00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:21.780
And I love that and I liked that it can,

179
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.960
that I can be as diverse as I want to be.

180
00:11:24.961 --> 00:11:29.961
And that I think is one of the hardest things or was for me in my career.

181
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.330
You,
you know,
you have gardeners,

182
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.480
some success and some genre and then that's all everybody wants you to do.

183
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:41.670
And having a production company gets me to do different things and kind of not

184
00:11:41.671 --> 00:11:44.820
regurgitate the same thing over and over and over.
Yeah,

185
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.083
<v 0>that's a,</v>

186
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:51.330
that seeking of diversity and creativity and thought and female centric is

187
00:11:51.851 --> 00:11:56.710
something we really value at and I do on my team as well,
so thank you.
Oh,
cool.

188
00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.650
Ron?
Yes.
You're from Iowa.

189
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.960
And this is personally important to me because my husband's in the audience and

190
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:08.460
he's from Iowa as well.
So shout out to the Hawkeyes

191
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.290
you are,
you have two daughters.
So tell us from a,

192
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.210
from a male perspective,
so what's important to you about this title and Jason,

193
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:21.370
I know you have a daughter as well,
I believe.
Yeah.

194
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.510
So I'd love to hear from you all about what's important to you about the female

195
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:27.850
empowerment from your perspective too.

196
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:32.650
And drew is Marla's as Marla's husband and the title.
Yeah.
Um,

197
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:33.740
yeah,

198
00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:38.510
<v 5>you know,
obviously,
uh,
cause I'm raising two girls to enter into the world.</v>

199
00:12:38.511 --> 00:12:42.000
I like the world to be a,
a welcoming and uh,

200
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:47.360
you a nice place for them to be and I want them to be valued and I want them to

201
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.620
be empowered and want them to feel strong.
Um,

202
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:57.010
they're pretty strong right now,
so I feel really good about it.
Yeah.
Um,

203
00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:01.820
yeah.
And,
and then the,
the rest of this stuff,
I guess we'll,
I guess we'll get to,

204
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:06.860
um,
I,
what I like about this,
the,
the way that this setup is,

205
00:13:06.861 --> 00:13:10.850
is any talked about the authenticity is I feel like there's a,

206
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.930
uh,
there's a sort of a husband,

207
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.530
a mold of like what husbands do,
uh,
and the,

208
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.010
and the child rearing area.
Uh,

209
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:26.960
and in real life the bar is a lot lower than what you see in the movies and the

210
00:13:26.961 --> 00:13:27.380
movies.

211
00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:32.060
It's like we kind of give them a lot of the benefit of the doubt and credit and

212
00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:35.330
uh,
you know,
so in this,
this character,
it's really,

213
00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:40.390
he's contributing closer to what a husband's generally actually contribute and

214
00:13:40.881 --> 00:13:44.890
think they're doing a great job.
Yeah.
Um,

215
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.010
so,
you know,
I don't know how that relates to the,
uh,

216
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.510
female empowerment,
uh,
element overall.

217
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.220
But,
uh,
you know,
it's a,

218
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.550
it's a wife part.
I'm playing on wife part is what they would call it.

219
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.240
And it's Kinda great that it's flipped around.
Um,

220
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.230
cause I know my wife has played a lot of wife parts and uh,

221
00:14:09.231 --> 00:14:12.750
and made some wonderful things out of them.
So,
uh,

222
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.360
that was a really good challenge of like,
okay,
I gotta take this guy who's a,
uh,

223
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.320
in a,
in a supportive functioning Grohl and figure out like,

224
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:22.820
well how can we make it real?

225
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.800
<v 0>Great.
Anything you would add there,
Jason?</v>

226
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.540
<v 4>I mean,
the funny thing is that a,</v>

227
00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:31.920
that I'd really like to make a movie for my daughter,
but I,

228
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.100
I've made eight movies so far and she hasn't seen any of them because they're

229
00:14:36.101 --> 00:14:40.030
all rated r or about teen pregnancy.

230
00:14:40.031 --> 00:14:44.830
So I have a lot of conversations waiting for me.

231
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.470
<v 0>Okay,
got it.
Um,</v>

232
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.320
well another thing that I'd like to touch on with y'all as you've,

233
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.480
and you've mentioned a little bit of this Sharlay's,

234
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:56.890
you've both done sort of small screen and big screen work and,

235
00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.330
and my role here at Google,
I worked quite a bit with the film studios,
uh,

236
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:02.770
and also the broadcaster.

237
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:07.790
So I think it's interesting what's going on between small and big screen these

238
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:07.971
days.

239
00:15:07.971 --> 00:15:12.260
And also I think it's really important that these kinds of stories make it to

240
00:15:12.261 --> 00:15:16.730
the big screen still.
And it's not just a world of sequels and blockbusters.

241
00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:21.470
So I thought maybe y'all could talk a little bit.
Yes,
that's true.

242
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.760
That's true.
That's true.
But with unique characters yet.
Um,

243
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.070
so I'd love to just talk about how do we,

244
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.580
how do we encourage and make sure that these types of stories are told on the

245
00:15:31.581 --> 00:15:32.630
big screen as well.

246
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.960
<v 5>I mean,
the best way to do is to make them,</v>

247
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.950
that's I think the first,
the first step.
Um,
you know,

248
00:15:43.951 --> 00:15:46.830
and it's,
thank God you're doing that.
Uh,

249
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.310
I don't really feel that there's that much of a difference.
Uh,

250
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.400
the cameras the same size,
uh,
in any case,

251
00:15:53.401 --> 00:15:56.340
but whether it's a big screen or a small screen,
that stuff all comes later.

252
00:15:56.341 --> 00:16:01.320
I feel like when,
uh,
you know,
your problem maybe thinking about that,
but when,

253
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:05.220
when I show up to work,
it's,
you know,

254
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.250
I'm not thinking about the screen.
Um,

255
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.140
and I think people have a great relationship.

256
00:16:10.141 --> 00:16:13.530
I feel like the difference and people have some pretty big screens in their

257
00:16:13.531 --> 00:16:16.920
houses now too,
you know,
and there's gonna be a lot of people who watch this,

258
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:22.110
watch this on downloaded on their phone,
the pirate it or something.
Yeah,
exactly.

259
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.920
Um,
so yeah,
no,
I,
um,

260
00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:30.420
to me I think it's a more of a thing of when the big screens still has that

261
00:16:30.421 --> 00:16:33.870
place for like,
this is an event.
We're going to give this our evening,

262
00:16:33.871 --> 00:16:35.790
we're going to get out of our house,
we're going to,
you know,

263
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:40.140
we're going to go sit down,
buy expensive popcorn and,
and we're locked into this.

264
00:16:40.141 --> 00:16:43.230
We can't flip the channel.
If we don't like it,
we can walk out,
you know?

265
00:16:43.231 --> 00:16:46.620
But that's a very dramatic thing.
Um,
so it's,
yeah,

266
00:16:46.621 --> 00:16:50.040
it's nice that we're giving adult fare,
I think.

267
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.110
I guess if you're an adult,

268
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.290
<v 0>so it's not so much about the screen,</v>

269
00:16:55.291 --> 00:16:58.620
then it's about the projects getting made and the story's being told,

270
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.030
regardless of,

271
00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.890
<v 4>I hope we hold onto the collective experience.
That's the important thing.</v>

272
00:17:03.891 --> 00:17:08.180
I think there's a lot of conversations about screens and sound and,
uh,

273
00:17:08.181 --> 00:17:10.220
and that's all well and good.
It's nice,
although I find,

274
00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:15.140
I go to the movies all the time and I think,
man,
why don't they turn this up?
A,

275
00:17:15.141 --> 00:17:17.570
I wish they would play movies louder and theaters and,
uh,

276
00:17:17.571 --> 00:17:22.190
and change the bulbs and the projectors more often.
But I'm also a nerd.
Um,
but,

277
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.180
uh,
but what I think is important is the collective experience

278
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.170
<v 5>is you go to the movies</v>

279
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.940
<v 4>with a bunch of strangers and you're all laughing together.</v>

280
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.980
Are Y'all crying together?
You're all being moved together,

281
00:17:34.981 --> 00:17:39.000
you're all realizing something together.
And that is very rare experience.

282
00:17:39.001 --> 00:17:41.160
I think that's an important experience.
Uh,
I mean,

283
00:17:41.161 --> 00:17:43.140
he certainly has been throughout my childhood.
I love movies,

284
00:17:43.141 --> 00:17:47.910
a trek to the movies.
It's many times a week as possible.
But,
uh,

285
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:52.500
and I,
and by the way,
I love and I watch a lot and I binge a lot as well.

286
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.050
I think it's a great,
it's a great form of entertainment.

287
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.930
What I'd hate to lose though is the collective experience.

288
00:17:57.931 --> 00:18:00.480
That doesn't only happen for,
uh,

289
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:05.540
movies like Black Panther but also happens for tiny movies that can really

290
00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:08.570
change minds and move us.
Cause it,

291
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.700
there's something different about watching a movie at home alone and having that

292
00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:13.170
experience just moving,

293
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:17.430
but it's alone and having it as a community with people you don't know,

294
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.610
you all showed up at this theater from maybe all parts of the city.

295
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.700
You all come from different lives and now you're all laughing together.

296
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.770
And I think the thing that I fear losing the most is that,

297
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.000
<v 3>that's a great point.
So if the audience wants to kind of get ready,</v>

298
00:18:33.001 --> 00:18:34.530
I think we're going to do a little bit of a Q and.

299
00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:39.180
A if you guys want to get ready for that.
And uh,
I'm curious,
Jason,

300
00:18:39.181 --> 00:18:43.050
like is there a movie that was like that for you?
Like,
can you think back?

301
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.550
<v 4>Uh,
uh,
I mean,
uh,
in movie theater experience,
I mean there's a hundred,
but,</v>

302
00:18:48.551 --> 00:18:50.050
uh,
uh,

303
00:18:50.051 --> 00:18:53.920
I remember lining up to see pulp fiction and a,

304
00:18:53.921 --> 00:18:58.330
I was in high school and that was,
that was one of the great nights of my life.

305
00:18:58.331 --> 00:19:02.800
I mean,
I think about that night,
the way that people think about,
you know,
uh,

306
00:19:02.801 --> 00:19:03.390
you know,

307
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.930
lining up for some shows at CBGBs in the 70s or something like it just that,

308
00:19:06.931 --> 00:19:08.200
that's a,
that was a life changer.

309
00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.010
<v 3>Yeah.
How about the rest of you?
Can you think of a title that was really mean?</v>

310
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.730
I just,
I just,
I was sharing this with Jason.
Um,

311
00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:21.430
and I think my friend is here who's a producer on this to best Kono and I went

312
00:19:21.431 --> 00:19:26.431
to go see a shape of water and we're both kind of dead inside as people.

313
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:33.610
We have a lot of emotion and I started crying.

314
00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.840
So uncontrollably I felt,
I was literally like,
Oh my God,

315
00:19:37.841 --> 00:19:38.950
this is so embarrassing.

316
00:19:38.951 --> 00:19:41.440
And then I just looked over and she was crying and I was like,

317
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:48.060
yeah,
I'm not a Weirdo,
but it's like Jason said,

318
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:52.540
like I could have never experienced that at home.
And um,

319
00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.700
and it's nice to have that conversation after too,
right?
Like the,
the,

320
00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:02.560
the credits start rolling and like you start talking about it collectively and

321
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.020
her,
something nice about that.
And I do think like,

322
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.940
sometimes people have experiences,

323
00:20:06.941 --> 00:20:11.090
they watch films at home and they don't have the same experience.

324
00:20:11.091 --> 00:20:13.960
And you do when you're in that theater with other people is something that

325
00:20:13.961 --> 00:20:16.290
happens.
Maybe it's expensive popcorn,
I don't know.

326
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:21.400
But something definitely happens for me.
It did.
Yeah.
I'm not dead.
Turns out,

327
00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.470
okay.

328
00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:33.510
<v 4>I saw us store star wars is a fifth grader and it kind of rocked my world.
Um,</v>

329
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.450
not only just the,
you know,
the SPEC,

330
00:20:35.451 --> 00:20:39.690
the goal and the way it just kind of exploded.
Uh,

331
00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.220
you know,
there,
there wasn't anything like that before.

332
00:20:43.221 --> 00:20:46.760
And then all of a sudden there was,
but I feel like that just the,

333
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.070
all the mythical

334
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.480
<v 0>stuff,
um,
it's like a primer in eastern philosophy,
you know,</v>

335
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:57.481
in like Tau Ism Zen and uh,

336
00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.890
that has lasting effects.
You know,
I think it,
it's,
it's cheesy to say,
well,

337
00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:06.490
I don't think it changed my life,
but yeah,
it had to have wars,

338
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.870
star wars changing my life,
you know,
I get it.

339
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.190
<v 3>My local,
this is not like that at all.</v>

340
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.270
My whole movie theater is this really old dingy place.

341
00:21:17.271 --> 00:21:20.570
And I think it's where they shoot those like night vision examples where they do

342
00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:23.720
screeners of scary movies and people are like popcorn.

343
00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.410
And I saw it there,

344
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:32.470
this the one that just came out and I had to wait in line that wrapped around

345
00:21:32.661 --> 00:21:37.661
the block and it was like a 30 minute wait and then it was just like 11 to 17

346
00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.600
olds and we all watched it together and it was so,

347
00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.170
it felt like religious where everybody likes screamed at the same time and then

348
00:21:45.171 --> 00:21:49.330
you'd turn to the stranger and be like [inaudible].

349
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:54.680
It was so fun to be in that space again and it just reminds you like you don't

350
00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.070
cause all you get at home.
It's sort of like hmm,

351
00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:02.270
but not the full like Cathartic scream and communal energy.

352
00:22:02.271 --> 00:22:05.330
This very movie when the person next to you was scared,

353
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.320
the energy transfer and,

354
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:13.700
and you'd do the like scream to laugh ratio is on your car and it's so fun and

355
00:22:13.701 --> 00:22:14.534
weird.

356
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.520
<v 0>Shall we open it up now?
Thank you all so much for coming.</v>

357
00:22:22.521 --> 00:22:25.100
I was able to watch the film earlier today.

358
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:29.630
And what I'd like to think that the magic of Diablo script was part of this.

359
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:33.220
I'm really curious for Mckinsey and Charlise.
Um,

360
00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.710
it hasn't,
I don't want to spoiler alert,

361
00:22:36.711 --> 00:22:39.110
but it has such an unusual twist at the end.

362
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:45.250
I was not expecting it and I just thought you two were so separate,

363
00:22:45.261 --> 00:22:48.200
but then so connected.
How did you develop that?

364
00:22:48.201 --> 00:22:52.610
Because that magic just wasn't in the script.
He slept with each other

365
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.480
<v 3>and it was awkward at first,</v>

366
00:22:56.481 --> 00:23:00.620
but then it just like broke down this barrier right away.
It helped,
yeah.

367
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:05.780
Anything to know someone's body like that is especially that body.

368
00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:11.150
There's a lot to explore there.
Um,

369
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:16.760
I,
I,
I've been very lucky.
Uh,
Jason,

370
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:22.190
<v 0>uh,
is
really,
really good at casting</v>

371
00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.310
<v 3>obviously.
Uh,
no,
but seriously,</v>

372
00:23:27.311 --> 00:23:32.020
he's just so good at counseling.
I remember when we did young adult together,

373
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.660
he only brought up one name and it was Patton Oswald.

374
00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:38.290
And I didn't know who Patton Oswald was.
So it was a little bit like,
Ooh,

375
00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:41.830
who's this?
And then he showed me some stuff and it was like,
really?

376
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:46.190
And then we got on set and it was like,
ah,
God,
that's,

377
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.210
you just see something.
And so this time around,
it was the same thing.

378
00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:53.150
The only name that was ever brought up was mackenzie.

379
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:58.750
And uh,
and there were,
I mean for me when I read the script there were,

380
00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:03.790
because it was so intricate that does this relationship between us,

381
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:09.110
I definitely read it in that sense,
you know?
And so I was like,
cool,

382
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.450
it's going to be interesting.
Like what do you do with this?

383
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:16.451
And Mckenzie showed up and it was just so beautifully weird and odd and,

384
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:22.280
and pretty much from the moment that I met her,
I was just like this.

385
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:27.050
And so it was perfect for the film and then she ends up like,

386
00:24:27.051 --> 00:24:28.040
she's a cool girl.

387
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:31.880
So it was nice to be on set with her and to share this experience with her.

388
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:33.733
<v 2>Okay.</v>

389
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.340
<v 3>You're welcome.
Um,
yeah,</v>

390
00:24:37.341 --> 00:24:41.710
I feel like we did an like plan anything out too much.

391
00:24:41.711 --> 00:24:44.330
And we just talked a bit about,
um,

392
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:49.010
I remember that breakfast that we had in that weird hotel and the Sutton hotel

393
00:24:49.011 --> 00:24:53.330
where we just talked about like getting older in a really low yeah,

394
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.310
normal but way like,
I don't know,

395
00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:01.280
we have the same body type and like what it's like to be used to the way your

396
00:25:01.281 --> 00:25:04.070
body behaves for your whole life and then what happens when it starts behaving

397
00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:08.930
in a different way and just simple things that can kind of bond you to someone

398
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.190
quite easily and make you,
I dunno,
there's like certain the sound,

399
00:25:13.191 --> 00:25:16.250
so like something that Cosmopolitan magazine would say,

400
00:25:16.251 --> 00:25:20.120
but there are something like certain like secrets of being female that can make

401
00:25:20.121 --> 00:25:24.890
you feel very close to someone immediately.
Um,
without needing to,
to like,

402
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:28.040
you know,
map out a whole plan right away.

403
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:32.450
I think she's also one of the funniest people I've ever been around.
See.
And,

404
00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.750
and so that's just so disarming.

405
00:25:34.751 --> 00:25:38.230
And I think instantly we really connected on that.
I was just like,

406
00:25:38.231 --> 00:25:39.580
every time I was around I was like,

407
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:44.560
cause I was not the funnest person on the shoot.
Um,

408
00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:49.060
I kind of dealt with depression for the first time in my life and my body was

409
00:25:49.061 --> 00:25:52.630
just not happy and my mind wasn't happy in my soul isn't happy.

410
00:25:52.631 --> 00:25:57.460
And being around her was just real joy and I think we,

411
00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.890
I definitely got close whether she liked it or not,

412
00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:04.170
I got closer to her through that.
I was very happy when she,
Ron,

413
00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:05.670
I was happy when you were there too.
Yeah.

414
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.720
I was happy when you were there too in a different way.
Yeah.

415
00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.710
Um,
I love Roddy different though.

416
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.150
You don't know what it's like.
Ron is you,
by the way,

417
00:26:19.151 --> 00:26:23.620
the nicest person you'll ever meet on the face of the earth.
Hands down.

418
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:28.400
Way Nicer than you know.
I'll just point out you,

419
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.600
you guys as best as foils.
Yes.

420
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.593
<v 2>Go ahead,</v>

421
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.800
<v 3>you guys for being here.
I'm just curious,</v>

422
00:26:38.801 --> 00:26:43.270
was it hard to get this movie made given that it's a movie about motherhood,

423
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.860
being a new parent and multiple kids?

424
00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.070
Is this a hard one to pitch or do you feel like there's an appetite for that

425
00:26:50.071 --> 00:26:50.904
right now?

426
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:55.740
How much we're exploring motherhood and you're seeing it more in shows and
films.

427
00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:01.230
<v 4>I don't think,
uh,
they're traditionally not easy to get financing.</v>

428
00:27:01.231 --> 00:27:05.910
I don't think there,
uh,
I have not heard of any studio out there are saying,

429
00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:10.080
you know what,
let's look for more real human drama,

430
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.860
a particularly female human drama that's um,
although you're right,

431
00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:18.240
there's a lot more of that happening in television now.
Uh,
I think,
uh,

432
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.290
frankly,
you know,
a company called Bron studios up in Vancouver,
uh,

433
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:26.910
finance this film and they came in early and they came in strong.

434
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:31.950
They liked the script.
Uh,
they loved this cast,
uh,
clearly and,

435
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.790
and they back to film and they were kind of amazing start to finish.
Uh,

436
00:27:35.791 --> 00:27:37.820
there was never any kind of a,

437
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.610
I'd never felt them trying to bend it into something that it wasn't a knee.

438
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:45.390
You know,
the people that were already big fans of Juno and young adult,

439
00:27:45.391 --> 00:27:48.960
they got the tone of it going to what we wanted to do.
And,
and we got it made,

440
00:27:48.961 --> 00:27:51.090
but I,
but I feel lucky about that.

441
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.400
I think we're very fortunate that we got to get this film made.

442
00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.680
I think there's a lot of homes like that or trying to get made that are not

443
00:27:55.681 --> 00:28:00.681
getting the financing if only we were at a company with a limitless amount of

444
00:28:01.261 --> 00:28:05.830
funds that can invest into movies and tomorrow.
Yeah.

445
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.240
I would think they really cared about women.

446
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.320
They would start investing money into female driven independent film.

447
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.760
Huh.
Like that.

448
00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:21.580
<v 5>This,</v>

449
00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:26.580
my question goes to Jason because I'm an aspiring filmmaker and I,

450
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.490
I haven't got a chance to see the movie yet because it's release on May 4th.

451
00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:34.950
May the force be with you,
by the way anyway.

452
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.800
So it's within the star wars universe.

453
00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.660
<v 3>Yeah,
pretty much.
Um,
it's a tall can crossover.
Yes.</v>

454
00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:43.503
<v 5>Um,</v>

455
00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:48.120
I'm just really curious to know what you're directing processes like from or

456
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.160
from gained the script in your hands to development,

457
00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:55.570
pre production,
post production to distribution.

458
00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.710
How much was changed,
what was left,
what was left,

459
00:28:59.711 --> 00:29:03.850
and what was left out.
And,
um,
how were,

460
00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.830
and through those changes,
how would you,

461
00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:10.460
how did you define the characters from,
um,

462
00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:14.350
from point a to point B and what was,

463
00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:19.420
what was it like to pick out the color Palette for some photography and choosing

464
00:29:19.421 --> 00:29:22.270
the appropriate lens is to tell the story?
I'm sorry.

465
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:26.260
<v 4>Is there a lot?
I,
and they're all great questions.
It's a lot of them.</v>

466
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:30.190
And I think if I were to answer all of that habit,
it would be,

467
00:29:30.191 --> 00:29:32.800
it would take a while and I'm going to,
so,

468
00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.930
<v 3>so,
uh,
and I'll,
I'll just say it</v>

469
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.700
<v 4>a couple of brief things.
Um,
uh,
the one,</v>

470
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:46.470
what's unique about Diablo is that she is a pure writer and does not use index

471
00:29:50.471 --> 00:29:54.970
cards or treatments.
She has an idea.
She called me,

472
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.550
uh,
at one point said I have this idea for a movie.

473
00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:01.960
And she kind of told to me in two sentences and then six weeks later she had a

474
00:30:01.961 --> 00:30:05.140
screenplay and it was a first draft,

475
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.250
but it was also our shooting draft.
And she just writes,

476
00:30:09.251 --> 00:30:12.520
she sits down and starts with the first scene,
then the second scene,

477
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.940
and she lets the movie tell her what it's going to be.

478
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:20.110
And that's how she's written all our films.
And as another writer,

479
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.820
it's infuriating.
Uh,
I mean it took me seven years to write up in the air.

480
00:30:24.821 --> 00:30:26.950
I don't know.
I don't know how she does it,

481
00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.860
but her screenplays are very clear on the page.

482
00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:34.180
And it's not to say that they're loaded with long paragraphs of detail.

483
00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:37.210
They're very succinct.
They're very short,
the hundred page scripts,

484
00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.720
but you can't help but read it and know what she's saying and what she's

485
00:30:42.731 --> 00:30:47.350
referring to.
I feel like it's my job not to tell the actors how to do it.

486
00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:50.860
It's to find people who I think have connective tissue with the characters on

487
00:30:50.861 --> 00:30:53.050
the page.
Not that they're the same human being,

488
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.000
but there's something inside them that connects them to this character,
uh,

489
00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.980
that I know is going to come to life.
Uh,

490
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:04.850
and then they bring it to life and I'm there to kind of help shape,
um,

491
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:09.220
and keep us with all in,
all within kind of one tonal world.
Uh,

492
00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:13.470
but it's up to them and we don't rehearse,
you know,
we,
uh,

493
00:31:13.471 --> 00:31:16.480
and it's something that you kind of brought that up.
We had one lunch,
uh,

494
00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.140
before we went,
uh,
exam,
blocky.

495
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:23.770
I get to work with brilliant actors and I know on the day we're going to find it

496
00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:26.420
and we're going to find it over a few takes or maybe a few more takes.

497
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:30.350
It's not going to be anything crazy.
And when that magic happens,
when,

498
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.710
when two actors,

499
00:31:32.711 --> 00:31:36.910
when two really talented actors suddenly connect and have chemistry and the

500
00:31:36.911 --> 00:31:40.300
lines come to life,
um,
there's nothing like it in the world.
I mean,

501
00:31:40.301 --> 00:31:43.630
it's really an exciting thing to watch happen live and when it happens on what

502
00:31:43.631 --> 00:31:46.420
the cameras to be on,
I don't want to be in rehearsal studio.

503
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:49.780
So that's a little bit of how the process was and it's certainly is how this

504
00:31:49.781 --> 00:31:54.580
movie came together.
I think they have one more question and then we'll,

505
00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.940
<v 3>um,
so Charlise and Ron,
I think if you both,
this is really funny,</v>

506
00:31:58.941 --> 00:32:03.160
people who play characters with a lot of pain but really funny characters with a

507
00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:05.060
lot of pain and um,

508
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.590
but you also do some sort of wackier characters and I,

509
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:12.140
and I'm sort of curious as artists and performers,

510
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:17.120
do you feel like that balance is important or do you lean one way or the other

511
00:32:17.121 --> 00:32:20.630
that it's important to you to play characters who have some sort of non comedic

512
00:32:20.631 --> 00:32:21.470
painful depth?

513
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:26.530
<v 4>Oh,
that's a great question.
You want to take that or,
uh,</v>

514
00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:33.390
<v 3>simultaneously,
you know what?
I want to assume my male privilege to go first.</v>

515
00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:40.280
I,

516
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:45.200
<v 5>you know,
it's like the,
I think the pain is everybody has a pain and so if,</v>

517
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:48.770
you know,
it's,
if it's useful to,
to bring it to the thing,

518
00:32:48.771 --> 00:32:53.030
then that's great.
As far as the Wacky,
uh,

519
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:57.650
I just,
I think I'm just kind of Goofy,
you know,
there's like a,

520
00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.980
there's an element of me this term that's kind of goofy and there was a while

521
00:33:00.981 --> 00:33:01.820
there was a,
you know,

522
00:33:01.821 --> 00:33:05.090
five years when I was trying to be a matinee idol and you know,

523
00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:09.150
where the leather jacket and you're like,
I have on that.
And uh,

524
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:13.770
it was just really hard not to like make a face and,
uh,
because it,

525
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:18.330
there's something about it that if it strikes me as a little silly and,

526
00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:22.430
and then that's the part that I like about it is like,
oh,
okay,
what's the,

527
00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:26.720
what's the silly part?
Um,
but I,
I think it's all the same,

528
00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:27.930
you know what I mean?
It's like he,

529
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:32.950
there's it people who are only in pain or only trying to be funny,

530
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.890
uh,
tend to be really infuriating people hang out with,

531
00:33:36.891 --> 00:33:40.040
so you just throw it all together and see what,
what comes out of it.

532
00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.320
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean,
I agree with,
um,
with Ron,
I,</v>

533
00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:49.740
I don't believe that people are only one thing.

534
00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.800
Um,
I think that,

535
00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:58.160
I think that's also what makes this writing feels so great because it deals with

536
00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:04.560
some very serious and,
um,
hard subject matter.

537
00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.610
But through real people and I think real people,

538
00:34:08.611 --> 00:34:12.810
I think we can all relate to that.
You know,
I've had shitloads of tragedy,

539
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.560
but nobody is just that one thing.

540
00:34:16.561 --> 00:34:21.120
And I think a lot of people who have had a lot of tragedy in their life tend to

541
00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:26.150
veer more towards the silly and the light light hearted ness of it in order to

542
00:34:26.581 --> 00:34:30.690
survive.
I mean,
this is why I'm dead inside.

543
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:34.560
Uh,
didn't work for me.
But,
um,

544
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.780
I think there's a sense of humor about this that feels very real.

545
00:34:39.781 --> 00:34:42.870
That's not just a joke for the sake of a joke or to be funny.

546
00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.980
I think a lot of the humor of this film comes from very real places.

547
00:34:46.981 --> 00:34:50.940
And I know for myself,
raising my kids,
it's,
it's,

548
00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:55.970
it is a horror movie and a comedy with Will Ferrell and,

549
00:34:56.690 --> 00:35:01.440
uh,
Star Wars,
it's everything.
It's literally every day.
I'm like,

550
00:35:01.441 --> 00:35:05.460
I don't know what movie we're in today,
but can't wait to go on the ride.

551
00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:09.990
See where we're at.
We're at lands.
I Dunno.
Does that,
is that?
That's great.

552
00:35:09.991 --> 00:35:14.360
That's a bullshit.
I know.
I don't.
Yeah,
I'm sorry.
Oh,
I don't know.

553
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:19.470
Thank you for this.
Do what he says.
Basically.
That's really what happens.

554
00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.890
Me personally or just to know what Jason was.
Yeah.

555
00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:28.170
We've been waiting for you to,
cause I'm waiting for you to tell me.

556
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:32.550
I get to respond.
Reminder,
may for everyone.

557
00:35:32.551 --> 00:35:37.500
Please take your friends.
Go See Tali in theaters.
Thank you so much.

558
00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:42.690
<v 2>Right.</v>
