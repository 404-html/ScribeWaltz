1
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.380
Just as my opening sidewall,
I want each one of you,
uh,

2
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.590
to talk about what does progress mean to you in the context of International

3
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.590
Women's Day.
Who wants to start us off?
The only man in

4
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.680
you knew that was coming.

5
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.100
<v 1>That's okay.
Um,</v>

6
00:00:25.101 --> 00:00:27.920
so burglars in this Palette of colors for progress in the spirit of

7
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:30.560
international men's Day as you pointed out,

8
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.780
the gender parity excess with a whole lot.

9
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.990
And I'll talk a little bit from a Google perspective as well because I'm the

10
00:00:35.991 --> 00:00:38.660
only Gugler on the panel,
uh,
from,

11
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.580
<v 2>okay.</v>

12
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.830
<v 1>We've been doing a lot of work in Taiwan.
The scan,</v>

13
00:00:41.831 --> 00:00:44.170
what does getting parity means?
Something from Google's,

14
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.330
our employees guiding point.
And where do we see,

15
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.160
and it's not just about gender globally,
we've looked at,
um,

16
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.590
minority that doesn't patient and how it started word in India specifically with

17
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.453
agenda Palette.

18
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.200
We've done a lot of sessions as a part of the diversity and inclusion teams in

19
00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:01.790
Hyderabad.
Go understand one,
uh,

20
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.110
what does inclusive behaviors mean and what does equal opportunity look like?

21
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.040
And also setting the tone from our senior leadership to ensure that everybody
is,

22
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.530
uh,
is actually behind some of these.

23
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:16.480
It's not just saying things as recently as a few weeks or two weeks back,

24
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.380
we did a session a for,
we call it happy days,

25
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.100
which was more about helping educate children,

26
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.850
underprivileged children about menstrual health and how they were not

27
00:01:27.851 --> 00:01:31.060
necessarily aware of what are the things that they need to do.

28
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.870
And it actually helped them open their eyes and we could see it marked shift

29
00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:37.900
from the four day session in terms of how they could,

30
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.590
how they felt comfortable in talking about it,
discussing it.

31
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.180
And also data that we had showed around 30 odd percent of kids drop out of

32
00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:50.740
schools because of,
uh,
of some issues that they might have.
So,

33
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.520
uh,

34
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.750
what that they actually kind of hinted was there's a lot of work that we can do

35
00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:59.380
primarily to help engender Palette.
It is a smaller steps that keep happening,

36
00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:01.030
not just inside Google but outside,

37
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.620
but overall a lot more to it unlocked to be done as as a part of,

38
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.090
as a manager on my team as well.

39
00:02:07.091 --> 00:02:11.020
What are the things that we look at is are we being inclusive in terms of

40
00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:11.501
everybody?

41
00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:14.980
That's that that's when openings come out or when people need to be higher.

42
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.540
How are we making sure that we are looking at a diverse and inclusive way of

43
00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:21.220
hiring,
retaining talent.

44
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.990
So those are few things that we've been doing as we think about logos for the

45
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.170
power.
Uber's,
we're bad at it.

46
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.423
<v 2>That's,</v>

47
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.890
<v 3>I might be a little radical,
but I'm not a feminist.</v>

48
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.080
I want to see progress to me is seizing the opportunities which come your way.

49
00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:40.960
I mean you can always say,
you know,
my office didn't give me a promotion.

50
00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:41.890
You know,
I'm not this.

51
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.900
But you have to seize the opportunities and we've gone through a tough life.

52
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.530
But you know,
where we are is because of our push.

53
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.400
So I think it's women have to seize the opportunity.
So there's no point.

54
00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:57.470
You're not saying that I'm not been given,
nobody's going to give you anything.

55
00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.600
You don't have to season.
Yeah,

56
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.583
<v 4>yeah,</v>

57
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.400
<v 5>yeah.
So,
uh,
I come from a family,</v>

58
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:10.480
see my grandmother was wearing like a,

59
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.300
like an eight inch [inaudible] to me,

60
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.190
like a sitting in a boardroom where I'm the only female in the boardroom.

61
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:21.100
I think that's progress for me.
And uh,

62
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:26.101
another thing which I can give a personal example is when I started working and

63
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.750
I come from a manufacturing background and they wouldn't be like female toilets

64
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:35.290
and I manufacturing units to today,

65
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.120
60% of our employment are women because they're loyal to the company.

66
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.250
They are agreed.
We do solar modules,

67
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:46.780
which is very close to like stitching and knitting.
So we've taught the people,

68
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.050
the women who are good in stitching and knitting to come and work as factory

69
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:56.890
workers wear those uniforms and those kinds of women at the grassroot level,

70
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.380
they feel empowered even wearing a uniform and coming to work everyday.

71
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.170
So I think that's progress for me.
Thanks Eli.

72
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.740
<v 4>I think it's a matter of age or an age factor when I wouldn't be as radical as I</v>

73
00:04:09.741 --> 00:04:10.640
am not a feminist.

74
00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:15.641
But the point is I have never seen myself as a woman with a disadvantage for

75
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:21.230
them.
So you don't like the House I grew up in my parents,
they,

76
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.850
I have a younger brother and they really did not differentiate between us.

77
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.970
And I've heard that from many people that I was brought up exactly like my

78
00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:33.600
brother.
But when I say this,
I realize how different it is for me is,
uh,

79
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.910
you know,

80
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.440
not only was I allowed to stay as late out as my brother was or not only did I

81
00:04:39.441 --> 00:04:41.630
learn karate because he learned karate,

82
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.320
but he learned Catholic because I learned Kathak he was made to learn piano

83
00:04:45.321 --> 00:04:48.500
because I was learning piano.
It's like the children went to piano class,

84
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.120
the children went to horse riding class.

85
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.990
So I really didn't think that the certain things my mom doesn't cook to date.

86
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.480
I mean she just does not know how to cook.

87
00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.010
And I never thought that was a disadvantage.
Right.
So coming from that thing,

88
00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:03.440
I didn't realize that they were two different fields.

89
00:05:03.441 --> 00:05:06.830
One could straddle or they were two different,
uh,
you know,

90
00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:09.500
skill sets that people had based on gender.

91
00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:13.160
I really didn't think of it until I stepped into the world,

92
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.820
but because I came with that much of confidence,

93
00:05:16.821 --> 00:05:18.860
I wouldn't say arrogance into this world.

94
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:23.360
I didn't ever take it as a personal agenda or assault.
Everyone does it.

95
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.930
Even men,
you know,
code key school enables the new guys.
You know,
it's,

96
00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:31.880
this is not a good word in life.
Shit happens.
But I didn't look at it that way.

97
00:05:31.881 --> 00:05:35.990
So I don't think I'm the pressing for progress,
only pressing for more money.

98
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.890
Give me money.
I want to make a little bit,
give me money,
give me money.

99
00:05:39.891 --> 00:05:41.900
I want to heal child.
I'm only asking for money.

100
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.190
So I guess I've been just pressing for furthering my agenda and life.

101
00:05:46.191 --> 00:05:47.850
But that's about it.
So I,

102
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.850
I don't know what they make good headlines with these lines,

103
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.400
but this is what really my life doesn't matter if you make headlines Lie,

104
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.890
you are leading the line for us.
That sounds good.

105
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.060
<v 0>Thanks.
I did want to follow up,
uh,</v>

106
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.940
some very interesting themes have already emerged.
Um,

107
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.420
I think the five that we need to seize opportunities,

108
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.640
a chateau glass ceilings,
um,
and also make sure that it's,
uh,

109
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.040
you know,
it's not just women,
it's,
it,

110
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:19.100
this is leadership lessons for everybody's right.

111
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.130
But I want to revisit that team.
Right.
So,
um,
like you mentioned that I,
uh,

112
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.690
at home,
no one looked at you differently than your brother.
Um,

113
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.840
and I'm pretty much like that as well.

114
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.870
But do you think that that is privileged and there are women who need the

115
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:39.350
support too to be able to speak up and you know,
shatter glass ceiling,

116
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.340
put support other women,
their management,

117
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.410
<v 1>but it's not going to give you an envelope with the carpet.</v>

118
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.230
It's about support needed.
Definitely.
And it's not mine.

119
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.080
Maybe coming from whoever their is,
but sometimes what we have seen,

120
00:06:53.081 --> 00:06:58.081
like some of the data that we have looked at is [inaudible] 10 to [inaudible] by

121
00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:03.190
the,
uh,
the pattern might be more the more privileged than others,

122
00:07:03.191 --> 00:07:06.730
but women tend to be a little bit more restrictive in terms of trying to

123
00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:11.650
approach for newer things or trying to be more,
um,
more candid about saying,

124
00:07:11.651 --> 00:07:14.770
okay,
you want this,
they expect things to come to them.

125
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.310
And in those kinds of situations,
no way before this meeting,

126
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.920
it's not like it's everybody here,

127
00:07:20.921 --> 00:07:23.440
but there are some people who have that and then how do you make sure that you

128
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:27.040
are helping those?
So I don't mean to say that everybody needs,

129
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.340
but at least whenever there's an opening job of board data that I've seen phase

130
00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:35.680
that,
okay,
if you have 60,

131
00:07:35.681 --> 00:07:38.230
50% off the skills that are required by particular,

132
00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:42.630
the whole lot of women would not apply for that particular job.
Why?
Why?

133
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:43.780
Why would it?
Yeah.
Yeah.

134
00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:46.300
Because they don't feel that they have a blue thing that's required to do the

135
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.030
job,

136
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.400
<v 3>but does not as even with men,
the little hesitant.</v>

137
00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:53.060
I view the issue is much higher torque in the journalism school.

138
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.600
And the boys were the quietest.
The girls were like,
you know,
man,
listen man,

139
00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.760
that what should we do?
How do we become journalists?

140
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.950
And in fact they were very quiet.
I'm so,
I think that men also need the push.
No,

141
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:08.230
it's okay.
We don't want
different,

142
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.510
like you said,
you just can't say this is a woman thing,
a man thing.

143
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.880
<v 0>I totally agree with you.
Uh,</v>

144
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.560
it would be great to hear from you about how you navigated your careers because

145
00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:23.680
I think that is enough for men and women to learn.

146
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.000
But to when he does point where she said that on the manufacturing floor worn

147
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.200
toilets for women.

148
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.880
So we need to make sure that the system is set up to,
uh,

149
00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:38.530
support folks have both genders,
right.
She can,

150
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:39.260
I

151
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.670
<v 5>said that I,</v>

152
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:44.810
I do agree with him a lot of the main thing that they need to be perfect before

153
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:48.830
applying,
applying to a job.
But I feel like women need to be brief.

154
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.550
They don't need to be perfect.
They need to be more brief.
They need to be,

155
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.980
they need to have more courage because I think men,
it's like

156
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.400
<v 4>the Davar Jay like men thing.
They're better than they are.
And women,</v>

157
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.820
even though they're so gorgeous and beautiful and talented,
this,

158
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.610
they still have this,
I'm not good enough ceiling.

159
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.880
So I do resonate with his thought.

160
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.620
<v 0>But tell me how you all have navigated,
uh,
your careers because,
uh,</v>

161
00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.800
[inaudible] several different things when he does so many different things that

162
00:09:17.801 --> 00:09:21.640
you're managing.
She'd gone,
this was teaching assignments.
So tell me,

163
00:09:21.641 --> 00:09:25.300
how do you make these choices?
How do you navigate your careers?

164
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:31.610
<v 4>You haven't spoken in a long time.
So,
um,</v>

165
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.100
I'm a unique person.
Jd.

166
00:09:34.101 --> 00:09:36.050
I mean other than the fact that it's a good thing to be unique.

167
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.430
The only thing I ever wanted to do ever growing up was to become a lawyer

168
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.870
because in my formative years I did a really terrible book called rage of angels

169
00:09:44.871 --> 00:09:47.780
by Sidney Sheldon and I was,
I think all of 12 at that point.

170
00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:49.580
I know why they were letting me read such books at home,

171
00:09:49.581 --> 00:09:52.850
but I read that and Jennifer Parker,
the protagonist of the book,

172
00:09:52.851 --> 00:09:55.280
made this indelible impression in my mind.

173
00:09:55.281 --> 00:09:57.920
There was no way I wanted to be anything else.
In fact,

174
00:09:57.921 --> 00:10:02.090
last week I was feeling the [inaudible] library and I found a book with someone

175
00:10:02.091 --> 00:10:05.000
had gifted me saying that to our Jennifer Packer says,

176
00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:07.940
all I ever wanted to do was to do law and it was a sin.

177
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.200
I was the most focused kid in school,

178
00:10:09.201 --> 00:10:12.940
I think to know where I was going to the sats,
the window,
two fails.

179
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.850
No GMS is none of that because I knew where I was heading and I did law and it

180
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.750
was damn bad.
Boring.
It was terrible.
I mean,

181
00:10:20.751 --> 00:10:22.160
it was great to study all of that,

182
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.630
but I remember we should have things called moot court where you could be a

183
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.740
lawyer and help people who are underprivileged.

184
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.590
And I got my bottom pinch on day one in the court.

185
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.760
That shattered my entire,
you know,
it my existence.

186
00:10:34.761 --> 00:10:38.570
Then I was wearing a black coat and I'm being fed it up in Bombay High Court,

187
00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:39.380
which was,

188
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.790
and I'm thinking really this is really what I dreamed all my life to be.
So,

189
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:48.200
and also I realized quickly enough that to be a lawyer in India or anywhere else

190
00:10:48.201 --> 00:10:51.360
in the world I'm sure is that you had to jump onto a moving bag and you know,

191
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.200
if your father was a lawyer,
you came.
It's the same all over.
It's,
you know,

192
00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:56.840
this whole thing of nepotism exists as a society.

193
00:10:56.841 --> 00:11:00.050
It's nothing to do with the just the film world.
And I recognize it.

194
00:11:00.051 --> 00:11:01.430
Earlier when I had got into fashion,

195
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.250
I was working to support myself in one way because my father had the,

196
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.710
we come from a reasonably as a Sakata Whitaker,

197
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.320
he always told us cal supported a degree was [inaudible].

198
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:14.180
We never took him seriously and laid,
really finished my degree and then he said,

199
00:11:14.181 --> 00:11:18.410
yeah,
do what you want.
And I started working in a designer store and I realized,

200
00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:22.250
you know what,
I like fashion.
So I came back to Heather about and set up a lot,

201
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.900
which is they were not choices.
Like I said,
I can lower that story.
Yeah,

202
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.030
there was,
there were no choices at that point.
Fashion interested me.

203
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:34.630
I came back to me in those days and talking 93 is when I set up our unsettled

204
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.890
fashion was Shefali in second Dah and to do an agent Bandera hills.

205
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.900
That is exactly how fashionable we were at that point.
So I thought,
you know,

206
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.540
if I get this store and I get all these designers and I'm sure people would like

207
00:11:47.541 --> 00:11:48.620
to buy.
And they did.

208
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.370
And then I got bored with that because there was no competition.

209
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.490
There was nobody opening another store and the Nigga,

210
00:11:55.491 --> 00:11:57.510
she came into my life because he was making headway,

211
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.520
the blues and he contacted a bunch of people who could be good help him and

212
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:07.710
there was this,
this,
she has a group I belong to called dcs,

213
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.190
which was dramatic cycle had real bad,

214
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:13.900
but they really should have been called drunken circle in an entire year.

215
00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:17.950
We put up one plate but we met every week and drank ourselves silly to figure

216
00:12:17.951 --> 00:12:20.170
out which played we were going to do.
So you know,

217
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:24.910
it was a very invigorating and extremely good group that we had.

218
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.940
And when you contacted them they said a church,

219
00:12:26.941 --> 00:12:30.280
I know the phone [inaudible] and or that's how I got to meet

220
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.940
the keyless free McKown camp.
I had Rodman
and otherwise lose happened.

221
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.070
So I'm just really most lucky,
privileged because of the background.

222
00:12:42.071 --> 00:12:45.250
I come from that my colleague fell into my lap,
you know,

223
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.400
every time and genuinely films is my calling and it just,

224
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:52.390
I did nothing to get it but just show up.
The only thing,
like you said,

225
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.940
I know it sounds very this lofty to say I was brave and all,

226
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.820
but it took opportunities.
But you're also much younger,
right?
You,

227
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.100
you feel it can do so much more when you're younger.

228
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.680
How can say [inaudible] met me,

229
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.160
I was supposed to do a production with him and then he met me and he said,

230
00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:09.110
you know what,
when you audition for a role,
and like I said,
Heather valuable,

231
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.610
could you be a confidence he community?
And again,
sure,
why not?
I auditioned,

232
00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:15.400
I got the role.
So I split the second lead and hydro at Blues,

233
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.790
which I had never been on a film set before,
forget,
you know,

234
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.300
auditioning and stuff like that.
And then while we were rehearsing,

235
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.100
I would tell the actor,
Sakura epitomize Hackerati window.

236
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.360
So near saw that and he said,
well,
would you like to be my assistant director?

237
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.290
And like I keep saying he was desperate and I was clueless what assistant it

238
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.620
gaming stood for and like,
yeah,
sure,
no problem.
So that's how we get the,

239
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.300
and God forbid I ever do anything else in my life.
It just fell into my lap.

240
00:13:40.301 --> 00:13:43.810
So I had no what choices I made other than just saying yes to when people ask me

241
00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:46.660
stuff.
So people offering you take that chance?

242
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:51.020
I have gone all over the world with that answer,
but I didn't speak for too long,

243
00:13:51.021 --> 00:13:51.900
so I'm going to come back to me.

244
00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.010
Uh,
like I said,
I come from a very conservative background.

245
00:14:00.011 --> 00:14:04.000
I think my parents' ambition for me as to like be the trophy,

246
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.940
the trophy,
vive.
And uh,
ever since I was a kid I was uh,

247
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.440
as a rebel,
I would think that something off like my life just can't be like,

248
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:15.390
you know,

249
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:20.140
just just like get married and be somebody a showpiece.

250
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.430
Um,

251
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:26.430
and very early on I started working for other people because I come from a

252
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:30.520
family business background and I thought that if I joined my own business the

253
00:14:30.521 --> 00:14:33.700
first day,
I mean,
I don't think I'll be taken seriously.

254
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:37.330
I don't think I would be learning much.
Uh,
so I,
I went,

255
00:14:37.331 --> 00:14:41.170
I like ally is that even though I've traveled a lot,

256
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.340
I went to different cities because I wanted that anonymous or tea or no,

257
00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:50.050
I did not want to come from a background I wanted to learn and I totally

258
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:51.950
understood that.
Uh,

259
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.160
<v 5>what did DX to be anonymous in a system.</v>

260
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.130
And when I came back to my family business,

261
00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:00.530
I guess there was more empathy towards my employees,

262
00:15:00.531 --> 00:15:03.720
which I could have never learned if I started,
um,

263
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:09.070
from a cabin like from my cabin because I went from like a desk to a senior

264
00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:14.420
manager and then a cabin.
I guess that empathy factor came into me very early on.

265
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.480
Um,
but,
uh,
after I came back to my family business,
uh,
we started,
uh,

266
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.810
the solar company that,
um,
um,
uh,
that is the cash cow of a group.

267
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.060
And I'm very active in it.
Um,

268
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:31.220
and we've done a fairly good last two years has been a little tough,

269
00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:35.540
but we've,
we've,
we've had around and stuff like that.
But even then,

270
00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.580
I always felt like,
you know,

271
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:41.630
people would always associate to me to like a family business group.

272
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.800
So to your question,
you know,
like how do you maneuver the things?
It's,
it's,

273
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:50.720
it's because out of like,
you know,
this,
this thing that,
you know,

274
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.690
I need to prove it to someone.
I don't know if it's to my parents,

275
00:15:53.691 --> 00:15:56.330
to society or to my friends,

276
00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.190
but I need to prove it to someone that I'm not just a privilege.
Do you know,

277
00:16:01.191 --> 00:16:05.980
I want to do my own thing.
So I,
I am a startup on tuna.
Like I've done cereal,

278
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.120
uh,
um,
startups.

279
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.890
I started mentoring people right now,
like,
so when you said startup coach,

280
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:17.210
I work very actively with them,
but that also wasn't enough for me.

281
00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:20.480
So another hat that I wear is like these organizations.

282
00:16:20.481 --> 00:16:23.990
So today I'm a pod of three very active organizations.

283
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:25.910
One is called the entrepreneurs organization.

284
00:16:25.911 --> 00:16:30.440
It's the world's largest influential organization.
I'm on the southeast Shabbat,

285
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.700
uh,
and Vicky ladies organizations,
few if you would have heard it,

286
00:16:34.701 --> 00:16:39.620
I'm leading and then coming to a person next to you.
And,
uh,
another one is,

287
00:16:39.621 --> 00:16:43.010
uh,
uh,
it's a very easy to know,
like a Gen International Trade Organization.

288
00:16:43.011 --> 00:16:47.120
It's from the community I come from.
So,
uh,
all this,
like when,

289
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.980
when a person sees my Facebook profile,

290
00:16:48.981 --> 00:16:51.530
like my immediate community or my friends,
they're like,
oh,

291
00:16:51.531 --> 00:16:55.100
you're doing so many things with,
it's actually actually,

292
00:16:55.101 --> 00:16:59.120
because there are many factors to add.
One because you're like job list to this.

293
00:16:59.121 --> 00:17:03.740
You want to know,
like prove it to everyone and,
uh,
two because,

294
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:07.780
um,
you don't want to be tagged out.

295
00:17:07.781 --> 00:17:10.490
You don't want to be a new one that okay,

296
00:17:10.491 --> 00:17:12.770
this was just like you were born with a silver spoon.
No,

297
00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:17.830
I have my own identity and I think like women tend to try and prove,

298
00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:23.950
uh,
like extra for this.
Like my brother's just in Bahamas enjoying his name.

299
00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:30.110
Yeah.
He doesn't have to prove that much.
And I think even,
uh,
even as an air like,

300
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:34.460
oh,
you know,
he would be getting the next generation.
Um,

301
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:39.350
the,
uh,
in terms of the monetary compensation and stuff like that,

302
00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.730
uh,
it's,
it's kind of taken for granted that it's going to the men in the family.

303
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:48.260
I'm sure.
I do agree to your point that times are changing and you know,
that is,

304
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:53.010
uh,
going to be a lot of,
uh,
uh,
equality in this.

305
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:57.720
But as of now,
uh,
I still feel like as a,

306
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.710
as in down here a patriarchal society,
there's no doubt about that.

307
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.400
Yeah.

308
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.850
<v 3>I come from a family of bankers and people were in the garment,</v>

309
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.600
but dyes to sit down and read.
I was not a person like,
you know,

310
00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:15.810
who talk like this is like a very quiet,
nice,
sweet girl.

311
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.150
And uh,
I,

312
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.190
they always wanted to be a writer.
Those days,
you know,

313
00:18:23.191 --> 00:18:26.550
there was no career counseling.
Nobody told us you must do this course.

314
00:18:26.551 --> 00:18:30.990
So I just did English literature and then Ivan Tonto a bit more to Calcutta.

315
00:18:30.991 --> 00:18:34.500
So I joined Sunday.
It's not like I,
I,

316
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.710
I actually didn't do a journalism course.
So I just,

317
00:18:37.711 --> 00:18:41.910
and then even even in college,
I remember my dad writing in Saint Francis,

318
00:18:41.911 --> 00:18:43.050
you know,
we have to give an option.

319
00:18:43.051 --> 00:18:47.100
He put economic center vendor and cut it out in front of the system,
put English.

320
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.720
So my daughter's dorm and my dad said,
what do you,

321
00:18:49.721 --> 00:18:52.740
what do you go to do with English?
Shallow?
You're not,
she'll become a professor,

322
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:55.590
which I hate or I go,
I would never become a professor.

323
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.440
So I had no idea how I was going to become a writer,

324
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:03.440
but I just used to love writing essays,
writing stories.
And uh,
what happened,

325
00:19:03.441 --> 00:19:07.050
I joined the in Calcutta,
so this magazine called Sunday,

326
00:19:07.051 --> 00:19:11.790
which was very iconic in those days.
And then I think some dead,
it took off.

327
00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.060
And you know,
one,
when I started,
I didn't say that,
you know,

328
00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:18.360
I want to become an editor,
I want to start magazine,
not tea.
It just,

329
00:19:18.361 --> 00:19:20.340
the love of writing,
which I still love.

330
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.310
So it's just that one log we just takes you forward.

331
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:24.783
<v 5>Shake hands.</v>

332
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.990
<v 1>Yeah.
I've asked,
been asked this question a couple of times before,
do we?</v>

333
00:19:27.991 --> 00:19:31.650
I think about it,
it's optionality better than linearity in the sense,

334
00:19:31.651 --> 00:19:35.250
like not messy looking at your career or life as a linear progression,

335
00:19:35.251 --> 00:19:38.140
but more or less taking options and taking risks.
Um,

336
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:42.750
I come from a middle class family,
their parents being academicians.
So,

337
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:47.310
uh,
deadly good guy growing up there was Korea,
what's already set for you?

338
00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:51.690
You have to be an engineer or a doctor.
I was not as smart.

339
00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:55.410
So I chose engineering and then it was go to the u s because that's what you'll

340
00:19:55.411 --> 00:20:00.000
do.
So you make a GRE and that night I land up in theU s study their work there.

341
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.600
Then I realized that there are options that I can think of what I want to do and

342
00:20:03.601 --> 00:20:07.900
what I don't want to do.
One of those ways teaching,
like I,

343
00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:12.870
they utilize that back.
Good.
My appearance,
something stuck to me,

344
00:20:12.871 --> 00:20:16.090
but the gene of teaching.
So that kind of was things that I,

345
00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:21.030
I've been doing over an awful late.
And then at some point I was like,
okay,
good.

346
00:20:21.031 --> 00:20:24.590
Done technology down software.
I want to do something else.
I,
uh,

347
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.250
I actually hit a glass ceiling with my colleagues and I figured that I needed to

348
00:20:29.251 --> 00:20:32.400
get the business school to dig.
So I ran to Paterson and got an Mba,

349
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:36.210
then came back the strategy for some time and then got bored of it.

350
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.810
Then join Google.
I've been at Google for seven,
eight years.

351
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.490
And if I look at my career path,

352
00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:45.280
what I realize is there are two things which kind of our,
um,

353
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:49.960
uh,
our two lots for me.
One,

354
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.430
I'm a learning and then to,
I mean,
driving impact,
road adding impact.

355
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.160
If I'm not learning or if I'm not making an impact,

356
00:20:57.161 --> 00:20:59.140
I cannot get bored and I wanted to do something else.

357
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.520
So usually it's not like you would continue to learn and you would add impact.

358
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.720
It's not,
those don't happen at the same time,

359
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.970
but either you are learning or whether you are at it black and making an impact

360
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.340
on either of those students up.

361
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.540
Things that I hold true to myself as I think about career and collaboration and

362
00:21:13.541 --> 00:21:14.374
stuff like that.

363
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.770
<v 0>So it's very interesting that,
uh,</v>

364
00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.490
almost all of you said that when you started out,

365
00:21:19.491 --> 00:21:22.320
you weren't sure what you wanted to do.
Um,

366
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.130
and what I've sort of been scribbling as you're talking,

367
00:21:25.131 --> 00:21:27.170
I think that there are certain things that have stood out,

368
00:21:27.171 --> 00:21:31.010
which I think is important for everybody in this room.
So like a lot he said,

369
00:21:31.011 --> 00:21:33.560
show up,
right?
Like when the opportunity arrives,

370
00:21:33.561 --> 00:21:36.690
you have to be present and ready to grab it.
Um,

371
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.620
and also be very clear about what you want.

372
00:21:39.621 --> 00:21:44.060
So I think for many die it was a desire to prove yourself.
[inaudible] it was,

373
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.610
you know,
you wanted to ride and for you it was,
you know,

374
00:21:46.611 --> 00:21:49.080
learning and challenging yourself.
Um,

375
00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:53.770
but let's talk about the need for support and allies and mentors as you're

376
00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:58.370
navigating your careers.
So could you share a little bit about,
uh,
you know,

377
00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.640
you mentioned a little bit about navigation and your junk and so good on

378
00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:05.230
Hyderabad,
but who are the people who you think,
uh,

379
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:09.410
we're able to support you as you made some of these choices?
In some cases,

380
00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:12.590
radical choices,
uh,
who stood by our side.

381
00:22:12.591 --> 00:22:15.140
And how important do you think it is to have a mentor?

382
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.320
<v 4>I don't know what the people actively seek mentors.</v>

383
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.740
It happens at [inaudible] have her learn so much from this person or what day.

384
00:22:24.741 --> 00:22:29.740
But for me the support which is unconditional and was also uh,
you know,
media,

385
00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.240
it didn't even cross our minds that they would not support with family.

386
00:22:32.241 --> 00:22:34.790
I mean at any point of time my parents would have put their foot down and said,

387
00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:38.870
yes,
you want rule law.
That was fine.
Then you got into fashion,
we get quiet.

388
00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.050
You got married,
we allowed you to,
you got divorced,
you came back,

389
00:22:42.051 --> 00:22:45.590
we let you now you want to go the films.
Absolutely not.
You know,
they hadn't,

390
00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.240
I remember when we were doing how,
what Louis and I said,
you know what,

391
00:22:48.241 --> 00:22:48.861
this guy's coming,

392
00:22:48.861 --> 00:22:51.560
he wants to make this movie and he wants to do all this still lake.
Okay.

393
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.610
You know,
another thing,
it was an 18 days into whatever's,

394
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:58.220
I left my store in the kinder,

395
00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:02.810
the thing of my cousin and I went off to shoot and at one morning in a 5:00 AM

396
00:23:02.811 --> 00:23:04.610
call time I open my bathroom to get out of this.

397
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.440
My grandmother standing over there and I'm like,

398
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:10.460
daddy went and she's saying it's an English movie.
So I'm like,
yeah,
no,
no,
no,

399
00:23:10.461 --> 00:23:11.294
the keys.

400
00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.790
So that the only [inaudible] family was my grandmother when she found out on day

401
00:23:16.791 --> 00:23:20.900
12 was doing an English film.
I'm [inaudible] this child is going.

402
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:26.110
So I suppose that kind of freedom could be support innovators at the curb at any

403
00:23:26.121 --> 00:23:29.000
point.
We,
we made lots of mistakes.
I mean my,

404
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:33.260
my journey is filled with mistakes from my obsession through low to the managers

405
00:23:33.261 --> 00:23:33.831
to Maddie.

406
00:23:33.831 --> 00:23:37.310
Do you know the fact that I gave up my store when it was at the height of fits

407
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.220
backup,
Eli was the only store like leads to continuing.

408
00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.970
But the thing is I sold my name,
you know,
[inaudible] that's my name.

409
00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:46.880
I want back.
But that's the only thing I have to sell.

410
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:50.330
The store was on renting the are on consignment so I couldn't sell anything else

411
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:54.590
but the name.
So you know that the thought of them as mistakes.

412
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.880
And then of course Nagesh came as a director and then he was so clear about
what,

413
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:01.550
I never met someone with such clarity and he was,

414
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.280
he wasn't unhappy engineer because he was available.

415
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.200
He wasn't a medical because he was [inaudible].

416
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.060
And then of course pause that he just wanted to make movies and he was very

417
00:24:11.061 --> 00:24:12.170
clear about his pub.

418
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.190
And that was such a novelty to me that someone knew what they wanted to do

419
00:24:16.191 --> 00:24:20.480
because I really had no idea what I want to do in present.
Continuous,

420
00:24:20.481 --> 00:24:23.090
not Bostons.
And then as a mentor,

421
00:24:23.091 --> 00:24:26.660
you realize in hindsight how much you've picked up from the people who were

422
00:24:26.661 --> 00:24:28.700
there in your life.
So like my father for instance,

423
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:33.200
extremely checkered career chartered accountant,
became a fashion designer.

424
00:24:33.201 --> 00:24:37.730
He's responsible for radish,
Canada's guru color and running Umar saffron pants,

425
00:24:37.731 --> 00:24:40.850
colored pants.
That was my father because he was doodling in the,
in Bombay.

426
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:44.860
And then joined,
you know,
[inaudible] has a father,

427
00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.640
they per pack and this after this whole thing.

428
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:50.570
Then he came to a head the and set up a saccharin industries and a fire

429
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:54.230
extinguisher industry in Bhutan.
And while he was doodling,

430
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.910
he designed the,

431
00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:00.470
the small little ceasefire unit that we spoke so popular at one time and he saw

432
00:25:00.471 --> 00:25:05.180
that design do the people who made ceasefire and retired at 40 and it was really

433
00:25:05.181 --> 00:25:07.760
embarrassing for us because we are still in school and people would say,

434
00:25:07.761 --> 00:25:10.250
what does your father do?
He's an engineer,
he's a doctor,
he's a builder.

435
00:25:10.251 --> 00:25:12.290
What does your father do?
Not think he's the thing at home.

436
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.780
So it does really embarrassing for us to have fathers like that.

437
00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:19.430
But the point is that was data then I had negate who I remember was it line in

438
00:25:19.431 --> 00:25:21.920
the film called second fellow called Rockford that said,

439
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.590
don't recognize failure than there is no failing.

440
00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.180
And I realized that that is the mantra I've used all my life.

441
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:33.290
But if you don't recognize failure,
then you really don't know you failed.
Right.

442
00:25:33.291 --> 00:25:37.880
So I suppose that became a mentor,
mentee relationship,
but we are not,

443
00:25:37.881 --> 00:25:41.900
we are a director,
producer relationship.
So like I said,
mentor,

444
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:43.580
I don't know.

445
00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:47.900
I just take whatever I can learn from people and then applied to my life and

446
00:25:47.901 --> 00:25:51.620
pretend I was the one who was part of that.
But uh,
that's it.
Yeah.

447
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:57.720
What about,
am I answering any question you would ask me?
Yes,

448
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.080
<v 3>I'd like to,
I'd like to acknowledge my parents still because when you like,</v>

449
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.380
because even I was thinking,
who the hell supported me and who are my mentors?

450
00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:15.130
This unconditional support from the parents is very,
very important.

451
00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.400
But of course they thought I won't amount to much because of English literature.

452
00:26:18.401 --> 00:26:23.240
My brothers were all into MBA and brilliant in math.
I'm really bad at math,

453
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:27.580
so you don't,
but like she said,
they supported water.
I did.

454
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.810
And when I became a writer,

455
00:26:28.811 --> 00:26:31.900
I know I've had a career in society and lots of magazines in Bombay.

456
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.150
They were extremely proud of the whole thing.

457
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:37.960
And then of course I'd like to acknowledge Dr Andrew Ready because I started a

458
00:26:37.961 --> 00:26:41.970
magazine for them.
So initially whenever the magazine came out,
he would say,

459
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.250
my God at night looks like National Geographic.

460
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.860
And often that he stopped after first two years in calling me regularly via

461
00:26:49.861 --> 00:26:53.790
better than India today.
You know,
he was so proud and then he stopped.

462
00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:55.350
He knew that I could stand on my feet,

463
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.670
just a call.
That's all.
That's the kind of mentor he was.

464
00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:07.780
<v 5>I think mentorship is the most important thing in life.
Uh,</v>

465
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:12.700
I felt the lack of it growing up.
And I would Jordan if he'd like,
like,

466
00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:16.130
like somebody stabbing in a desert,
you know?
So,
uh,

467
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.870
and I had you add this on there that if you don't get something in life,

468
00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.340
you become the pioneer to fit.
And that's why I feel like,
uh,
right now,

469
00:27:24.341 --> 00:27:28.060
one of my part time Carlos is also life coaching.

470
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.520
And I do that for people.

471
00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:35.140
And I feel that I got into this because actually the lack of it,

472
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.770
but I also believe like every,
uh,

473
00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.680
level of your life demands a certain mentor,

474
00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.930
a certain skill set or certain advice that you're looking forward.

475
00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.040
And it's a little bit Eddie Petty,

476
00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:52.870
but I do believe in the law of attraction and I feel like the more you are pure

477
00:27:52.871 --> 00:27:57.760
game,
the bedroom mentors,
the better people into your life and nothing,

478
00:27:57.761 --> 00:27:59.650
nothing defies the grease of a group.

479
00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:04.050
Like if you have a mentor with the project,
the,
uh,

480
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:07.840
relationship,
anything like now if I just take in terms of a project,

481
00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:12.350
the project that I can do and now here are my personal growth that can happen in

482
00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:14.590
a year.
Just with the grease of good writing.

483
00:28:14.591 --> 00:28:17.230
It can accelerate to like in a month.

484
00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.250
So I am a Ha,
uh,

485
00:28:20.251 --> 00:28:24.220
like a daughter delever off,
uh,
the mentor,

486
00:28:24.221 --> 00:28:27.310
mentee relationship.
I think I'm pro mentorship.
Yeah,

487
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.400
<v 3>it's too late for us.</v>

488
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:40.960
<v 1>Port perspective.
Definitely family.
Parents were always there.</v>

489
00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.590
And the other equally important or more important in shaping my career.

490
00:28:44.591 --> 00:28:47.120
That's been my wife.
Um,
I've shared this,

491
00:28:47.121 --> 00:28:50.170
but some of the Google ads as well in the past.
Um,

492
00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:54.970
I left my wife and four months,
four month,
four week or it's on,

493
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.450
uh,
in the u s to go to business school in Paris,
all by myself.

494
00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:02.710
And he was there by herself taking care of the baby.
A lot of people were like,

495
00:29:02.711 --> 00:29:05.830
you're a great negotiator.
It's more importantly,

496
00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.770
she was empathetic towards what I felt was important for me.

497
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.620
And then he was there.
And second thing,
uh,

498
00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.560
when I started Google will be with the New York as well.
Uh,

499
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.530
we had a second doctor,
a second child,
a daughter,

500
00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:20.740
and then my wife was there with both of them.

501
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:25.820
And then I moved up to start my career in Google.
And second it,

502
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.060
same thing happens now.
Uh,
both of those situations where we at,

503
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:34.360
he stood behind me and said,
hey,
you want to do this?
Go ahead and do it.
Um,

504
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:38.740
my colleagues and my bosses make fun of me when they moved back from,
uh,

505
00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:41.590
from the U S for India.
They are like,
are you moving India?

506
00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:46.300
How are you expecting a third one?
It was luck that sneak through.
But yeah,

507
00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:50.980
so she has been there continuously in terms of mentorship.
Uh,
it happens,
right?

508
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.280
It's not like you will find the right mentor.
Having said that,

509
00:29:54.281 --> 00:29:59.281
there are some things that he can spot your one is what attributes or skills

510
00:29:59.951 --> 00:30:02.560
that you don't have that you might want to look for.

511
00:30:02.561 --> 00:30:05.890
The things that you might want to learn from somebody.
It's not something like,

512
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:06.101
okay,

513
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:09.050
I'm going to be Bluetooth this clip two and say this is what I want to do with a

514
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:10.120
hand somewhere to find somebody.

515
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.710
But the idea of continuous learning either from a Google or from a coach or

516
00:30:14.711 --> 00:30:17.920
somebody who is there who can help you navigate that next step is important.

517
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:21.420
You can find them in various forms and then you need to convince Lou,

518
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:25.480
look for them the value of a good mentor that's like under state there.

519
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.990
It's a huge,
huge benefit because they can be a sounding board.

520
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.950
Things that you cannot talk to your colleagues who can't up your bosses because

521
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.610
they,
my poor their toy.
Again,
spewing all of that,
they,

522
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.530
these mentors actually help you get the right idea.

523
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:43.970
<v 0>We do a lot of user research and we talk to women and they've said that,
uh,</v>

524
00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:44.191
you know,

525
00:30:44.191 --> 00:30:49.191
the reason why I can't pursue a career in technology and pursue a phd and things

526
00:30:49.351 --> 00:30:53.760
like that is because I can tell my mom that I want to be like Sheryl Sandberg,

527
00:30:53.761 --> 00:30:53.941
right?

528
00:30:53.941 --> 00:30:57.490
Because she's this foreigner and it's very easy for my parents to take you far

529
00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:59.420
in Mattel.
I'm an angel died.

530
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:03.760
So I'm so I think it's important to have these stories from India,
uh,

531
00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:07.830
royal models that we can,
uh,
you know,
one that gives,
that make,

532
00:31:07.831 --> 00:31:12.450
that inspire us or fill us with rage to do something like the ones you mentioned

533
00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:17.010
are things that are aspirational women who look like us,
but who dealt with,
uh,

534
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:21.530
with a lot of adversity and still made it happen.
Um,
that's sort of my kids.

535
00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:24.630
How many can,
I definitely thought both.
Sorry,
you didn't get your name.

536
00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:30.740
<v 5>Uh,
now,
now when you were talking like every word you said,</v>

537
00:31:30.741 --> 00:31:35.120
the choice of words you use is the exact emotion I could connect to because it

538
00:31:35.121 --> 00:31:39.530
happens to me like,
like lie.
He said,
even after proving yourself dime a dozen,

539
00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:43.100
you're bad instilled out you.
They're like,
no,
by you.
You know,
why,

540
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:45.650
why should we listen to you?
Or why should we listen to this?

541
00:31:45.651 --> 00:31:49.550
The device gain of advice,
you know,
because like,
like you said,

542
00:31:49.551 --> 00:31:54.380
the conditioning of the society or a,
they have to go back there,
you know,

543
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.200
and,
and I completely resonate with each and every thing,

544
00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:02.600
but what I can see is,
uh,
have you heard of the tyranny of the slight edge?

545
00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.550
Like just small daily habits that you do every day.
Did Not,

546
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:08.750
they need not be important to,
you know,

547
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.640
but then they add up when you just put one marble in a jar,

548
00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:17.840
it doesn't,
does make a difference,
but you keep adding up hundred days.
It'll be,

549
00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.540
it'll become like,
it'll be something solid.

550
00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.420
So taking the points from both of them,

551
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:28.330
that perseverance is something,
you know,
that we can't give up on it.

552
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.150
I like the one the best for our life and if it takes for us to,
you know,

553
00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.240
convince her parents are,
you know,

554
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:38.180
have those difficult conversations with the people they love the most because we

555
00:32:38.181 --> 00:32:40.070
don't want to hide them,
respect them.

556
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.470
And I think they love us and respect us too.

557
00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:46.490
It's just that they don't know how to,
you know,
kind of,
uh,

558
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:49.740
have like a marriage of the society and there,
uh,

559
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:54.410
and the new new generation iPods and stuff like that.
So I feel like in a line,

560
00:32:54.411 --> 00:32:58.910
if I would have to see is that if you know the background feeling that they

561
00:32:58.911 --> 00:33:01.460
truly love and care for you,
but they're helpless,

562
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:05.270
I think they also understand you.
And if he can like,

563
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.470
just have that at all.

564
00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:13.580
If you can just have that in the back of our mind and then go towards our

565
00:33:13.581 --> 00:33:15.520
actionable items.
I know

566
00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.550
<v 3>my daughter wanted to get married.
I said buddy to go live with him.
I mean,</v>

567
00:33:19.551 --> 00:33:23.500
what is this obsession with marriage and budgeting this in all of us to do this,

568
00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:28.150
Johnny and all that.
But she was like saying,
no,
I must get married.
So she,

569
00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:29.660
I think your generation wants to get

570
00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.360
<v 0>not in and which is like your</v>

571
00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:38.270
city is,
it is a CT awesome dot.
Then she wasn't mad at you can die from it

572
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:43.700
because I thought she didn't know him that enough.

573
00:33:43.701 --> 00:33:46.850
So I said limit and for some time and then before you decide if it's okay,

574
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.350
I feel if you want married,

575
00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.890
<v 3>please do that.
If you want to live with somebody,
a guy or a girl plays Dota.</v>

576
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:55.430
Basically we need to liberate ourselves.
This is what my point is.

577
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.430
Don't say my dad said this.
Don't say my husband said this.

578
00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:00.710
I mean I've gone from very difficult backgrounds.
I've,

579
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:02.570
it's not like everything was given to me,

580
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:07.190
but I just broke all barriers on a single mom brought up two kids and then when

581
00:34:07.191 --> 00:34:09.410
we started a magazine,
you know,
I just went forward.

582
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.020
It was like in house bag because it has,

583
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.830
why should they in House magazine be boring?

584
00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.230
So just break the barriers in your mind.

585
00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:18.050
That is what we need to break when everybody says,

586
00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:22.770
<v 0>my kid,
my mom loves me.
Sorry,</v>

587
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:25.590
my mom loves his.
Everybody had told me

588
00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:29.380
get a swig.
Remind me,
because

589
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:36.180
I am in is in this book field,
which we are.
Look under a microscope.

590
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.750
Rejoice if our film flops right.
And it was keep petite.

591
00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.520
We come from that kind of a thing.

592
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:46.790
But if you really do give that much weightage to what everybody thinks,

593
00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:51.200
genuinely,
you will not go one step.
Understand

594
00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.530
you don't get as good as the last Friday.
Next Friday,

595
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.610
someone else will get put off by it.

596
00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:01.440
They don't care about you think that they don't give a damn.

597
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.660
I met,
have gone the National Watsi David,
Nice tomorrow.
I'm a history headlines.

598
00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:11.250
They leave.
Nobody cares about you.
We think people

599
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:17.430
get this idea of what unfolds,
fortunately.
All right.

600
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:21.300
Uh,
so that's all we have time for.
So it's a great note to Asia,

601
00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.740
but I think there's some great lessons to learn.

602
00:35:25.741 --> 00:35:30.630
Thank you so much for sharing your stories.
Seize the opportunity.
Show up.
Um,

603
00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:34.410
you know,
pursue your desires.
Act from a place of empathy.

604
00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.470
A realize where your families are coming from.
Uh,

605
00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:42.000
but of course we brave and pursue everything.
Thank you everybody.
