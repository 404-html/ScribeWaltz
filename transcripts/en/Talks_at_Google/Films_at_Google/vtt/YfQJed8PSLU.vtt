1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.280
[inaudible]

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.730
<v 1>you all could just say your names and I'm just getting it Mindy's,</v>

3
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:13.960
although it's not done.
And Chris Pratt look at him.

4
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.050
<v 0>All right,
so we're going to ask,</v>

5
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.540
<v 1>well,
we wanna thank you guys for coming to the very center of the nerd universe.</v>

6
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.120
Knock a lot of them out right off,
right out of the gate.
Um,

7
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.890
so we're gonna ask some questions.
Um,
okay.
So this,
this movie,
we all saw it.
Uh,

8
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.640
I started last week.
It was amazing.
Really.
It's,
it's,

9
00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.740
I would say it's almost like 95% of comedy.

10
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.350
<v 2>It's really like a fun,
I mean,
the tone is like super light and fun.
Like,</v>

11
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.160
is it hard to keep it loose when you know that it's,
you know,

12
00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:50.530
they're spending like $1 million a minute.
I'm not good with math,

13
00:00:50.531 --> 00:00:54.580
but something like that around the million dollars a second,
I think.
Oh,
sorry.

14
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.540
Um,
have those figures,
you know,
it is,

15
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.550
it is a little difficult juggling tone.

16
00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:03.310
I think when you have comedy and action and drama and all those things in the

17
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:07.060
same movie,
a lot of times when movies try to have all three of those things,

18
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.090
they essentially fail it all.
Three.
Like,
you know,

19
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:13.450
movies that are trying to be funny and have action and have drama oftentimes

20
00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:16.540
feel it,
all of those things.
And so,
you know,

21
00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:19.150
it is a little scary because you're there and like,
you know,

22
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.180
you're surrounded by alien makeup extras and you're on this amazing set

23
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.230
outdoors,
you know,

24
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.610
it's literally costing at least thousands of dollars a minute if not.
Yeah.

25
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.780
And um,
and they're like,
okay,
no,
do the running man more.

26
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.300
<v 1>You're like,
oh my God.
Like if this doesn't work,</v>

27
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.930
<v 2>work,
it's going to be super embarrassing,
you know?
Um,
so,
so it is,</v>

28
00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:46.270
it is a little tough,
but I think tone is something that's like,

29
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.410
we just have to sort of,

30
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.620
we just sort of have to trust James in the post production process that he's

31
00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:54.010
gonna Polish it and test it and make sure that the comedies working but not

32
00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:57.340
overshadowing the action and not,
oh,
not always.
Shining the drama.
I mean,

33
00:01:57.341 --> 00:01:59.530
I like to liken it to like gastronomy,
you know,

34
00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:03.970
like those kind of dishes that shouldn't work together but do and the result of

35
00:02:03.971 --> 00:02:06.760
a chef knowing just how much caviar to mix with the lollipop

36
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.050
<v 1>and the cat food.
Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.390
<v 2>There's a lot of times it is weird when you're like,
oh wait,</v>

38
00:02:13.391 --> 00:02:16.640
now the raccoons crying.
What do we,
uh,
you know,
you right.
And it works,

39
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.680
but it works.
Yeah.
I think,

40
00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:21.190
I think as long as the ingredients are really organic and fresh and new and you

41
00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:22.420
have it in the hands of a good chef,

42
00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:24.850
they can like give you a dish that you're not used to eating,
but you're like,

43
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.300
God dammit.
That's really good.
And I,
you know,

44
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.420
<v 1>I did not eat</v>

45
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.030
<v 2>every time.
I'm only use food metaphors,
you know,
I'm hungry.</v>

46
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.200
How many of you a audition for any of these like Superhero,
uh,
uh,

47
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.220
huge superhero comic book kind of things before.
And I've been,

48
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:48.720
you've been in a billion action movies
now.

49
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:53.520
This is the first,
uh,
the first marvel film,
the First Superhero Film I've done.

50
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:54.181
And it was like a,

51
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:58.020
there was like a social media wave to get you involved in a marvel movie.

52
00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:00.670
Was that how this came about?
Yeah,
it happened last year.

53
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.890
<v 3>Um,
it was at comicon.</v>

54
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.520
I was at comicon and I was there for how I was at holiday h for Riddick and

55
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.610
someone in the iron man outfit ask neutral questions.

56
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.790
How did I envision my relationship with marvel would be,
and uh,

57
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.140
and then the next day Kevin Fygi was there and they asked him the same question.

58
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.640
And then two weeks later,
Kevin,
if I get called,
men said,
you want to play a tree?

59
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.780
<v 1>To which you said,
I am.
I am.</v>

60
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.770
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.550
How many,
how many times

62
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.600
<v 1>did you have to say that?
I mean,
was it like,
hey,</v>

63
00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:46.440
just come in and give a six and then we're gone?

64
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.680
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean,</v>

65
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.980
the cool thing about the James Gunn is that he really was invested in this

66
00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:59.000
movie.
And I was lucky because they had already shot so much of the movie.

67
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.710
And when I went into the Adr booth,
I was loving what I was seeing.

68
00:04:03.711 --> 00:04:05.270
I was loving these characters.

69
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.830
<v 1>But you got to play off the scenes that were arguing that tall,</v>

70
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.650
<v 3>all of them.
So I'm loving star Lord and Loving Gomorrah.</v>

71
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.600
I'm seeing these guys in action.

72
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.140
And I thought that there was only gonna be three words when I came in there and

73
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:24.601
there was a 50 page document with I am Groot on the lefthand side and then

74
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.430
whatever he wanted to say.
I know some of you,

75
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:32.530
I mean if this is the nerd capitol,

76
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.620
<v 1>yeah.</v>

77
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.840
<v 3>Do you know what a floor colossus is?</v>

78
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.870
And it is a group and essentially people that are familiar with him can

79
00:04:45.541 --> 00:04:46.380
understand him,

80
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.130
but if you aren't familiar with them because he has a hardened larynx,

81
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.550
you can understand the nuance of his speech.

82
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.940
So James Gunn really wanted to give me the line and then the process with trying

83
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:04.780
to make that line fit into the three monosyllabic words of

84
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.610
<v 1>so like,
so.
So speaking group,
like say if you wanted to say,
uh,
I'll,</v>

85
00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:13.170
I'll take the check.
How would that sound right

86
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.750
word.
All right.
All right.
You gave us one that was,

87
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.660
come on.
What is this?
Um,
Zoe,
you a between star trek,

88
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.760
this an Avatar,
like you're in space more than you're not in space.
Um,

89
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.750
is that something like,
is it hard for you to go like from that to okay,

90
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.450
now you're in Pittsburgh with Christian Bale and it's a serious scene.
Yeah.

91
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.160
<v 4>Um,
I can't,
I wish I was in space when I went to Pittsburgh.</v>

92
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.613
<v 0>I know.</v>

93
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.430
<v 4>No,
no.
The content of what we were doing was so non fun.</v>

94
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.420
When you work,
when you work in a movie like this,

95
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:02.870
you're kind of skipping to work and you're just sort of bitching and moaning

96
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:07.250
about the long hours of makeup and the 18 hours shoots or whatever.

97
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.300
When you do a film like out of the furnace,
we can be shooting and in Miami,

98
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:12.320
in South Beach,

99
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.430
it's still not going to be fun and you're still going to wish that you were in

100
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:18.920
space.
The content was really heavy.

101
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.570
Nobody made a joke and everybody was like a method actor.

102
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.660
So I'm the only one like walking towards

103
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:26.130
<v 1>good.
I like,</v>

104
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.980
instead of being in the makeup trailer and I have like Christian Bale here,

105
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.480
<v 4>Casey Affleck there.
I'm like,</v>

106
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.980
<v 1>Hey,
it was just like,
oh my God.</v>

107
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.730
<v 4>So like,
so it was good when,
after that movie,
you know,</v>

108
00:06:41.731 --> 00:06:43.650
and I was very proud of it.
I side too.

109
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.660
It's good to do things here on earth sometimes.
And um,

110
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.570
cause then when you do get to go one space you're like,
yeah,

111
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.510
<v 1>we'll start by doing all that stuff with Scifi.
I love Pittsburgh by the way.</v>

112
00:06:56.511 --> 00:07:01.060
You guys have so many awesome bridges and the Andy Warhol Museum is there

113
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.180
by the way.
Don't see in a Miller me please.

114
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.800
But Christian Bale and Casey Affleck nuts.
I'm just kidding.

115
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.000
That was signed by suddenly you've been interested in like we originally we

116
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:14.460
started out right?

117
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.780
<v 4>Doing or do you just kind of come to,
you know,
I was,
I,</v>

118
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.010
I grew up in a household where my mother,

119
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.820
if she wasn't watching science fiction,
she was reading it.
And,
and um,

120
00:07:23.821 --> 00:07:25.620
I remember I read Dune when I was very,

121
00:07:25.621 --> 00:07:29.950
very young and I was lady Jessica for many Halloweens.
I was at banner desert.

122
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.090
And um,
so,
uh,
I just,

123
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.810
there was something about the curiosity of what can happen there.

124
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.520
And having a lot of respect through my mother's eyes for the writers and

125
00:07:41.521 --> 00:07:45.090
creators that we're able to imagine the unimaginable.
I just thought they,

126
00:07:45.091 --> 00:07:49.290
it was such a bold decision and,
and,
and they were so they were originals,

127
00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:52.980
you know,
and um,
being an underdog myself,

128
00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:58.010
I kind of felt an affinity always with people that were able to go outside of

129
00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:02.400
the norm and,
and see life for what it truly truly is,

130
00:08:02.401 --> 00:08:05.630
which is a complete blank canvas.
Uh,

131
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.970
so filmmakers like Jj Abrams,
James Cameron,

132
00:08:08.971 --> 00:08:12.810
Steven Spielberg are not people that I would've thought that a girl from Queens

133
00:08:12.811 --> 00:08:15.570
would get to work with.
And the first,
you know,

134
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:20.640
it's a seven or eight years of my acting career and yet I did.
And,
um,

135
00:08:20.641 --> 00:08:22.110
and I was very grateful for it.

136
00:08:22.111 --> 00:08:26.130
And then I connected all the dots and it has to do with our affinity with space.

137
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:30.810
And I'm okay with that.
I did have a fear when,
when James Gunn came calling,

138
00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:34.530
they come calling.
I've,
I sorta gone,
I always go,
this will be the last,

139
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.730
and then it's like,
you got,
you got so and so is it.

140
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.260
<v 1>What do you want?
You're going to be green now instead of blue.</v>

141
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.710
That brings up,
is it hard to play a green person or a blue person?
Well,

142
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.140
because I'm a little,

143
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.450
<v 4>I'm a little lazy and heart.
Um,</v>

144
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.090
I like motion capture better because you guys get to do all the hard work.

145
00:08:57.091 --> 00:09:00.820
And I just,
I do my work and I,
I put it all out there.
Uh,

146
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.960
but then I walk away and then it's all done in two years.

147
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:07.410
I can post and things like that.
Uh,
for guardians of the galaxy,

148
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:12.000
like I have to sit there for five hours and it's not cool.

149
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:16.020
Like I have add,
I have OCD.
I'm an England,

150
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:18.820
I'm away from home.
So it's just,
it's been,

151
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.750
it's still dark and you go in and you're getting your makeup done.

152
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:25.170
You come out and it's still dark,
like the day hasn't even started.

153
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:30.090
And then you have like 16 hours worth of work to do.
Um,
and you,

154
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:33.600
you can't complain because everybody's just so happy to be there.

155
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.080
<v 1>[inaudible] palace.</v>

156
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.500
We were watching it.
We were just,
we were just like,

157
00:09:42.501 --> 00:09:45.410
so does every actor no karate now.
Like it seems like,

158
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.800
did you guys know many martial arts before this or did you have to learn it,
uh,

159
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.860
for the [inaudible] when you were in the booth?

160
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:57.260
I am doing it for fun.
No,
but I mean it seems like

161
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:57.481
<v 2>he goes,</v>

162
00:09:57.481 --> 00:10:00.960
we're doing a lot of lot of martial arts really dumbed down my marsh large
scale.

163
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:01.794
Yeah.

164
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.740
I'm a 10th degree black belt in every martial art.
Um,
no,

165
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:12.480
uh,
yeah,
like,
you know,
did Kung Fu when I was like,
I think in third grade,

166
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.760
so I was pretty much qualified and do a

167
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.790
kick ass and space.
Didn't she kick you pretty hard a couple of times?
Yeah.
Yup.

168
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.870
She did.
You know,
she's got these,
she had got these,

169
00:10:24.871 --> 00:10:28.140
she's really very powerful athlete and uh,
and a lot,
you know,

170
00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:31.230
people don't understand that power does come from brute strength.

171
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:34.380
That comes from grace and it comes from like clean lines.
You know what I mean?

172
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:37.070
Like,
like you see the most graceful,
um,

173
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.960
mixed martial arts fighters and they're not like big muscle heads.

174
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:43.020
They're actually like,
almost like ballerinas,
you know what I mean?

175
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.220
And she's a ballerina,
so she whacked me once in the ribs.
I think I'd push on it.

176
00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:49.920
It hurts still.
So might be broken.
I don't know.
It's been like,

177
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.330
it's been like a year,
so I think she broke it.
Um,
but uh,
yeah,

178
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.420
she was wearing these boots too.
They're kind of like high heel boots,

179
00:10:57.421 --> 00:11:00.800
but like instead of having a healed,
they have a,
like a,

180
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:05.100
a thin like rubber hard sole at the bottom and then he'll,
there's,

181
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.980
they're kind of interesting like a triangle.
And then,
uh,

182
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.970
she sort of shorter drove that triangle,
I guess into my,
yeah,

183
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:18.450
I'd say through my diaphragm,
it more into my lung.
Uh,
yeah,
it was a good,

184
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:22.210
she just,
she whacked me good,
you know,
but it's kind of Nice because that's just

185
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:26.030
<v 4>them saying,
do you want to wear your guard,
your safe guards?
No,
no,
no,
no.</v>

186
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.840
Oh my God,
I got it.

187
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.690
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

188
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.700
<v 4>James Gunn,
this done coordinator,
everybody.
And I was like,
seriously Chris,</v>

189
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:35.520
you don't want to wear it.
Are you sure?
He's like,
come on.

190
00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:38.040
It's like we know we know our marks and all right,

191
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.000
<v 2>well,
so are you not supposed to make actual contact?</v>

192
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.150
<v 4>No,
you usually you,
you don't,
you're not supposed to.
And and</v>

193
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.390
<v 1>Ben does.
When you work with them,</v>

194
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.130
<v 4>when you work with someone like James,
he'll go like,</v>

195
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:57.100
well you need to just get a little closer.
Just get a little closer.

196
00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.213
Like looking at

197
00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:03.610
<v 2>kind of like you're blaming James and me for like not wearing some protective</v>

198
00:12:03.661 --> 00:12:08.130
shield.
Look,
the thing is is when it's,
when got winds,

199
00:12:08.131 --> 00:12:11.340
people do stunts and when you do physical activities you just get bumps and

200
00:12:11.341 --> 00:12:12.090
bruises.

201
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:17.090
And the fact that the fact that I got a one from Zoe is seems for some reason to

202
00:12:17.251 --> 00:12:18.540
be remarkable because she's a female,

203
00:12:18.541 --> 00:12:20.800
but she just happens to be another one of the people who did her own,

204
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.330
did a lot of her own stunts.
And so yeah,

205
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.920
you just get bumps and bruises when you do these things.
And,
and my ma the,

206
00:12:25.921 --> 00:12:29.860
you know,
the funny,
tougher bump I got was her kicking me in the ribs.
Yeah.

207
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.590
Good to you.
Now you,
you,

208
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.010
there's a lot of talk about how in shape you got for this and how,
how I go on,

209
00:12:35.011 --> 00:12:35.940
like be more specific.
What is

210
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:40.320
<v 1>Zach?
You got you,
you buy,
I don't know,</v>

211
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.620
<v 2>you just got totally ripped,
uh,
you know,
Ms,
lot of universe style.
Um,</v>

212
00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.730
now do you now have to get back into comedy shape?
Is there,
is,

213
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.000
<v 1>is there a comedy waiting to get to</v>

214
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.900
<v 2>Vidar?
I've been doing some extensive comedy weight training.
Yeah.</v>

215
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.310
You want to train with actually,
yeah.
Train.
We can train.

216
00:12:56.311 --> 00:12:59.750
You were good at right around in that good comedy.
Wait,
yeah,
I know.
I've,
yeah,

217
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.920
definitely started incorporating,
uh,

218
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.100
fun things and tasty things back into my life.
Um,
and I,

219
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.640
that's like just sort of the natural balance,
you know,
like you work very,

220
00:13:08.641 --> 00:13:10.860
very hard,
but it really is,

221
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.720
you only live in that impeccable shape for maybe 24 hours.

222
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.180
No,
seriously.
It's like several months built up to like the,
it's like a,

223
00:13:21.181 --> 00:13:26.160
it's like an orchid that blooms and dies on the same day.
You know,

224
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.060
it's like care and concern watering and the perfect amount of sunshine for six

225
00:13:30.061 --> 00:13:33.180
months.
And then it just,
and you take a selfie

226
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.240
<v 1>and then</v>

227
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.050
<v 2>you slowly,
the orchid falls off and,</v>

228
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.090
and we're sucking in the whole movie pretty much.
Yeah,
pretty much.

229
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.810
<v 4>Yeah.
I have to say I'm,
Chris went through an arguous,</v>

230
00:13:45.811 --> 00:13:49.270
like in very strict,
uh,
I'm purposeful,
uh,

231
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.520
process transformation process that I had the gift of witnessing.

232
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.750
And he did it primarily for health reasons.
And you know,
he's a father as well,

233
00:13:57.751 --> 00:14:01.110
so he wants to be a good example,
not just to his family,

234
00:14:01.111 --> 00:14:04.050
but also to people out there that it is possible.
You could do it.

235
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.260
You could be the guy,
the Chubby guy from Parkson rags

236
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:11.690
<v 1>and [inaudible] show on NBC</v>

237
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.880
<v 4>where he wrote in a marvel movie.
And it's just,
it's the message,</v>

238
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:17.280
the positive message I had sent out,

239
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:24.330
<v 1>where's my money?
I'm going to,
I'm going to go on that diet.
The</v>

240
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.440
<v 2>get cast in a huge blockbuster.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it's a good one.</v>

241
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.650
Now you're going to do a nude scene diet?
Probably anybody.
Uh,

242
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.940
w when I open up to questions,

243
00:14:32.941 --> 00:14:37.941
anybody come in to work working out thing is you have to do that all the time.

244
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.930
Imagine.
Do you,
I mean,
is it like he for you,

245
00:14:42.931 --> 00:14:46.770
is it like his process of like,
it's the one day,
but it's perfect for everyone?

246
00:14:46.771 --> 00:14:51.600
In some ways it is to me you're always building to a specific scene you building

247
00:14:51.601 --> 00:14:52.640
to a specific

248
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:57.770
<v 3>fight scene,
whether it's,
you know,
and the thing or whether it,
yeah.</v>

249
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.530
And um,
yeah.

250
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.080
<v 2>Are you ever just like,
Hey,
just let me stay in the car the whole time?</v>

251
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:09.010
<v 0>I am like that.
I am like that.
I'm just,
I'd be in the car.
Rock is out there.</v>

252
00:15:09.011 --> 00:15:13.410
I don't want to get down.
Stand next to him.
I don't want to slip on baby oil is,

253
00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.173
so

254
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.063
that's the question.

255
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:26.080
<v 5>Hi.
Uh,
speaking of baby oil,
um,
so,</v>

256
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.950
uh,
Vin Mr Diesel,

257
00:15:28.951 --> 00:15:32.100
I don't know if we want to be in a first name basis or nine right now.
We are.

258
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.290
Okay.
Sweet.
So a vin diesel,
Zoe Saldana,

259
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:40.530
both of you have been action figures before for Chris.

260
00:15:40.531 --> 00:15:42.750
I don't know if there was a parks and rec action figure,

261
00:15:42.751 --> 00:15:46.680
but maybe this is the first time you're an actual like action figure that's out

262
00:15:46.681 --> 00:15:50.310
there and kids play with.
So one,
what's that feel like in too?

263
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:51.570
Have you ever played with yourself?

264
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:58.770
<v 0>[inaudible] nice job by the way.</v>

265
00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.620
<v 3>Yeah,
my,</v>

266
00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:15.680
my son was at target and somehow found a group doll.

267
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:22.230
And then when my daughter wanted to one day said they were sold out and they

268
00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:26.250
didn't have any of the targets and became a big deal.

269
00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.690
And uh,
it's a strange thing when you see a doll of yourself,

270
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.290
it's very twilight zone.
You imagine,
you know,

271
00:16:34.291 --> 00:16:38.160
going to brush your teeth at night and opening up the cabinet and seeing nothing

272
00:16:38.161 --> 00:16:40.800
but Groot dolls.
It's freaky.

273
00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:43.740
It's a real freaky thing that's see a doll of yourself.
I mean,

274
00:16:43.741 --> 00:16:45.150
especially if you're a tree.

275
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:48.183
<v 0>Okay.</v>

276
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.850
<v 2>Now how did you guys were,
who were you acting with?</v>

277
00:16:50.851 --> 00:16:54.600
Was it like a tennis ball thing or for,
for group and a,
um,

278
00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:59.430
what's the Fox guy's name?
What's that guy's name?
The rack hawks.
Ratko in,

279
00:16:59.431 --> 00:17:04.160
sorry to hear rock.
He would he blow your

280
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.243
<v 0>hello</v>

281
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.420
<v 2>a hole in your face?
Um,
no,
no,
no.
You see like,
it really like it,</v>

282
00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.040
the tech like the way it works technically.

283
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.550
And not to bore you with all the w what it takes to,

284
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.880
no one's going to be bored by technical stuff.
That's,
yeah,
I guess it's probably,

285
00:17:20.881 --> 00:17:22.950
it's probably true to it is pretty fascinating.
You know,

286
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.180
it really depends on what the,
what the seat with a shot was.
A would depend,
uh,

287
00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.690
would,
would determine what we were acting opposite.

288
00:17:30.691 --> 00:17:34.430
So if we're doing a closeup of Gomorrah and she's having an emotional scene and

289
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.380
with group where she looks at him and she's like having a real interaction and

290
00:17:37.381 --> 00:17:40.380
we need to capture that,
capture that magic,
you know,
right here,

291
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.500
then you'll have her,
uh,
acting opposite.

292
00:17:43.501 --> 00:17:46.800
An actor who do you need to be Christian who played the role of gruit on set or

293
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.940
Sean Gunn,
who has another role in the film is Craig Lynn.
It's hilarious.
Yeah,

294
00:17:50.941 --> 00:17:55.310
he's really great.
And,
uh,
James guns,
brother Shawn,

295
00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.330
he had great,
so good.
And,
and you know,

296
00:17:57.331 --> 00:18:01.290
those characters were definitely born there on the stages when we were working.

297
00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:04.740
And they,
those guys have had,
you know,
pretty thankless,

298
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.190
thankless job and there's sort of the unsung heroes of the movie because they

299
00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:11.160
were there every single day in and out creating this stuff.

300
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.460
Really just so that we could have organic performance is opposite them.

301
00:18:14.461 --> 00:18:16.560
So like when you go in for those money shots,

302
00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:19.350
those magic emotional moments where you're having,
like for instance,

303
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.600
a quill is reacting to,
to rock,

304
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:23.430
and when he sees them in the prison for the first time and he's like,

305
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:25.770
you sees the cybernetic enhancements on his back,
he sees it.

306
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:29.820
This is a creature that's not,
not just,
uh,
uh,
tough,
uh,
you know,

307
00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:33.720
little little guy with a machine gun,
but actually like a living,

308
00:18:33.721 --> 00:18:37.620
breathing creature who feels stuff and who's like probably lonely.
Like you,

309
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:38.880
you develop empathy.

310
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.330
And that's all because I'm watching Sean walking into essentially create that

311
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:43.800
performance just so that I can react to it.

312
00:18:43.801 --> 00:18:47.310
So like depending on the in and then sometimes you'd have like an led light or

313
00:18:47.311 --> 00:18:50.480
an eyeline or if it's a big wide shot we might have,
it wasn't nothing.

314
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.750
<v 1>We don't have some tennis balls.
Every,
there was time for tennis balls.
Yeah.</v>

315
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.381
And Tim Times.

316
00:18:54.381 --> 00:18:58.490
Chris has his own tennis ball and I had my own tennis ball and they had separate

317
00:18:58.491 --> 00:18:59.031
trailers.

318
00:18:59.031 --> 00:19:04.010
They kind of didn't get along and so I tennis balls and I get along.
Yeah,

319
00:19:04.011 --> 00:19:05.360
we'd have different islands.
So like if,

320
00:19:05.361 --> 00:19:10.130
if this plant didn't exist right here and we need to look like we're looking at

321
00:19:10.131 --> 00:19:10.221
it,

322
00:19:10.221 --> 00:19:14.390
I'd be looking at the young lady here in the black and in rose dress in between

323
00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.020
those two individuals and I'd be looking somewhere over there

324
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.590
and grew.
It would be licking his shoulder.

325
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.260
Now when you were,
when you were watching this stuff,
were they like,

326
00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:29.720
did you accidentally here are the other guys I am?

327
00:19:29.721 --> 00:19:30.830
Groups were like during those off

328
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:35.510
<v 3>never.
I never heard any I am Groot.
I just,
it was just wide open.</v>

329
00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:41.040
It was a really special experience for me because I was able to take my kids

330
00:19:41.451 --> 00:19:46.040
into the Adr booth.
And so my kids were,

331
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.900
even before I saw the movie,
My kids were already imitating both of them.

332
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:56.300
Literally,
my three year old son was saying,
star Lord,
man.

333
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.760
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

334
00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.050
<v 3>I mean it was at,</v>

335
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:05.180
my daughter runs around acting like she's Kamora now and they already know each

336
00:20:05.381 --> 00:20:09.940
other.
So it's,
it's a surreal thing.
Such a good experience.
Such a,

337
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.720
it's one of those,
you all saw the movie.
Oh,
see,
you all saw this move.

338
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.790
<v 1>What did you think in the movie?</v>

339
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:24.350
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

340
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.850
<v 3>call it a gift movie.</v>

341
00:20:28.851 --> 00:20:32.420
I call it a gift movie because you have to gift it to someone.

342
00:20:32.421 --> 00:20:34.070
You want to share it with someone.

343
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.880
You want to take every kid in your neighborhood.
Did this movie

344
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.390
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

345
00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.790
<v 1>first of all on guardians too.
Okay,
thanks.
That's awesome.
Alrighty.</v>

346
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:52.840
So my question is,
when you came in a bit later,

347
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:56.440
so is the press junket really how you're getting to know these guys and are you

348
00:20:56.441 --> 00:20:57.274
going to be doing

349
00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:02.120
<v 3>onset stuff for two or a very,
very good question.
Uh,</v>

350
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:06.980
I've known Zoe for many years.
Um,
so it was,

351
00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.530
Zoe was kind of a comfort zone coming into this.

352
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:14.110
<v 1>I directed a web series at some of the episodes of a web series at Venn created</v>

353
00:21:14.111 --> 00:21:17.140
called the ropes.
My sister and I were,

354
00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.660
were directed three or four episodes of that.

355
00:21:19.661 --> 00:21:22.450
So that's how we know Ben and his family.

356
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.710
<v 3>And Chris,
I met on the Junket,
I met,
I met Brad,</v>

357
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.750
I met Chris before I met Bradley Cooper.
I mean I literally,

358
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:36.751
I met Bradley Cooper backstage at one of the talk shows and uh,

359
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:41.650
but I felt like I knew him because I saw him in the Adr booth and I'm playing

360
00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:45.220
off of them.
But it is surreal.
It's,
it's kind of a,

361
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:48.430
I play a tree.

362
00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:53.390
<v 1>I mean I guess there are no rules tree without seeming wooden.</v>

363
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.650
It's strange.
I guess I'm going for that wooden performance.

364
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:03.320
I mean I look at trees.
Did you got a sec guys?

365
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.300
<v 3>You've seen the movie.
You have to tell me,</v>

366
00:22:06.301 --> 00:22:07.920
you look at trees a little bit different.

367
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.110
<v 1>Not so well,</v>

368
00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.300
you're not so ashamed of your tree hugger parents anymore.

369
00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:19.400
I mean it's a new world.
Did anyone planted tree after they saw the movie?

370
00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.610
Not much to ask.
Let's take one from the,

371
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.390
a super nerdy one from the dory here.

372
00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:30.650
Give every member of the team whatever weapons he or she wants.

373
00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.760
Who would win in a battle royale slash hunger game scenario and why

374
00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:41.420
taught us the puck?
Be constantly tossing the Avengers.
Now what?

375
00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.120
Let's just make this,
who would win in a fight?
You guys are the Avengers.

376
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:50.650
Are We uh,
do we get to use our spaceship?
Yeah.

377
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.080
Cause cause iron man would be able to,
wouldn't be,
I mean like I think,

378
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:56.720
well he gets to wear his suit.
He gets to wear a suit.
Right?
So yeah,

379
00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:02.390
I can only take like his girlfriend Natalie Portman.

380
00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:07.970
Yes.
Does it take place on earth or in space?
In space.

381
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:12.830
We,
we win.
You would win the suit.
You,
you can,

382
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:14.960
well we have more.
Yeah,
we have,
I think,

383
00:23:14.961 --> 00:23:18.200
well I think the deciding factor would probably be rocket because like he would,

384
00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.393
you know,

385
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:24.260
he would take Tony Stark's shoot apart and like guild like a nuclear bomb out of

386
00:23:24.261 --> 00:23:27.890
it or something.
And then they also have a god.
So yeah,

387
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:32.330
you would obviously dismantle Thor because,
uh,
we also have a god

388
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:42.860
that we would win,
but it's not

389
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:46.520
be the deadliest woman in the galaxy.

390
00:23:46.521 --> 00:23:50.670
So it's true Susie thing that we would win because they're all human.

391
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.700
They all Taryn.
Um,
except for Thor and um,
you know,

392
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:57.853
we are,

393
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:02.950
well [inaudible] he's such a nice guy.

394
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.610
Rocket would kill Bruce Banner.

395
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.780
He would wait for the hope to stop like slippers,
banners,

396
00:24:10.781 --> 00:24:11.614
throat and then it would be done.

397
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:17.230
You guys are writing a movie [inaudible] crossover.

398
00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:22.150
They all die in the first three minutes.
I'm sorry.
[inaudible]

399
00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.730
did you guys ever start like pitching ideas like that?

400
00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.180
I thought this was a creative meeting.
You guys,

401
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.870
this is all testing really well,
thank you.

402
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.570
<v 2>We throw around ideas,
we pitched ideas,
but you know,
they don't listen.</v>

403
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:47.230
<v 1>Guardians [inaudible] what do you think would happen?</v>

404
00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.470
Ready all at once.
Everyone goes,

405
00:24:55.150 --> 00:25:00.150
I'm hooked on a feeling they want from the gentleman over there.

406
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.710
<v 2>Um,
so I've heard you're really into dungeons and dragons,</v>

407
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.400
so I have two questions.

408
00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:13.080
What character do you play and would you be willing to join our group?

409
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.760
<v 3>You know,
it's whenever anyone asks me to join their campaign,</v>

410
00:25:21.761 --> 00:25:25.810
there's a good old feeling I have where I feel like,
you know,

411
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.160
I'm not alone in the world.

412
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:29.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

413
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:32.120
<v 3>And it's okay to be a Dweeb.
Um,
I,</v>

414
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:37.750
I played a lot of code and I played the,

415
00:25:38.421 --> 00:25:42.380
my most famous character you might've read about,
which was my witch hunter,

416
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.000
my Haftarah,
which hunter?

417
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.920
The irony is I'm about to next month to a movie called the witch hunter.

418
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.320
Kind of freaky.
I didn't,

419
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:57.790
I never thought in a million years when I was rolling that 20 sided die 20

420
00:25:58.281 --> 00:26:01.850
something years ago that Hollywood would make a movie about to which center.

421
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.750
But that's another story.
Um,
uh,

422
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.110
and yet how,
where are you playing in on the east coast?

423
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:13.730
<v 2>Well,
we actually do it over video chat.
You are doing video chat?
Yeah.</v>

424
00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:18.890
So,
um,
we've got one guy down in,
uh,
North Carolina a and,

425
00:26:18.891 --> 00:26:21.730
t we'll video in and are using modules.

426
00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.040
It's mostly second edition rules,

427
00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:29.270
but they have some holdovers from the first edition.
Um,
so yeah.

428
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:33.310
<v 1>Okay.
Thinking about it,
I mean we played with</v>

429
00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:36.070
<v 3>Arcana,
we played with everything.</v>

430
00:26:36.071 --> 00:26:39.110
I mean that's where the Whitsundays which under wasn't created by Gary Gygax

431
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:39.944
says,
you know,

432
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.060
it was an aftermarket books that we were trying to incorporate and create new

433
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.090
games and try to create the,

434
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.510
<v 1>it was a special time.</v>

435
00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.590
D And d was a special time.

436
00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.160
Yeah.
We might have to get into that.
We might have to get into that.

437
00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.110
I can get into that man.

438
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:03.370
Do you know that Gary Guy Jakks as

439
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:12.570
break out sessions?
I'll tell you later.

440
00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.110
<v 2>You,
um,
there's,
so try to look at,
you know,</v>

441
00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:23.170
the mythology of star Lord and it looks like there's a whole lot of different

442
00:27:23.171 --> 00:27:25.750
stories and uh,
origins stuff.

443
00:27:25.751 --> 00:27:27.960
Did you read everything you can get your hands on or were you like,

444
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.200
I'm just going to read,

445
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:33.870
I'm just going to read the words on the script when the camera's on.
No,
no,
no.

446
00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.370
It was someone who was somewhere in between the two.
I like,
it wasn't like,

447
00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.290
you know,
I think it takes a little bit for me,
and this is going to sound crazy,

448
00:27:41.291 --> 00:27:45.340
but it was the same thing when I did,
uh,
the movie moneyball.

449
00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:46.960
There's a book that it's based on,

450
00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:48.730
and I remember reading the script and I was like,

451
00:27:48.731 --> 00:27:50.710
this is just such a great version of this story.

452
00:27:50.711 --> 00:27:55.450
I don't want to come into this questioning,
uh,
questioning the script.

453
00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.360
I don't want to come in and say,
well,
you know,
in fact this,

454
00:27:58.361 --> 00:28:01.240
this time is a little off cause it just works so well as a story.

455
00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.610
I thought the same thing with the script.
Um,

456
00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.050
a lot of the guardians of the galaxy,

457
00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.020
the incarnations of the guardians of the galaxy,
it doesn't,

458
00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.260
don't include star Lord,

459
00:28:08.261 --> 00:28:11.410
like the ones that I had happened to coincidentally collected as a kid.

460
00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.570
They didn't have a star Lord in them.

461
00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.770
And so there were some Star-Lord comics out there.
But for me,
what was important,

462
00:28:17.771 --> 00:28:20.440
what the thing that grabbed me in the script that in creating this character was

463
00:28:20.441 --> 00:28:22.690
that he and I are kind of the same person.

464
00:28:22.691 --> 00:28:27.691
I mean we're both born in 1979 so in 1988 we were nine years old and we are both

465
00:28:28.511 --> 00:28:32.800
have all the same pop culture references and icons,
which for him is like his,

466
00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:35.770
his,
it's who he is.
I mean he was,

467
00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.640
he was taken away from Earth at nine years old and brought out into space and

468
00:28:39.641 --> 00:28:40.510
given an opportunity to,

469
00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:44.320
to be an adventurer and he's like sort of running from this traumatic thing that

470
00:28:44.321 --> 00:28:45.154
happened to them.

471
00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.280
And so what he wants to do is just create a hero that he wants people to think

472
00:28:50.411 --> 00:28:52.450
that he is star Lord and all of the,

473
00:28:52.451 --> 00:28:56.380
everything he knows about life is based on the movies that I watched as a kid.

474
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:58.480
The movie,
The music that I listened to,

475
00:28:58.481 --> 00:29:01.030
the dance moves that I knew and it's like this kid,

476
00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.870
this guy is basically what me is nine years old would want to be if I was given

477
00:29:04.871 --> 00:29:06.490
carte blanche to be an adventure and space.

478
00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.060
So that's where I started mining for information is like what did I like the

479
00:29:10.061 --> 00:29:11.350
Kevin Bacon line that was,

480
00:29:11.351 --> 00:29:15.010
that was a result of collaboration and footloose that was never in the script.

481
00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:18.340
Like these things like that or like yeah cause I loved footloose and I was like,

482
00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.020
when he's that says she won't dance,

483
00:29:20.021 --> 00:29:23.830
maybe it should be this ideology like really loves movies is like the legends

484
00:29:23.831 --> 00:29:27.520
that create him.
You know,
cause he's like,
he's gotten,

485
00:29:27.521 --> 00:29:29.590
he hasn't been to earth since he was nine,
you know,

486
00:29:29.591 --> 00:29:31.270
so he gets to kind of be whoever he wants to be.

487
00:29:31.271 --> 00:29:35.230
So that's really where I started kind of developing or we collaborate,

488
00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.560
collaborate in developing who this guy would be is just who I was at that age.

489
00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.080
Yeah.
When Gomorrah says like,
just like Kevin Bacon,

490
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.130
think that was like the biggest

491
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.590
<v 1>laugh.
Yeah.
That sounds amazing to that.</v>

492
00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:47.560
And I went in there cause I was waiting to hear a little foot on the soundtrack.

493
00:29:47.561 --> 00:29:51.710
I was like there's that song.
Yeah,
no did you,
did they plan all those songs out?

494
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.610
<v 2>Soundtrack is amazing.
Did you like know what the mix tape was going to be?</v>

495
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.210
I knew,
yeah.

496
00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.760
That was the first thing I requested after reading the script was I was like

497
00:29:57.761 --> 00:30:00.370
Dora James,
send me this mix tape.
Because you know,

498
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:03.550
in the script he had written specifically each song that would play in each

499
00:30:03.551 --> 00:30:05.700
scene.
And that lasted throughout from the first script,

500
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.540
from his first draft all the way to the end.

501
00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:11.080
Like those songs were in there and planned.
So I made him send me the mix tape,

502
00:30:11.081 --> 00:30:14.020
which includes all those songs plus many more.
Cause I figured,
you know,

503
00:30:14.021 --> 00:30:17.380
if you have like one cassette tape and it's all you listened to for 20 years,

504
00:30:17.381 --> 00:30:19.330
you're going to,
it's going to become part of you,
you know?

505
00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:23.890
So I listened to that thing.
I mean no less than a hundred times,

506
00:30:23.891 --> 00:30:27.090
but probably more than a hundred times.
Wow.
So in,
so in the SQL we're going to,

507
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:30.910
we're going to hear that second mix tape.
Yeah,
we'll hit they're awesome.

508
00:30:30.911 --> 00:30:31.820
Mix Volume.
Phoenix.

509
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.380
There was no scene where you'd like trying to unwind it with the pencil.

510
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.360
<v 1>Rewind.
I know</v>

511
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.670
these guys have a really busy day.
Let's pick one more if we can.

512
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.360
<v 3>Uh,
so</v>

513
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:48.560
<v 1>Sandoz has already been introducing Avengers and now he's been shown in</v>

514
00:30:48.561 --> 00:30:53.140
guardians.
Right.
So are there any plans already being made for teaming a boot,

515
00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:54.410
the Avengers in the guardians?

516
00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.400
<v 3>Probably for the next version as
well.</v>

517
00:30:58.401 --> 00:31:03.100
James Gunn has talked about that already.
He's been pretty open about,
uh,

518
00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.910
cross collaboration of Avengers.
And is that what you're asking?
Yeah.

519
00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:08.540
Yeah,

520
00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.220
<v 4>that's,
that's what I think I would want to see.</v>

521
00:31:10.221 --> 00:31:14.440
I don't ever want to see the Guardian's fight the Avengers.
Yeah.
Um,

522
00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:18.560
I want to see them sort of fighting together maybe against their nose because I

523
00:31:18.561 --> 00:31:20.030
do believe that then I'll just sort of,

524
00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:24.230
isn't the animals like the overall enemy of everybody,
right.

525
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:28.660
<v 1>You don't know.
I think,
I think like,</v>

526
00:31:28.661 --> 00:31:29.590
isn't he your dad?

527
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:33.521
<v 2>I want to go.
Right.
Like,</v>

528
00:31:33.521 --> 00:31:36.640
what I think is so cool about the guardians of the galaxy is it opens up the

529
00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:37.474
universe.

530
00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:42.160
So like instead of like taking these new things and bringing them right back to

531
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.150
the stories we already know,

532
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:47.080
I think it's like open it up like see what other corners of the galaxy we can

533
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:50.110
discover,
bring in characters like that weren't,
you know,

534
00:31:50.111 --> 00:31:52.990
bringing in characters there were from some of the guardians of the Galaxy,

535
00:31:52.991 --> 00:31:55.900
like explore yon to explore the art and the origins more of these characters.

536
00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.180
And if it is thanatos explore the infinity gauntlet,

537
00:31:58.181 --> 00:32:01.700
like how many of these stones is he going to get and who does that open up like

538
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.990
the universe expands,
you know,
and looking out on it,

539
00:32:04.991 --> 00:32:07.660
we want to take these characters and bring them into the Avengers and we want to

540
00:32:07.661 --> 00:32:09.820
like have them be all in the same movie together.
It's like,
no,

541
00:32:09.821 --> 00:32:11.740
fuck that and make it fucking a hundred movies.

542
00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.330
<v 0>Do you know what I mean?
They ended up crossing over break</v>

543
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.120
or are we out of time?

544
00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:25.850
<v 1>We are out of time officially.
Please stay our beloved guests for joining us.</v>

545
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:30.990
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

546
00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.290
<v 1>one more.
Why?
No post credits scene.
There is a post credit scene.</v>

547
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:53.350
There is a post credit scene and it's not.

548
00:32:53.351 --> 00:32:55.150
It's not going to be in any of the advanced screenings.

549
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.700
None of the press meetings,
hey,
don't groan.

550
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.310
You want the post credit scene?
It's going to cost you 13 bucks.
Yeah,

551
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.180
and see this and maybe a little more in Imax and you'll see it,

552
00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:12.010
but I know what it is and no one else does.
Yes,
I do.

553
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:16.250
And it's going to blow your mind.
Go back.
Just go back to,

554
00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:20.740
I'm going to sneak it into a theater at the end of it.
All right.
Once again,

555
00:33:20.741 --> 00:33:21.970
thank you guys so much for joining us.

556
