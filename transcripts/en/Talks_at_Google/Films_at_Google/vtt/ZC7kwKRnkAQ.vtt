00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.690
<v 0>Okay,</v>

<v 1>so this full productions facility,
we're really,</v>

6
00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:25.100
really excited here because we're doing something brand new that we haven't done

7
00:00:25.101 --> 00:00:30.030

We're doing a youtube three 60 degree live stream.

8
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:32.210
So we're live right now across the world.

9
00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:35.270
And these two cameras that you see here are 360 degrees.

10
00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:39.620
So for you guys watching online,
what we're going to be doing here today is,
uh,

11
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.150
interviewing the cast to finding dory.

12
00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:42.530
So we're gonna bring him up here in just a second.

13
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.350
So if you guys watching online,
if you're watching on your mobile device,

14
00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:49.670
just take your phone,
just look around and complete 360 degrees.

15
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.220
Then we got some fun stuff here in the back.

16
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.870
You can look around the production facility,
um,
and then four,

17
00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:58.340
if you're on desktop,
just take your mouse,
click the video,
move it around,

18
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.550
and that's it.
So,
all right,
we're going to meet the cast.

19
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.500
<v 0>Well,
let's bring him out,</v>

20
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.560
<v 1>ladies and gentlemen,
the cast,
the voice cast and creative team behind Disney.</v>

21
00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:10.030
Pixar is finding dory.

22
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.630
<v 0>Ready?
Welcome guys.
Hello.
Thanks so much for coming here.</v>

23
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.600
<v 1>Um,
so,
uh,
finding dory out June 17.</v>

24
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:51.460
Thank you guys all for being here.
Uh,
Ellen,
welcome.
Uh,
so,

25
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.480
uh,
this is a movie completely about your character Dory,

26
00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.250
and you've been characters as well,
right?
Uh,
thank you.

27
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.480
Uh,
and uh,
but so York,
yeah,
go ahead.

28
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.990
I've just found that out.
I'm dory

29
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.110
and so,
but you were huge cheerleader for this film for years on your,

30
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.183
uh,
on your shows.

31
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.440
<v 2>Thank God I had a show.
We would not be sitting here had I not had a talk show.</v>

32
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.690
<v 0>Talk about</v>

33
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.710
<v 2>yeah.
To intimidation.
Yeah.
He finally called and said uncle,
he's like a,</v>

34
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.190
all right,
we'll do it.
We'll do it.
It was,
they said I was just kidding.
Yeah.

35
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.760
Where was like,
no,
I'm not interested.
No,
it was a,

36
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:39.270
it was started as is.
I seriously wanted a sequel.
I was like,

37
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.640
they make sequels for every other successful film.

38
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:45.420
We want an academy award for crying out loud.
So where's the sequel?

39
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.230
And then it just got to be a joke and then I just gave up and I was just,
well,

40
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:52.530
I'm just going to keep going because it's funny.
But uh,
and then it worked out

41
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.850
<v 1>and then 13 years later,
so Andrea,
you brought this back 13 years later.</v>

42
00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:58.530
So when did that idea,
besides Ellen pushing?
Yeah,

43
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.080
when you make these movies that you see them so many times.

44
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:05.740
So I'd seen finding any more about a hundred times before 2003 even finished.

45
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.520
So you just stop watching.
And about eight years later,

46
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:13.240
it was 2011 they wanted to put it out in three d they put me in a theater and I

47
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:16.030
watched it like an audience member for the first time in a long time.

48
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.780
And I walked out so worried about dory.
I was just like,

49
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.690
she's gonna Forget Marlon Nimo.
She won't know how to get back.

50
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.130
And I don't know where she's from.
And I think that,
yeah,

51
00:03:25.131 --> 00:03:27.730
she's got abandonment issues that I know about as a writer.

52
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.530
So it like suddenly it,
it's just all,

53
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:33.960
it just all started to bubble up after that.
It's,
it's unbelievable.
And it's,

54
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.120
it's wonderful thing.
I've seen it.
It's,
it's

55
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.610
<v 3>otherwise,
as long as you're here.
Yeah.
Make the third one before we die.</v>

56
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.563
<v 4>Oh,
okay.</v>

57
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.350
<v 1>Oh
well I'm,</v>

58
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.850
I want to get to you actually about your character to Marlin Marlin's back.
Um,

59
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:51.930
and we have the new voice of,
uh,
Nimmo birth up there.
Hayden Hayden,

60
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.803
say hello to everyone.

61
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.140
<v 4>Hayden Hayden's actually 30</v>

62
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.270
ladies were really good.
Nine year old,
like you guys didn't know yet.

63
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.930
<v 1>And so l a Alberta,
your character Marlin is back obviously.</v>

64
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.040
And it's interesting cause it was really,
really great to see you.

65
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.260
Now I have a completely different dynamic with your son Nemo.

66
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.320
And now Marlon is much more protected over Dory.

67
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.820
Who wants to go find your family?

68
00:04:19.821 --> 00:04:22.790
So can you talk a little bit about where Merryn is at the stage and,

69
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.120
<v 3>well,
I know he doesn't agree,</v>

70
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.000
but I thought that Marlin was in love with Dory.

71
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.960
<v 4>I mean it,
that I just figured that,
you know,</v>

72
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.300
whatever it makes the seats were for,
y'all heard Marlin's lonely and,
and,
uh,

73
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.280
you hadn't found anyone else and she's lovely and you know,
why not?

74
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.480
But,
uh,
I think we have the next seat.
I was just gonna say there's your third.

75
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.710
<v 3>Um,
but you know,
we,
it was great.
I Hayden's terrific.</v>

76
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.600
Alexandra Gould,
who played the first one,
he's 42.

77
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.350
I actually was in weeds with him after he was neem.

78
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.340
Roy played his grandfather and weeds.

79
00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:11.450
So that was sort of interesting talking about pot with Nemo

80
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.413
<v 4>know,</v>

81
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.370
<v 3>but,
uh,
Hayden's wonderful and,
you know,
like a modern,
divorced family.</v>

82
00:05:17.371 --> 00:05:18.250
Here's a new kid.

83
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.643
<v 4>There we go.</v>

84
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.530
<v 1>It's going great.
Uh,
so ty and Katelyn,
you guys play new characters in the film.</v>

85
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:30.580
So we have,
uh,
Bailey,
which is your character tigh and then designate.

86
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:31.960
So tell us about your characters.

87
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.020
<v 4>We're buddies.
Yeah.</v>

88
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.470
<v 1>Uh,
basically,
uh,
Bailey and destiny are,</v>

89
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.240
uh,
two people,
the Dorian lists to help her find her folks.

90
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.863
<v 4>People.</v>

91
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.200
There are two people dressed in whale and the whale shark costumes.

92
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.070
It's like an abstract kind of a thing we do.
Is did you dress in

93
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.720
<v 5>wheel costumes when you recorded this?</v>

94
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.030
Didn't need to do or the only live back moving.
It was exhausting.

95
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.800
It has been so hot.
It's really hot.
Yeah.

96
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.220
You're Bailey's a big Beluga whale and a destiny is a giant whale shark and

97
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:16.520
they're kind of a brother,

98
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:18.500
sister relationship and then get on each other's nerves,

99
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:22.850
but they're very sweet and they ended up,
uh,
trying to help dory out.

100
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:24.101
<v 1>Great.</v>

101
00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:26.560
And we have an exclusive clip we're going to play here in just a few minutes

102
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.700
with your two characters.
So what,
bring that up here in a little bit.
Um,
but Alan,

103
00:06:30.701 --> 00:06:33.730
so you know,
you're returning to the character of Dory.
Um,
it's a really,

104
00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:37.280
really emotional story about her trying to find her parents.
So,
um,
you know,

105
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.410
when you first read the script,

106
00:06:38.411 --> 00:06:41.470
was there anything that you were able to bring to the scripts or tell Andrew,

107
00:06:41.471 --> 00:06:43.870
I'm looking for this and the character.
I want to go this direction.

108
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.320
<v 5>Um,
no.
I,
I mean this guy is a genius.
This,
I,</v>

109
00:06:49.321 --> 00:06:52.140
I'm not going to tell him how to write a script.
Um,
I mean,

110
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:54.660
when I was in the room I changed a lot,
but I,
yeah,

111
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.250
<v 6>no,</v>

112
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.860
<v 5>but you know,
that's what's great about it.
The script is fantastic.</v>

113
00:06:58.861 --> 00:07:03.540
The script is what it is,
but it's,
it's open and free enough that you do,

114
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.490
you know,
50 takes and,

115
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.150
and you can then you just do whatever you want to do and he chooses,

116
00:07:09.151 --> 00:07:12.840
they choose whatever it turns out to be the best one.

117
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.370
So it's always the first,

118
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.370
<v 1>but you know,
it's four years writing this thing.
I mean,
so we're doing,</v>

119
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.150
but there was over 10 drafts of this story done over that time and they know

120
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:26.240
that what we're working with them and you also adapt to the actors once their

121
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:28.070
cast.
So you're,
you're,
you know,

122
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:31.460
I'm learning just as much from them and we're rewriting to play to their

123
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:35.490
strengths so that it's like hopefully comfortable shoes almost.
And they,
and,

124
00:07:35.491 --> 00:07:39.680
and you just,
it becomes a little symbiotic at a point.
And Eugene,

125
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:44.300
you play Charlie.
Yes,
that's correct.
Other of Dory.
Yeah.

126
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.650
So what can you tell us about Charlie and,
oh,

127
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.490
well it was a,
it was exciting to play a,

128
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.240
a dad who has a child not doing strange things with pies.

129
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.153
<v 6>Uh,</v>

130
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.430
<v 1>that was a big plus.</v>

131
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:03.830
<v 6>Okay.</v>

132
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.290
<v 1>That was a,
that was like your first question and the,</v>

133
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.860
<v 5>yeah,
write that out.
Yes.</v>

134
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.030
<v 1>Does dory eat baked goods?
No.</v>

135
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.170
<v 6>Uh,</v>

136
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.920
<v 1>no.
It was kind of a,
it was a very charming,
well,
I was just,</v>

137
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:22.280
I was honored to be included in this thing,
no question about that.

138
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.290
And playing a dad,
uh,
you know,
uh,
have a child who is,
you know,

139
00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:32.210
kind of memory impaired,
so to speak.
So there,
you know,
it's,

140
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.710
it's kind of a very funny,
very amusing and,

141
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.230
and there's something very heartfelt about playing,
um,
you know,
uh,
Dad,
uh,

142
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.860
um,
where,
whose child is off somewhere.

143
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.070
You don't know what happened and you know,

144
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:53.960
will they ever be able to,
you know,
how will they function because the,
the,
the,

145
00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:58.350
she has no memory,
a short term memory.
So,
you know,

146
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.900
um,
it's,
uh,

147
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.170
it was interesting and complicated and fun and exciting.

148
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.160
I mean that's a real powerful part too.
And he didn't know,

149
00:09:07.161 --> 00:09:09.120
I'll get right back to you.
But Andrew and Lindsey,

150
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:11.250
when you're creating this story about you,
you,

151
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:14.850
you use a very much of a comedic effect in,
um,

152
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.700
in finding nemo where you have Doerries character with short term memory loss,

153
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.510
but it's a real disability in life and you really,

154
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:23.700
really hit it home in this film.
So was that,

155
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:25.650
I mean cause she's really struggling with that.

156
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:27.510
You see in the beginning of the film you see it throughout.

157
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:30.220
So was that a point that you really wanted to drive home and yeah.

158
00:09:30.221 --> 00:09:31.230
Well she's the main character.

159
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:33.990
Once you have a main care cause it has to be more depth to them and they,

160
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:37.380
and you sadly are sort of forced into a bit of a straight man role when you were

161
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:38.490
in the main character role.

162
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.390
The thing that it was always great about stories that I always knew that tragic

163
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:43.850
side of her that was always,
uh,

164
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.420
I always knew her optimism and her care giving and her candy spirit was somewhat

165
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:52.710
her armor to protect herself from the sense of loss she had.

166
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.850
So it was just sort of flipping that on this film.

167
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.110
<v 5>It was,
it was great too,
because I remember the day that you,</v>

168
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.910
there was this the scene where I had to explain what short term memory loss was

169
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.120
and how to explain it.

170
00:10:04.121 --> 00:10:08.550
And that was one of the Times that I could just go and talk about what,

171
00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:11.420
what to,
how to explain it to s someone's hurt.

172
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.590
<v 7>I mean,
it was funny and heartbreaking at the same time at the same time.</v>

173
00:10:14.591 --> 00:10:17.860
And I think that's kind of what the movie really leans into on this one that

174
00:10:17.861 --> 00:10:21.700
it's like it's charming and,
and that is dory.
And we kind of,
you know,

175
00:10:21.701 --> 00:10:25.900
we were always trying to walk that line between the charm that it was dory and

176
00:10:25.901 --> 00:10:30.730
that is Ellen.
And then also the,
you know,
the kind of tragedy really of it.

177
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:34.240
And,
and making sure that we never lean too,
too far one way or the other.

178
00:10:34.241 --> 00:10:36.730
So that we felt like it was being really true to this character.

179
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.450
<v 1>No,
it was a delicate balance.
I mean that's what it was like in the beginning,</v>

180
00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:42.240
the movie,
you first,
your initial reaction is to laugh.
It's like,
oh,
that's dory.

181
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.230
And then it starts getting deeper and you're like,
Oh God,
I don't like,
it's,

182
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.990
it's really,
really intense.
So,
uh,
Hayden,
the new voice and Nimo,
um,

183
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.670
pretty exciting from my hometown of Chicago.
So welcome here to California.
Um,

184
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.370
so was it like to be an email?

185
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.850
<v 7>Um,
uh,
it's very fun being able to pretend that I'm just a cute little fishing.</v>

186
00:11:01.851 --> 00:11:05.930
I'm not.
Yes.
And I'm not just me.

187
00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:10.931
I actually get to pretend that I'm something that's a very good idea and very

188
00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:12.254
fun to do.

189
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.980
<v 1>Yeah,
no,
it's your,
we were wonderful in it.
It's crazy.
Cause I was,</v>

190
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.290
when I was watching it and I actually didn't realize the first one,

191
00:11:18.291 --> 00:11:19.640
the trailer is that they got a new voice.
I was like,

192
00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.490
well of course it is 13 years later.
And you,

193
00:11:21.491 --> 00:11:24.200
you pull your sound exactly like him.
It's it,
it's great.

194
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.580
<v 5>He's like the Darren of bewitched,
you know,</v>

195
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:31.520
like he had to show your folks watch original Darren and it's really tough.

196
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.860
<v 1>And so a lot of this takes place in,
which is a great thing cause it,</v>

197
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:37.920
you can find an email,

198
00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:41.250
you see the characters going through open water and oceans and everything and

199
00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:41.911
you have different investments.

200
00:11:41.911 --> 00:11:46.650
But now you're in a marine institute and it's so for you,
you,
Lindsey and Andrew,

201
00:11:46.651 --> 00:11:47.520
when you guys are there,

202
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.610
there's a lot of creative ways of how the characters get around the park.

203
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.940
But what was one of the most complicated scenes as a producer?
Lindsay,

204
00:11:54.941 --> 00:11:57.510
you're just like,
really?
I think

205
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.480
<v 7>honestly that was the,
it was when Andrew came and was like,</v>

206
00:12:00.481 --> 00:12:05.130
so we've come up with this new character and he's an octopus.

207
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:09.090
And I said,
I'm sorry,
what?
And he said,
he's an octopus boy.
He's a step to puss.

208
00:12:09.091 --> 00:12:13.140
So you get one less technical.
He is a Hank the octopus.

209
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:18.260
No doubt is the hardest character I think anybody at Pixar has ever done and

210
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:20.040
took two years.
I mean,

211
00:12:20.041 --> 00:12:23.730
normally our characters take kind of nine months start to finish and this took

212
00:12:23.731 --> 00:12:27.780
two and a,
he took two and a half years just to build and rig.
Um,

213
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.370
and so that was one where I was like,
really?
Does it have to be an octopus?

214
00:12:32.371 --> 00:12:35.620
Could you maybe not?
Huh?
Maybe turtle.
No,

215
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.090
already have that now the front plastic,

216
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.780
the first shot took six months to anime and we're,
we're never going to get

217
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:45.370
<v 1>finished at this rate.
But,
uh,
fortunately ready,
got smarter and faster.
Okay.</v>

218
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.490
Gotcha.
And what environments where some of the most complicated ones,

219
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:49.660
cause you see them in pipes,

220
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.310
<v 7>it's in the tanks.
If you watch finding Nemo,</v>

221
00:12:53.311 --> 00:12:55.860
you'll notice that there was like only three shots I think,

222
00:12:55.861 --> 00:13:00.210
where we allowed Andrew to put the camera in the corner of the tank of the

223
00:13:00.211 --> 00:13:00.871
dentist office.

224
00:13:00.871 --> 00:13:04.590
And it's because of the reflection refraction talking to people at Google and

225
00:13:04.591 --> 00:13:08.670
youtube.
So I feel like I'm in a people you understand that.
Um,
so it's,

226
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.360
and it's really hard.
I mean we,
we intentionally didn't do that because the,

227
00:13:12.361 --> 00:13:15.190
the computer couldn't do it and we had to direct it and fake it,

228
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:19.300
all the lighting.
And so the new renderer are actually allowed us to do much,

229
00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:22.090
much more in.
And we took both do it everywhere.
We basically,

230
00:13:22.091 --> 00:13:24.480
he did it everywhere.
I'm like,
yes,

231
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.150
every possible container has blast and reflection in itself.

232
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.360
<v 1>Gotcha.
Um,
and so,
you know,
are there any,
you know,</v>

233
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.410
what I loved was,
you know,
I remember watching,

234
00:13:36.411 --> 00:13:40.610
I'm a huge Pixar fan animation fan and I love watching in the first one some of

235
00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:43.890
the making of it and you kind of tacked onto this um,

236
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.330
flashback thing and the first finding an email where you want to do flashbacks

237
00:13:47.331 --> 00:13:48.770
and kind of tell the story through that.

238
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.470
And it's a great plot device that you used here throughout the movie as well.

239
00:13:51.471 --> 00:13:52.760
The kind of tell Doris story.

240
00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.460
Was that something you immediately knew that you wanted to do?

241
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.030
Work that is going to 11th hour idea that saved our butts on this movie.

242
00:13:59.031 --> 00:14:02.090
We came up with it last fall,
but a lot of people don't know.

243
00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:05.060
Nima didn't come together till the last six or eight months.
Um,

244
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.490
like all the pieces were that we just didn't happen.
It didn't have them lines.

245
00:14:07.491 --> 00:14:07.790
Right.

246
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:11.420
And so I feel like this movie's in good hands in a weird way because it did the

247
00:14:11.421 --> 00:14:14.600
same pattern.
Um,
but yeah,
the first movie,

248
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.300
all that tragedy you see at the beginning of finding Nima,

249
00:14:17.301 --> 00:14:20.960
all that loss was actually flashbacks that were doled out and it just didn't

250
00:14:20.961 --> 00:14:24.170
work.
You didn't sympathize with Marlin,
but once we saw his tragedy at the front,

251
00:14:24.171 --> 00:14:28.340
we moved at all the fountains and suddenly all the lines we'd always had played

252
00:14:28.341 --> 00:14:32.270
fine.
Everybody empathized with them.
Um,
and then this was the reverse.

253
00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:35.210
We have too much information at the front and then when we doled it out and made

254
00:14:35.211 --> 00:14:38.720
it memories that dory or has and is triggered,
she goes,

255
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.230
it became like the inverse of the first movie in it.
And it just felt right.

256
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:43.543
It was Jason.
Yeah.

257
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.990
<v 7>You can take that into your own life.</v>

258
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.790
Start every conversation with your saddest story.
It.

259
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:52.883
<v 4>Okay.</v>

260
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:58.510
<v 1>And so now we're going to Q,
a,
uh,
exclusive clip here from finding dory.</v>

261
00:14:58.511 --> 00:14:59.350
So let's clear it up.

262
00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.990
<v 4>Okay.
Can you please keep it down over there?
My head hurts was that</v>

263
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.850
he was brought in with a head injury.
I know you're talking about me.

264
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.230
Destinee we can't use this.

265
00:15:11.231 --> 00:15:15.850
Echolocation but I've overheard the doctor's time writing every word you're

266
00:15:15.851 --> 00:15:18.070
saying about me.
What's echolocation?
Well,

267
00:15:18.071 --> 00:15:22.000
Bailey's head is supposed to put out a call and the echo helps him find objects

268
00:15:22.001 --> 00:15:26.020
far away.
Oh,
put.
Apparently he's still healing.

269
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.450
No,
I know you're talking about me.
I really can't echo like,
hey,

270
00:15:30.451 --> 00:15:31.390
I have this conversation again.

271
00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:35.680
I just hit my head very hard out there and see how it's going in his head is

272
00:15:35.681 --> 00:15:38.780
supposed to be big.
You're a Beluga.
Yeah.

273
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.790
<v 1>So ty and Katelyn,
those are your guys' characters.
Uh,
Bailey and destiny.</v>

274
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.630
Did you guys record it all together to get some of the dynamic and Improv?

275
00:15:53.631 --> 00:15:55.160
And we did.
That was,

276
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.690
<v 7>that was fun.
We got to do two or three together because you know,</v>

277
00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:00.910
mostly you just in there by yourself with these guys,

278
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.230
<v 4>right.
Again,</v>

279
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.980
<v 7>well we got to do a couple together and it was really fun cause it's,</v>

280
00:16:06.981 --> 00:16:10.220
we're actors,
we're used to working with these spies by the way,
are amazing.

281
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:15.060
<v 4>They're too smart for us though.
It's much.
I'm always looked on people.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

282
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.230
She was looking for an idiot.
That's your phone one.
That's right.

283
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:22.390
It makes me more comfortable.
It makes me feel smarter.
Um,
yeah,
that was actually,

284
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:26.380
that was new for me.
I,
I haven't done a ton of animation,

285
00:16:26.381 --> 00:16:30.520
but the chances to go in and be in the room with,
well,

286
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:35.140
Katelyn in particular who's so funny,
um,
it's all,
you know,

287
00:16:35.141 --> 00:16:38.200
the whole process is so collaborative.
Um,

288
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.140
obviously we're not really tinkering with any of the major writing,

289
00:16:41.141 --> 00:16:45.130
but these guys were just so smart and so much changes as you're doing it.

290
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.760
Um,
the,
when we were able to do it together,

291
00:16:48.761 --> 00:16:52.810
it really felt the freedom to play around a little bit and see what else was

292
00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:53.644
there.
Yeah.

293
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.440
<v 1>That's great.
So we're going to bring up our,
uh,</v>

294
00:16:56.441 --> 00:17:00.460
one of our youtube topgraders smoothing to ask some questions that he got from

295
00:17:00.461 --> 00:17:03.520
our social media.
Again,
social media handles.
So let's bring him up.

296
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.030
<v 4>Hi,
check,
check.
How's it going guys?
All right.</v>

297
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:15.040
So we asked a lot of our youtube subscribers and the youtube people's out there

298
00:17:15.041 --> 00:17:19.280
some questions and a lot of them were coming toward you.
Andrew.

299
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:23.120
They want to know how you go about selecting

300
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.830
<v 1>thing voices for your movies.
Oh,
well,
you know,</v>

301
00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.250
everybody knows the term that the camera loves them.
They're very photogenic.

302
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.370
But I like to say there's a term with a microphone.
Loves them.

303
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.870
They're people that just have voices that you can just hang a character on and

304
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.040
sitting in front of you.
Or five amazing example.
Six,
I'm sorry,

305
00:17:42.041 --> 00:17:43.540
I can't count today.
Six exam.

306
00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:47.800
<v 4>Was I the one you weren't thinking.
I wasn't thinking a year,
not loving time.</v>

307
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.950
There's five in front of,
you know,
for

308
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.630
one guy who just tried

309
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.930
<v 1>super hard.
Those are hard working guy.</v>

310
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.760
But it's true.
Like when you want it.
Like I,
I was,
uh,
started out as an animator.

311
00:18:03.761 --> 00:18:08.110
So I really recognize like when you hear a voice that you just can't,

312
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.510
you can't help a project,
a character on,
you can't help it.

313
00:18:10.511 --> 00:18:14.320
Like want to see a acting from out of,
out of,
out of,

314
00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.410
out of a different character.
It's a [inaudible].

315
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.660
And so you end up with these lists sometimes.
Um,
uh,

316
00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:25.990
Ellen herself as somebody I wasn't thinking of at the time when I was really an

317
00:18:25.991 --> 00:18:27.460
early days of writing on finding Nemo.

318
00:18:27.461 --> 00:18:30.670
And then I heard her off of the television set and boom,
you know,

319
00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.640
it's suddenly matched.
I had been a fan of Albert's,
you know,

320
00:18:33.641 --> 00:18:37.450
ever since I can remember watching going to all of his movies and listening to

321
00:18:37.451 --> 00:18:40.960
his comedy albums and sorry,
just waiting for the right role to fall for that.

322
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:42.760
And then Katelyn,
same thing.

323
00:18:42.761 --> 00:18:47.350
I'd sort of been a fan of her voice and tie and a Hayden I discovered and Eugene

324
00:18:47.351 --> 00:18:50.590
of all these are people that I've just been fans of hearing and I just go,

325
00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:51.371
they would be perfect,

326
00:18:51.371 --> 00:18:55.540
but you're just waiting for the right character that you're coming up with and

327
00:18:55.541 --> 00:18:57.700
hope that somebody else hasn't grabbed them before you do.

328
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.050
<v 4>What's the other thing too?
On Youtube?</v>

329
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:04.430
A lot of us are one man production teams and a lot of us do animations so

330
00:19:04.431 --> 00:19:07.280
there's a lot of people are wondering how do we start off anybody that wants to

331
00:19:07.281 --> 00:19:10.490
be involved with animation,
the process just out the gate.

332
00:19:10.491 --> 00:19:13.240
What would you recommend as far as programs for anybody starting out?
Okay.

333
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.320
<v 1>God,
I don't know.
I mean I'm too old now.
I don't,
I don't know.</v>

334
00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:19.170
I started out with Pencil and paper.
I still use pencil and paper.

335
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:20.400
I don't know if anybody knows what that is,

336
00:19:20.401 --> 00:19:25.380
but all of the school like stone age stuff.
Yeah.
All I can say is it's so easy.

337
00:19:25.381 --> 00:19:29.190
I mean,
now you can make a movie in your house.
Like,
like I get to steal stuff,

338
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.570
like when I did it,
you know,

339
00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:33.540
to like get them to get movies made and my backyard stuff and,

340
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.060
but so I'd just say like,
do it,
do you grab whatever you can and do it.

341
00:19:37.061 --> 00:19:39.690
Like there's nothing stopping you.
So just do it.

342
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.560
<v 4>Uh,
I mean this one was popping up a lot.
Uh,
we can go on to,
all right.</v>

343
00:19:44.561 --> 00:19:47.110
What about other animated Disney films?

344
00:19:47.111 --> 00:19:50.470
If you could be in any of those other animated Disney films,

345
00:19:50.471 --> 00:19:51.850
or what movie would you want to be in?

346
00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:56.090
<v 7>I am a huge fan of all the Pixar movies and particularly all of Andrew's movies.</v>

347
00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.380
I was a huge fan of Wally and all the toys stories,
those are just,

348
00:20:00.381 --> 00:20:05.210
I watched those before I had kids and then I,
my little boys love those movies.

349
00:20:05.211 --> 00:20:08.930
So those are the ones that are always on.
And so when I got the call about this,

350
00:20:08.931 --> 00:20:11.780
I was like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I don't care what I'm playing.
But yes,

351
00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.420
whenever I'd like to get the candlesticks

352
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.600
<v 1>go and building on the base.
Nice.</v>

353
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:24.010
Even the Broadway version?
No.
Matinees

354
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:27.460
<v 4>what,
what about you hate in any other movie,
Aladdin,
Lion King,</v>

355
00:20:27.461 --> 00:20:28.690
any of those that you'd want to be in?

356
00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.660
<v 1>Um,
I don't really know if I'd want to be in any other movie besides this one.</v>

357
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.780
<v 5>Good answer.
Yeah,
you're checking whale.</v>

358
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.220
<v 4>Buenas Ellen,
what about you?</v>

359
00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.110
<v 5>Uh,
same answer.
I would never,
I'd like,</v>

360
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.650
this is the one I thought Dory was great in finding Nemo.
Um,

361
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.290
joy and inside out would have been fun.
I like joy that,
uh,

362
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:58.330
I mean I'm very happy being dory.
Eugene.
Anybody?

363
00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.400
<v 1>No,
I,
I,
you know,</v>

364
00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.760
the thing of it is really these pictures,

365
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.530
all the picks are animations are so incredibly great that,

366
00:21:10.531 --> 00:21:14.940
and the process is so much fun to do.
I mean,

367
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.720
I don't know if anybody really understands exactly what you do when you're in a

368
00:21:18.721 --> 00:21:23.250
studio,
but it's really quite amazing.
And when you get to work with,

369
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.800
you know,
incredible,

370
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.410
incredibly talented like genius people here,

371
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.750
uh,
where you kind of just give a line and they,
as you're giving the line in the,

372
00:21:36.751 --> 00:21:39.060
in the,
in the,
in the scene,

373
00:21:39.061 --> 00:21:42.330
they kind of know they're making changes as they're going,
try it this way,

374
00:21:42.331 --> 00:21:45.630
try it this way.
And it's all happening in milliseconds and it's just like,

375
00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:50.700
it's an incredibly exciting way to work because I've got to act with Diane

376
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:55.590
Keaton.
So that's probably why he's on a high.
I know my wife isn't here today.

377
00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.230
Um,
yeah,
so that was a,
that was good.
That was kind of a fun too.
But yeah,

378
00:22:02.231 --> 00:22:03.910
I I,
you know,
I would say it's just,

379
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:08.350
it's a really fun way to work doing animated films and when the scripts and the

380
00:22:08.351 --> 00:22:13.120
stories are as,
as exciting as a finding dory,

381
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:17.290
then you know,
you're,
you consider yourself very lucky.
Okay,
awesome.

382
00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:20.830
That's all the time I have for you guys.
We have some crowd questions later,

383
00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:25.000
but I'm going to toss it back here.
Thanks so much for your time guys.
Thank you.

384
00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:25.983
<v 8>I see.</v>

385
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.540
<v 1>Thank you.
Suzy.
So we're gonna take some audience questions.</v>

386
00:22:32.541 --> 00:22:37.250
I think they're going to start lining up here.
Um,
here we go.

387
00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.780
<v 5>Hey,
you hear me?
Yeah,
I kind of want to ask a question if everyone,</v>

388
00:22:43.781 --> 00:22:46.480
but I'm going to focus on dory.
So don't be offended.
It's all good.

389
00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:49.780
You're all cool.
So my question to you is in finding norb Dory,

390
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.060
one of the mantras for me was just keep swimming,

391
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.920
which is I'm a plus size health and fitness motivators.

392
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.970
I help women like me starting,
reengage it.
The s so to me it's about the journey,

393
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:03.610
bracing the journey.
Just keep moving no matter what happens.
Just keep going.

394
00:23:03.611 --> 00:23:05.860
Well 11 who you are in the body you're in.

395
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:11.140
So what I be curious to know is what is your life lesson coming out of finding

396
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:11.530
dory?

397
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:15.940
Did you have that moment that just keeps living moment that really stood out to

398
00:23:15.941 --> 00:23:20.860
you?
Um,
well,
my life is,
that's,
that's my motto as well.
That was my motto,
I think.

399
00:23:20.861 --> 00:23:25.600
Okay.
It's yours now.
We'll share.
So sorry to steal it from you.

400
00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.290
Second lawsuit.
Oh,
I'm aggressive.

401
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.690
Um,
well it was,
it was kind of like my model.

402
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.950
It wasn't completely my motto.

403
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.470
<v 8>MMM.</v>

404
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:44.940
<v 5>Because I think if 51 knows my story,
it is,
I had to just keep swimming.
I,
you,</v>

405
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.130
my life has been

406
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:51.040
<v 2>a lot of challenges and a lot of,
uh,
different,
uh,
curves and,
uh,
and,
uh,</v>

407
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.080
roadblocks.
And so I think that's a great,
you know,

408
00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:56.500
I didn't come up with just kip keep swimming,
but it,

409
00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:01.370
it has turned out to be something that a lot of people can hold onto and use in

410
00:24:01.371 --> 00:24:05.450
their life.
And so I would say just everything I think is,
I'm,

411
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:10.310
I am so blessed and lucky that that's part of my character that I get to say,

412
00:24:10.311 --> 00:24:13.820
just keeps,
keep swimming for whoever you are and whatever you're going through.

413
00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:18.010
<v 7>Well,
thank you for that because it's a big life changer.
So thank you.
Thank you.</v>

414
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.333
<v 8>Thank you.</v>

415
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.173
<v 7>Hello.</v>

416
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.650
I just wanted to know what your favorite aspect of working on this film has
been,

417
00:24:30.651 --> 00:24:34.760
whether it's recording,
fleshing out the story,
promoting it,
et Cetera,

418
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:41.070
of anyone you've had,
the big you've had probably the most accused from.
Yeah.

419
00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:42.550
<v 1>Uh,</v>

420
00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:47.410
it's honestly working with the actors is probably my favorite simply because

421
00:24:47.411 --> 00:24:50.660
they're sitting in front of me.
Um,
no,
it's,

422
00:24:50.661 --> 00:24:54.810
it's actually because it's the one part of this process over four years that's

423
00:24:54.811 --> 00:24:58.600
spontaneous where you're actually doing a lot of give and take in the moment and

424
00:24:58.601 --> 00:25:03.310
you're kind of,
you're in the now and you're just reacting.
And,
uh,

425
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.150
I find that so exciting.
I get very little of it.
We came in animated pictures,

426
00:25:07.151 --> 00:25:10.300
so I'm pretty hungry for it when we do these sessions.
I know they're grueling,

427
00:25:10.301 --> 00:25:10.661
they're long,

428
00:25:10.661 --> 00:25:14.200
these guys stand around for four hours and they're just on the whole time.

429
00:25:14.201 --> 00:25:18.100
So they're basically doing a one person show.
And a lot of them I know,

430
00:25:18.101 --> 00:25:21.790
I've said that,
that it's the most tiring thing they do simply because it,

431
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.200
there's no breaks built into it.
And,
um,
but um,
it's,

432
00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.300
it's pretty invigorating.
It's pretty exciting to me.

433
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.500
<v 8>Okay.</v>

434
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.510
<v 7>Hello,
I'm Christina cal from the channel back,
girls ball.
Um,</v>

435
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:38.750
this question is for everyone.
A lot of people in the audience,
including myself,

436
00:25:38.751 --> 00:25:40.730
are content creators here at Youtube.

437
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.110
And I just would like to ask you all what advice you'd like to give us with

438
00:25:45.111 --> 00:25:46.610
building our careers.

439
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.340
<v 1>Super Lucky.</v>

440
00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:56.150
<v 7>Yeah.
Weirdly lucky.
Oh,
that's a horrible advice.</v>

441
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:05.220
<v 3>Someone asked a question earlier about to Andrew about how do you animate</v>

442
00:26:06.881 --> 00:26:08.620
something and you know,

443
00:26:08.621 --> 00:26:13.621
I would say the answer is the same and that's a story you start with that you

444
00:26:15.401 --> 00:26:20.380
start,
you're a content creator so you don't start with the actors.

445
00:26:20.381 --> 00:26:24.280
You don't start with upset,
you start with a story,

446
00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:29.110
you start with the content.
And if you have a great story,

447
00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:34.390
it can fit a hundred different ways to tell it animation,

448
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.370
it can fit live action.
So you know,
think of great stories,

449
00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:42.550
just stories that you haven't heard.

450
00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.630
I say that's a basis to start with.

451
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.190
<v 2>I would say authenticity.
I think whatever.</v>

452
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.900
I think when you,

453
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:54.390
if something's happened to you in the same thing that Albert saying,

454
00:26:54.391 --> 00:26:58.410
if you have a story,
you're probably not the only person with that story,

455
00:26:58.411 --> 00:26:59.191
whatever it is.

456
00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:03.480
And sometimes the best stuff comes out of the hardest stuff and the worst stuff

457
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:06.810
that you've gone through.
So if you've actually experienced something,

458
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.680
I don't think anybody should hide any kind of truth.

459
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:15.530
So whatever you have witnessed or experienced or gone through,

460
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:19.140
find a way to express that and find a way to stay.

461
00:27:19.141 --> 00:27:23.220
And I think people read truth and authenticity and I think that's the most

462
00:27:23.221 --> 00:27:25.530
important thing for establishing anything.

463
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:28.540
<v 3>And even if you don't have something,
you must have a horrible uncle.</v>

464
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:32.510
<v 2>Thank you very much.</v>

465
00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.253
<v 8>Okay.</v>

466
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.093
<v 5>Hello.</v>

467
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:43.910
So I know a lot of you have experienced with Improv and just being quick on your

468
00:27:44.251 --> 00:27:48.960
feet and I was wondering how much room there was for improvisation.

469
00:27:48.961 --> 00:27:53.700
It seems like a lot from what you've been saying,
um,
but how that improvisation,

470
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:58.290
uh,
affects the process and the final product and how it might be different from

471
00:27:58.291 --> 00:28:02.130
other animated films as it was with finding dory.

472
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:07.310
<v 3>Well,
I dunno,
it compared to other animated films are,
are different.</v>

473
00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.680
Some of the Simpsons that I've done,
the whole thing was Improv'd.

474
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.680
There's always a solid script here.

475
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:21.310
And the thing about Andrew is that once she gets those words,

476
00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.650
if you're willing to keep going,

477
00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.370
he'll take every word in the English language out of you.

478
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.880
So you know by the end of the day you've given a lot of choices.

479
00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:40.180
Hopefully there's some choices he didn't think of and then they have to,

480
00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:40.660
the,

481
00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:45.500
the thing I'm most grateful for is I don't have to listen back to these

482
00:28:45.501 --> 00:28:50.090
recording sessions because after 9,000 takes,

483
00:28:50.091 --> 00:28:51.430
I just,
you youtube

484
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:55.510
<v 1>every,
every person here,
there's at least one or two lines,
if not more,</v>

485
00:28:55.511 --> 00:28:59.110
that are in the finished movie of things that they came up with on the set that

486
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.130
I would have never written.

487
00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.580
<v 3>So,
but you know,
it's generally an animated films.</v>

488
00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.880
I think it's generally welcome because it's at the stage where it's still,

489
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:14.350
you're not coming into a finished movie where you have to fit the exact words in

490
00:29:14.351 --> 00:29:18.510
a mouth.
So they generally,
if you can do it,
they welcome it.

491
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:25.850
<v 5>This is a question for Ellen and Dory.
How did you learn to speak?</v>

492
00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.550
<v 2>Well,
that's very good.
First of all,</v>

493
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.673
<v 5>mmm.</v>

494
00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.740
<v 2>I was in Hawaii and there was a,</v>

495
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:42.700
a woman who was staying in the house next to the House that I was renting and

496
00:29:42.701 --> 00:29:47.260
she was doing yoga and like crazy yoga,

497
00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.030
like on rocks and um,

498
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.500
and listening to whale sounds like,

499
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.300
I didn't know you could buy that record,

500
00:29:55.301 --> 00:29:59.770
but there's a record that just is whale sounds.
And uh,

501
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.190
and I was listening to it and I just,
it just was like the most,

502
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.220
it was the weirdest thing I'd ever seen in my life.

503
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.860
And I just thought a wave is going to take her out any minute.

504
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:13.000
And it didn't kind of wanted it to happen because it was just so weird that

505
00:30:13.001 --> 00:30:16.060
she's on her head on a rock.
And,
um,
so anyway,

506
00:30:16.061 --> 00:30:19.240
I just knew what a whale's sounded like.
And so,
uh,

507
00:30:19.241 --> 00:30:21.850
I didn't think I'd ever need to use it in life,
but I did.

508
00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:25.210
<v 1>I was so scared to ask her this.
I thought this is going to be the thing.</v>

509
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.400
This is going to be the something,
you know,

510
00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.450
this isn't gonna be the thing that makes me go,
okay,
I'm done.

511
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:30.910
I'm not in this movie anymore.
I'm out.
And I'm like,

512
00:30:30.911 --> 00:30:34.540
would you be willing to speak well?
And she told me this whole story right away.

513
00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:38.040
<v 5>It just went right into it.
Oh,
I can speak whale.
Right.
And I've been waiting.</v>

514
00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:44.390
So that's it.
And it's a,
it's not easy.
I mean,
you did it very well,

515
00:30:44.391 --> 00:30:45.780
but if you have to do it a lot,
yeah,

516
00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.650
<v 2>it's very,
uh,
it's tough on your vocal cords.
You have to kind of,
yeah.</v>

517
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.570
<v 1>Warmup.
Caitlin had to do it a lot because her care characters,</v>

518
00:30:51.571 --> 00:30:53.550
the reason dory knows how to speak well.
So

519
00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:58.130
<v 5>yeah,
it did it a lot.
They'd look at me and go,
um,
one last thing.</v>

520
00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:02.030
Okay,
let's just do it.
Give me some tea.

521
00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:04.910
Thank you.
Thanks.

522
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.680
Hello.
My question is where Ellen,

523
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.450
what was the craziest moment that have been onset when recording the movie?

524
00:31:19.451 --> 00:31:24.250
Finding Dory?
Uh,
the craziest moment.
I don't know if there was a crazy moment,

525
00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:29.200
but uh,
yeah,
when you're back you couldn't even stay at your backwards.

526
00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.040
I don't even remember that.
We did give it to the secure.
So what happened like

527
00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.060
right before you came in?

528
00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.080
I still had to do at a four hour sessions with us and we were like,

529
00:31:38.081 --> 00:31:42.430
we're really sorry.
Could you do one more?
That's right.
That's good.
Well it's,

530
00:31:42.431 --> 00:31:45.580
I don't know.
It was crazy.
It was sad.
Sad.
One of the saddest.

531
00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:49.480
Do you want a sad moment are crazy.
Yeah.
I forgot.
And then I literally,

532
00:31:49.481 --> 00:31:53.170
I had to still do it because other version where you got in that horrible

533
00:31:53.171 --> 00:31:57.940
accident.
Yeah,
I remember that time when I was so crazy.
Crazy,
crazy.

534
00:31:57.941 --> 00:32:01.730
Ellen.
Yeah.
Um,
I was gonna say,
uh,

535
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:05.620
this is just an excuse to complain about it,
um,
that they,

536
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:09.070
because dory is always either left behind or catching up to people.

537
00:32:09.071 --> 00:32:13.950
So there's a lot of hyperventilating,
like breathing,
really just guys,

538
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:18.730
you know,
it's that,
or it's like screaming and like a lot of those.

539
00:32:18.731 --> 00:32:20.380
And you think that once,
I just did that,

540
00:32:20.381 --> 00:32:22.330
you could use that throughout the whole film,
right?
Yeah,

541
00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.830
but I had to do it all the time.
I had to like and I was just like,
do you,

542
00:32:26.831 --> 00:32:29.530
don't you really have the already,

543
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:33.220
so there was a lot of that and when you see this film and you should see it many

544
00:32:33.221 --> 00:32:35.950
times,
um,
you,

545
00:32:35.951 --> 00:32:38.230
you will see that I don't do it that often in the film.

546
00:32:38.231 --> 00:32:42.350
And I don't know why he needed this first comment that was like,

547
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:44.570
that was like Ellen was like,
I really loved it.

548
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:48.640
Where was all the gasping and waiting like literally that was her first
question.

549
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:52.990
Where is it?
It's in the toys.
Yeah.
I see.

550
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.810
That's how they get ya.
Thank you.
Thanks.

551
00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:02.393
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

552
00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:07.960
<v 1>Hello.
Hi.
Oh,
who came up with the idea for Sia to cover unforgettable.</v>

553
00:33:07.961 --> 00:33:11.590
And how did that all come about?
Oh Gosh,

554
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:15.420
<v 5>we know who exactly what we,
you always wanted this song.</v>

555
00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.730
I just thought it was always,
I said they've got to have one syllable.

556
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.020
That's the only thing I care about that,

557
00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:22.470
that's just one soul and we don't want to know what she looks like.
Yeah,
no,

558
00:33:22.471 --> 00:33:24.510
but it was the,
the song was always there.

559
00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:28.050
Like you always wanted that song at the end of the movie and you were knew,

560
00:33:28.051 --> 00:33:30.540
we knew it was going to be covered and didn't want the original.
We wanted it.

561
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:33.710
Robbie Robertson and province said Robert Robbie Williams,

562
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:38.000
<v 1>I had actually covered,
um,
beyond the sea on the first movie.</v>

563
00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.570
And so I wanted it to feel like that same sort of complimentary modern day

564
00:33:41.571 --> 00:33:44.130
singer plus an old classic and see it was

565
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.590
<v 5>pretty much on the top of the list.
We were talking to you about it.
Yeah,</v>

566
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.020
I was in a session and they said,
we,

567
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.750
this is the song is going to be unforgettable.
And um,
they said,

568
00:33:53.751 --> 00:33:56.440
we're thinking of Sia and I got my phone out like,

569
00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:00.440
let's see how fast we can make this happen.
I'm right now.

570
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.770
And so I texted her and she's like,
are you kidding me?

571
00:34:03.771 --> 00:34:06.110
Of course I would love to do that.
So it was like that quick.

572
00:34:06.111 --> 00:34:09.230
She just was so excited.
So it turns out when you know islands and generous,

573
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:11.840
you have to be a friend of Elliot.
And it happened pretty quickly.

574
00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.280
I was texting with CEO too.

575
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:18.410
That's a thing as she was texting with me when she got that text and I was like,

576
00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:22.550
all right,
go,
Ellen needs you.
Thank you.

577
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.393

580
00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:40.020

uh,

581
00:34:40.021 --> 00:34:41.850
