1
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.713
Hi.

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:04.930
<v 1>How is everybody?</v>

3
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.990
<v 0>The toxic Google.
My name is such Egan.
Thanks for being here.
I don't,</v>

4
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.660
I don't think these guys need any introduction,

5
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:19.430
but we'll still venture to give one anyway.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.360
It's my immediate right is John Hillcoat.
I do need an introduction.
All right.

7
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.230
We'll do our best over in four.
Yeah.
Okay.

8
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.580
He's an Australian award winning award winning film director Music Video

9
00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:36.560
Director and screenwriter.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A lot of great memories at this point.

10
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.680
Wikipedia.
Lay it to me.
Oh,
I'm sorry.
Fair.

11
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.720
I know a,
is it a lot of good movies by now?
Uh,

12
00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:47.830
one of them you guys might have seen the road,
uh,

13
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.670
the film adaptation of the road by Cormac Mccarthy teacher where you go.

14
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.563
Yeah.

15
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.010
And then to my further right men who probably needs no introduction to either,

16
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:01.040
but Aaron Paul who stole our hearts and our nerves.

17
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.880
It's Jesse Pinkman on breaking bad.
Oh,
also one,
a lot of awards for that.

18
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:09.590
What a lot of best supporting actor awards.

19
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.820
And we're here today to talk about their new heist thriller.

20
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.630
Triple nine out tomorrow.
Exciting stuff.
What can we see it guys?

21
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.310
Thank you.
Thank you.
Already.
Thank all right.
So you guys be doing the rounds.

22
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.810
This is stop number 430 on the tour.
We talked about that.
Put you on the spot.

23
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:29.660
What's the,
what's the best question you've been asked about the film so far?

24
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.770
I've got it.

25
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.360
<v 1>Uh,</v>

26
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.810
<v 0>oh,
I think I was asked.
Um,</v>

27
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.550
what does Norman Rita's smell like?

28
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.950
I think we're all curious to know more about that as well.
Yeah.
Uh,

29
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.350
oh man.
Yeah.
Do you remember what Norman smells like?

30
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.920
No.
No.
I make a point of not.
All right.

31
00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:05.440
We'll set smelling your actors.
Uh,
yeah.

32
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.500
Let's start with the basics then.

33
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.080
I guess we'll have better questions for you guys on this one.
Okay.

34
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.150
So talk about how'd you get involved with the film?

35
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:15.950
How'd you first hear about it?
Why this picture?
How'd you guys get involved?
Well,

36
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.180
I heard about the,
uh,
I got the script.
Uh,

37
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.590
it's a first time script writer,
um,

38
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.040
ex marine guy who talked to a friend of his,

39
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.100
who was a call that told him about a triple nine and neither one of us had heard

40
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:35.860
about it.
Does anyone know about a triple nine?
No.

41
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.100
They got it.
There you go.
That's how it started.
So triple nine,

42
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:44.960
it's a police code for officer down and,
uh,
you know,

43
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:47.190
it's an unwritten law that,
uh,

44
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.050
all the cops will go to that destination if they hear it.

45
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.260
And a contemporary crime thriller,

46
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.320
I've been itching to do something temporary about like a slice of life and you

47
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:02.290
know,
the,
the streets today.

48
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:07.190
So this was the opportunity and,
uh,
yeah,

49
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.990
you're,

50
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.610
<v 2>I mean,
yeah,
the,
uh,
this was placed in front of me out of nowhere.
I,</v>

51
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.080
I saw that John Hillcoat was even working on his next project.
And I mean,

52
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:19.750
I think that's really why we got such an incredible,

53
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.030
incredible cast and jump on board.
Uh,
he doesn't do all that many movies,

54
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:25.631
but you know,

55
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:30.631
the ones that he does do is going to be just a brutal gripping story,

56
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.200
um,
in a very human way.
And,
uh,
and yeah,

57
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.670
I read the script and I thought it was incredible.
And so,
um,

58
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.430
I had to jump at the opportunity ensemble cast

59
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.440
<v 0>just to name a few you've heard over and over.
Casey Affleck,
Woody Harrelson,</v>

60
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.800
Kate Winslet,
Anthony Mackie,
yourself,
just just to name a few.

61
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.520
What was it like to work with that much talent all in one place?

62
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.460
<v 2>Uh,
incredible,
terrifying,
you know,
as a,</v>

63
00:03:58.461 --> 00:04:01.850
an embarrassment of riches.
You know,
I've,

64
00:04:01.851 --> 00:04:06.851
I've been a huge fan of most of these cast members for a very long time and,

65
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.370
uh,
some of them being a dear friends of mine,

66
00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:13.640
and so it was nice to go to work and,
you know,

67
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.350
work with people that you really look up to and work with this guy.
And,
um,
yeah,

68
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.030
it was great.
Very cool.

69
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.860
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
I,
I was,
yeah,
totally spoiled rotten with,
uh,
these guys could,</v>

70
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.380
they're all very committed,
very,
um,
top of the game,

71
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.070
uh,
actors that,
uh,
are attracted to.
Uh,

72
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.691
you know,

73
00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:40.691
when you mentioned humanity that that was the thing is that even a world is grim

74
00:04:42.051 --> 00:04:46.760
and,
and Knarley is,
you know,
crime.
It actually,
you know,

75
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.780
behind all these people are,
are the people.
So,
um,

76
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.910
so these actors like eight,
10 parts,
uh,
main characters,

77
00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.180
um,
needed a real richness,
you know,
to uh,

78
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.260
cover that big,
it's like a sea of or a soup of human,

79
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.480
um,
kind of,
uh,

80
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.540
floors in your character is in some ways I think the most conflicted in the

81
00:05:14.391 --> 00:05:18.250
film,
not to give anything away.
Um,
we see a lot of conflict.
Uh,

82
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.260
those ones you're
always dealing with conflict.

83
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.850
Okay.
Yeah.
Did you,

84
00:05:25.851 --> 00:05:28.910
did you struggle to figure out how to act as character?

85
00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:31.100
Was it similar to stuff you've done before?
What was it like?

86
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.930
<v 2>I mean,
you know,
I,
I always tend to gravitate towards characters with conflict.
I,</v>

87
00:05:35.931 --> 00:05:40.820
I love playing,
uh,
the darker,
grittier side of things.

88
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.290
Um,
I think it's very honest to the real life.
Um,

89
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.080
uh,
would,
before we jumped into shooting this project,

90
00:05:51.081 --> 00:05:55.760
John is very important to him that we had as much information to us at our

91
00:05:55.761 --> 00:05:56.960
fingertips.
And so he,

92
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.150
US endless amounts of information and homework to study up on.
And

93
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.530
<v 0>Oh,
from Google,
often Google.</v>

94
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.183
Yeah.

95
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.330
<v 2>Uh,
spent,
spent some time with the LAPD,
did some ride alongs.</v>

96
00:06:16.331 --> 00:06:18.010
Um,
you know,

97
00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:22.870
this is just a side of the world that I am not used to,
but it is acting,

98
00:06:22.871 --> 00:06:27.040
you know,
it's absolutely happening every single day.
Um,
and it's,
uh,

99
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.730
it's crazy,
but,
you know,
so doing the ride alongs

100
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.140
<v 0>pairing,
did anything really surprise you?
Something you,</v>

101
00:06:33.141 --> 00:06:34.810
which weren't prepared for it and think through?

102
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.630
<v 2>Uh,
well,
you know,
we,
we,
uh,
we pulled over this guy,
um,</v>

103
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.400
and as we were pulling him over,

104
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.410
they told me that he already had two strikes on his record.
Uh,
third one,

105
00:06:47.411 --> 00:06:51.120
he'd be in prison forever.
Uh,
and this was in fact his third strike,
uh,

106
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.630
because big girl in his front seat was just shot.

107
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.340
Um,
in the backseat was his mom.
Uh,

108
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.940
he had tattoos all over his face.
Um,
they pulled him out of the car,

109
00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:08.590
he had a gun on him with a serial number scratched off.
Um,

110
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.263
but you know,

111
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.980
sitting in this car and going into this world and seeing these young kids on

112
00:07:14.981 --> 00:07:18.580
their bikes,
and they just get a glimpse of a cop car,

113
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.130
they run away from the cops there.
The cops are,
uh,

114
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.450
their enemy,
you know,
but you see these young kids and that's all they know.

115
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.810
And so it's,
she has really humanizes their world,
you know,

116
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.920
cause they don't really have a choice.

117
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.420
They have to side with a gang.
Um,

118
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.430
otherwise they get left behind or got shot in a corner and you really,

119
00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:46.570
you actually,
I mean,
you,
you feel for them and then you see these gang members,

120
00:07:46.571 --> 00:07:50.290
they're just grown up kids and this is all they know.

121
00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:55.180
And so it's,
um,
know it's just,
it's crazy and you're getting a peek behind the,

122
00:07:55.181 --> 00:08:00.040
you know,
we love her curtain per say,
at their world.
Um,
but yeah,

123
00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:01.810
it was,
uh,
it was,
it was unreal.

124
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.860
<v 0>Thank you for that.
I think that the humanity of the characters we meet,</v>

125
00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:08.890
there's a lot of characters in the film and that humanity really kind of comes

126
00:08:08.891 --> 00:08:09.490
through.

127
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.490
Did you have experiences in your own life that sort of led you to wanting to

128
00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:16.000
tell that kind of a story?
Uh,
yeah.
I mean,

129
00:08:16.001 --> 00:08:21.001
I came to America at a very young age and was kind of throwing as a young child,

130
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.950
um,
uh,
new haven,
Connecticut.

131
00:08:23.951 --> 00:08:27.900
And the late sixties was everything was kicking off.
Um,

132
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.180
I used to regularly,

133
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.240
I've found out recently that my mother told me that she used to have me baby sat

134
00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:40.000
by the Black Panthers at their headquarters.

135
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.960
They dropped me off there regularly.

136
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.680
But I remember absorbing at a young age,

137
00:08:47.681 --> 00:08:51.880
the turmoil of that age,
you know,
with the civil rights,

138
00:08:51.881 --> 00:08:56.881
antiwar movement and all those leaders were assassinated in a very short time.

139
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.000
And then the media,
there was no filter.
You know,
there's,
uh,

140
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.560
the Vietnam War was the most publicized,

141
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.440
a unfiltered war in history.

142
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.510
So as a young kid seeing all this and the adult world,
uh,

143
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.830
that,
that did affect me.
And then I,

144
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.910
you know,
started through the seventies and eighties,

145
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:25.330
looking at all the great American genre films and,
uh,

146
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.210
seeing those worlds in acted.
Um,
but it was yeah,

147
00:09:30.211 --> 00:09:32.460
wanting to get that kind of,
um,

148
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.900
a realism and immersement into this other world,
you know,

149
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.110
<v 2>go back to the cash briefly.
Was there anybody in the cast,
it's surprised you,</v>

150
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.290
anybody that was just really funny point pranks or just kind of just surprised

151
00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:47.090
you?
I guess having never worked with either of them before.

152
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.890
<v 0>Well,
we were just talking about earlier,
woody,</v>

153
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.130
woody Harrelson entrance is that,
this is like first,
uh,

154
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.540
seen first time onset,
uh,
very first take.

155
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.290
And he pulls up his,

156
00:10:05.291 --> 00:10:08.920
driving his car at high speed.
He jumps the curb,

157
00:10:08.921 --> 00:10:13.800
crashes into a tree,
uh,
smashes his head against the,
uh,

158
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.900
thing and gets out of the car with and goes up to Casey and plays the entire

159
00:10:20.771 --> 00:10:21.281
scene.

160
00:10:21.281 --> 00:10:26.281
Two pages without missing a beat while this giant Welt is growing.

161
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.270
<v 2>And did he give you guys rehearsed it right?
And they said,
well,</v>

162
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.720
there's no reason really coming that hot.
So maybe just

163
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.140
not push that hard on the gas pedal and he's like,
okay,

164
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.420
and then he does this,
which is so woody,
you know?
Yeah.
So it's the tone I guess.

165
00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:52.890
Right.
It right off the bat.
Absolutely.
Fantastic.
A couple of questions for you,

166
00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:54.940
which is about the style drone.
Uh,

167
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.560
a bunch of us watched the film last night and we're talking about afterwards.

168
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.550
One of my friends mentioned,
uh,
okay,
spoiler alert.
There's a lot of,

169
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.780
a lot of shooting in this movie

170
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.320
film with shooting thought,
right.
And,
uh,

171
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.840
use the phrase animating inanimate that we get a lot of first person shooter.

172
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:16.760
Uh,

173
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.630
we see a vantage point of either the victim or the shooter in a very unique way.

174
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:24.840
Could you talk about the way you tried to stylize the action in the film?

175
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.470
<v 0>Oh,
um,
uh,
that's great.
People pick up on that.
Um,</v>

176
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.950
but I liked change.
Yeah.

177
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:39.390
Um,
yeah,
changing the perspective because,
uh,
violence,
uh,

178
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.310
having seen real violence and,

179
00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:46.311
and being very influenced by the history and storytelling in America of and seen

180
00:11:49.421 --> 00:11:54.110
film maker is great.
Filmmakers tackle this subject to me.
Um,

181
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.720
it's always,
there's an element of chaos and unpredictability.

182
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.220
And I think too,

183
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:05.580
when you're staging action to change that perspective really helps capture that

184
00:12:07.181 --> 00:12:11.650
feeling of uncertainty and,
um,
uh,
yeah.

185
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.570
Rather than,
um,
uh,
keeping one prospective on it.

186
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:21.520
Fantastic.
Things that make sense.
Did that make sense?
I bet it was great.

187
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.040
What about colors?
I wanted to ask about colors as well.

188
00:12:27.041 --> 00:12:30.670
I know that I am different directors who makers care about color differently.

189
00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:35.250
I guess red is obviously a big movie,
you know,
it's on the film poster.
Yeah.

190
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:35.831
So,

191
00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:38.590
so should we look out for other colors in addition to read what you're trying to

192
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:42.610
do with red?
Anything about color?
Well,
that was a conscious choice of,
uh,

193
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.630
because we were shooting in Atlanta in the summer time and we,

194
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.840
we all want to,

195
00:12:47.841 --> 00:12:52.540
to make this genre of fresh again and some way and make it,

196
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.630
keep it a gritty reality.
So,
um,

197
00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.720
I did notice the west coast and the east coast when it comes to cops and crime

198
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.260
are always,
uh,
dominated by blue.
Um,

199
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:10.090
and even even Michael Mann's heat is dominated by blue.
Um,

200
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.220
amazing film,
but we,
so there was a conscious choice to,
well,

201
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:20.221
we're in Atlanta with the hot heat and I wanted to uh,

202
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.160
get that kind of richness of and reds a very,
uh,

203
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:30.240
emotional color and very vivid and I think it suits the themes,

204
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:37.270
change a lot of the colors on the cars.
Yeah.
Yeah.

205
00:13:37.271 --> 00:13:42.120
The actual police lights as much as we could.
We,
so we got rid of,

206
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:46.990
I see a fair bit of blue in this room,
but normally I would be removing,
you know,

207
00:13:46.991 --> 00:13:51.400
like
get rid of your shirt,

208
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.880
give you colors.

209
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.960
We noticed gold actually comes up once or twice as well.

210
00:13:58.961 --> 00:14:01.300
Are there other colors that you were going forward?
Just read.

211
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.520
I was looking at the Google color scheme.
It's a good way to do it.
Yeah,

212
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.520
I like that.
Okay.
No,
we were,

213
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:14.500
we chose to go with those,
uh,
more,
um,
warmer,

214
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.050
uh,
kind of emotionally more intense colors.
Sure.

215
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.850
To intensify.
It's very,
it's like,

216
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.990
as Aaron often describes it when you,
you know,

217
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.520
there's a lot of adrenaline and energy in the film,
so it kind of,

218
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.970
that's all part of it.
I think the color,
the richness of the color,

219
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.360
we'll then also in reaction to the road,
you mentioned the road,

220
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.930
I was itching to do something with more richness and very well it gets

221
00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:48.370
communicated through and through.
Um,
so what was it,

222
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.850
what was the most challenging part of the filmmaking process for either of you?

223
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.120
<v 2>Working with us?</v>

224
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.270
Working together was a big dog,
kind of a nightmare.

225
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:06.390
It was great.
I mean,
um,
I think that the,

226
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.940
the heist was the highlight for me,
um,
just to,

227
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.280
at the beginning of the movie,
uh,
we're trying to,
you know,

228
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.360
rob a bank and just putting on a mask and running inside of a bank with a gun

229
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.650
was amazing.
Um,

230
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.880
<v 0>and I've made all these guys try it out,</v>

231
00:15:26.881 --> 00:15:30.690
try and do it and do I really do math and to feel what it's really like.

232
00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:35.460
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah.
Which was grades.
Um,
but yeah,
so,
you know,</v>

233
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.710
and then getting in the car,
I was,
uh,
I was,
I'm the get away driver,
um,

234
00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.600
and doing that high speed chase was just fantastic.

235
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.690
<v 0>Is there any other difficult scenes?
Are you just cold?
Well,</v>

236
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.550
probably pretty difficult,

237
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.950
a favorite scene that we know what Erin's is now,
but one of my favorites,

238
00:15:58.951 --> 00:16:00.870
he did remind me of,
uh,

239
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.370
one of my favorites is with Tewa tell Acha for amazing,

240
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.330
very forceful,
powerful actor in the car.

241
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.550
And physically he'd been training with Navy seals for a month and months and

242
00:16:14.551 --> 00:16:17.730
months and he let's,
uh,

243
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.090
well he gets a little angry at that.

244
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:22.963
He let this guy

245
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:27.670
<v 2>aggression out on,
on me and if it's scripted that</v>

246
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.130
he throws a punch,
that means he's just going to beat the shit out of you.
And uh,

247
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.910
he doesn't hold back anything and um,
and it was great.

248
00:16:36.911 --> 00:16:40.370
I mean definitely know it comes across on screen,
but yeah,

249
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.150
anytime they yelled action I was truly terrified.

250
00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.020
Yeah.

251
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:50.380
What about just generally taking a step back from my last question is how'd you

252
00:16:50.381 --> 00:16:53.980
get where you are now?
How'd you guys get into film,
into acting,
into directing?

253
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.070
Anything about that story that you want to share?

254
00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.260
Uh,
you know,

255
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:06.010
I've been acting professionally for a long time.
I moved to la at 17,

256
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:11.530
graduated high school a year early.
Um,
I don't know if this is always loved the,

257
00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.130
I loved it.
You know,
like I said before,
like cops and robbers,

258
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.890
I think all of us boys are,
most of us did that.

259
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:23.050
It was something to girls to that as well.
Growing up a make believe,
pretend.

260
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:28.000
Um,
I've always been such a huge fan of,
of film.
Um,

261
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.390
yeah,
that's really cool.

262
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.100
<v 0>But you don't,
uh,
well similar it just that,</v>

263
00:17:36.101 --> 00:17:38.560
that kind of being immersed in other worlds.

264
00:17:38.561 --> 00:17:43.060
It's like a passport into all these other worlds where we get to go.

265
00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.400
And you work like this film we were working with a lot of um,

266
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.800
ex gang members,
gang unit people and very closely so you,

267
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.670
you kind of,
whatever world you go into,
you,
you know,

268
00:17:56.671 --> 00:18:00.640
you really engage with it.
And it's,
so for me that kind of,
um,

269
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.340
passport to all these places was very enticing.
But I got,

270
00:18:05.341 --> 00:18:10.341
I actually got into it through music and music videos way back in the day,

271
00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.810
remember those days anyway.
But yeah.
Cool.

272
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.020
And through that,
thank you.
Thank you guys.

273
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.950
I know we've got some questions in the audience.
There's a mic right there for,

274
00:18:21.951 --> 00:18:23.670
for day step on up.

275
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.760
<v 3>Thanks so much for coming.
Aaron.
I'm a huge fan of your work.
I think.</v>

276
00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:33.680
I think you're one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood.
Oh,

277
00:18:33.681 --> 00:18:37.880
I love you.
We're about
to die happy.

278
00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.810
Oh,
so you're really well known,

279
00:18:41.811 --> 00:18:45.950
obviously for breaking bad and now you're moving into movies.

280
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:47.091
Do you find,
uh,

281
00:18:47.091 --> 00:18:52.091
challenging to shed that character that people know you so well for and turn

282
00:18:52.491 --> 00:18:57.260
into a different person that they don't recognize you as Jesse from breaking
bad,

283
00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:58.490
but as a brand new character?

284
00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.010
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean,
I think a lot of,
you know,
a lot of people,</v>

285
00:19:02.011 --> 00:19:06.900
most people that know my work,
they know me as,
you know,
Jesse Pinkman.
Yeah.

286
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.800
Um,
uh,
on a daily basis I get called a bitch.

287
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.663
<v 3>It's great.</v>

288
00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.730
<v 2>It was stride.
It was,
uh,</v>

289
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:23.140
a beautiful show,
beautifully written character,

290
00:19:23.141 --> 00:19:27.550
and I feel very honored,
blessed to have been able to,
uh,

291
00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:31.630
to play that guy.
And so it's all about,
you know,
trying to mix it up,

292
00:19:31.631 --> 00:19:35.680
do something a little different.
You know,
when this came my way,

293
00:19:35.681 --> 00:19:38.290
I get offered drug addict roles all the time.

294
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.670
Wait,
is the instant answer,
quick answer is,
you know,
no,
it's a,
you know,
strong,

295
00:19:44.671 --> 00:19:48.720
solid pass.
Um,
but when this came my way,

296
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.950
it was impossible to ignore John l code.

297
00:19:51.951 --> 00:19:55.950
It's impossible to ignore this story.
You know,
granted,

298
00:19:55.951 --> 00:19:59.780
when I was reading the script and I seen this character picking up a pipe

299
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.390
<v 3>and
why?</v>

300
00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.960
<v 2>But I had to say yes,
you know,
and so this,</v>

301
00:20:06.961 --> 00:20:11.610
this role is probably the most similar.
I mean,
I think the similarity is just,

302
00:20:11.611 --> 00:20:13.510
you know,
they both have a,
uh,

303
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:18.240
an addiction to drugs,
uh,
along the other thing is,

304
00:20:18.241 --> 00:20:21.690
but yeah,
so it's just about changing it up,
mixing it up.

305
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:26.490
So hopefully people will,
uh,
see other characters in inmate.

306
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.260
Okay.

307
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.210
<v 3>Awesome.
Thank you.
And your wife have the most adorable relationship.</v>

308
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:35.960
She the best.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

309
00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:40.130
<v 0>And I,
I apologize that I called,
uh,
and bitch</v>

310
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.810
<v 3>all the time.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

311
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.690
<v 0>Act better,
bitch.</v>

312
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:56.980
I'm trying my best man.
Um,
but yeah.
All right.

313
00:20:56.981 --> 00:20:59.710
John is sexually question for you.
And I have to be honest,

314
00:20:59.711 --> 00:21:02.620
I have not seen the movie,
but I have watched the trailer,

315
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:06.520
the Red van trailers weekend this weekend and go check it out or be there.

316
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:10.240
And I'm curious from your perspective in making a movie like this that's really

317
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.990
dark and gritty kind of,
you know,

318
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:16.210
similar to the road and kind of has that like you think a heat or Scicaro and

319
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.970
you know,
kind of the cops and robbers,
those types of movies.

320
00:21:18.971 --> 00:21:23.650
How do you make a movie that has that look and feel compared to a more

321
00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:26.560
traditional,
you know,
not campy but you know,

322
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:30.730
kind of a cops and robbers bank robber movie that doesn't have that same gritty

323
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.760
dark feel to it by I think by research is probably the key to making that

324
00:21:38.021 --> 00:21:41.260
different Taishan and grounding it.
In reality.

325
00:21:41.261 --> 00:21:43.330
I'm a big fan of reality.

326
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.890
Even if you are doing a film in the future or in the past.

327
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.860
Um,
I think he want,
uh,

328
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:55.690
or at least I do as a an audience member.
I love that kind of,
um,

329
00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.310
detail.
So details and other research detail.

330
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:05.320
Um,
I look even science fiction.
You know,
I,
I love,

331
00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:09.780
um,
when,
when there's that kind of,
uh,
you know,
you,

332
00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.000
if I was to do a science fiction,

333
00:22:13.001 --> 00:22:16.680
I would go to NASA and I would get them involved and,

334
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.990
or physicists involved too,

335
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.950
to get some hard science in there.
Um,

336
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.910
because I think it always helps create that world.
And I think for the actors,

337
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:28.210
you know,

338
00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:33.210
who are the key to all bringing this to life and actually have that incredible

339
00:22:33.521 --> 00:22:37.810
pressure to in the moment to make it feel real.

340
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:42.310
Um,
I think it helps that,
you know,

341
00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:46.930
if that world,
if they're touching some kind of reality for them.

342
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.610
Um,
I think,
I hope,
um,
but yeah,

343
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:55.510
so thank you.
That's,
yeah.
Thank you.

344
00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.750
Question for John about the music.
Uh,

345
00:22:57.751 --> 00:23:02.010
I saw it last night and there was the creepiest version of,
um,

346
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.100
what is it,
this little piggy at the end that I've ever heard.

347
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:11.230
I just want her to unwell.
That's actually Cypress hills.
Cypress Hill has a,

348
00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.530
a great,
uh,

349
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:17.700
classic track from a cold pigs about actually corrupt police corruption.

350
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.260
Um,
so we,
you know,
given the themes of this film,

351
00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:26.330
we thought it was appropriate and adequate swirls.
Uh,

352
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.300
Claudia sign his wife,
Leo,
um,
his brother,

353
00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.350
um,
they basically,
uh,

354
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:40.240
worked very closely and really did an amazing remix of that.

355
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.780
I think I'm so good.
How did you kind of,

356
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.130
did you have to lay down the like,
music

357
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.310
<v 3>video element of it to not,
you know,
you don't want to have like,
oh,</v>

358
00:23:49.311 --> 00:23:51.120
this featuring the song here now,
you know,

359
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:57.350
<v 0>find that really distracting and movies where it's just like someone's playlist.</v>

360
00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:02.060
Um,
yeah.
And,
and um,
I like that kind of,

361
00:24:02.061 --> 00:24:06.990
again,
I keep coming,
I immersive is a word probably overused,
but that,

362
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:11.930
um,
uh,
thing of where there's sort of the right balance of,

363
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.950
you know,
if their source music or score.
Um,

364
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:20.900
I think music is greatly under valued a lot in,

365
00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.160
in films,
in terms of,
um,
uh,

366
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:30.050
certainly on the finance here,
production side,
uh,

367
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:34.240
a lot of,
um,
producers and finances and,

368
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:39.600
and people in the,
you know,
the studios and stuff have,
have,
uh,
uh,

369
00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:44.870
often forget the power of scores and,
and what sound,

370
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:45.471
you know,

371
00:24:45.471 --> 00:24:50.471
because we're so visually oriented and we all look at story and performance and,

372
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:57.250
and all that stuff and often we forget the power of sound that

373
00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.180
<v 3>I have.
Kind of a general question about,
um,
you know,</v>

374
00:25:01.181 --> 00:25:04.990
the types of films and TV shows that you've been in or like obviously very heavy

375
00:25:04.991 --> 00:25:08.710
topics.
So you're dealing with gang violence,
drug addiction,

376
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.130
you know,
police corruption,
potentially,
things like that.

377
00:25:12.131 --> 00:25:15.520
How do you feel like when you're immersing yourself so heavily and these really

378
00:25:15.521 --> 00:25:19.420
heavy topics that are,
you know,
serious problems in America and across the world,

379
00:25:19.421 --> 00:25:22.390
gun control,
walking away from something like that,

380
00:25:22.391 --> 00:25:23.890
after you've completed the film,

381
00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:29.340
does it really affect you and do you feel like going back to those issues and

382
00:25:30.101 --> 00:25:33.550
trying to find ways to help situations like that?

383
00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:43.360
But it's like,
you know,
you're especially for breaking bad.
I mean,

384
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:48.040
when you're working on something for such a long period of time where,
you know,

385
00:25:48.041 --> 00:25:49.960
crystal Meth,
drug addiction in America,

386
00:25:49.961 --> 00:25:53.800
it's like a serious thing that affects people's livelihood and family and all

387
00:25:53.801 --> 00:25:54.820
that kind of stuff.
That's

388
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:59.480
<v 2>what I think is so great about breaking bad.
Um,
before the show came out,</v>

389
00:25:59.481 --> 00:26:01.200
like shame on AMC Shaman,

390
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:06.170
Sony for doing a show that glamorizes the cooking and selling of crystal meth.

391
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:11.270
Um,
I don't think that showed,
did that at all.
I think,
uh,
showed the brutal,

392
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:15.110
harsh reality of what that drug does.
And I think it,

393
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.180
I think it actually educated people.

394
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:22.270
And so I think just making a show like that is doing good.

395
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.360
Um,
you know,
when I first started that show,
I would,
you know,

396
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:31.510
spend all hours of the night and the darkest alleys of Albuquerque,

397
00:26:32.781 --> 00:26:36.710
New Mexico,
and surround myself with very sketchy,

398
00:26:36.711 --> 00:26:41.570
dangerous people just to kind of put myself in that situation.

399
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.410
Um,
which was probably stupid.
Um,

400
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:51.360
but it helped.
It helped me because that stuff is going on.
And you're right,

401
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.850
uh,
math,
um,

402
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.360
there's a terrible drug and it does take over people and it's not just the

403
00:26:57.361 --> 00:27:00.510
people that are using it.
It's,
you know,
their friends,

404
00:27:00.511 --> 00:27:02.430
their families that are affected by it.
So,

405
00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:04.213
<v 0>yeah.</v>

406
00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.570
And also what was great about that,

407
00:27:08.571 --> 00:27:13.060
he said it's been different waves of,
uh,

408
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:18.020
uh,
drugs that have affected this country.
And,
um,
it Kinda,

409
00:27:18.021 --> 00:27:21.650
it brought up to date a real,

410
00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:26.210
the way that the stakes keep raising.
Like,
you know,
the,
the,

411
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:30.540
when you think back in the day when prohibition,
it was just like bad,

412
00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.010
illegal moonshine,
um,
things have,
uh,

413
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.570
there's been such a huge appetite for drugs,
um,

414
00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:42.740
and that supply and demand,
it's a very tricky equation.
Um,

415
00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.600
so I think I'm,
I'm with her and that,
you know,
it's good to for,

416
00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:48.853
um,

417
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:54.130
film and TV to embrace the reality of what's going on and try and,

418
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:59.420
you know,
um,
tackle that.
Uh,
how do you walk away from it?
Um,

419
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.183
uh,

420
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.210
<v 2>that question is kind of just more like,
does it affect you like personally?</v>

421
00:28:04.211 --> 00:28:08.470
A lot when you complete something like that after like really immersing yourself

422
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.010
a lot.

423
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:13.490
<v 0>I,
you know,
I,
I get,
uh,</v>

424
00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.570
have my guns,
I have my drugs,
I have all my stuff

425
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.880
<v 2>that's set up,
you know,
so,</v>

426
00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.730
so then I know how to use it.

427
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:27.820
No,
but seriously,
it's a,

428
00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:33.160
<v 0>I think when you're doing stuff with,
with actual,
uh,
serious,</v>

429
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:34.540
uh,
intention,

430
00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:38.440
I think there's something really positive comes out of it.

431
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:43.390
I found,
and actually this,
um,
you know,

432
00:28:43.391 --> 00:28:46.480
like I'm in awe of comedy and,
um,

433
00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:51.820
but I also know that comedy is like the darkest,

434
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.890
like the comic geniuses or the darkest people on the planet.
And,

435
00:28:56.130 --> 00:29:00.730
and on a comedy set,
it's the last set you want to be around.

436
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:05.770
The tension is just off the all scales.
Um,

437
00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:10.360
and I find this,
so it's a balancing act,
I guess is what I'm saying.

438
00:29:10.361 --> 00:29:14.440
There's a lot of,
um,
uh,
but I think,
uh,

439
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:19.000
tackling real things,
whether it's through comedy or through drama,

440
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.273
um,

441
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:25.270
I think people walk away feeling better for it.

442
00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:26.950
Um,
because it's,

443
00:29:26.951 --> 00:29:31.150
it's kind of a positive action even though you're dealing with a negative.

444
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:37.530
<v 2>That was really good.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
Wow.</v>

445
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:42.040
Thank you.
So that's also really tough act to follow.

446
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.450
<v 4>But I have a question for Aaron.</v>

447
00:29:43.451 --> 00:29:47.140
So you really started to have some great movie roles lately and uh,

448
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.710
you're more better known for your TV roles and,

449
00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:55.360
and just sort of wondering how you want your career to progress in sort of a

450
00:29:55.361 --> 00:30:00.250
character development versus sort of the fast paced life of,
uh,

451
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.210
you know,
movie star.

452
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:06.390
<v 2>Uh,
it was just long as I continue to work,</v>

453
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:12.760
it's always like the main goal,
um,
but just do stuff that,
you know,

454
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:16.440
I really believe in stories that I believe in,

455
00:30:16.441 --> 00:30:21.180
the characters that I believe in.
Um,
just it's all about the material.

456
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.790
If it's not on the page,
you don't have anything.

457
00:30:23.791 --> 00:30:28.791
So it's all about finding the right stories to tell and then getting the right

458
00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:33.570
directors to kind of hold the reigns to tell that story.
So just,
you know,

459
00:30:33.571 --> 00:30:38.370
working with directors that I look up to,
um,
writers I look up to,
um,

460
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:43.110
whether that's TV,
film,
I like it all.
He already dropped.
Thanks for being here.

461
00:30:43.111 --> 00:30:43.944
Thank you.

462
00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:49.030
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
