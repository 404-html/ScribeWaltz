1
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.130
No,
you're welcome to toxic Google.
I,
Kevin Hallock,

2
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.090
I'm going to be your host for today.

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.170
I'd like to welcome the cast and creative crew,
uh,
from big hero six.

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.980
<v 2>It's so we have Chris Williams and don hall directors,</v>

5
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.280
Ryan Potter,
Herro,
Jamie Chung,
Gogo to Manco,

6
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.190
Jansen's Rodriguez,
honey lemon,
and Roy kindly producer.

7
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.360
<v 1>Hey guys.
Hi.</v>

8
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.450
Was the fallout boyfriend was that marketing was just a suggestion from our

9
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.620
music department and you know,

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.650
we met him and they're like super cool and love.
Uh,

11
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.720
they love Disney and I love comic books a lot too.

12
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:48.330
So they were like the perfect choice.
No,
it's a,
it's a great film.

13
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:52.170
Now how many of you in the room saw the film last night and we showed it?
It was,

14
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.480
it was great.
We did a screening for the Google people.
People loved it.

15
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.420
Families loved it.
You know,
the theater was packed.
It was,
it was a beautiful,

16
00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:00.330
beautiful film.
So,
and Don,
you were on it from the very beginning,

17
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:02.750
right after your pitch.
Three and a half years ago.

18
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.150
I was finishing up Winnie the Pooh and,
uh,
um,

19
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.630
I just talked to John about what my next thing would be.
And,
and as a kid,

20
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:12.580
I loved Disney animation.
I love marvel comics.
And,

21
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.380
and we had just purchased marvel.
Disney hadn't.

22
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.960
So I pitched that to John and he got really excited and said,
go find something,

23
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.510
go.
Um,
and I did a lot of research and found big hero six and,

24
00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:25.710
and it felt like there were kind of the perfect choice for us.

25
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:29.690
I mean it's a very obscure title in the marvel sort of Pantheon,
but uh,

26
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.550
which actually ended up benefiting us I think a little bit.

27
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.950
But I'd love the characters.
I love the,
you know,
the,

28
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.620
the whole thing was very light and on light on his feet.

29
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:40.140
And the thing is like a love letter to sort of Japanese pop culture.

30
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:42.450
And we also saw that there could be an emotional story there too.

31
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:45.010
So head kind of all the elements we were looking for.
No,
absolutely.

32
00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:48.810
And John Lasseter,
and he's always got his radar up for people's passions.

33
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.090
And when he sensed how excited don was about the idea of pursuing a marvel

34
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:57.930
property,
he really,
he really got behind them.
Great.
And then Roy,

35
00:01:57.931 --> 00:01:59.130
when did you come onto the project?

36
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.300
<v 3>I get mine with a project about a year ago and basically we kind of wrapped</v>

37
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:07.470
everything up in terms of pulling together the story was,

38
00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:10.450
or it was a long process and literally we,

39
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.740
we finished the film about 15 days ago.
Gosh.

40
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.340
And it's pretty mad on it,
man.

41
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.790
We finished the story process probably sometime in August,
so it was,

42
00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:23.380
uh,
it was a,
it was a nice one.

43
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.030
<v 1>Okay.
And Ryan,
our hero of the story,
uh,</v>

44
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.700
I came on about a year and six months ago.
Okay.
Um,

45
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.270
it's the first voice acting role,
right?
This is my first voice acting role.
Yeah.

46
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.290
And um,
it's funny because the most,
the,

47
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:44.030
like the last recording session was maybe a month ago that we had.

48
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.850
Yeah.
So that's the story process of Disney,
right?
Yeah.

49
00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:49.280
It's really just figuring out the story.
Always changing.

50
00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:51.470
Always kind of literally.
And last year.
Yeah,

51
00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:55.010
last year has a phrase he says our films are never finished there.
Just released.

52
00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.950
We can go back.

53
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.240
<v 4>That's right.
You guys,
you guys came on.</v>

54
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.680
At what point in the filming?

55
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.260
<v 5>I believe I auditioned last November.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:12.990
So I can't believe it's gone by so quick.

57
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.003
<v 4>Right?
Yeah.</v>

58
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.400
And you mostly live action cause you started off kind of your big kind of hit

59
00:03:17.401 --> 00:03:18.520
was entourage really.

60
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.990
And then you kind of came on with last stand and identity theft in hours and you

61
00:03:21.991 --> 00:03:25.290
work with this incredible people and teams and then you come into Disney and do

62
00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:26.640
this.
His voice acting role.

63
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:30.810
So what was that like in terms of doing the voice as opposed to acting in front

64
00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:31.710
of live real actors?

65
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.230
<v 5>See I've always been a Disney fan,</v>

66
00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:39.231
so they did me a huge favor this job because you're welcome.

67
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.330
Thank you.
Okay,

68
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.030
<v 4>well I heard fun fact.</v>

69
00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:48.360
I hear that you were on an all girls robotics team in high school and you're a

70
00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:49.200
self proclaimed nerd.

71
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.010
<v 5>Yes,
we have to talk about this.
Yes.</v>

72
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.180
I was on a robotics team and I did basically robot wars and I was a welder and I

73
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.750
gave the robot commands.
Um,

74
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:06.040
I really wasn't into the physics aspect of it,
but um,

75
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.440
or a driver,
I don't drive in real life.
So,
um,

76
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.420
they didn't give me the robot,
um,
to take care of,
but it was so much fun.

77
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:15.220
It was just the coolest thing I've ever done.

78
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.410
<v 4>So then what,
what,
what was the transitioned into acting then?</v>

79
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.630
<v 5>I don't know how it translates.
I don't know what the similarities are.</v>

80
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.700
I guess it's having an idea and being able to express it or execute it.

81
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.800
Um,

82
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.250
it was just really cool to just think of something and be able to create it and

83
00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:37.990
make it actually tangible.
So,
um,
I had the best time.

84
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.050
I kind of love seeing the boys' faces when an all girls robotics team just would

85
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:48.070
walk up and they wouldn't think that we were so bad ass,
but we were,

86
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.820
<v 4>did you guys know this before?
I didn't.
I mean,
it came,
I mean we'd,
I think we'd,</v>

87
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.340
she already had the part and then we'll just talk and she's like,
Oh yeah,

88
00:04:55.341 --> 00:04:57.630
I was on the all girl in this room about it.
And then they'd be like,
what's that?

89
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.690
Oh,
because I actually met on a research trip,
um,
uh,
back east at Carnegie Mellon.

90
00:05:02.691 --> 00:05:03.860
I met the girls of steel,

91
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.540
which was a high school all girls robotics team in there.

92
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.000
Their logo was like Rosie the riveter with like cyborg arm.
That was really cool.

93
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.800
Um,
and again,
I was just struck by their spirit and,
uh,
and a lot of that,

94
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.590
you know,
we tried to get into the characters of honey lemon and Gogo,
you know,

95
00:05:18.591 --> 00:05:21.740
just that idea of this can do,
they're all makers.
They're all scientific,

96
00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:24.950
they're all super smart and enthusiastic and that really influenced those two

97
00:05:24.951 --> 00:05:29.180
characters.
Okay.
Jamie,
so you're a San Francisco native?
Yes,
I am.
Well,
how,

98
00:05:29.181 --> 00:05:31.040
so you're from here.
So what part of San Francisco?

99
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.590
<v 5>Uh,
born and raised in Westwood Park,
like right by monitoring Miramar.</v>

100
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.490
<v 4>So it was a very,
was interesting cause it,
this is a beautiful,</v>

101
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.000
beautiful film and you really captured the city and and it's an incredible,

102
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:45.090
was it cool kind of seeing San Francisco in an animal?

103
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.290
<v 5>I mean to be honest,</v>

104
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:51.070
I didn't really know how the world was going to look like and right away it's so

105
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:55.450
recognizable.
You know all the,
all the light,
all the great land marks are there.

106
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.400
So like the TRANSAMERICA building and the Golden Gate Bridge

107
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.790
<v 3>and,
and market street.
It's,</v>

108
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.370
it's really surreal because you don't get that feeling when you're in the

109
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:05.270
recording booth.

110
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.630
<v 4>Want to talk about that because it was,
it's a beautiful,
beautiful film.</v>

111
00:06:09.631 --> 00:06:10.231
It's really,

112
00:06:10.231 --> 00:06:13.500
it looks like you basically took the footprint of San Francisco and then you

113
00:06:13.501 --> 00:06:18.240
just added all the aesthetics of Tokyo and just,
it's gorgeous stuff.
Yeah.

114
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.840
<v 1>Thank you.
Yeah,
it was a,
yeah,</v>

115
00:06:19.841 --> 00:06:23.120
we started with basically a computer model of San Francisco.
You said we all,

116
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.140
we started with sort of the baseline,
the geography or,

117
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.430
and geographically it was always going to be San Francisco.

118
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.130
So we spent a lot of time in Tokyo doing research trips as well and,

119
00:06:30.131 --> 00:06:32.890
and just try to get as much of that in there.

120
00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:35.740
And we were just in Japan like a week ago for the world premiere.

121
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.300
We had a lot of Japanese press coming up to us and saying how,
uh,

122
00:06:40.301 --> 00:06:44.260
they loved the film and they loved how authentic it felt down to little details.

123
00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:45.520
Like,
you know,
we would,

124
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.400
they would put their empty recyclables in these milk crates and put them in

125
00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:51.430
alleys.
Well we have that in a lot of shots in the film,
which I,

126
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.830
we didn't even know.
We didn't have to ask our production designer to do it.

127
00:06:53.831 --> 00:06:54.580
They just did it.

128
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.460
But they were so appreciative of those little details like that because it just

129
00:06:57.461 --> 00:06:59.440
made them feel like we did our homework.
You know,
we have,

130
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.150
we would love to take root.
Yeah,

131
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.190
<v 3>exactly.
Hall Felix and Scott.
What?
Nabi.
Yeah.
Uh,</v>

132
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.080
our production designer and art director,
they,
well,

133
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.380
Scott was kind of a secret weapon.
Yeah.

134
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.600
Cause Scott grew up in San Francisco and is Japanese American and he spent his

135
00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:20.500
summers in Japan.
So it was like having this double threat.
I

136
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.071
<v 4>mean,
yeah and I,</v>

137
00:07:21.071 --> 00:07:24.070
I've only been here three years in San Francisco and just even just the feel of

138
00:07:24.071 --> 00:07:26.740
just the weather and the fog and the mist and the lighting,

139
00:07:26.741 --> 00:07:29.210
like everything is very,
very specific.
In San Francisco we were,
uh,

140
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.920
we were tried very hard to capture the lighting because way it was important to

141
00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:33.671
Jon laster.

142
00:07:33.671 --> 00:07:35.760
Cause when we first pitched this idea it's like you've got to go up and you got

143
00:07:35.761 --> 00:07:38.110
to study the light because the light in San Francisco is like no other place.

144
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.050
So we did send a team up here and,
and they were on,
you know,

145
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.120
rooftops of buildings taking like the time lapse photos of the light,
you know,

146
00:07:46.121 --> 00:07:48.040
all through the day.
And we use that a lot in the film.

147
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.480
Even the placement of the sun and the sky is accurate to San Francisco depending

148
00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:55.060
on the time of day of the scene.
Like they go really deep.

149
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.420
And it's important to make note of this be because before we tried to construct

150
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:01.090
the story,
we try to,
we build the world.

151
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.030
And because the story is something that over the course of the years of

152
00:08:04.031 --> 00:08:07.000
production is going to evolve quite a bit.
We work in a very iterative way.

153
00:08:07.001 --> 00:08:09.010
The story is always going to going to change,

154
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.370
but you're kind of stuck with the world Ukraine.
So before we do that,

155
00:08:12.371 --> 00:08:15.540
we go back and do tons and tons of research and,
and our art direction,

156
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.740
our director of production design and really immerse themselves in,

157
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.310
in this world.
And they sketch a lot and they,

158
00:08:21.311 --> 00:08:23.650
and they take pictures and they really immerse themselves.

159
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.390
And that's why it feels so complete.

160
00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:28.510
And it feels like the world has a history to it.
Yeah,
it's incredible.
I mean,

161
00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:30.520
even this post,
so we have kind of sitting back there,
you know,

162
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.550
production to Miguel around,
but it's just a beautiful,

163
00:08:33.551 --> 00:08:35.440
just sunset with Baymax and,

164
00:08:35.441 --> 00:08:39.160
and a here and your character is an awesome seeing with Bay Max where you guys

165
00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:41.650
are flying around in the city and kind of testing them out.
And there's a,

166
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:44.290
there's a beautiful little part in there.
It's not an acting on your part.

167
00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:45.080
I know it's an anime,

168
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.340
but it's a beautiful little scene with hero where it's your catch,

169
00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:50.950
your reflection and the,
you know,
in the building.

170
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.380
So it's a little subtle but it's amazing moment for the character to just of be

171
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:57.770
like,
oh this is awesome when opened.
I'm doing,
it's,

172
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.590
it's funny you say that because that's something that I do in my everyday life

173
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.130
and I'm trying to find out which of the animators put that in there cause they

174
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:08.820
watch,
you know,
hours and hours of,
of me in the booth and then Washington,

175
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:13.140
you know,
they wash my face and when my body does and um,
w when I,

176
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.170
when I look at something and I think it's cool or I think it's entertaining or

177
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:20.700
funny,
I almost do this laugh to myself.
It's like,
Huh,
I do that.

178
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:24.780
And when does it twice in the film he does it when he's on the back of Tadashi,

179
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:26.130
his moped,
he,
you know,

180
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:29.760
they hit up and then he's looking next to like the glass and he sees himself,

181
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.250
he does a laugh.
And then that scene parallels with the,

182
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.510
for the first flight scene where he's on the back of Baymax and he's going

183
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:39.960
around the city and he sees himself in the mirror again,
well in the glass.

184
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.010
And it was just so bizarre watching the film when those two things,

185
00:09:44.011 --> 00:09:45.690
I missed the first one the first time around,

186
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.350
but when I saw the one where he's on the back of Baymax blew my mind.

187
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:50.363
Cause there's some,

188
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.170
some animator saw me do that in the booth and put it into the film.
Yeah,

189
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.360
yeah.
No it's,
it's such a cool part.
Oh sorry.

190
00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:58.940
<v 5>That's the first time I cried.</v>

191
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.690
We're not the last 103 d glasses.
Yes.
No,
it's,
it's such an

192
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.890
<v 4>terrible scene.
It just kind of gets to the actual,</v>

193
00:10:06.891 --> 00:10:09.470
it makes these characters alive and their actual human beings,
you know,

194
00:10:09.471 --> 00:10:10.580
they're not computer or data,

195
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.980
they're actual human beings and seeing that little moment he could just be

196
00:10:12.981 --> 00:10:15.560
flying around,
but he's actually seeing how cool it is.
Just the,
you know,

197
00:10:15.561 --> 00:10:17.210
a complete teenager thing

198
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.810
<v 3>to do a total testament to our animators.</v>

199
00:10:19.811 --> 00:10:23.450
So we've got the greatest animation team.
I think in the business right now who,

200
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.250
who are,
are able,
you know,

201
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.310
to take human characters and make them come alive.
I mean,

202
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.110
oftentimes I'll be talking to people and they'll say,
you know,

203
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:36.140
I forgot I was watching an animated film.
And you know,
it's not photo real.

204
00:10:36.141 --> 00:10:40.160
It's not,
I mean it's,
it's,
it's totally exaggerated in the way a,

205
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.560
an animated film should be.
Yeah.
But you,
you,

206
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.720
you emotionally and fall in love with these characters and you just go with it.

207
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.410
<v 6>And you know,
and Ford,
those little moments of,
of spontaneity,</v>

208
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.070
we really rely on big moments.

209
00:10:53.071 --> 00:10:57.390
We really rely on these guys relying on past because the way animation works,

210
00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:01.020
it's so everything is so meticulously planned.
Everything you see on the screen,

211
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:04.420
every little crack in the sidewalk is a choice that somebody made.
Um,

212
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.580
and so the one place where we can find spontaneity is in the recording booth and

213
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:11.470
with these guys and they still inhabited the characters and,
and,

214
00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:15.090
and brought them to life.
And so we're,
we're,
we're very,
very grateful.

215
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.940
<v 4>Full to you guys.
Thank you.
Yeah.
The Janssen.
Jimmy,</v>

216
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.630
that must have been actually interesting too cause you watch yourself on screen

217
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.410
live action films and you obviously see yourself but now you're seeing these

218
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:23.260
characters up on screen.

219
00:11:23.261 --> 00:11:26.610
So did you see any little bits that the animators took out from you guys?

220
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.690
<v 5>I mean they got the narrowed aspect,
right?</v>

221
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:34.910
The first thing was like I totally hear it out in the room and they acted a fool

222
00:11:34.911 --> 00:11:39.911
for the new guy or like four hours and I saw some of the cooking is and you know

223
00:11:40.311 --> 00:11:44.630
the lip biting thing and just the,
the,
the mad scientist that we didn't in room.

224
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:46.530
They captured that.
Okay.

225
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.380
<v 6>We needed to give genesis lots of room there.</v>

226
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:53.230
We move things out of the way ball very.
I'm very active there.

227
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.370
Were any of you guys together

228
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.600
<v 4>during the recording process?
No,
not at all.
We met less than a month ago.</v>

229
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.670
Oh my gosh.
For the first time at a cast dinner.
It's hard to do.
Um,
the APP,

230
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.080
just because everybody's schedules and all in our production schedule is in a

231
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:06.340
perfect world.
It'd be awesome though.

232
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:09.700
I mean to get everybody in and record at the same time.
I worked with,
uh,

233
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:14.080
my Rudolph who voices and cast for about 20 minutes.

234
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.950
I thought that was about it.
Um,
but um,
yeah,
I mean,
it,
it,
it's,

235
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.480
it was fun.
It was fun being able to work with another actor,
but with,

236
00:12:22.481 --> 00:12:24.250
with voiceover,
I think,

237
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.380
I think what's so amazing about it is it's because it's just yourself.
It's,

238
00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:33.460
you have so much freedom to play around because usually in live action you're

239
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:37.990
worried about someone maybe messing up align or I watch my body looked like on

240
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:41.020
camera.
Well,
you know,
you have all these things to worry about with voice.

241
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:44.890
It's just,
it's,
it's simply your voice so you can,
you run around the room,

242
00:12:44.891 --> 00:12:48.430
you can do cartwheels as long as you're,
you know,

243
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.320
the voice matches is all that.

244
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.660
<v 5>Yeah.
And to expand on that,
I feel like with,
you know,</v>

245
00:12:54.661 --> 00:12:58.440
the difference between doing a live action film and doing an animation film is

246
00:12:58.441 --> 00:13:01.330
you have the luxury of time.
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,

247
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:05.450
John's been with this project for for many,
many years and for them to continue,

248
00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:10.140
leap,
protect,
uh,
you know,
perfected.
And same thing with the character is,

249
00:13:10.141 --> 00:13:11.220
you know,
we had that luxury.

250
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.170
<v 4>No,
I think that's a great thing about Disney and you know,
picks her up as a,</v>

251
00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:16.620
to where you guys,
you guys want stunned cats.
It's not like you're like,

252
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.750
get Brad Pitt,
look at Tom Cruise and they're,
it's,
it's,

253
00:13:18.751 --> 00:13:22.800
you guys find the perfect people because you guys just blend perfectly in with

254
00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:24.230
these characters.
You know,
when you,
again,

255
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.190
I think goes to the realism of the character who you really believe these

256
00:13:26.191 --> 00:13:29.610
characters are alive but hiding that boys in the character and they are,

257
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.330
you are hero and you are go,
go.
You know,
it's,
it's,
it's incredible.

258
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.620
<v 6>I really feel that way pretty early on in the process.</v>

259
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:38.620
It became impossible to imagine anyone else playing these characters.

260
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:42.600
They're just really inhabited them.
And,
and uh,
yeah,
I have to remember these,

261
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.270
these guys have to conjure up everything.
They don't have a costume.

262
00:13:46.271 --> 00:13:50.050
They don't have a set,
they don't have the other actors,
uh,
to bounce off of.
And,

263
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.380
and if it was a live action thing,
you would probably come to the,

264
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.380
to the set to do one scene that day.
Uh,

265
00:13:56.381 --> 00:13:59.710
whereas we have them race from scene to scene to scene in the course of one

266
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:01.930
recording session,
the whole movie basically.
Yeah.

267
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.750
So it might be a comedic scene followed by a very emotional scene with,
with,

268
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.350
with great tragedy and they're forced to sort of,

269
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:11.140
to sort of nimbly sort of shift from one thing to another.

270
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:14.200
And I'm always really amazed and we're all exhausted by the end of each

271
00:14:14.201 --> 00:14:14.920
recording session.

272
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.550
<v 4>No,
I bet.
I bet.
Um,
you know,
it's,</v>

273
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.480
it's an incredible film really about a boy really coming of age and these

274
00:14:22.481 --> 00:14:24.370
teenagers and these college students really coming of age.

275
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.100
And there's this beautiful,
really interesting part,

276
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:29.870
which I've never really done seen,
done in animation before.

277
00:14:29.871 --> 00:14:31.960
Where am I going to spoil it for people who haven't seen the movie,

278
00:14:31.961 --> 00:14:34.450
but there's a part where a particular character,

279
00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:38.710
just because it does a complete one 80,
you know,
and it's completely changes.

280
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:41.290
And I haven't seen that before,
especially from,
you know,

281
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.270
it definitely one of the main characters and it's,

282
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.210
it's so interesting cause it's,
it's a real emotion,
right?

283
00:14:46.211 --> 00:14:49.360
Like I think it's something that's very specific to someone who is young who

284
00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:51.980
gets put into these very situations

285
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.720
<v 1>who has to have these real human emotions.
Right?
And so that,</v>

286
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.860
that's an interesting part and I kind of want without kind of split it is,

287
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.280
and it's a little tough when we're big.
We're very proud of that scene too.

288
00:15:04.281 --> 00:15:06.860
And it does kind of plum,
uh,
some,

289
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.540
some of the darker depths of this particular character.
Um,
and uh,
you know,

290
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:15.200
it was one of those scenes that,
you know,
as we animated it,
we were,
we kept,

291
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.330
we kept shifting things like,
and we would,
it,

292
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.110
it came across in the animation we thought,
Oh man,
this is really powerful.

293
00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:24.020
And then when it came time to score it and mix it,

294
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.830
we found that taking out the sound effects and just letting the score play

295
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.610
actually really made it land emotionally.
So it was one of those,

296
00:15:31.611 --> 00:15:33.590
it kind of kept evolving throughout our process.

297
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.360
<v 6>Yeah.
I think that,
um,</v>

298
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.980
the idea that hero inherits his brothers robot and then wants to turn them into

299
00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:42.560
something other than what it was intended to be a is actually a lot of the fun

300
00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:44.030
and the comedy of the movie,

301
00:15:44.031 --> 00:15:47.570
but we knew inevitably will lead to a terrible choice.

302
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:52.640
And we knew it wouldn't be true to not do that.
And,
and,
but it is a challenge.

303
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.660
We were asking the audience to suddenly sever from their main character and not

304
00:15:56.661 --> 00:16:01.380
like what he was doing.
Uh,
but,
but we knew it had to be in the film.
And so I,
we,

305
00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:02.720
we took it on and hopefully we did it.

306
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:03.931
<v 1>Well.
I think that was the,</v>

307
00:16:03.931 --> 00:16:05.730
that was a great thing is it was completely unexpected.

308
00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.770
<v 3>Yeah.
And it's a testament to you two guys to don and Chris.
I mean,</v>

309
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.420
I think there's some really brave film making going on.
Uh,
you know,

310
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.410
the fact that they,
oh Gosh,
say,
uh,

311
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.750
the fact that they do not depend on sound effects,

312
00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:23.930
they do not depend on a score.

313
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.140
They actually let moments go silent,
you know,

314
00:16:27.141 --> 00:16:31.130
which I think in animation is really important because it is a visual art form

315
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:36.380
and they really play into the strengths of animation and also the power of

316
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:41.240
emotion and not try and gimmick it up.
And that's youtube guys.
You're great.

317
00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.950
Thanks Roy.
Thanks.
You're welcome.

318
00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:47.760
<v 1>Was there a lot of pressure because you know,</v>

319
00:16:47.761 --> 00:16:50.100
Disney is kind of in this new golden age of animation again,

320
00:16:50.101 --> 00:16:52.640
kind of back in the 90s when I was little mermaid and Aladdin and being the

321
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:54.330
beast,
and now you have tangled,

322
00:16:54.331 --> 00:16:58.980
which was just an amazing film and you wreck it Ralph and frozen,
you know,

323
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.850
is there a lot of pressure to succeed?
Like after frozen comes out?

324
00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:05.280
It does last year come in and like,
oh my gosh,
we need a valid with Baymax,

325
00:17:05.281 --> 00:17:10.110
you know,
singing oh yeah.
With the cigar and the old?
Uh,
no,

326
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.610
no,
no,
no.
Um,

327
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.180
I mean the pressure is really more internal than external to be honest with you.

328
00:17:15.181 --> 00:17:18.360
And,
and the fact that we grew up Disney fans,

329
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.340
our whole building is full of fans and,
and some somewhere in their childhood,

330
00:17:23.341 --> 00:17:27.600
they were emotionally touched by a Disney film and that made them want to work

331
00:17:27.601 --> 00:17:28.291
there.
Right.

332
00:17:28.291 --> 00:17:33.180
And so the pressure is strictly can we make a film that is a Disney film but as

333
00:17:33.181 --> 00:17:37.170
fresh and new and can it sit on the shelf with those other,
you know,
classics.

334
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.530
And so really it was more of an internal pressure than any kind of external

335
00:17:40.531 --> 00:17:41.280
pressure.

336
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.250
<v 6>We don't compete with other Disney movies in that way.</v>

337
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.370
We were actually a pretty small community at,
at Disney animation,

338
00:17:47.371 --> 00:17:48.870
and we all work on each other's movies.

339
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:53.700
And so anyone movie's success is everyone's success.
And so yeah,

340
00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:56.620
we were not worried about trying to make more money than frozen.

341
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.840
There was no such thing as more money than frozen,
all of them.
But,

342
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.100
but what is important,
we have a relationship with the audience.
You know,

343
00:18:05.101 --> 00:18:09.510
they track Disney feature animated films and we want them to believe that if

344
00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:11.880
they come to see one of our movies,
whatever the genre we're taking on,

345
00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.100
that they'll have a great experience.
That's what's most important.

346
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:16.320
And that's the thing that Kinda keeps me up at night.

347
00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:20.270
<v 4>I think the strength of the studio right now is the fact that,
you know,</v>

348
00:18:20.271 --> 00:18:25.010
dawn was working on Winnie the Pooh and decided he wanted to do a superhero

349
00:18:25.011 --> 00:18:28.220
movie that split,
you know,
for me,

350
00:18:28.221 --> 00:18:32.060
I'd done tangled and the next thing I do as a superhero movie.
That's great.

351
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.690
And that's,
that's the strength of our studio right now in terms of storytelling.

352
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.440
And it's all about the storytelling and,
and whenever we make a choice,

353
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.910
it's about what's the best story.
Yeah.
No,
I think that's incredible too.

354
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.870
Uh,
you know,
with you guys as the voice cast and stuff with your guys' costumes,

355
00:18:47.871 --> 00:18:49.250
did you have any say over that stuff?

356
00:18:49.251 --> 00:18:51.650
Any little bits and pieces of it or not really

357
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.780
<v 6>zero Weintraub though.</v>

358
00:18:55.781 --> 00:19:00.750
So I hope that happens for me.
Cause it absolutely adorable.
Yeah,

359
00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.460
it was pretty good.

360
00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.790
And I want to talk a little bit about that with the costumes and their and their

361
00:19:03.791 --> 00:19:07.530
powers and everything.
Cause you know,
you had,
you know,
Wasabi,

362
00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:11.320
he has basically lightsaber hands is essentially what he has a,
Fred has a,

363
00:19:11.321 --> 00:19:12.700
is a fire breathing monster,
you know,

364
00:19:12.701 --> 00:19:16.720
Bay Max has his karate skills and Gogo has the,
you know,
wheel discs.

365
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.780
Honey has the purse bombs and purse.
Not Terrible.
Right.

366
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:27.300
I like it.
Some balls we called scream then to respond.

367
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:32.690
<v 4>But the incredible thing with hero is that actually he doesn't have anything.</v>

368
00:19:32.691 --> 00:19:35.310
He just has this suit and Baymax and he needs Baymax and,

369
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.390
but that was very particular and very specific to your character where it was,

370
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.900
you're kind of nothing without but not nothing,
but you're not,
you need baymax.

371
00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.280
Yeah.
It's funny you go,

372
00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.390
you go all the way back to kind of the origin and big hero six and you see

373
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:54.510
hero's role and it's still very much the same thing from the comic book till the

374
00:19:55.091 --> 00:19:59.720
film.
He is,
he is the strategist.
He is the guy who figures out the plan.
Um,

375
00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.910
and he's the guy that,
you know,
um,

376
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.910
he's basically like it these guys form like Voltron and I'm stealing a line from

377
00:20:06.911 --> 00:20:11.500
the Wu Tang clan hero is the head.
Um,
and,

378
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:14.680
uh,
yeah,
you know,
he doesn't have any,
you know,
he doesn't,
he didn't,

379
00:20:14.681 --> 00:20:18.340
he didn't add anything to a suit except for the fact that he connects to Bay
Max.

380
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.110
Um,
and yeah,
I mean,
you,
when you watch the film,
you,

381
00:20:23.111 --> 00:20:27.970
you hear him kind of call out,
oh,
do this,
do that.
And,
um,
it,

382
00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.910
it,
it's great because everyone's powers could,

383
00:20:30.911 --> 00:20:34.450
they come together really nicely and everyone's skills and,
um,

384
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:37.420
their intellect come together in a way that they can work together as a team

385
00:20:37.421 --> 00:20:38.254
really well

386
00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.040
<v 6>is important.
Uh,
early on,
you know,
when we first started developing it,
that,
um,</v>

387
00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:46.000
I just made a choice to not have super beings in this movie.

388
00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.100
Um,
I felt like there was

389
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.270
<v 1>a lot of that.
And,
uh,
I liked the challenge of creating the,</v>

390
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.210
really the superpower in the movie is their intelligence.
It's super tech really,

391
00:20:55.211 --> 00:20:59.590
and the,
and the smarts of the,
of these characters.
And,
and,
uh,
it,
it led us down,

392
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.700
you know,
interesting.
Cause it made us research more and boy,
I mean we found,

393
00:21:03.701 --> 00:21:08.200
you know,
so many really cool maglev technology.
We researched that and uh,

394
00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:08.411
you know,

395
00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:12.850
even telekinesis for heroes microbots which we thought was a crazy Scifi kind of

396
00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:14.860
thing.
It turns out that,
you know,

397
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:18.250
there are people working on some rudimentary aspects of telekinesis.

398
00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:22.720
So like probably us,
right?
Probably Google.
Um,
so,

399
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:26.530
but uh,
you know,
and I think it paid off and that the,
you know,
that they do feel,

400
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:29.140
you know,
they're,
they're mortal beings.
They're just kids.

401
00:21:29.141 --> 00:21:30.400
They're just call it really go,
goes.

402
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:32.800
Really the only one that has any business being a superhero to be honest with

403
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:35.020
you at two carries the team for a while,
carries him a little bit.

404
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.500
But it is a sort of celebration of sort of the maker movement and Super

405
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.520
Technology.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They're all smart.
I mean,

406
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.960
they're all smart kids and we celebrate that and they have a lot of potential.

407
00:21:46.961 --> 00:21:49.480
And that's one of the things the movie talks about is that each of us has

408
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:50.860
potential.
And what are you going to do with it?

409
00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:53.140
Are you gonna do something selfish or selfless with it?

410
00:21:53.141 --> 00:21:55.450
And if this movie in any way inspire science,

411
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.260
<v 4>terrific curiosity,
then,
then that's a good thing.
Yeah,</v>

412
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.200
I do want to double back because these guys may not think they had anything to

413
00:22:02.201 --> 00:22:04.210
do with actually the look of their character,

414
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.710
but essentially their performances are what finally shaped the character.

415
00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.260
We don't do,
you know,
we,

416
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:13.930
we don't do anything with the character until we have that voice.
And so,

417
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.440
you know,
slight design changes and you know,

418
00:22:17.441 --> 00:22:19.510
all kinds of things in terms of costume,

419
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:24.420
it's all a result of your performance and the body language as well.
Absolutely.

420
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.660
Absolutely.
You know,
what was kind of the balance of,
you know,

421
00:22:28.661 --> 00:22:32.140
you're taking this very obscure marvel property and try and translating that

422
00:22:32.141 --> 00:22:34.690
into,
you know,
uh,
you know,
the guys,
you know,

423
00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.550
Disney marvel just did it with gardens and galaxy.

424
00:22:36.551 --> 00:22:39.610
You guys are doing with big hero six kind of introducing this and kind of find

425
00:22:39.611 --> 00:22:42.640
that balance of respecting the original property,
but also making it your own.

426
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.200
And it gets,
you know,
looking back to the original,

427
00:22:44.201 --> 00:22:47.410
because I didn't really know it and I was looking at some of it crosses but
some,

428
00:22:47.411 --> 00:22:47.670
but you know,

429
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:52.120
some characters are different and I mean Baymax is completely way better than

430
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:53.580
the original.
Yeah,
yeah.

431
00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.320
<v 1>Uh,
well in,
in,</v>

432
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.300
it actually came from one of the first meeting we have with marvel when we win.

433
00:22:59.330 --> 00:22:59.560
You know,

434
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.550
I pitched several ideas to John based on marvel ideas and he gravitated towards

435
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:06.770
big hero six and as did the other directors,
you know,
we,

436
00:23:06.771 --> 00:23:08.480
we generally pitch stuff to all the other directors.

437
00:23:08.481 --> 00:23:10.070
We all kind of work on each other's stuff,
you know,

438
00:23:10.071 --> 00:23:13.850
and everybody seemed to gravitate towards the big hero six.
And uh,
uh,

439
00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:17.120
marvel was super cool with it and they just said,
don't worry,

440
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.730
you don't have to worry about setting this in the marvel universe.

441
00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:23.210
You don't have to worry about iron man and captain American.

442
00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.410
And everybody showed up,
you know,

443
00:23:24.411 --> 00:23:25.910
they were really encouraged us to make it our own.

444
00:23:25.911 --> 00:23:28.610
And that's what led to San Fran Soko.
If it's not the marvel universe,

445
00:23:28.611 --> 00:23:32.600
which is generally New York City in the,
in the real world,
um,
you know,

446
00:23:32.601 --> 00:23:36.740
then what is our world that led to San Francisco?
And,
and ultimately,
you know,

447
00:23:36.741 --> 00:23:39.800
they were,
they gave us complete freedom to kind of make this our own.

448
00:23:39.801 --> 00:23:41.440
And so we ended up,
you know,

449
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:45.530
really kind of taking the characters names and we tried to base their tech on

450
00:23:45.531 --> 00:23:48.340
something from the comic book loosely.
Um,

451
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.040
but baymax really Wa is a kind of a whole new character.

452
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:56.240
And that came from our research.
You know,
I did a robotics tour very early on,

453
00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:00.470
about three and a half years ago actually.
And,
uh,
uh,
Harvard,
Mit,

454
00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:04.070
and actually Carnegie Mellon was where I found a researcher named Chris Atkinson

455
00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:05.630
who was doing research in soft robotics.

456
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.470
And you guys are probably working on it too.
But,
um,
but,
uh,

457
00:24:09.471 --> 00:24:12.880
I met Chris Adkisson and,
and,
uh,
you know,
I'd never seen eighth.

458
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.470
I was on the hunt for something unique.
I,
you know,

459
00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:18.650
I knew it was gonna be a challenge to put a,
you know,
a unique robot on screen.

460
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.660
We've seen so many,
uh,
and not only that,

461
00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:23.900
but he had to be appealing and huggable everybody kept saying it's gotta be

462
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.240
huggable robot.
So when I saw that soft robotics,

463
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.750
that's when I knew that we'd found our Baymax.
And so his,
his character,

464
00:24:29.751 --> 00:24:32.450
his personality,
everything from Baymax came from that research trip.

465
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:37.220
And the fact that it stems from a more obscure property is actually really

466
00:24:37.221 --> 00:24:40.250
served us because it meant the audience wasn't going to bring any preconceived

467
00:24:40.251 --> 00:24:42.950
notions about what the character should be,
where the story should be.

468
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:46.670
It was one thing you can't emphasize enough is how fluid our story environment

469
00:24:46.671 --> 00:24:47.270
is.

470
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.170
We spend years crafting the story and it changes quite a bit over the course of

471
00:24:51.171 --> 00:24:52.004
that journey.

472
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:55.700
And the whole system is designed to be constantly questioning your assumptions

473
00:24:55.701 --> 00:24:58.200
about the story.
And so it changed dramatically.
So,
you know,

474
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.050
one thing you know is whatever you start out with,

475
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.240
you're going to end up with something else at the end of the journey.

476
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.450
So better to start with something that people don't have a fixed idea of what it

477
00:25:05.451 --> 00:25:08.840
should be.
Interesting for.
You know,
the development of characters.

478
00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:09.830
You kind of brought in that,
you know,

479
00:25:09.831 --> 00:25:11.690
the story is constantly changing and you guys are probably brought in,

480
00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.480
I'm guessing several times to do audio now.

481
00:25:14.481 --> 00:25:17.000
Is there any thought to bring it in these actors,
maybe even sooner,

482
00:25:17.001 --> 00:25:18.260
maybe earlier in the process,

483
00:25:18.261 --> 00:25:21.260
kind of when you're developing the characters or you still trust trying to find

484
00:25:21.261 --> 00:25:22.071
them and find their voice,

485
00:25:22.071 --> 00:25:25.010
but would it be easier almost to find the actors first and then kind of develop

486
00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:29.000
the character from there or is that they are part of the process?
Yeah,
I mean,

487
00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:31.970
yeah.
For for you,
for years you guys have been involved,
right?

488
00:25:31.971 --> 00:25:34.700
For a year and a half or so.
Oh,
is that right?
I mean,
yeah,

489
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:38.120
even when they audition,
I mean we had pages,
but it was kind of like,
okay,

490
00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:39.910
take it and do whatever.
You know?

491
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:44.990
I really encourage them to bring a lot of themselves to it and bring any kind of

492
00:25:44.991 --> 00:25:46.190
Improv because again,

493
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:50.150
it keeps it fresh and for us and when they were not,

494
00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:53.090
the characters were definitely not baked.
When when you guys came in,

495
00:25:53.091 --> 00:25:57.760
I mean you had huge impact on defining these characters and yeah,

496
00:25:57.761 --> 00:25:59.270
the,
the,
the,
the

497
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.700
<v 4>sure we'll be always evolving.
The scenes will be changing.</v>

498
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:06.701
So you guys will be asked to come in and rerecord the scene over and over and

499
00:26:06.711 --> 00:26:09.830
over again and I've always really impressed by your patients

500
00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.181
or we probably didn't.

501
00:26:12.181 --> 00:26:16.870
I am going to use how many recording sessions with you for 15 more than 20 and

502
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.020
they could be four or five hour sessions and it was pretty demanding and you

503
00:26:21.021 --> 00:26:24.950
guys never lost faith,
I felt,
you know what I mean?
Every reason to,

504
00:26:24.951 --> 00:26:27.560
I think because you're seeing scenes change over and over and over again.

505
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:34.390
Being able to come in so many times I was able to see how the script evolved and

506
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:35.190
I just thought it was,

507
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:38.540
he kept going and like I already thought it was phenomenal,

508
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:42.910
but then it just kept evolving and becoming better and better and better.
And um,

509
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.510
I mean every time,
every time I came in,
it was just,

510
00:26:45.511 --> 00:26:50.310
I was happy to see that I had that it could get better.
I don't know.

511
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:53.130
It was a weird,
I was like,
it's not going to get any better than this.
And it did.

512
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:58.410
It's an interesting thing for you because your character isn't most of the

513
00:26:58.411 --> 00:26:58.791
films.

514
00:26:58.791 --> 00:27:02.550
So you saw most of the script because these guys only see really the chunks of

515
00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:05.530
the script that they're in.
And so,
you know,

516
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.950
he was able to see the kind of arc developing.

517
00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:11.700
You guys probably had a little bit more what's going on here.

518
00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.000
I'm glad you guys were able to finally settle on an opening.

519
00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.770
<v 1>The film is,
that's always the last thing.
The last thing,</v>

520
00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:21.830
if there were so many versions of the first scene of the movie,

521
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.540
to Roy's point though,
we never read,

522
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:29.080
I wouldn't say we ever really have a finished script,
you know,
um,
to,

523
00:27:29.081 --> 00:27:31.180
to hand out because,
because of that evolution,

524
00:27:31.181 --> 00:27:33.880
I mean there may be a complete script at one point,

525
00:27:33.881 --> 00:27:36.880
but it's never done in an our terms,
you know?

526
00:27:36.881 --> 00:27:39.670
And so we can't really ever had out of finish group cause it doesn't exist

527
00:27:39.671 --> 00:27:42.750
really until the movie's done.
We keep iterating and iterating and iterating.

528
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:46.050
And so there's no version of like a shooting script,
you know,
in light of action.

529
00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:49.810
In a sense.
It's the shooting script is like when it's done and it's,

530
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.060
that's the shooting script.
Yeah.
Oh there it is.
Yeah.

531
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.020
<v 4>There is there all time.
And for you three,
you know,
with,</v>

532
00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.870
with anytime you're acting,
you're always a character.
Right.

533
00:27:58.871 --> 00:28:01.420
And so what were kind of your inspirations of trying to bring these characters

534
00:28:01.421 --> 00:28:04.540
to life?
You know,
was it yourself?
Was it a sibling?
Was it another actor?

535
00:28:04.541 --> 00:28:07.150
Was it something from your childhood?
You know,
what was kind of bringing about,

536
00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.600
um,
cause obviously you're not,
you know,
14 and you know,
20 year old and so,

537
00:28:10.601 --> 00:28:15.400
you know,
in college,
um,
man,
it's,

538
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.460
it's funny because everyone keeps asking the question,

539
00:28:18.461 --> 00:28:21.620
how are you similar into your character?
And well we,

540
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.600
I don't really have any differences from here other than the fact that he's,

541
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.950
he's much smarter than I am
but,

542
00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:34.240
but certain ways in certain ways.
But besides that,
we're so,

543
00:28:34.241 --> 00:28:38.230
I mean we're so similar and even obviously the body language and you know,

544
00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:43.150
the way you see hero onscreen that's attributed to the animators.
Um,

545
00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.660
but I didn't have to change my voice at all for the project.

546
00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:51.580
It's my voice during,
through and what was written on the page.

547
00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.810
I feel like things have already gone through things I've already experienced.
Um,

548
00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:00.370
things I've said even.
And,
um,
obviously when I was able to Improv,

549
00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:02.950
I was able to bring more of myself to him.
But honestly,

550
00:29:02.951 --> 00:29:04.810
every time I went in there was nothing I had to do.

551
00:29:04.811 --> 00:29:07.180
All I did was walked through the door.
They started recording,

552
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.090
I read lines off off a page and it was just

553
00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:11.350
<v 5>was me.
Yeah,</v>

554
00:29:11.351 --> 00:29:14.800
I think you're going to see a parallel because there's a reason why they hired

555
00:29:14.801 --> 00:29:19.700
us.
Thank God.
You know,
so you're going to see some resemblances.

556
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.720
But I feel like for my character,
you know,

557
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:26.290
they gave me a great direction and it was,
she's,

558
00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.690
she's the female version of Clint Eastwood,
you know,

559
00:29:28.691 --> 00:29:30.460
she doesn't have a lot to say,
but when she says it,

560
00:29:30.461 --> 00:29:33.790
it's just straight to the point.
Um,
so that was really helpful.

561
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:37.390
So what you're saying is you're the easiest job because you only had so crazy.

562
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:42.480
<v 1>We had to learn to escape though.
Will,
yeah,</v>

563
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.260
we had to ask her to be mean sometimes.

564
00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:47.110
It was sort of breaking away from who you actually are,

565
00:29:47.111 --> 00:29:51.010
I think more mean for me to get pushy here.
Nastier.
Nastier.

566
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.950
So was there any room for improvisation?
Because you mentioned that,

567
00:29:53.951 --> 00:29:57.190
so you've got to Improv a little bit.
Oh yeah,
for sure.

568
00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.493
Yeah.

569
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.680
There's sections where it's a blur because I had so much fun.
I was like,

570
00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:09.910
I can't believe I went and I got paid for it.
All you guys would say,

571
00:30:09.911 --> 00:30:12.660
can I try something?
And the answer is always yes,

572
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:14.800
always has to be asked because you might get great stuff.

573
00:30:14.801 --> 00:30:18.070
And also you want to see their interpretation of the scene,
the moment,

574
00:30:18.071 --> 00:30:18.904
the character,

575
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.700
and you want to create that environment where where everyone's point of view is

576
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.190
worth listening to.
So yeah,
it was,

577
00:30:24.191 --> 00:30:26.890
you guys offered so much great stuff that was off page.

578
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:33.640
It's also cool to see it in the final it when it's done,
you go,

579
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.540
oh my line made it like,
you're like,
oh,
no way.
Yes,

580
00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:41.980
they approve.
You know,
Tj,

581
00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.340
I'm sure it was just,
I was just constantly,
no,

582
00:30:45.341 --> 00:30:49.840
he's stuck to the script the whole time.
Oh,
there's a
great teacher.

583
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:54.190
He's a crazy man,
isn't him?
Well Scott,
interestingly enough though,

584
00:30:54.191 --> 00:30:57.580
was probably the most scripted character cause Baymax you know,
he,

585
00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:02.640
we were pretty strict with him and how he is syntax and how he speaks and,

586
00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:05.620
and it was,
it was all very kind of scripted out.

587
00:31:05.621 --> 00:31:09.280
And Scott is such an amazing actor and improper that he could find nuances

588
00:31:09.281 --> 00:31:13.750
within lines to make them funny or actually to make them,
you know,

589
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:17.520
tug at your heartstrings,
you know?
And,
and that's just testament to how,
you know,

590
00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:21.490
cause we really kind of him to him as far as,
yeah,

591
00:31:21.491 --> 00:31:25.160
he had a very tight envelope with which to act.
But he did a great job.
Yeah.

592
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.610
I was going to ask about it backs because I know Scott's not here,

593
00:31:27.611 --> 00:31:31.770
but his character is,
it's so interesting like his voice and how you,

594
00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:32.740
how do you even find Scott,

595
00:31:32.741 --> 00:31:36.070
because it's gotta be hard to cast the boys cause you're probably going with,

596
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.650
you know,
trying to figure out what's going to be a robot voice.
You know,

597
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:42.880
we looked at,
yeah,
I looked at several,
lost a few right.

598
00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.210
And the 40 ish,
I don't know.
But,
uh,
and,
and you know,

599
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.140
there was a certain,
definitely had something in mind,
you know,

600
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:55.470
that it had to be that kind of calm,
soothing,
kind of peaceful,
you know,

601
00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.600
cheerful tone.
Cause he's a nurse and he,
that's how he views the world.
And,
and,

602
00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:03.310
and so we're really looking for the right tonality.
And then when Scott came in,

603
00:32:03.311 --> 00:32:06.460
he was really good at,
he brought that idea of,
um,
you know,

604
00:32:06.461 --> 00:32:10.360
like when you call a call center and it's not a human being on the other end,

605
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.910
there's always that weird pause in between words.
You know,

606
00:32:12.911 --> 00:32:16.420
Scott brought that in there and it seemed to really fit the character and it,

607
00:32:16.421 --> 00:32:20.260
was there anything that was really just so crazy and wild,

608
00:32:20.261 --> 00:32:21.490
but she really wanted it in the film,

609
00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:24.580
but it just didn't fit or you just got to cut it or,

610
00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.270
that's a hard question.
There were scenes the fall,

611
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:32.320
the villain's plot a little more that were really fun and cinematic but

612
00:32:32.321 --> 00:32:36.670
ultimately didn't serve the stories so they had to go.
Yeah,
you just can't,

613
00:32:36.671 --> 00:32:39.860
you know,
when you're making an animated film,
unlike a live action film,
you know,

614
00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:41.140
there is,
uh,
you know,

615
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:46.100
we are generally in the 85 to 90 minute range and can't really go too much

616
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:51.020
beyond that.
Um,
for many reasons actually.
And so it does make you like,

617
00:32:51.021 --> 00:32:55.040
be like,
you have to Sorta kill your babies as far as like,
okay,
does that work?

618
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.170
Does it not?
Does that further the story?
Does it not?
And,

619
00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:02.480
and you gotta be really hardcore,
you know,
a kill your darlings.

620
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:07.700
We know.
Everybody knows the term.
Right.
It's like,
Whoa,
the family.
Uh,

621
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:11.450
but,
uh,
so,
you know,
you do have to make those tough choices.
So there were,
yeah,

622
00:33:11.451 --> 00:33:14.360
we did follow the villains story a little bit and they were very cool cinematic

623
00:33:14.361 --> 00:33:17.120
scenes.
But,
um,
I just didn't further heroes emotional story,

624
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:18.320
which had to be the main story.

625
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:21.830
So it was there any point where you just got completely stuck and you were just,

626
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:25.230
this is not going to work cause I know every film baseband and yeah,

627
00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:28.100
birth is just,
it's,
you know,
it's not good.

628
00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:33.080
<v 6>Sure.
Yeah.
I mean the,
the,
we,
we put up a series of screenings,</v>

629
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:35.890
which are a story reels,
um,
uh,

630
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.740
storyboards with music and dialogue and sound effects.
And,
and we put up,

631
00:33:39.741 --> 00:33:43.700
I think it's seven or eight versions of the story of wheels internally over the

632
00:33:43.701 --> 00:33:48.650
course of making the movie.
And at the,
after every screening,
uh,

633
00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:51.500
you get lots of opinions and lots of ideas not to feedback.

634
00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:55.730
And you're in a position to do lots of soul searching about what you think is

635
00:33:55.731 --> 00:33:59.090
working,
what's not working,
what your vision of the film was,

636
00:33:59.091 --> 00:34:03.770
what it now has to be.
Cause that's constantly evolving as well.
And,
uh,

637
00:34:03.771 --> 00:34:06.590
and there,
there are moments where you think,
well,

638
00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.420
I don't know if we can crack this one.
You know,
were we,

639
00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:12.350
this was a very ambitious story plot wise.
And as far as the emotional storyline,

640
00:34:12.351 --> 00:34:16.580
very ambitious.
Um,
and,
and there were certainly moments where we thought,
boy,

641
00:34:16.581 --> 00:34:18.590
I don't know if we're going to be able to crack this one,

642
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:22.610
but somebody would keep talking,
you know,
so we just keep going and,

643
00:34:22.611 --> 00:34:24.580
and the machine would just keep,
we,

644
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:27.610
there's about eight or 10 people in that story room,

645
00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:32.010
a sitting across the table from each other,
uh,
for days on end.
At the end.

646
00:34:32.011 --> 00:34:34.400
That process goes for years.
And a,

647
00:34:34.401 --> 00:34:38.060
and somebody will always be that spark plug that fires up the conversation and

648
00:34:38.061 --> 00:34:42.620
keeps it going and,
and we all fire off a of each other.
And so,

649
00:34:42.621 --> 00:34:45.200
um,
there might have been those,
those moments of doubt,

650
00:34:45.201 --> 00:34:49.070
but we're the people that we're surrounded by,
it doesn't take very long.

651
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:52.800
<v 3>We're very fortunate in the sense that we have this story trust and it's all the</v>

652
00:34:52.801 --> 00:34:55.960
directors that work on all the films and you know,
we,

653
00:34:55.990 --> 00:35:00.400
we meet after every screening and have these great offsites and,
and,

654
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.450
and discuss,
um,
you know,
specific notes.

655
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:07.650
But there were two moments that I remember that were really,
uh,
essential.

656
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:12.210
We did one offsite and we brought in a psychologist and a couple of social

657
00:35:12.211 --> 00:35:14.280
workers to talk about teenage loss.

658
00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:19.610
And that really kind of solidified hero story in our minds that kind of like

659
00:35:20.881 --> 00:35:22.230
took us in the right direction.

660
00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:26.850
And then the other moment was when we discovered that it was really Baymax who

661
00:35:26.851 --> 00:35:31.200
had to drive the story.
He was the one who actually gets the team together.

662
00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:36.510
And once that happened,
then kind of the pieces started falling into place.

663
00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.040
That happened around the fourth

664
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.550
<v 4>screening.
And so then the next,
you know,</v>

665
00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:44.850
four screenings were about getting all the other elements functioning.

666
00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:46.900
Absolutely.
We're going to do some Q and a as well.
Uh,

667
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:49.560
people wanna start getting up to the microphone,
but you have any questions.
But,

668
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:50.520
you know,

669
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.420
something I want to talk about too was what was just your guys' favorite part of

670
00:35:54.421 --> 00:35:55.380
the movie?
You know,
I,
I,

671
00:35:55.381 --> 00:35:57.990
there was a few of those and there's a couple parts where,
you know,

672
00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.660
Disney socks you in the gut and you just start crying,
you know,
and it's just,

673
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.900
it's a,
some heartbreaking moments,
but there's gotta be some,
you know,

674
00:36:03.901 --> 00:36:07.380
the hero seeing stuff,
but what,
what,
you know,
senior reflection.
But you know,
Roy,

675
00:36:07.381 --> 00:36:09.030
we'll kind of start with you and kind of be aligned.
You know,

676
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:12.960
that scene that I love the most is when they're walking into the a hall for the

677
00:36:12.961 --> 00:36:17.400
showcase and it's there and they're rolling in the microbots in the,
uh,

678
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:22.140
in the,
uh,
little containers.
And it's just,
it's the team,

679
00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:23.340
it's the team together,

680
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.330
just goofing around and talking and trying to pep him up.

681
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:32.380
And it's so real and it's so gentle and yet,
you know,
it's,

682
00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:36.780
it's a bunch of kids just shooting the breeze,
you know,

683
00:36:36.781 --> 00:36:40.860
and it just,
for that moment,
I see them together for the first time.

684
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:45.060
I see them as a team,
I see them as friends,
I see them as buttons,
you know,

685
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:45.953
and it,
it,

686
00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.270
it's a kind of a special scene and it's simple or we,

687
00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.780
we already touched on it.
I mean,

688
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:55.320
my favorite thing in the whole film was actually that was that look,

689
00:36:55.321 --> 00:37:00.321
when I look when hero looks into and to the glass and he's basically does what I

690
00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:04.400
do in my everyday life.
Um,
but I,
I,

691
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.080
the opening is a great scene.
Um,
it's just,

692
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:10.260
it's a lot of fun on the first flight sequence is great.

693
00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:13.620
<v 5>Just one,
Brian,</v>

694
00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:17.590
you are not listening and then the end and then this and,

695
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:22.990
and there's just so many great moments that really are okay.
Um,

696
00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:28.170
my favorite scene is when you see the team trying out their deer and perfecting

697
00:37:28.721 --> 00:37:31.930
it with heath cliff.
That's very funny to me.

698
00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.170
Your carriage is very sweet in that scene.

699
00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:38.950
Drunk.

700
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:43.950
Baymax no battery Baymax is probably the funniest things ever.

701
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.080
Yeah.
Whoever.
I would just keep them on low.
Hanging out.

702
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.120
You like the drunk version better?
Yeah.

703
00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.660
Hilarious.
Yeah.

704
00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:57.590
<v 6>Um,</v>

705
00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:00.740
well there there's a couple scenes I actually don't want to talk about too much

706
00:38:00.741 --> 00:38:04.190
because of spoilers and things,
but um,
one scene that,

707
00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.840
that I love and it's,

708
00:38:05.841 --> 00:38:10.730
I think it's a credit to the way that we build our stories is after the,

709
00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.091
uh,

710
00:38:11.091 --> 00:38:14.300
the first flight seem where heroes riding on Bay Max from the city for the first

711
00:38:14.301 --> 00:38:14.750
time.

712
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.870
There was a very quiet moment where they're sitting on top of wind turbine above

713
00:38:17.871 --> 00:38:22.100
the clouds and,
uh,
and there's,
there's a stillness and a,

714
00:38:22.101 --> 00:38:26.540
and I think a very,
uh,
a good kind of sentimentality to that scene.

715
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:28.930
And,
uh,
I'm,
I'm very proud of it and it's,

716
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:31.490
it's a scene that came very late in the game for us.
Um,

717
00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:36.010
it was only after years of,
of,
of all of the story evolving and

718
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.130
<v 1>working on the structure that we realized that,
that we were,</v>

719
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:40.990
we were missing something.
We're missing that scene.
And once we had it,

720
00:38:40.991 --> 00:38:45.400
we couldn't imagine how we ever had had a version of the movie without it.
Um,

721
00:38:45.401 --> 00:38:50.110
so I love that scene and I love what it says about our process that it even

722
00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:54.430
exists.
Yeah.
And for me,
the first flight sequences,
uh,

723
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:58.150
was the near and dear to my heart and it was in every version of every screening

724
00:38:58.151 --> 00:39:02.620
we ever did.
And,
uh,
and it never really integrated until we came up.

725
00:39:02.621 --> 00:39:05.620
It was Jon laster actually that came up with the idea that that Bay Max was

726
00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:08.370
going to kind of go on a dare devil,
uh,

727
00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.960
flight through San Francisco in order to boost heroes,

728
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:15.460
neuro transmitter levels and get them to feel excited.
And uh,
but it also,

729
00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.810
to me it was the ultimate,

730
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:19.960
this movie to me is like either a moments in this film where I'm like eight

731
00:39:19.961 --> 00:39:23.680
years old and I,
and I know how I would feel about watching that in the theater.

732
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.160
And that's one of those scenes where I just know my year old self would go

733
00:39:27.161 --> 00:39:29.050
bananas for it.
So it's my favorite city.

734
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:31.360
So That's interesting cause I was going to ask about that too.

735
00:39:31.361 --> 00:39:33.760
So there's that scene.
Was it through every iteration?

736
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:36.850
So we're going to double those.
It didn't work until we came.

737
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.630
John came up with that idea.
Um,
well like if at the end for instance,

738
00:39:40.631 --> 00:39:43.160
the beginning of the film with a Bot fight that was in the first version of a

739
00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:46.630
couple of versions of the film and then kind of went away and meandered back in

740
00:39:46.631 --> 00:39:48.100
and that often happens,
you know,

741
00:39:48.101 --> 00:39:50.980
just because we're trying out stuff and throw it away,

742
00:39:50.981 --> 00:39:52.090
it doesn't work in this context,

743
00:39:52.091 --> 00:39:54.340
but then you pull it back out and now it works in a new context.

744
00:39:54.341 --> 00:39:56.280
So the first flight was in every version slide.

745
00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.810
<v 4>Maybe he just needed the right context.
Yeah,
exactly.
You need it.</v>

746
00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.180
The characters and you know,
where are you?

747
00:40:01.181 --> 00:40:04.270
You could probably jump in here too with the technological challenges cause you

748
00:40:04.271 --> 00:40:05.800
have Baymax is something,

749
00:40:05.801 --> 00:40:09.040
I don't think we've really seen it in terms of a character.
No know he's crazy.

750
00:40:09.041 --> 00:40:11.740
You know and I'm sure that character,
it must have been crazy for the animators.

751
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:14.500
And then you also have,
uh,
the microbots,

752
00:40:14.501 --> 00:40:18.460
which are just this beautiful,
amazing thing of them coming together.

753
00:40:18.461 --> 00:40:21.250
I kind of want to talk about the technological challenges with that and making

754
00:40:21.251 --> 00:40:22.084
that all time.

755
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.290
<v 3>Well,
you're,
you're,
you're hitting two great teams that we have.</v>

756
00:40:25.291 --> 00:40:26.490
One is tech at him.
They,

757
00:40:26.491 --> 00:40:31.110
they basically work after animation and make sure that that vinyl was actually

758
00:40:31.111 --> 00:40:35.880
vinyl.
I mean it is amazing before the folds and how the vinyl moves,

759
00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:39.450
that's all tech anim and that's just an amazing team that we work with.

760
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:44.210
And then our effects team who came up with so much in,

761
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:48.750
in this film,
I mean,
you know,
it's kind of interesting.
If you were to take,

762
00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:53.280
um,
San Francisco in the world that we built in this film,

763
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:56.610
you could fit tangled,
you could fit,
wreck it,
Ralph,

764
00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.860
and you could fit frozen into this world.

765
00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:04.190
It was so amazing what we're able to accomplish just in terms of,

766
00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:09.410
you know,
a rendering power in terms of the animation and all the,

767
00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.390
the nuance that's there.
It's,
it's brilliant.

768
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:15.120
<v 4>Yeah.
It's,
it's visually beautiful.
I mean,
it's just crazy.
And again,</v>

769
00:41:15.121 --> 00:41:18.030
Baymax is just one of those characters I don't think we've ever seen on screen

770
00:41:18.031 --> 00:41:20.050
before.
Now,
you know,
and some of the crazy goal,

771
00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:24.240
<v 3>we were rendering like 1.1 million hours per night.</v>

772
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:29.000
We had 50,000 cores running this thing.
I mean it was insane.
He's saying,

773
00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.470
you know,
kind of one of the last things is can we kind of wrap it up?

774
00:41:31.471 --> 00:41:34.070
I don't think there's anyone for the Q and a,
but uh,
for,
uh,

775
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.520
<v 4>the,
you know,
there's a lot of Easter eggs and a lot of heart bags to,
yeah,</v>

776
00:41:37.521 --> 00:41:39.830
I think,
you know,
I kind of want to tell viewers,
you know,

777
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:42.330
I think basically in Fred's room I saw a ton of stuff.
Yeah.

778
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:45.800
A little bit in heroes.
Yeah.
The big window.
I'm not going to reveal what it is,

779
00:41:45.801 --> 00:41:48.140
but the window,
is that designed after something and Heroes Room?

780
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:50.440
The round window?
Yeah.
I don't know.

781
00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:53.050
It wasn't done and it looks like a Pokemon ball.
Oh.

782
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.480
I don't know if that's intentional or not.

783
00:41:55.481 --> 00:41:58.180
Or are you talking about in today's she's lab or,
yeah,
I'm sorry.
Yeah,
actually,

784
00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:00.440
no.
You know what that was from a research.
Uh,

785
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:05.500
there is a robotics lab at MIT that I visited that had that kind of turret,

786
00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:08.000
like window can have like the Millennium Falcon.

787
00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.450
And so that always stuck in my head and based it on that.

788
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:15.420
But we can say Pokemon that's built.
There you go.
I only got like a,

789
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:18.800
there are lots of Easter eggs and we have lots of marvel fans and obviously

790
00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:21.260
people proud of the Disney history yeah.
In our building.

791
00:42:21.261 --> 00:42:24.350
And so they were placing lots of Easter eggs to the point where don and I had to

792
00:42:24.351 --> 00:42:27.520
tell him to knock it off or just too many.
We actually pulled a couple out,

793
00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:30.300
lock it down.
Great.
Great.
Um,

794
00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:32.780
I think that's all we have time for because we've got to wrap this up.

795
00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:37.970
Thank you guys so much for being here.
