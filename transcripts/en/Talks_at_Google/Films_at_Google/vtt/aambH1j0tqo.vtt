1
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.980
I thought were really just going to jump right into this.
Um,

2
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.350
and so I have questions for each of you.

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.170
We're also going to have time for audience questions.

4
00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:20.120
So at that time if you guys could line up at the mics and then we'll kind of go

5
00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:23.480
back and forth until time runs out.
So that's okay.
Um,

6
00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:27.980
the first question is for Matt,
so just kind of ground us in this story.

7
00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:30.820
Like how did you become interested in the project?
Um,

8
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.810
and why did you decide to tell the story?

9
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.320
<v 2>Um,
well a story core,
the oral history project,</v>

10
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.600
um,
that you may have heard of,

11
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.630
they have recording booths around the country and people do long form

12
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:49.660
conversations that are archived at the library of Congress,
um,

13
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.530
and that are also used to create a radio pieces on NPR.

14
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.330
So they had approached me because they had a queer history initiative.
Um,

15
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.900
and they asked if I could help them find interesting stories.

16
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.230
And I had heard of the phenomena of intergenerational gay adoption,
um,

17
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.300
in a pre marriage era and was interested in finding stories related to it.

18
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:13.743
Um,

19
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.840
and so at the time I was working with a producer who is Walter's knees,

20
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.450
Eric and Nagel,
and,
um,

21
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.220
she had to call Steven Spielberg.
So on the bone that evening,

22
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:30.760
she said I had to cold call Steven Spielberg.
And I said,

23
00:01:30.761 --> 00:01:35.040
I had to cold call the owner of a clothing optional bed and breakfast.

24
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.710
She was adopted by his older lover in the 80s.
And she said,
oh,

25
00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:43.711
my uncle was adopted by his lover and his name is Walter.

26
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:47.170
So I went home and I googled,
you know,

27
00:01:47.171 --> 00:01:52.150
Walter Nagle or last name and she failed to mention that Walter's partner had

28
00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:55.360
been Byard Rustin who I was a huge fan of.

29
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.350
Although I feel that a lot of people don't know who he is.
Um,

30
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.850
despite a very acclaimed documentary called brother outsider that came out in

31
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:08.800
2000 and I believe in,
that's how I had heard of buyers.
So,
um,

32
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.150
you know,
that's how the whole project kind of got started.
Yeah.

33
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.620
<v 0>Thank you for that.
And whilst there,</v>

34
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.630
I feel like we all have so many questions for you,

35
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.440
but I can just ground death in one.
Um,

36
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.420
so you were 27 and buyer,
it was 65.
And so I mean,

37
00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:30.340
just intergenerational interracial,
like just tell us about,
you know,

38
00:02:30.341 --> 00:02:31.250
like that experience,

39
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:34.490
embracing those intersections and like what were some of the challenges and what

40
00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:35.990
were some of the beautiful moments?

41
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.500
<v 3>Well,
when I look back on it now and I,
you know,
here he,</v>

42
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.930
us that kind of a question.
I mean it seems like,
Gee,
I mean,
how did,

43
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.200
how did we do this?
But it was all very,

44
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:52.400
very perfectly natural for us at the time.
Uh,
as I said in the film,

45
00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:56.630
I was kind of an old 27 and borrowed was a very youthful 65.

46
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.600
Uh,
and we really,
you know,
we really shared a common,

47
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.460
common values,
common ideas,
common interest.
And so,
you know,

48
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:09.070
aside from just kind of being attracted me at the time,

49
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:10.360
I was attracted to older guys.

50
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:14.440
That can't be the case too much anymore because they're not that many that are

51
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:18.390
older than me,
so I've moved in the other direction.
Um,

52
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.110
but,
um,
yeah,
I mean,

53
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.480
we really just had a camaraderie.
Um,

54
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.050
just a very comfortable,
it was very,
it was very easy,
very,
very quickly.

55
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.330
Uh,
I think,
you know,
within two months,
I mean,

56
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:37.360
I was still on this kind of San Francisco idea,

57
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.190
but about two months after we left,
I mean,
after we met,
um,

58
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.070
we just kind of agreed that we were going to stay together for awhile.
So,

59
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.290
uh,
as far as the,
you know,
and when we were in a ratio,

60
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:53.500
we're intergenerational,
we were same sex.
It was like,
you know,

61
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.850
what else could there possibly be that could be thrown up on our faces are held

62
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:02.050
against this,
but we just,
you know,
kind of move forward and,
and you know,

63
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:05.320
people that loved us and people that cared for us,
our friends,
our family,

64
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.690
they were all cool with it was,
it was very comfortable.
Yeah.

65
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.400
<v 0>And then Shawn,
you know,
someone who studied academically,
you know,</v>

66
00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:16.840
race and ethnic studies,
um,

67
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:20.390
and also someone who was also younger and also African American.

68
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.880
Like how did you first learn about bio Breslin?
Um,
and,
you know,

69
00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:26.730
what were your thoughts kind of before the film and then how has the film

70
00:04:26.731 --> 00:04:29.760
informed,
you know,
how you think about him and how you think about his legacy?

71
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.740
<v 4>Yeah,
so I'm going to try to get through each question here.
Um,</v>

72
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.360
but I arrived at Byard Rustin when I was in college.

73
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.090
Um,
I,
you know,

74
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.960
I consider myself a very good student of history prior to college,

75
00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:50.070
but I noticed in our history books,
Byard restroom was purposely left out.

76
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.080
Um,
and you know,

77
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.410
given what we know about us history and how it's taught k through 12,
um,

78
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.620
we know that black history general generally has a very small portion are

79
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.470
located in those history books.

80
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:08.920
So it makes sense why Byard would be left out as a marginalized person,
uh,

81
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.710
being queer.
Um,

82
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.800
but having arrived at him in college as I was coming into my own sexual identity

83
00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:20.390
as a black gay man,
um,
I took hold so Byard,

84
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.250
um,
in a way that a lot of my peers did not.

85
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.760
I really wanted to research him and study him and learn a little bit more about

86
00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:27.594
his life.

87
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.630
Just so that I can see how things have changed since he kind of lived his life,

88
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.810
kind of came into his own sexuality,
live within the movement as well.
Um,

89
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:39.690
and see,
you know,

90
00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:44.691
kind of how that can kind of put some kind of focus on what I'm doing,

91
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:48.870
where I locate myself within the black queer community today and the 21st

92
00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:50.280
century.
Um,

93
00:05:50.281 --> 00:05:54.750
so watching the documentary was very eyeopening for me.
Um,

94
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.920
I had previously known that,
you know,
by addressing,

95
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.080
had been in a long term partnership with someone who was white.
Um,

96
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.010
having had been,
uh,
very,
uh,
you know,

97
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.220
this thing which president within the civil rights movement.
Um,
so I,

98
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.230
I took very serious interest in this because,
um,

99
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.640
I considered it a very hot button issue for a lot of people.

100
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:21.880
People would consider that to be,
um,

101
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.210
kind of taboo as you mentioned in the documentary.
Um,
so,
you know,

102
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:30.920
seeing the documentary really plants or perspective how his,
um,

103
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.780
how has Quaker upbringing really helped him come to terms with some of the

104
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:39.800
decisions he's made,
especially when it came to his personal life as well.
Um,

105
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.150
so just seeing how those things kind of overlaps,
um,
how his personal politics,

106
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.260
um,
kind of channeled into his,
um,
his love life,
um,

107
00:06:49.261 --> 00:06:52.880
as well.
Um,
I think it was cool to see those,
those layers there.

108
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.860
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
thank you.
And I love how they're like three distinct,
um,</v>

109
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.100
kind of different views and perspectives on buyer.

110
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:04.380
And that's what really we're really looking to kind of show here.
And,
um,

111
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.930
this is a question for all of you and feel.
Matt,
I was reading an article,
um,

112
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.560
that you were quoted in and you talked about buyers creative resistance.

113
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.520
I don't think you can talk a little bit more about that.
Um,
and then the,

114
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.170
so if you can talk about that and then the question for all of us,
um,

115
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.920
is what type of creative resistance do you think is needed?
Now we're in very,

116
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:28.940
very interesting time,
you know,
in a multiple levels.
Um,

117
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.520
so just using this idea of creative resistance,

118
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:33.950
like what do you think we can extract from that for today?

119
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.780
<v 2>Um,</v>

120
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.700
something I was thinking about while making the film is this continuum of things

121
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:41.740
that,
uh,

122
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.250
seem radical at one time in that become kind of more mainstream or accepted

123
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:49.430
later.
So,
uh,
intergenerational adoption,

124
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.170
I'm sure to most people seem like a radical step to obtain equal rights,

125
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.550
but now gay marriage,
um,
this part of the mainstream.

126
00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:03.551
So I think that's a key kind of helpful framework to look at,

127
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.860
um,
creative resistance now,
um,

128
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.820
in terms of conceptualizing things that,
uh,

129
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.350
break rules or reimagine what rules could be,
um,
uh,

130
00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:18.640
with the knowledge through history that that rule breaking,
um,

131
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.670
sometimes becomes absorbed into the culture as something mainstream

132
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.720
<v 3>buyer trees.
Buyers' resistance was based on nonviolence,</v>

133
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.980
on his Quaker upbringing.
And the whole idea about nonviolence,

134
00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:37.680
it's really based on love.
And so,
you know,

135
00:08:37.681 --> 00:08:42.681
you go into the creative phase of resisting with the idea of eventually building

136
00:08:44.131 --> 00:08:45.390
community.
I mean,

137
00:08:45.391 --> 00:08:48.480
the community is fractured and you're trying to heal it in some way.

138
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.340
And so that kind of means that you're not going to be screaming in somebody's

139
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:55.060
face or calling them a pig or calling them,
you know,

140
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.550
a racist comment or something like that.

141
00:08:56.551 --> 00:09:00.000
You're going to try and bridge the gap that already exists.

142
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.530
And so that was kind of really the framework that fired,
had to operate in.

143
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:07.170
And so we had to come up with really,
you know,
creative,

144
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:09.810
a creative demonstrations,
creative marches,

145
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:14.811
ideas that were really uniting people as opposed to just broadening,

146
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.790
broadening the gap.
And I think there exists such a gap now there seems to,

147
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:25.020
in in the society that we have that we need those kinds of creative thinkers and

148
00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:27.630
creative resistors more than ever

149
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.340
<v 4>when I'm thinking about creative resistance,
um,</v>

150
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:38.430
I always come back to what we're doing within our own communities to resist the

151
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.890
forces that my tear us intro in the intro community away from each other.

152
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:49.690
Um,
when I think about intersectionality about being black and queer,

153
00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:50.830
um,

154
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:55.830
specifically and given the challenges that we're up against socially and given

155
00:09:56.111 --> 00:09:59.800
the current political environment that we find ourselves in,

156
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.840
I think it's more important than ever that we have serious conversations in our

157
00:10:04.841 --> 00:10:09.841
community about what we're doing is marginalized others who look like us,

158
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.790
who come from the same backgrounds as us.

159
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:17.560
I think it starts at home for a lot of us in terms of having those serious

160
00:10:17.561 --> 00:10:20.680
conversations before we talk about,
um,
you know,

161
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.770
extending the hand over to other communities.

162
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:28.330
Not saying that they should happen separate from each other,
um,
or it shouldn't,

163
00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.900
they should,
when should happen before the other,
but saying that,
you know,

164
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.540
we should be resisting,
um,

165
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:40.030
creatively and strategically different ideas that would pull us apart from one

166
00:10:40.151 --> 00:10:44.110
another.
Um,
specifically within the black community or specifically within,

167
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.370
within the queer community.

168
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.930
And a lot of people actually find a queer community to be very isolationists in

169
00:10:49.931 --> 00:10:54.070
and of itself,
very white and very male and of itself.
Um,

170
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.290
we obviously know that's not true,
right?

171
00:10:56.291 --> 00:10:59.110
So we have a lot to do internally as well.
Um,

172
00:10:59.111 --> 00:11:03.340
in terms of rectifying things that have been done,
um,
in the past,

173
00:11:03.341 --> 00:11:06.520
I have been wrong and to have marginalized people within our communities.

174
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.690
So basically resisting those internal forces that can disrupt it.

175
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.610
<v 0>Thank you.
No,
I think as I reflect on,
um,
buyer in this film,</v>

176
00:11:15.611 --> 00:11:19.180
I'm struck by the fact that it just took me so long to learn about him.

177
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.040
Like I think that I was in college,
um,
when I found out about him,

178
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.670
um,
and identifying as a black queer man myself,

179
00:11:27.671 --> 00:11:31.850
it was just so comforting to know that his presence was there.
You know,

180
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:36.870
his legacy is all throughout the civil rights movement and still lives on today.

181
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.750
Um,
but he is like still largely unknown in a lot of spaces.

182
00:11:40.751 --> 00:11:43.150
So kind of before we go to audience questions,
Walter,

183
00:11:43.151 --> 00:11:47.780
I would love for you to kind of tell us like,
what's the one thing that,
that we,

184
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.130
we wouldn't know about buyer and that we wouldn't get from the documentary.

185
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.280
<v 3>Oh,
that's interesting.
Um,
because I think this,</v>

186
00:11:57.281 --> 00:12:01.060
this document and kind of compliments whether outside or a great deal,

187
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:04.210
because some brother outside do you see bar debating Malcolm x,

188
00:12:04.211 --> 00:12:08.320
you see buyer and podiums talking and pointing his finger and you know,

189
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.790
very militant and yeah.
You know,
I think this,
this,

190
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.520
this one kind of shows a softer side of him.
Yeah.
Um,

191
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:20.770
I think probably,
you know,
the fact that he was so human,
he was so gentle,

192
00:12:20.771 --> 00:12:25.210
he was a very approachable,
I mean,
he was not somebody,
I mean,

193
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:26.890
even though he had achieved a certain,

194
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.570
I guess you could say rank or position in the civil rights movement,
you know,

195
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:36.571
that really didn't happen until after the march on Washington in 1963 and so he,

196
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.610
you know,
up to then he had kind of lived as an itinerant freelance troublemaker,

197
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:46.370
if you will,
kind of making this subsistence living.
And you know,
um,

198
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.200
so he wasn't really very full of himself,
I guess.
You know,

199
00:12:50.201 --> 00:12:52.810
he didn't go around with bodyguards,

200
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.800
limousines or anything like that kind of thing.
Um,
so I,

201
00:12:56.801 --> 00:13:01.801
I think just the fact that he was really so human and warm and really always

202
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:06.500
willing to,
um,
reach out to people.
Yeah.

203
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.830
Uh,
especially young people.
I mean,

204
00:13:08.831 --> 00:13:12.800
Bard was one of the leaders who was really known too.

205
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.870
It was an inspiration and because of his radical politics,

206
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:18.340
especially in his younger years,

207
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:22.690
young people kind of gravitate to him because younger people tend to be more

208
00:13:22.691 --> 00:13:27.050
radical.
So when Stokely Carmichael was coming up,
uh,
people like that,
they,

209
00:13:27.051 --> 00:13:31.060
they really went to buy it as opposed to going to why Wilkins or Whitney young.

210
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.920
Yeah.
They went to Bard and they went to Ella Baker.
That's,

211
00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.860
that might be a name that is familiar to somebody because they were really the,

212
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:41.380
they were the voices within the leadership of the movement that we're kind of

213
00:13:41.381 --> 00:13:45.400
edgy and progressive.
So,
uh,
yeah,
I think,
um,

214
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:51.060
you know,
just his,
his spirit of youthfulness in his spirit of creativity.
Uh,

215
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.040
something that,
you know,

216
00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:57.910
it was very important to his legacy,
to his life.

217
00:13:57.911 --> 00:14:01.990
And again,
something that,
uh,
we need now.

218
00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:03.710
We need creative young people at,

219
00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:08.200
they're not relying on all the old methods to make change but to,

220
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.270
to forge ahead and use the tools that we have now.
Absolutely.
Thank you.

221
00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.500
So do you have any audience questions?

222
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.850
<v 6>Um,
I would love to know are,
have you speculate as to what,</v>

223
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:21.680
uh,

224
00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.610
Byard would be thinking and doing today in terms of the political landscape,

225
00:14:26.611 --> 00:14:30.330
in terms of where we are with,
um,
gay rights,

226
00:14:30.331 --> 00:14:33.780
with things that are happening within the black community.
Where do you,

227
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.790
where would he be positioned right now?

228
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:38.521
<v 3>Well,</v>

229
00:14:38.521 --> 00:14:41.430
I think he would certainly to be pleased with the progress that's been made over

230
00:14:41.431 --> 00:14:43.740
the last 50 years.
Uh,

231
00:14:43.741 --> 00:14:48.030
he would have been disheartened by the 2016 election and,
you know,

232
00:14:48.031 --> 00:14:50.760
maybe depressed for a day or two,
but,
uh,

233
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:55.400
we would have gotten up two days later and gotten right back in the fight and

234
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:59.480
started,
you know,
starting resisting.
Um,

235
00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.620
yeah,
I think he,

236
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:07.563
<v 5>okay.</v>

237
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.870
<v 3>You know,
Byron a Philip Randolph,</v>

238
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.060
they dealt largely with the issues of racial discrimination and segregation and

239
00:15:16.061 --> 00:15:19.210
Jim Crow,
you know,
in the,
in the forties to the 60s.

240
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:23.200
But then once some of those laws were passed and there was a civil rights

241
00:15:23.201 --> 00:15:24.880
legislation,
the voting rights act,

242
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.340
they way they really understood that the larger issue is poverty and economics.

243
00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.450
And that's something that is,
is still witness in his,
you know,

244
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.910
the income inequality has broadened over these last years.

245
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:41.890
And so the work that he was doing in the mid sixties to work that Dr. King was

246
00:15:41.891 --> 00:15:44.350
doing at the time they need died,
the poor people's campaign,

247
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.250
I think those would really be issues that he would be focusing on.

248
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.540
And you know,
I think a little less so on identity politics,

249
00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:56.440
but more on bringing people together on the issue of economic justice.

250
00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.210
<v 4>And something I think about often,
um,</v>

251
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.420
is it paid was a lot today,
um,

252
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.950
where he had been involved in any of the,
um,

253
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:13.230
the political fights that black queer people are facing in this country at this

254
00:16:13.231 --> 00:16:16.920
time.
Um,
you know,
as I've done research about Byard,

255
00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.560
I've found very little of him,
you know,

256
00:16:19.561 --> 00:16:23.410
engaging with black queer people of his generation.
Um,

257
00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.970
and that's been something that has always been like a gray area for me.

258
00:16:26.971 --> 00:16:31.020
Like I'm just like,
Hey,
I'm sure he's probably done work and he's probably,

259
00:16:31.021 --> 00:16:34.770
he probably knows tons of people within the Black Creek community.

260
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:39.630
But similarly it's a Baldwin I often question,
you know,
how,

261
00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:44.660
what their ties were liking if they would kind of be the champions for Black

262
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.950
Queer,
um,
you know,

263
00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.460
political issues that we're facing today as something I think about all the
time.

264
00:16:50.461 --> 00:16:52.800
It's just something that I wish I had more context.

265
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.370
So thank you for asking that question is something I think about too.

266
00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:02.090
<v 7>My name is Ryan.
I'm so my question is,</v>

267
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.010
so how do you think,
um,

268
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.420
like kind of just like having like an interracial relationship is different deck

269
00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:12.770
then it is today and kind of going off a little bit more of that.
Is that,

270
00:17:12.771 --> 00:17:15.050
would that be considered like,
you know,

271
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.360
like empowerment within like the black community or is that like kind of

272
00:17:19.361 --> 00:17:22.880
discouraged or frowned upon to day outside of your racing going against the

273
00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:25.570
cause of like black empowerment?

274
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.530
<v 4>This is often something I think about it as well.
Um,
like</v>

275
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:37.300
given the documentary and seeing where Bayard Rustin comes from as far as his

276
00:17:38.181 --> 00:17:39.320
Quaker upbringing,

277
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:44.360
I think that gives us a lot of context into how he went about,

278
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.740
um,
you know,
engaging in relationships,
um,

279
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:53.690
which is very different.
And then also considering the fact that he was,
you know,

280
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.470
apple under Martin Luther King instead of like say a Malcolm x or,

281
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.820
um,
you know,
someone who more left.
Um,

282
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:07.800
I think that often can provide some insight into how he thought about,

283
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.470
um,
interracial relationships.

284
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.700
But I think at the time,
I mean,

285
00:18:14.701 --> 00:18:18.780
I didn't live there,
obviously I didn't live back then.
Um,

286
00:18:18.781 --> 00:18:22.230
so I don't have as much context there,
but,
um,

287
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:26.400
I would imagine that there were a lot of questions that people had,

288
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:31.110
um,
to his relationships.
Um,

289
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:36.300
and I think in a lot of ways we can draw parallels to today.

290
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:41.780
I think interracial relationships are obviously less taboo than they were,

291
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:46.710
um,
you know,
50 years ago.
Uh,
that being said,

292
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.690
there are a number of conversations that we have honest conversations that we

293
00:18:51.691 --> 00:18:54.900
have,
especially when it comes to black leadership,

294
00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:00.240
black people who are visibly,
um,
out there who are representing communities,
um,

295
00:19:00.241 --> 00:19:00.901
about,
you know,

296
00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:05.901
the relationships that they answer and how oftentimes they can portray,

297
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:12.450
um,
something that might be different than what their work consist of.

298
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.810
Um,
that's something that I interrogate often.

299
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.390
I don't really have an answer to it.
Um,

300
00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:22.750
I just think that we like more the things more chain.

301
00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.570
This is the way that more things change.

302
00:19:25.571 --> 00:19:30.330
It's like more things stay the same I guess in a situation.
Um,

303
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.980
but yeah,
it's a very,
it's a very,
uh,

304
00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.200
tricky issue.
I guess.

305
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.790
<v 3>I like to add a few things.</v>

306
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:45.770
I think you really have to look at the whole context in which we were living.

307
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.050
Um,
first of all,

308
00:19:48.051 --> 00:19:51.980
they're always been people who have been against interracial relationships.

309
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:56.360
Their worries were and there still are and they're probably always will be.
Um,

310
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:02.210
there wasn't a gay movement.
I mean,
during the,

311
00:20:02.211 --> 00:20:06.620
during the time that I met Bart there was,
but in the time that he was maturing,

312
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.920
there was not really much of a gay movement,
just speak of,

313
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:15.050
there are a few organizations,
but um,
you know,
they weren't very high profile,

314
00:20:15.051 --> 00:20:19.200
high visibility.
Uh,
and certainly,
you know,
I don't know,
I mean,

315
00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:24.240
I don't know how many out black gay men you could name from his generation.

316
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:28.430
Maybe you could name more than I could.
I mean,

317
00:20:28.431 --> 00:20:32.000
people always refer to James Baldwin,
a wooden barn,
you know,

318
00:20:32.001 --> 00:20:34.880
had a relationship with James Baldwin and a friendly relationship.

319
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.320
And like they occasionally appeared on panels together and work together and

320
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:44.030
that kind of thing.
Um,
but bard was different because he was out there.

321
00:20:44.031 --> 00:20:46.760
He was more authentic.
He didn't lie about who he was.

322
00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:50.320
It was a generation of gay men,
regardless of color,

323
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:55.180
who we made in the closet,
who married marriage is convenience,
if you will,

324
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:58.840
so that they could advance their careers,
had families,
you know,

325
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:00.790
Bard didn't do that kind of thing.

326
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.880
So the number of people who are really living their authentic selves in,

327
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:09.400
in Baldwin was one also,
uh,
were very few.
So in terms of,
you know,

328
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.540
pool of applicants,
I guess you could say for having relationships for Bard,

329
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:20.020
having relations with people,
it was not that great.
If you think about,
you know,

330
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.380
besides the percentage of gay men in the world,

331
00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.930
percentage of black gay men in the world,

332
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.800
the percentage of black gay men in the world who had an education who were

333
00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:32.800
interested in nonviolence,
who were political.
I mean,
you know,

334
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:34.540
it keeps getting smaller and smaller and smaller.

335
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.220
A bar did have relationships with black gay men,
sexual relationships.

336
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:44.500
But in terms of longterm partners,
that's really about values.
And,
um,

337
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.980
they're just,
you know,
the pool of applicants,
if you will,

338
00:21:47.981 --> 00:21:49.120
was just not that great.

339
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:53.240
<v 8>We've had a few conversations internally about,
um,</v>

340
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.640
Jen,
mostly a white folk,
uh,

341
00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:02.150
sort of working on narratives around folks of color and the inherent,

342
00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:08.020
a strong problematic areas that we can get into by representing other people's

343
00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:10.650
stories,
um,

344
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.680
that involve experiences that we will never be able to experience as,
um,

345
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:19.460
as white folks.
So I'm curious,
a question for Matt is,
um,

346
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.280
did you encounter any challenges since you were telling Walter Story?
Certainly,

347
00:22:23.281 --> 00:22:24.930
but this was also a story about bard.

348
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.540
I'm curious whether you encountered at any challenges,

349
00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:32.570
I'm trying to sort of create an artistic narrative of a man of color,

350
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.640
um,
knowing that that was not your experience.

351
00:22:35.641 --> 00:22:40.641
Recognizing also that directors do create stories about people that are not

352
00:22:40.681 --> 00:22:43.230
exactly like them,
but this might be a particular,

353
00:22:43.231 --> 00:22:45.000
I could imagine this being a particular challenge.

354
00:22:45.001 --> 00:22:47.340
So I'd be interested in hearing how you approached that.

355
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:52.230
<v 2>Yeah,
I think about that a lot and I do make films.
Um,</v>

356
00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.540
mostly not from my point of view,
but from the point of view of a character's,

357
00:22:57.541 --> 00:23:01.230
for lack of a better word.
Um,
and while thinking of this,

358
00:23:01.231 --> 00:23:05.490
I do ask my self the question,
this is a great story.

359
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.360
Um,

360
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.860
am I the person to tell it or is my job to get out of the way and let other

361
00:23:10.861 --> 00:23:15.510
people tell a certain story?
And,
um,
in a sense,

362
00:23:15.511 --> 00:23:17.320
even though I made this film,
um,

363
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:22.080
because I chose to do it entirely from Walter's point of view.
Um,

364
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.820
he's,
he's telling this story,
uh,

365
00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.870
which is a story of the civil rights movement,

366
00:23:27.871 --> 00:23:32.850
but through very particular personal lens.
Um,
and Walter has been such a,

367
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:33.450
um,

368
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:38.070
amazing ambassador for Byrds legacy and that's part of the reason I didn't feel

369
00:23:38.071 --> 00:23:38.904
like,
um,

370
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:43.740
the film needed additional points of view to historicize Byard.
So,

371
00:23:43.741 --> 00:23:45.530
um,
yeah,
I mean,

372
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:50.280
I think there's been recent films like a film about Martha P.
Johnson where,
um,

373
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:55.040
these issues have really come to the fore,
um,
about,
um,

374
00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.680
you know,
uh,
authorship and,
um,
kind of,
uh,

375
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.970
I guess as white people getting out of the way sometimes instead of talking and

376
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.060
listening more.
So,
um,
you know,

377
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:12.460
it's sometimes a limitation to my ex,
my ability as a filmmaker.

378
00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:13.413
And I think about that

379
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:18.620
<v 9>by addressing was like totally inspirational for me in college as well.
Um,</v>

380
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.001
the movie brother,

381
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:24.410
outsider and his early life as a communist and it's like Congress,

382
00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:26.690
like his debate with Martin,
with Malcolm x,

383
00:24:26.691 --> 00:24:30.680
like thought those where he was like really interested in his early politics.

384
00:24:30.681 --> 00:24:31.940
I guess.
When you met him,

385
00:24:31.941 --> 00:24:36.230
did you know who he was before he introduced himself before he introduced

386
00:24:36.231 --> 00:24:40.940
himself to like,
we're like,
oh that's,
he's like this big shot.
Like how was that?

387
00:24:40.941 --> 00:24:42.790
What was that like just as a personal experience?
Like,

388
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.060
<v 2>well,
it was an ma at the moment that I met him.</v>

389
00:24:47.061 --> 00:24:49.970
I wasn't sure I knew who I had known who buyer dressed and was,

390
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:54.410
but bard was no different carrying a walking stick cane.
Well,
oh,

391
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.550
it's only a can if you need it.
He didn't need it.
There's a walking stick,

392
00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:04.880
you know,
style accessory.
So,
um,

393
00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.690
he didn't have it with them that afternoon,
so I wasn't sure,
but you know,

394
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:10.461
he introduced himself.

395
00:25:10.461 --> 00:25:13.520
But I had known because I was interested in the movement in my,

396
00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:18.020
in my high school years,
and Barb was showing up in the press quite a lot.
I,

397
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:21.060
you know,
I knew who he was.
It was,
hmm.

398
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.380
<v 0>Well,
thank you so much,
Matt.
Walter and Sean.
Um,</v>

399
00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.570
it's really been a treat for us to bring added screening to Google and the

400
00:25:28.571 --> 00:25:33.250
partnership with the,
it gets better project.
Uh,
thank you for that.
And also,

401
00:25:33.251 --> 00:25:37.400
I just want to thank you guys for humanizing buyer for us,
um,
and,

402
00:25:37.401 --> 00:25:42.310
and bringing home at this notion of love and respect and creativity.
Um,

403
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:46.630
and I think that that transcends time and space.
So thank you all so much.

404
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:47.820
Thank you.

405
00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:51.930
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>
