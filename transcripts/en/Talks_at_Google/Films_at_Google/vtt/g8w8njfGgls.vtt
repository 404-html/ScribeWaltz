1
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.690
In the toxic Google.
My name is Kevin Belk.

2
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.870
And today on the rock,
the casbah.

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.200
So let's welcome Mr Bill Murray and Mitch Glaser.

4
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.470
MMM.

5
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.840
<v 2>You guys about a wonderful film.</v>

6
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.590
You play a Richie lands you wrote and produced the film.

7
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.600
And so can you talk about just the story?

8
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.410
<v 3>Um,
the basic story is bill's character,</v>

9
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.480
bitchy lands is kind of a third rate,

10
00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:59.650
never was on his back down on his luck.
Um,
rock manager.

11
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.520
I was gonna say sleazy rock manager,
but it's kind of self explanatory.
Yeah.

12
00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:07.570
Redundant.
And um,
who,
uh,
takes his last act,

13
00:01:07.571 --> 00:01:10.450
who was his secretary of play by Zooey Deschanel,
uh,

14
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.900
to co to Cabo and to Afghanistan to do Uso tour,

15
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.700
which is his way back into the big time.
And she freaks out because w,
you know,

16
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.140
this is takes place five or six years ago.
Uh,
and,
and still,
you know,

17
00:01:23.141 --> 00:01:26.410
a terrifying place if for,
you know,
for all the reasons she freaks out,

18
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.940
steals his money,
his passport,
his wallet leaves them stranded in Afghanistan.

19
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.780
And the rest of it,
kind of the,
the,
the journey plays out from there.

20
00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:36.910
But what basically what happens in the,

21
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:41.020
in the movie is that he uses his rock manager skills.
Um,

22
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.700
again,
redundant,
I guess.
Uh,
he hears a wonderful singer in,
in,
uh,

23
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.980
in southern Afghanistan,

24
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.760
a girl singing in a cave and realizes that this is the voice he's never heard

25
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:53.470
before.
And,
and managers,

26
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.090
managers or into the Afghan star competition,
which is based on,
it's a,

27
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.050
it's their American idol and it does exist.
And,
um,
and,

28
00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:05.740
and Richie lands does that.
And that's basically the engine of the movie,

29
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.070
<v 2>I would say.
Right.
You were there.</v>

30
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.980
Okay.
Can you hear us if we don't use these microphones?
Not The same,
Huh?

31
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.590
We need him.
Yeah,
that's,
that's enough.
I mean,

32
00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:19.900
you want to leave some mystery for the people that,
hey,

33
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.330
so your character,
Richie lands,

34
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:29.331
you've talked about how he has been influenced by a lot of agents and managers

35
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:32.280
that you've kind of met over in your life.

36
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:33.960
And Bill Graham I think was one of them too.

37
00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:38.580
And Bill Graham certainly was one hilarious episode of rock and roll manager,

38
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.020
promoter,
someone that I got to witness on a couple of occasions.
And,
uh,

39
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.880
another cat we know in New York named Ron Delsener who's just nuts,

40
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.740
just really know,
probably suing us.
Big Guy.
But he's nice.

41
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.830
He,
he,
you know,
they're both very,
Dell Delsener is really funny.

42
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.230
Constantly self deprecating.
Well,
uh,
cutting people's heads off.

43
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.850
He's just lots of fun.
But um,
how are y'all doing this afternoon?

44
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.410
<v 3>Go?
They're in love with you guys.</v>

45
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:15.820
So you guys have known each other for years too.

46
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.300
So you guys knew each other back from the SNL days?
We have,
yeah.

47
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.170
I was introduced to bill,
uh,
our mutual friend John Belushi was a friend.

48
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:26.800
I'd done a piece on him in [inaudible] 77 and John,

49
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:31.630
I became friends and I was sitting in a studio eight h and a New York Saturday

50
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:33.920
night live and John Wave,

51
00:03:33.921 --> 00:03:38.230
somebody over from behind me and this guy comes over and he goes,

52
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.250
Mitch,
this is Billy,
the new kid.
And um,
so we met in [inaudible] 77,

53
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.720
but we became close,
you know,
as collaborators on scrooge and 87,
which,

54
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.240
which I wrote with my late writing part of my,
yeah,

55
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.840
<v 1>go down here.
And Billy was in,
um,</v>

56
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.180
<v 3>well we've worked together a lot and over the remaining 30 years.</v>

57
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.410
<v 2>Yeah.
Cause you guys had scrooge and passion play,</v>

58
00:03:58.411 --> 00:04:00.660
which was your first film you directed.
Yep.

59
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.410
<v 3>Villain bill was in.
And then,
um,
uh,
what's it call it?
Charlie's angels.</v>

60
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:10.150
And you know,
I was a writer on for nine weeks.
And the first Charlie's angels,
um,

61
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.260
the real one.
The real one.
Yeah,
the classic.

62
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.320
How do you direct bill?
Uh,
it,
it,
it was a dream.
I mean,
you know,

63
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.340
w w fortunately we knew each other.

64
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.010
The bigger question was how did I direct Mickey Rourke?

65
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:28.030
But that's a whole nother,
there's a whole nother visit.
Um,
no,
he's,
you know,

66
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:31.690
bills,
the bills.
It's weird from him sending here,
but he's the best,
you know,
to,

67
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.640
to collaborate with.
Um,
he's a great friend,
but he brings a lot of energy and,

68
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:41.260
and,
and um,
in all those years of,
of talent to,
to what he does.

69
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.980
And he's easy.
He's great to direct.
I mean,
he loves to collaborate.
It was,

70
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:45.814
it was a dream.

71
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.940
<v 2>You guys have another special coming up with Netflix,</v>

72
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.120
a very merry Christmas and that you're riding with Sofia Coppola.

73
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.650
Exactly as well.
Yeah.
And so,
uh,
what keeps bringing you guys just get,
it's like,

74
00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:56.760
what is that collaboration?

75
00:04:56.761 --> 00:05:00.960
What does it like just to continue to work with your friend?
Well,

76
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.260
Hollywood is a tricky place and,
uh,
when you have a,

77
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.510
if you last long enough,
you have some,

78
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.740
you have a career involves really nightmarish episodes.

79
00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:16.410
She has some really bad episodes.
If you don't have them,

80
00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:21.090
you didn't really have a career and you weren't really there so you can have a

81
00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:24.510
career that,
you know,
I was very lucky.
I had a lot of success early on.

82
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.200
And then along the way,
you,
you,
you,
you meet some real monsters.

83
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.260
You meet some people who are just have incredible positions of authority without

84
00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:35.670
any of the qualifications for them.

85
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.960
Do you know what kind of people I'm talking about?
You meet people like that,

86
00:05:39.961 --> 00:05:43.920
that are just incapable of getting out of their own way in our fearful of

87
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.420
sharing a responsibility.
They're just not able to,
uh,
work with,

88
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:54.110
uh,
they don't play well with others.
You know,
they just don't.
And so they do.

89
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.080
Having those experiences where you work with someone,
then

90
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.970
<v 4>you do your best every day and you make everything better every day.</v>

91
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:06.350
And they still don't understand that,
you know,
that you should be,
you know,

92
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.400
I'm here to help.
I'm not here.
It's not about me.
I'm really here to help.
But uh,

93
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.480
go on a little too much about it because I've had a,
it's like a,

94
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.450
it's like a five o'clock in the afternoon coffee.
I'm going to get emotional.

95
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.913
<v 1>But</v>

96
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.490
<v 4>uh,
so we had some of these monsters things happen.
Look,
cause it's scrooge was,</v>

97
00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:29.380
we had a character who was the director who was,
it was jaw dropping.
I could,

98
00:06:29.381 --> 00:06:34.030
I mean if you had a few hours and like half of a bar,
we could get to the,

99
00:06:34.031 --> 00:06:34.900
some of these stories,

100
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.320
but just dealing with this guy and making a movie about Christmas and really the

101
00:06:40.421 --> 00:06:43.570
Dickens story of scrooge and how you could miss that one.
How you could,

102
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.700
how you had to be reeducated on that one every four hours was it was mind

103
00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:53.410
boggling.
So that was really,
that was a very important moment where you realized,

104
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.990
you know,
if you have to go to war with someone,

105
00:06:55.991 --> 00:06:58.960
you better go with someone who's been in before,
you know,

106
00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:01.450
who spend through something horrible and then you don't have that.

107
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.920
There's no fear and you realize,
well,
if you just keep playing your game,

108
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.993
you know,

109
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.080
and my feeling always is when we work together and we write together that if it

110
00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:15.710
makes us laugh or moves us,
then I'm cool.
Then I,
then I go in armored and,

111
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:19.650
and I,
you know,
I can't be challenged because,
um,

112
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.440
that's the first initial hurdle or the person you want to please as your writing

113
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:26.590
partner.
We've written a script together and,
and um,
you know,

114
00:07:26.591 --> 00:07:29.560
we laugh at the same things.
It's,
it,
it's,
it's been wonderful.

115
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.100
What makes a Bill Murray Movie Bill Murray movie.

116
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.380
So what are those elements that you put in there?

117
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.540
<v 1>Hmm,</v>

118
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.600
<v 4>I'm right here.
Right.</v>

119
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.543
<v 1>Excellent.</v>

120
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.020
<v 4>Maybe you could answer with Bill Murray.
Well,</v>

121
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.630
what makes a movie number one prep services?

122
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.940
Get Bill Murray in it.

123
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.730
<v 1>Yeah,
we can move on.
No,
it's just,</v>

124
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.650
<v 4>I dunno.
I guess it partly that I guess a lot of it is being in it.</v>

125
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.933
<v 1>MMM.</v>

126
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.080
<v 4>Uh,
you know,
I just do the ones I like.
I don't have any agenda.</v>

127
00:08:07.081 --> 00:08:10.170
I don't have any kind of move that I want to go a certain way.
Particularly.

128
00:08:10.171 --> 00:08:14.850
I've just had this funny career where I started out doing comedies and then I

129
00:08:14.851 --> 00:08:19.320
ended up,
uh,
doing more serious roles and I wasn't intending to do it that way.

130
00:08:19.321 --> 00:08:21.600
And now this movie's funny again.
Now there was,

131
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.640
we do have a mutual friend who said,

132
00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:29.240
when I was laying on my back on the,
in Venice at the end of some of the photo,

133
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.190
and he said,
Bill,
you know,

134
00:08:32.191 --> 00:08:35.390
you do these sad movies and you ended up taking him home with you.
You know,

135
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.640
and you know,
your life as an always fun anyway.

136
00:08:39.641 --> 00:08:43.320
Maybe you should think about doing something funny.
And it's funny when,

137
00:08:43.321 --> 00:08:45.670
when you're laying on your back on marble,
you know,

138
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.380
it's just changes everything because you're a little bit more receptive.

139
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.460
But this just happened to come up up.
Not hard upon that.

140
00:08:54.461 --> 00:08:55.740
But soon after there was a movie

141
00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.600
<v 2>aware there was a chance to be funny.
And I thought,
well if you,
I,</v>

142
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.200
I do believe that if you can,
right,
you must write.

143
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.640
And I do believe if you can be funny,
you should be funny.
People need funding.

144
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.300
They need funny.
Moving on from that terrible question I just asked,

145
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.970
you know,
I tried to help

146
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.810
Bill Murray help me.
All right.
Uh,
so,
uh,
the interesting thing about this,

147
00:09:22.811 --> 00:09:26.210
or he was like,
Richie lands tries to bring a lot of American culture.

148
00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:28.730
Have you seen this movie?
Yeah,
we just had last night.
You all saw it.

149
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.020
A lot of us are.
Yeah.
How many blue?
Yes.
Good.

150
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.690
We still got some major box office to corral.
Yeah.
Okay,

151
00:09:37.691 --> 00:09:39.340
so you saw it anyway.
All good.
Okay,
go ahead.

152
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.010
We tried to bring a lot of American culture into Afghanistan.

153
00:09:42.011 --> 00:09:44.800
You guys filmed in Morocco?
So what?
So it wasn't quite a gas,
Dan,

154
00:09:44.801 --> 00:09:49.630
but what did you see in that culture that maybe we should be bringing back here

155
00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:50.464
to the Western world?

156
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.830
<v 3>It was amazing actually because we filmed during Ramadan,
uh,</v>

157
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.480
July of 2014,
June,
July of 2014.
Um,
and there were,

158
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.820
there were options.
I was telling Billy earlier,
you know,

159
00:10:01.821 --> 00:10:04.030
producers were saying you should do it in New Mexico,

160
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.810
but from the beginning of the movie had to have the feel of the Muslim world.

161
00:10:08.811 --> 00:10:12.890
I mean it just did.
And um,
so we were really serious about that.

162
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.420
Um,
so half our crew was a,
was a Muslim crew and,

163
00:10:16.421 --> 00:10:19.340
and experiencing Ramadan with them.
And you know,

164
00:10:19.341 --> 00:10:21.560
Bill kind of insist that you,

165
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.850
you take a huge bite out of life wherever you are.
But,
um,

166
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.300
there you are in Marrakesh and Morocco.
So we,
you know,

167
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.400
he had two of his sons with him and,
and uh,

168
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:36.100
on weekends my wife and I would join them and went to Fez and robot and s Wera

169
00:10:36.101 --> 00:10:38.900
and we really got that.
They went up to the atlas mountains were really did,

170
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.930
I mean we left after seven weeks and bill stayed,
you know,

171
00:10:41.931 --> 00:10:46.490
took this cause it was so,
so powerful.
But there were moments there that are,
um,

172
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.110
there'll be with me forever.
Just,
just,
you know,
the beauty of,
of a,
of the city,

173
00:10:51.111 --> 00:10:55.640
the culture and uh,
and getting a chance to work in a place like that was,

174
00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.230
was a dream.
And we also did shoot,
there's a woman named Galora who,
um,

175
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.310
works for advice,
who shot all the couple cobble footage in the movie.

176
00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:06.530
So anytime you don't see an actor,

177
00:11:06.531 --> 00:11:10.670
but it's all the footage of people watching the TVS and the,
you know,

178
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.350
all that was from Afghanistan.
Um,
and a beautifully shot and seamless really.

179
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:20.230
Um,
I thought it was a,
it really was a magical two months for all of us.
And,

180
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.120
and the movie,
the movie,
the end of the day is about what's universal.
I mean,

181
00:11:23.121 --> 00:11:27.380
it really,
you know,
not what separates us,
but a father loves his daughter.
Um,

182
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.820
every,
everybody loves music and loves to laugh and,
and uh,

183
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.230
and who better to

184
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.240
<v 2>take us through that?
When you,
it was a,</v>

185
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.660
I don't know if any of you ever been to Morocco.
It's a beautiful place.

186
00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:44.250
I strongly recommended as a place to visit and see,
and I made a joke to the day.

187
00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:46.950
It's like,
it's,
it's entry level Africa,
you know,

188
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.880
you get in and it's sort of the easiest way into sort of go like,

189
00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:54.070
hey is a whole different world here.
And it's of an entry level

190
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.380
<v 4>Muslim world too because it's,</v>

191
00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:00.040
it's a predominantly Muslim country and it's a,
you know,

192
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:04.290
what we might call like a softer,
gentler Jen,
gentler,
less strident,
uh,

193
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:08.590
most of them conveniently and sort of look,
Indonesia is easier and it's not,

194
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:09.071
you know,

195
00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:13.960
you have some sort of anticipation or fear or anxiety about some sort of

196
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.790
reactionary Muslim and these are people that sort of read the book the way it

197
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.540
reads,
you know,
they don't,
they don't reinterpret it in a,
in a bizarre,

198
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.840
unusual fashion.
They,
it's pretty straightforward.

199
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.980
And so when we come there with American culture,
that's your question.

200
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.870
We come there with our American movie making and the way we treat people.
Well,

201
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.590
the Ramadan thing was a very big thing.
You know what Ramadan is?

202
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:42.070
The people don't eat or drink through the in the daylight hours.

203
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.710
And because this was a late Ramadan in July,

204
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.860
these are the longest day as long as no longer days of the year.

205
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.860
So it was a bad time to be having in the hottest.

206
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.200
So there's just a struggle.

207
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.060
Everyone's struggling through it and you know,
even if you're not a Muslim,

208
00:12:58.061 --> 00:13:02.510
you're,
you're,
you feel this struggle all round you and that uh,
you know,

209
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:07.530
if that sort of relationship that you get with someone where this is how I treat

210
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:09.610
you,
this is how we talk,

211
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.590
this is how we walk back and forth to the job is how we carry something
together.

212
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.560
This is how we move around in a circle.

213
00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:21.370
This is how we walk back and forth to lunch.
All that sort of just,

214
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.320
you know,
it's sort of,
there's a German lands in you.
It was,

215
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:28.240
I probably given to us much earlier on in life.

216
00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:32.290
But that connection grows through the time.

217
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.300
So when the time comes,

218
00:13:34.301 --> 00:13:38.140
when the days get hard and the days are long and movie days are long,

219
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:41.920
they're unsafe,
insufferably long and there's no point in the,

220
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.650
in the locals to quit before they can eat anyway.

221
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.690
So they just want to keep going because if we stay working on the job until
dark,

222
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.460
then we get to eat on the movie,
sort of,
you know what I mean?

223
00:13:52.461 --> 00:13:54.250
And then then it's like,
then we all sort of break,
right.

224
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:55.930
And we stopped and that was good.

225
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.690
People didn't have to drive all the way to their homes.

226
00:13:58.691 --> 00:14:03.070
The movie provided a meal.
When the sun went down,
we stopped and we ate.

227
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:04.870
And even if we had to keep going,

228
00:14:04.871 --> 00:14:09.640
we stopped and we ate and everyone stopped an aid and all the different

229
00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:14.140
departments.
When we don't work now,
we stopped and we eat as as a group.

230
00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:18.250
And you feel it?
It's onscreen.
I mean,
you fit,
you feel,
you know,
as bill says,

231
00:14:18.251 --> 00:14:19.061
you know,
the,
that,

232
00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:24.061
that the exotic and the unusual and the magical of it on screen,

233
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.330
you know,
it really,
it really does.

234
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.420
I noticed that last night we watched the screen or two nights ago whenever we

235
00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:32.710
saw the movie again and the credits roll and you're used to seeing,
you know,

236
00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:35.780
kind of like show business names like,
hey,
there's wanting Westmore,
you know,

237
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.010
you know some guy that,
you know,
and they're all Muslim names.

238
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:43.930
I don't know anyone,
you know,
it's like,
well,
here's the,
everyone had a nickname.

239
00:14:43.931 --> 00:14:47.200
So he,
it's like,
I don't know who likes her roof guy named doll is,
you know,

240
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:51.770
but everyone had nicknames and you'd have to go like,
ah,
you know,
you point

241
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.030
<v 2>because the names,
you never knew everyone's entire name,</v>

242
00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:58.610
which could be three or four words and,
and it,

243
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:03.250
but the fact that here's this American movie that has an entire crew,
that's not,

244
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.010
that's not American.
It was,
um,
you know,
you feel good about that.

245
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.990
You guys brought rock the casbah to comicon this year,
which had to be insane.

246
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.150
It's,
what was that experience like?
Because there's both of your first,
right.

247
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.980
Yeah,
it was amazing.
And I gotta say,
uh,
neither of us had done it,

248
00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:22.860
but it was in that big room and the 6,500 seat or 7,000 seat or whatever is
yeah.

249
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:26.810
And uh,
and his entrance was to smoke on the water through the back of the room.

250
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.740
Something I'd seen Mick Jagger due to different song clearly.
But,
uh,
it was,

251
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.910
it was epic.

252
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.510
I mean it was really exciting and a bill bill insisted on leaving the same way,

253
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.770
which was insanely bold.
Well,
I was charmed by it.

254
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.510
I had a kind of a

255
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.350
<v 1>okay,</v>

256
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.460
<v 2>you know,
just to healthy and maybe,
you know,</v>

257
00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:49.890
cautious attitude about people that dressed as wonder woman,
you know,

258
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.610
especially if they weren't a woman.
I felt funny about them.

259
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:59.420
So Woo.
That's actually a perfect time actually.

260
00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:01.940
So we have to acknowledge it.
You're from Chicago.
I'm from Chicago.

261
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.750
Cubs are playing right now.
Game for the playoffs.

262
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:10.850
So we're going to get a score check right now.
And also some cubs gear.

263
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:12.330
Didn't know.

264
00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.140
Is there anyone out there that's a cub fan that doesn't have a cub hat?

265
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.020
<v 1>Actually we had some lean.</v>

266
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.300
<v 2>I have one.
I have one,
so I'm going to let you have mine.</v>

267
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:25.903
<v 1>I'll hand it to him.</v>

268
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:31.120
[inaudible]

269
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.290
<v 2>brings up a great point actually.</v>

270
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:46.250
So the Internet is this beer that is beer.

271
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.670
I'm not really a beer guy.
I'm more of a hard liquor guy.
You a beer girl,
right?

272
00:16:50.671 --> 00:16:51.504
Yeah,

273
00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.960
she looks very thirsty.
Can you share with her

274
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.270
all right.
All right,
that's good.
All right.
Popcorn too.

275
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.190
<v 1>Okay.
All right.
Just put your hand out.</v>

276
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.260
Put both hands up

277
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.253
both hands

278
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.920
and then put your gum in there.

279
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:34.733
All right,

280
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.260
<v 2>so you're from Chicago.
How did,
uh,</v>

281
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.760
growing up in Chicago shape you as a person today?

282
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.543
<v 1>Well,</v>

283
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.980
<v 2>it gets very cold in Chicago in the winter and people from out of go then go,
it</v>

284
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.860
<v 4>gets it.
They just can't believe that it gets that cold.</v>

285
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.470
But people from cold weather,
places like Minneapolis or green bay or Chicago,

286
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.820
you end up trying to figure out how to entertain yourself in the cold.

287
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.620
And we were talking yesterday about,
sorry,

288
00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:10.710
I've got a son that has a,
that has a job,

289
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:16.200
well I have two that have jobs,
but um,
he said,

290
00:18:16.201 --> 00:18:20.690
you taught me how to work.
And I say I could,
you know,
I thought,
well that's how,

291
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.450
how did that happen?
He said it was that night we had to,

292
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.300
we were at Peggy's house,
my sister Peggy's house,

293
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:32.340
and she has a driveway that's very long,
very,
very long,
like maybe 60,

294
00:18:32.341 --> 00:18:36.360
70 yards long.
And,
and she said,
and he said,

295
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:39.870
you and you made us shovel the snow.
What doesn't sound like a big thing.

296
00:18:39.871 --> 00:18:44.871
But when you have to shovel like 4,200 square yards of,

297
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.510
of driveway in like a 12 inch snowstorm,

298
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.660
you've got to go out there several times.

299
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.840
You can't wait till it for it to stop or you'll never be able to do it.

300
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.260
You have to go out when there's four inches on the ground and then you have to

301
00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:01.050
go out again when there's the next four inches on the ground and then you have

302
00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:04.050
to go out.
So it's about a six hour job to do it.

303
00:19:04.051 --> 00:19:06.240
Otherwise you'll never get it done.
So he,

304
00:19:06.241 --> 00:19:10.020
I just wouldn't let him quit until we got it all the way done each time.

305
00:19:10.021 --> 00:19:13.110
And he just couldn't believe that I was still going to be out there.
He's like,

306
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:17.490
come on old man,
give up.
You know,
it's like,
this is what we do here.

307
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.250
This is how we live in Chicago.
You have to get it done.

308
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.130
And that gets hot in the summer and people are friendly.
They're,
you know,

309
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.990
they were just kind of natural in front of pretty straightforward.

310
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.340
There's not a lot of mystery to it.

311
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.000
People root for the cubs for the socks or the bears or something.

312
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.630
And I don't know,
I come from a very big family,

313
00:19:36.631 --> 00:19:41.010
so that was a great part of the education because you have to get along with,

314
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.070
you know,
you got to get along with people at work.
I,

315
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.240
you got to go in with people at home,
you know,
that's,
it's even harder sometimes.

316
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.570
And then,
um,
and I was a caddy and so I worked my way through school as a caddy.

317
00:19:54.571 --> 00:19:58.560
And that's really when you have a great,
that's a great opportunity to,

318
00:19:58.561 --> 00:20:03.561
to acquire an education because you see how you learn how to treat people.

319
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.340
You,
you learn how you would like to be treated.

320
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.010
Like you are really a slave,
you're really a servant.

321
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.370
The disc job description has show up,

322
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.680
keep up and shut up and that's where it begins.
And you,

323
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:24.710
you have to be able to last four or five hours in that mode without ever

324
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.530
imposing your personality on the event.

325
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:34.490
And that you see people who recognize the struggle that that is and not only

326
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.690
urge you to show yourself,

327
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.460
but they respect the effort you're giving and they treat you with kindness.
So,

328
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.180
you know,

329
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.210
it's like I can always tell someone that's like a real prick to a waiter.

330
00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:48.700
I just think he's,
you know,
you should have caddy,
you really should have caddy.

331
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.910
You're alert.
And it was,

332
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.340
I was,
it was luck.
It was very,
it was just luck.

333
00:20:57.341 --> 00:21:00.430
And it was just my fortune that I had to work that I got.
I got it.

334
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.260
<v 3>So we're going to take some questions from our audience.
And a few minutes,</v>

335
00:21:04.261 --> 00:21:06.750
but we're going to bring up Dana Han client who runs their social media for

336
00:21:06.751 --> 00:21:09.900
toxic Google.
And now she has some questions that she's gathered from Twitter

337
00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:14.120
<v 5>and from our internal folks as well.
Hey guys,
let's go ahead.
Uh,
Mitch,</v>

338
00:21:14.121 --> 00:21:15.770
this one is for you.
Um,

339
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.130
so your character speak Pashto and Dari and I'm sorry if I'm butchering those

340
00:21:19.131 --> 00:21:22.850
languages without subtitles.
So they're wondering what,
um,

341
00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.110
what was your sort of train of thought and not subsiding?

342
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:29.840
It was a to kind of make us a little uncomfortable.
Um,
and,
and then also what,

343
00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.160
um,
what were the choices to have saline seeing only American songs.

344
00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.640
<v 3>Okay.
The,
the,
the,
the Pashto and,
and,
and,</v>

345
00:21:37.641 --> 00:21:41.120
and other languages that are used.
Um,

346
00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.640
well there are choices not to use subtitles because we had a character,

347
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.660
a great acronym,
Ren who played this cab driver Rizza who's with,

348
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.210
with bill throughout this journey.
And there was some,

349
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.280
because he was such a wonderful actor.
I mean,

350
00:21:54.281 --> 00:21:59.050
there's a scene around a campfire where he translates what the passion patch

351
00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:01.810
tune leader is saying.
And I just thought,

352
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.620
and Barry Levinson agreed that it was more powerful and more beautiful to,

353
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.850
to hear him repeat the words here,
then both say them.
And then there's,
yeah,

354
00:22:09.851 --> 00:22:12.560
there is that lag of what's,
what's he saying?
And so it really was a,

355
00:22:12.561 --> 00:22:15.730
it almost a cinematic device more than,
than accuracy.

356
00:22:15.731 --> 00:22:16.820
It was just something I thought would be more,

357
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.980
we thought it would be more powerful.
Um,
and as far as,
as far as the Cat Stevens,

358
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.430
that was really for three reasons.
One,
I,
you know,
I grew up in the 70s,

359
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.610
loved Cat Stevens from day one.
Uh,

360
00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.330
so his music is powerful and peace train was always ending for seven years.

361
00:22:31.331 --> 00:22:36.220
From the very first iteration of the script.
It was,
it was ending the movie.
Um,

362
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:41.730
but the idea that [inaudible] girl would feel better about singing a Muslim

363
00:22:43.721 --> 00:22:47.800
singers songs,
even a western singer,
um,
felt important.
I mean,

364
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.340
it felt logical and important that,
that she wouldn't be doing,
you know,

365
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.520
Nicki Minaj and the,
and the,
and the cat that it would be that it would be,

366
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.510
you know,
as Bill's character says in the movie,
she does the Muslim west.
I mean,

367
00:22:58.511 --> 00:23:00.130
she,
she feels comfortable seeing that.

368
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:00.790
<v 1>Yup.</v>

369
00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:04.610
<v 5>Oh,
a bill,
this one's for you.
You've played several iconic film roles.</v>

370
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.190
Are there any roles that you passed on or later you thought,

371
00:23:07.191 --> 00:23:09.770
I wish I had taken that or I would have taken that character in a different

372
00:23:09.771 --> 00:23:10.604
direction?

373
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.920
<v 4>Were there none that I passed on?</v>

374
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.710
<v 1>Uh,
that,
uh,
I really covered it,
you know,</v>

375
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.273
uh,

376
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:22.951
<v 4>there was one,</v>

377
00:23:22.951 --> 00:23:26.130
I w for a moment I was told I was going to be in the movie Philadelphia

378
00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:27.873
<v 1>and,
uh,</v>

379
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.920
<v 4>I didn't bring myself to see it until about an hour ago,
you know,
but,</v>

380
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.910
but I liked the film and they did a good job with the movie

381
00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:38.643
<v 1>and,
uh,</v>

382
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.990
<v 4>Tom Hanks was really great.
I don't know what part,</v>

383
00:23:40.991 --> 00:23:43.360
I think I was going to play the other part,
Denzel Washington Dunes Park.

384
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.010
But it was,
I think it was more important.

385
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.550
What's the Damn Funny Bitch?

386
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:56.360
I didn't really mean that.

387
00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.363
<v 1>No,</v>

388
00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:03.070
<v 4>but,
um,
but no,
I,
but I think,
I think the director Jonathan Demme,</v>

389
00:24:03.071 --> 00:24:07.480
he thought it was more important that the way the character was written,

390
00:24:07.481 --> 00:24:10.710
it's sort of like Denzel is like a black man on the down,

391
00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.960
down low was the way that it sort of came across in the film if you remember the

392
00:24:13.961 --> 00:24:17.410
film.
And he thought that that was a more important thing to speak to,

393
00:24:17.411 --> 00:24:19.010
I think are a very important thing to do.

394
00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:23.710
More important than having me in the film.
Yeah.
So our last question is,
uh,

395
00:24:23.711 --> 00:24:27.550
if you were a real rock tour manager,
what two bands would you want to manage?

396
00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.210
<v 1>Oh,
what happened before something reminded me.</v>

397
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:36.680
<v 4>Well,
I wanted to say about comicon.
Yes,</v>

398
00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:37.623
<v 1>sorry.</v>

399
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:41.010
<v 4>Well,
splice.
I wanted to say about comicon that,</v>

400
00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:43.803
<v 1>uh,</v>

401
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.990
<v 4>I,
I was charmed by that,
that group,</v>

402
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:51.120
they were so sweet and I had the occasion of seeing the last grateful dead show

403
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.790
in Chicago the week before.
And it's true,

404
00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.640
it was just delirium and there was just this joyous,

405
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.970
like imagine that all of these people in this room,

406
00:24:59.971 --> 00:25:04.110
we're dancing completely in a completely uninhibited fashion.

407
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.320
Can you imagine what that's like?
And that's what it's like at a dead show.

408
00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.390
And I hadn't seen one in a long time,

409
00:25:09.391 --> 00:25:14.391
but it was 150,000 people maybe dancing completely uninhibitedly and just happy

410
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.100
and free and relaxed.
And the comicon crowd was that way too.

411
00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.820
They were dressed as Batgirl or whatever,

412
00:25:23.821 --> 00:25:28.770
Batman and they were laughing together and they were amusing each other and they

413
00:25:28.771 --> 00:25:32.490
were delighted in each other and they were in love.
They really were in love.

414
00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.820
I was really charmed by that.
So I just want to make that,
um,

415
00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.210
express that.
But you asked a question about what bands,
what bands,

416
00:25:42.211 --> 00:25:46.140
where I like to hear
you,
man.
What do I manage?
Well,

417
00:25:46.141 --> 00:25:50.310
there was a great band back in the day called the amazing rhythm Masis and they

418
00:25:50.311 --> 00:25:54.390
only had one hit song was called third rate romance,

419
00:25:54.391 --> 00:25:57.480
low rent rendezvous,
which is kind of a clever song,

420
00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.090
but the way they could play live was extraordinary.

421
00:26:00.091 --> 00:26:03.530
And they were great songwriters,
really great songwriters.
And the lead fellow,

422
00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.770
Russell Smith still writes great songs for all the country guys.

423
00:26:07.771 --> 00:26:08.730
He's a Nashville guy now.

424
00:26:08.731 --> 00:26:12.550
They lived down there and you can still hire the amazing racist asis,

425
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.820
the amazing resumes to come to your house and play.
But,
um,

426
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.050
they,
I never felt like they had the right people pushing them along,

427
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.840
that they were something that they had that was unique,

428
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:29.280
that there was a soul that they had that really came across in their live

429
00:26:29.281 --> 00:26:34.110
performance and in their recordings that never was,
uh,

430
00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:37.770
didn't get fostered properly.
It didn't get to show him around.

431
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.620
And the records are really beautiful and they're,
you know,
they're,

432
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.140
they're among my treasures now.
Second,

433
00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:48.500
well,
I liked this fill a big head.
Todd.
Do you know,

434
00:26:48.501 --> 00:26:52.640
big head Todd and the monsters?
He's a really wonderful player.

435
00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:57.050
And,
uh,
I used to hit golf balls to his music.
I used to take,

436
00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:02.240
take a boombox to the driving range and hit golf balls too,
that,
uh,
you know,

437
00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:06.680
uh,
bittersweet,
you know,
those songs that they sing,
but he,

438
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:10.280
someone that on on his own,
he was from Colorado.

439
00:27:10.281 --> 00:27:15.140
He left and moved to Chicago to learn better how to play the blues.

440
00:27:15.141 --> 00:27:17.060
And he became great friends of Hubert,

441
00:27:17.061 --> 00:27:21.680
someone whom we know it was one of the great elders and stayed with Hubert,

442
00:27:21.681 --> 00:27:25.340
someone,
some someone and just played with them for,
I don't know,

443
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:30.040
a couple of years and was asked by his family to,

444
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:34.220
to play humor into the ground when they lowered his casket into the ground.

445
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:37.910
And he's a beautiful man who came to my party a couple of years ago,

446
00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.620
had a lot to drink,
uh,
got sick,
uh,
on my son's a cowboy boot,

447
00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.640
but fell asleep for a little while and then woke up around five in the morning

448
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:50.450
and played songs for two and a half hours straight.
So that's,

449
00:27:50.451 --> 00:27:53.180
he's got a great spirit.
That one.
Oh yeah,
yeah,

450
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.383
<v 3>it'd be mostly friends.</v>

451
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:58.590
My friend Steve Jordan has a band called the verbs with his wife,
Megan Voss.

452
00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.050
Love to manage him.
He just produced Keith Richards,
new new album with Keith and,

453
00:28:03.051 --> 00:28:07.350
and a grit,
world's greatest drummer.
And then we love Jenny Lewis.
I mean,
I would,

454
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.960
I would,
I'd love to manage her.
They'll for the laughs

455
00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:17.170
audience question.
Hey Bill.
Um,
my grandfather,
his birthday's coming up,

456
00:28:17.171 --> 00:28:21.120
he's turning 91,
and it's really hard to get him to laugh and I'm,

457
00:28:21.121 --> 00:28:22.900
I'm not very funny,
but you are.

458
00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:26.980
So I was wondering if you could help me out with a joke or his birthday.

459
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.970
<v 4>Okay.
I'm not,
I,
I usually forget jokes pretty quickly,
but I've got this one.</v>

460
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.570
I still have it.
My brother Brian is really good with the jokes and this is,

461
00:28:34.571 --> 00:28:38.770
I'm actually,
uh,
I've been appointed to an official Vatican,

462
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:43.540
a position.
I am,
I'm a,
the official Vatican,
uh,

463
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:48.340
Co consulate or whatever the hell I am to the pope on,
on humor.

464
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.210
It's true.
It's true.
It's true.

465
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.900
And so,
uh,
it turns out the pope wants me to play him when the movie's made.

466
00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:03.940
And,
uh,
maybe we'll see that that could use agent,
that could be his agent.

467
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:09.370
But he had a program when he came to the USA tell a joke to the pope.

468
00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.240
And so what they did was they asked people to like film themselves telling a

469
00:29:13.241 --> 00:29:17.650
joke to the pope.
And I'll tell you the joke I told to the pope and

470
00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:20.163
<v 1>we'll see.</v>

471
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:29.880
<v 4>So he's to a antenna.
Got Married.
Uh,</v>

472
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.900
that's a big news in my town.
These two antenna got married last week.

473
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.870
And uh,
the ceremony was,
you know,

474
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:44.910
it was okay,
was nice,
it was fine,
but the reception was extremely

475
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.903
<v 1>Miriam.</v>

476
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:52.080
[inaudible]

477
00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.600
<v 4>and that's,
that's PG 13.
I mean,
you can tell that.</v>

478
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.110
<v 1>Did you guys play with it?
Yeah.</v>

479
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.640
<v 6>So bill,
a lot of the work you've done in your life,
both in comedy and drama,</v>

480
00:30:07.641 --> 00:30:11.990
has dealt with artificial barriers,
human isolation and loneliness.

481
00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.180
So maybe you have some insight.

482
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:19.210
What's one of the most common and ridiculously sad ways that we make it harder

483
00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:21.230
to connect with each other?

484
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.970
<v 4>Well,
sometimes you get asked a question and the right,</v>

485
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.400
the right answer isn't right in front of you.
And you just sort of tried to,

486
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.180
cause it's a feeling.
It's a feeling that you're,
you're looking for.

487
00:30:37.181 --> 00:30:42.181
So I have to try to feel then we're and recall the most reason feeling of this.

488
00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.100
Okay.

489
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:44.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

490
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.960
<v 4>So I think,
I think that</v>

491
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.900
there's many ways to portray it or to show it,

492
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:57.780
but there's this feeling that we're alone.

493
00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.073
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

494
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.240
<v 4>And we're not alone.</v>

495
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:06.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

496
00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:09.540
<v 4>We're not alone.
And it's,</v>

497
00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:14.160
you can fool yourself that it's just you that feels pain.

498
00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:19.260
You can hypnotize yourself or delude yourself that no one could ever understand

499
00:31:19.261 --> 00:31:21.090
how I feel.
No one could ever,

500
00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:26.310
no one's ever felt this fucking miserable as I feel right now.
And it's wrong.

501
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:27.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

502
00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:33.280
<v 4>Because you felt that miserable and you felt that miserable.</v>

503
00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:39.570
And life is hard enough that the idea of elevating ourselves and making

504
00:31:42.071 --> 00:31:43.090
ourselves better,

505
00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:48.390
perfecting ourselves or becoming more of our true self is so daunting and so

506
00:31:48.641 --> 00:31:50.530
impossible that we have to,

507
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:55.710
we have to grab and realize that we can not to do it alone.

508
00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.000
And there's a,

509
00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:02.410
there's a connection that you have to me,

510
00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:09.210
certainly by asking the question and to all of us by asking the question because

511
00:32:09.671 --> 00:32:14.671
you're asking all of us this question and all of us have this question

512
00:32:15.461 --> 00:32:16.061
ourselves,

513
00:32:16.061 --> 00:32:20.590
whether it's in the front of our head as you were speaking or if it is now,

514
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.740
we all have this question.
And

515
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:30.270
to let that question settled down in you is really the bravery is the courage.

516
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.230
It's the try.
It's a try.
You know,
you can,

517
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:40.220
you've got to try.
You know,
it's not,
it's easy to

518
00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:41.840
<v 1>okay,</v>

519
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:46.840
<v 4>distract yourself or to be distracted or to turn on a television or to drink a</v>

520
00:32:47.301 --> 00:32:52.301
beer or a read of cartoons or stupid anything or to just,

521
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:56.380
you know,
walk up and down stairs,
but to try to come back and say,

522
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:57.783
<v 1>okay,</v>

523
00:32:59.050 --> 00:32:59.861
<v 4>observance,
hey,</v>

524
00:32:59.861 --> 00:33:04.861
this is who I am right now and it's okay that I'm this person now and it's okay

525
00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:11.520
that I keep coming back to this now because I'm trying to not feel that way as a

526
00:33:11.951 --> 00:33:12.340
rule.

527
00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:17.340
I'm trying to overcome the weakness of letting the emotions take me down.

528
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.990
And by seeing it in the Ed at the moment,
something changes,

529
00:33:22.991 --> 00:33:27.991
like something lands in your this different and you were able to feel the grace.

530
00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:34.410
It's really grace that can push you to try and it's like there's no harm in

531
00:33:35.321 --> 00:33:38.320
trying.
Right.
It's not going to make is not going to break you maybe,

532
00:33:38.321 --> 00:33:42.940
but there can be no harm in trying and if you try,

533
00:33:42.941 --> 00:33:45.040
you feel better about yourself.

534
00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:47.520
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

535
00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:52.520
[inaudible]

536
00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:58.620
<v 7>this question is for bill.
You,</v>

537
00:33:58.621 --> 00:34:03.290
you told us earlier how you worked with a lot of monsters over the time and it

538
00:34:03.291 --> 00:34:06.380
seems just in the first decade of the two thousands where the arts as they're

539
00:34:06.381 --> 00:34:08.900
sometimes known.
You did a lot of independent films,

540
00:34:08.901 --> 00:34:11.860
but I quite enjoy the ones that you did with Jim Jarmusch.
We'll it,

541
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:15.650
so the lost in translation with Sofia Coppola,

542
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.870
was that kind of,
uh,

543
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:22.690
what you turned into doing more independent films versus the,

544
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.810
the blockbusters or is that just what I turned into this.
Okay.

545
00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:31.710
<v 4>No,
I didn't really turn to it.
It wasn't a reaction to anything.
I don't,
I like I,</v>

546
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.500
I didn't really have any kind of a plan.
I just,

547
00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:38.950
I just do the ones I like to do.
I'm not very organized.

548
00:34:38.951 --> 00:34:40.690
I just do the ones I like to do.
Like I said,

549
00:34:40.691 --> 00:34:44.800
I'd do this movie seven years ago and it wasn't like,

550
00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:48.880
oh that was seven years ago,
man.
No I said I'd do it.
I mean that's,
I like it.

551
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:53.590
That doesn't change.
I didn't have any religion,
any plan.

552
00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:58.270
They just came this way and I had a certain kind of lock in that I feel if you

553
00:34:58.271 --> 00:35:02.560
do this job and you don't completely embarrass yourself,

554
00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:07.300
that you remain legitimate.
You,
you were,
you remain viable.

555
00:35:07.301 --> 00:35:10.180
I've done casting myself where you look through the book and you go like,

556
00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:14.110
oh here's so and so.
Oh my God,
he did that horrible watch McCall,
that movie.

557
00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:16.180
Remember that piece of crap he did.
You know,

558
00:35:16.181 --> 00:35:18.240
and you go and you lose that guy cause he,

559
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:22.690
anyone that would sign on to a death ship like that,
that's bad.
You can't,

560
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.760
you know,
you don't just don't trust him anymore.

561
00:35:24.761 --> 00:35:28.060
I've been lucky about choosing like I haven't,

562
00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:33.910
I haven't done anything,
you know,
for which I could be prosecuted,
you know,

563
00:35:33.911 --> 00:35:37.210
I couldn't do,
you know,
and that you just stay viable.

564
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:41.400
And then sort of this next generation of people like Wes Anderson and Sophia,

565
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:44.340
they go,
we'll get that guy's okay.
He's not terrible yet.
And then you get,

566
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:48.870
you get to work more.
It's the same in every kind of career I think.
You know,

567
00:35:48.871 --> 00:35:52.770
it was like a carpenter makes a great piece of work.
He doesn't rip people off.

568
00:35:52.771 --> 00:35:56.020
It's like,
Hey,
this guy made my garage,
you know,
he's good.
You know,
you,

569
00:35:56.410 --> 00:36:01.140
you last your,
your mark,
your reputation lives,
you know,
you don't kill it.

570
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:06.540
Thank you.
So we have two books here that you have brought with you.

571
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.440
Um,
importing always by Lillian Ross.

572
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:15.270
Yes.
Okay.
This is,
it's called reporting always.

573
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:19.140
She was what they call the reporter back when she started writing.

574
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:23.340
Then she became a journalist because they changed the job title.

575
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:27.360
Her name is Lillian Ross and she's most famous for writing for the New Yorker

576
00:36:27.361 --> 00:36:32.020
for decades.
And she did profiles of,

577
00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.250
you can help me here.
She had profiles of some of the most famous people anyway,

578
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.770
of the century,
Hemingway and chaplain and John Houston.

579
00:36:40.771 --> 00:36:44.430
And there's spectacular to read her.
One of Hemingway was,

580
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:49.460
was groundbreaking because Hemingway was this mythic character,

581
00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:52.230
this gigantic character.
And she,

582
00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:57.000
she gave him a human voice that was beautiful to read and engaging.

583
00:36:57.001 --> 00:37:01.770
You felt like you knew the man by reading her words.
Um,
she's,

584
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:05.910
she wrote for the New Yorker for many 40 years or something like that.

585
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.550
And she had a romance with the man who was the editor,

586
00:37:08.551 --> 00:37:12.660
a secret romance with the man who was the editor of that wasn't that much of a

587
00:37:12.661 --> 00:37:14.640
secret,
but it was kind of a secret romance.

588
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.910
And then when that editor was fired,

589
00:37:17.911 --> 00:37:22.911
she's quit working for the paper for the magazine and then a new way to editor

590
00:37:23.071 --> 00:37:25.200
came later and she went back to writing for them.

591
00:37:25.201 --> 00:37:30.120
She's 90 now and I've read a bunch of her stuff and she's,

592
00:37:30.121 --> 00:37:32.280
I've been friendly with her and I get it.
I like to tease her.

593
00:37:32.281 --> 00:37:34.950
She's like a little thing,
got curly hair.
And you can just mess with her.

594
00:37:34.951 --> 00:37:38.220
She's a lot of fun and she's real.
She's real smart and real funny.

595
00:37:38.221 --> 00:37:41.130
So you can mess with her all you like and she'll take it.

596
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:45.090
And then any moment she just gives you look like I could bite your head off,

597
00:37:45.091 --> 00:37:49.350
you know that.
And she's fun.
She's really a lot of fun to be with.
So her friend,

598
00:37:49.351 --> 00:37:52.590
he asked me to do some sort of thing,
I dunno,

599
00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:57.180
something modern to help her sell her book.
And I didn't know the answer to it.

600
00:37:57.181 --> 00:38:00.450
And someone said,
well,
if you bring it along,
maybe some people will notice it.

601
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:04.980
There's a little,
there's a little caricature over.
She's a sweetie.
But there's,

602
00:38:04.981 --> 00:38:09.960
um,
so I started looking at this book.
There's a profile of the,

603
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:13.130
do you know what the junior league is?
You know the,
the,

604
00:38:13.131 --> 00:38:15.170
the women's junior league.
She does,

605
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.560
she did a profile here in 1954 of the women's junior league that I think might

606
00:38:19.561 --> 00:38:22.920
be one of the funniest things I've ever read in my entire life.

607
00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:27.420
And it's all facts.
It's just the facts,
ma'am.
Just the facts.

608
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:31.290
She just writes the facts down and you are,
I,
I mean,

609
00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:35.380
I was shaking a shaking,
reading this thing anyway,
if you're in,

610
00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.780
if you're interested in journalism or you're interested in writing or you're

611
00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:44.230
interested in knowing what it's like to have real ears,

612
00:38:44.231 --> 00:38:48.880
to have a higher developed sense of listening,
of hearing,

613
00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:54.670
you know,
we're in this sort of state,
you know,
and what have we got?
If you said,

614
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:57.040
as you,
when you're awake and waking state,
you know,

615
00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.020
you wake up and you've got your eyes,

616
00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:03.340
then you've got your ears and your taste and your,

617
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:08.110
you know,
you've got these,
these,
these functions that these,
these,

618
00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:13.030
these aspects that you can work with her ears are like unlike anything I've ever

619
00:39:13.031 --> 00:39:17.440
seen and the way she hears and the way that her ears,

620
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:22.120
um,
almost separate that,
which is essential from that,
which is not,

621
00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:26.290
and she's able to recall it and put it down.
It's an amazing piece of,

622
00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:30.790
of literature too.
And it's,
and yet it's not literature,
it's writing,

623
00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.830
it's writing.
It's just facts.
And it's extraordinary.
It's called reporting.

624
00:39:35.831 --> 00:39:40.630
Always.
Her name is Lillian Ross.
And a few.
Um,
I,
I,

625
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:45.170
I was told that I the,
the idea would be to bring books out.
We have some for the,

626
00:39:45.171 --> 00:39:47.370
I've got some books,
some,
so after the,
you know,

627
00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:52.730
I don't know how many books there are,
but this is,
um,

628
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.970
this is some Dame.
She's really something.
This one,

629
00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:00.890
she's a real pistol and uh,
and kind.

630
00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:03.500
And then he got that one and this is a,

631
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:08.060
and then I mentioned that I was going to say something about that.
And my friend,

632
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:11.750
I said to my friend who had a funny look on his face,

633
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:15.680
you were talking about that thing about helping someone carrying something off

634
00:40:15.681 --> 00:40:18.710
of a truck or something.
And we have a friend who,

635
00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.593
<v 1>who</v>

636
00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:24.270
<v 4>is cursed with great wealth,
you know,
and it's</v>

637
00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:26.090
<v 1>okay.</v>

638
00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:31.010
<v 4>And all he does is pick up the checks of the world.
That's all he does.</v>

639
00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:35.810
And it's amazing you see on his face that he feels this sense of obligation that

640
00:40:35.811 --> 00:40:37.970
because he's been blessed with this,

641
00:40:37.971 --> 00:40:41.990
that he has to sort of even it up all the way across the world.

642
00:40:41.991 --> 00:40:45.050
Everywhere he goes,
everywhere he goes

643
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:51.290
in the quietest,
most subtle way.
He just passes the money back.

644
00:40:51.291 --> 00:40:54.500
He just tries to pass it all back.
And I said,
Gee,

645
00:40:54.501 --> 00:40:56.720
I wonder if there's something you'd like me to talk about.
And he said,

646
00:40:56.721 --> 00:41:01.310
his friend has a cookbook.
His friend has a cookbook,

647
00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.820
right?
This is the guy.
It's not like,
Hey,
uh,
you know,

648
00:41:04.821 --> 00:41:09.290
kept me a date with a supermodel.
No.
He's like,
um,
my friend has a cookbook.

649
00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:12.770
That's the way he thinks.
And this book is called crossroads.

650
00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.370
And our friend has this restaurant in California,

651
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:17.760
in Los Angeles called crossroads.

652
00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:21.590
It's a Vegan restaurant with a really good bar,

653
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:27.530
which is the vegans blow my mind.
They really do.

654
00:41:27.531 --> 00:41:30.620
It's like they're stoners and they're drunks and they're vegans.
They're just,

655
00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:34.880
I don't know how they do.
I don't know.
And I'm okay.
I'm down with that.

656
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:39.080
It's like you're a Morgan and a Mormon,
and you believe,
but you've got nine whys.

657
00:41:39.081 --> 00:41:42.860
Okay.
It's cool.
I'm all right.
It's just,
it's just an interpretation.

658
00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:48.850
And anyway,
this fellow's name is towel Ronan,
and he wrote this book.
Crossers.

659
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:53.720
I've eaten this guy's food and it is,
it's ridiculous.
Dazzling cause he,
he,
he,

660
00:41:53.721 --> 00:41:54.270
he's a,

661
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:54.771
<v 3>you know,</v>

662
00:41:54.771 --> 00:41:59.771
a trained chef and he has vegan food that doubles as tastes like,

663
00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:05.850
you know,
like he'll have a,
you know,
bone yeas sauce or Lasagna or whatever.

664
00:42:05.851 --> 00:42:09.690
And it,
it really is an amazing magic act.
And the food's wonderful.

665
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:11.680
<v 4>It really is magic.
Yeah,
it really is.</v>

666
00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:14.950
Cause it's tastes like something that you think it is and is not.

667
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:19.930
It really is extra.
So if you eat food or know people that do,

668
00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.050
this would be a great one to give them cause it's,

669
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:26.200
it may be the future that we have to eat healthy.
You never know.

670
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.040
And we have some copies for you guys too.
And we all put into those too.
Yeah.

671
00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.100
Cool.
Just for showing up all your duties.

672
00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.560
So I kind of want to end with this.
One of my

673
00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.550
<v 2>favorite scenes is actually not in the movie was actually the tag.</v>

674
00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:43.410
And I think that was just absolutely hilarious.

675
00:42:43.411 --> 00:42:47.640
So was there any of your favorite scenes or seen that may have gotten cut just

676
00:42:47.641 --> 00:42:49.590
for a time or just didn't fit in the story?

677
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.500
<v 3>The,
the,
the tag you're referring to is,</v>

678
00:42:51.501 --> 00:42:56.501
is was the very last scene we shot on the very last day and a in Morocco and

679
00:42:57.561 --> 00:43:01.120
there was just a spectacular looking older man there.
And,
and,
and,

680
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:05.660
and earlier bill was talking about Buster Keaton earlier in the day and there is

681
00:43:05.661 --> 00:43:05.960
a,

682
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.960
there is an an incredible invented seeing between bill and this,

683
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.140
this,
you know,
75 year old Moroccan mandate,
you know,

684
00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:19.940
at a store kind of discussing or arguing over,
you know,

685
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:24.770
string and an elephant and how much it's gonna cost and anything else on the tag

686
00:43:24.771 --> 00:43:27.410
as credits go.
So stick around and watch it because it's beautiful.

687
00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:28.431
My favorite scene,

688
00:43:28.431 --> 00:43:33.080
one of my favorite scenes in the movie is the scene that bill does.
I'm in one,

689
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:35.990
I mean it's a,
it's shot through a window of a,

690
00:43:35.991 --> 00:43:40.160
of a truck bill gets out of the truck,
goes out,
thinks about something,

691
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:43.280
turns around and comes back to the car and delivers a scene.

692
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:46.490
There are no cuts in it.
He did it twice and uh,

693
00:43:46.491 --> 00:43:49.310
I was sitting with Barry Levinson,
both of us really Mao's open.

694
00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:53.750
It's just a beautiful piece of acting and insane ride,
really well written.

695
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:58.790
And um,
and uh,
yeah,
that's my favorite scene in the,
and then move it.
Yeah.

696
00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.030
<v 1>How about you?
Well,</v>

697
00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:16.070
<v 4>no,
they're all perfect.
No,
I don't,
I'm trying to think of something.</v>

698
00:44:16.071 --> 00:44:19.610
I'm trying to think of something that just made a strong impression on me

699
00:44:19.611 --> 00:44:20.450
watching wise.

700
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.270
This little man that I'd do the scene with the string with is really something.

701
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:27.380
He wasn't even an actor,
he was just a guy.
It was an amazing face.

702
00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:30.770
And I basically Hungle and try to like,
you know,

703
00:44:30.771 --> 00:44:34.060
like bite him down on the price of string.
You know,
it's like not a,

704
00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:37.350
not a very nice scene,
but very fun.
Um,

705
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.353
there were,

706
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:44.580
I think the really seen that I miss that I love the most about was just being in

707
00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:49.230
Morocco was seeing the way,
I've never seen people drive like this.

708
00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:53.250
There's multiple kinds of vehicles.
There's,

709
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:57.600
there's still animals,
there's still animals pulling wagons,

710
00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:01.770
there's big trucks.
There's semi tractor trailers,

711
00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:07.340
there's a lot of these crazy three wheeled motorcycles with huge carrying racks

712
00:45:07.921 --> 00:45:12.330
on the back.
Every one of them was different.
There were motorcycles that were,

713
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:16.770
that had like a,
like a bed in the back of it that we saw one that had,

714
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.740
hey,
there was maybe 16 feet high,

715
00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:23.940
but the combinations of junk that they put into these motorcycles and drove,

716
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.810
and then there were people on bicycles and all kinds of different vehicles.

717
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:33.060
And I never saw people drive and miss each other like this.

718
00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:37.500
They just moved off.
They were like fish,
you know,

719
00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:41.520
you don't see fish crash into each other,
right.
You don't see a school of fish.

720
00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:46.050
Well sorry,
you know,
they just kind of go,
hey,
hey,
hey,

721
00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.570
like the blue angels.
But there's thousands of them.

722
00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:52.320
And that's what Morocco was like.
And you'd see,
you know,

723
00:45:52.321 --> 00:45:56.250
if you've ever been to Asia or someplace where you see an entire family on a

724
00:45:56.251 --> 00:45:59.430
motor scooter,
there'll be five people on a motor scooter.

725
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:05.090
And the woman always dressed in beautiful color riding sidesaddle on the back.

726
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:07.850
And I think this is great.

727
00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.250
You know there's like there's a kid in front of the dad,

728
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.570
there's two kids in between.

729
00:46:12.571 --> 00:46:16.620
And then there's a mom and she's holding a kid and she's on the back and she's

730
00:46:16.621 --> 00:46:21.621
riding sidesaddle and they'd all fall and they don't crash and they just move

731
00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:26.190
like this.
They just move their really beautiful people.
Great.

732
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.080
Well thank you guys so much for being here.

733
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:31.880
<v 1>That's right.
Thank you.
[inaudible]</v>

734
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:36.250
go see.
Yeah,

735
00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:40.450
<v 4>yeah.
I have a question.
I asked it outside and I maybe one of you guys,</v>

736
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:45.820
which one do you guys is the brains of Google?
Can I oh,
there you are.
So,

737
00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.380
um,
so I've got a question.

738
00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:53.220
Why is Google asks me for my secret password night keeps I say no,

739
00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:57.520
but it keeps asking me,
isn't it smart enough to like get the hint,

740
00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:01.540
I'm not going to give it out.
Why do they,
why does it keep asking it?

741
00:47:01.541 --> 00:47:05.110
Shouldn't it know that I'm not going to do that?
Cause I'm just shy.

742
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:12.190
Like many things in life.
First.
Safety.
No,
I agree with you.

743
00:47:12.191 --> 00:47:14.830
I believe it though about the safety,
but I just tried to,

744
00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:18.850
I always feel like a guy asked me a question today,
what is,

745
00:47:18.851 --> 00:47:23.740
what is your secret to life?
And I said,
if I told you my secret,

746
00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.110
then it's not a secret anymore,
is it?

747
00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.010
And would you ever want to be involved with someone that couldn't keep a,
would

748
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.960
<v 2>you like to be friends with some of the,
couldn't keep a secret.</v>

749
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:36.610
I guess I'm just going over the same old territory again,
but that's,

750
00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:38.230
that's sort of how I feel.

751
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:42.850
It's nice to come here and put a face with the bicycle.
Thanks

752
00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:43.220
<v 1>very well.</v>

753
00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:48.220
[inaudible] I was out this weekend.

754
