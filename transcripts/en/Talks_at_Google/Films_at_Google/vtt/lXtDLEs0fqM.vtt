00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.830
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the toxic Google.
I'm Kevin Belkin.

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.390
Today we have Mr. George Miller,
writer,

3
00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:10.640
director and producer of Mad Max fury road.

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.380
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

5
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.250
<v 1>So you were turning to the franchise that you started decades ago.</v>

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.780
So what was that like and in getting this,
uh,
written,

7
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.370
produced and filmed?
Well,
it was a,

8
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.810
<v 2>an epic saga in itself in that,
uh,
it was,
uh,</v>

9
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.640
greenlit three times and fill down twice.
Uh,

10
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.960
and we eventually got to make the movie.
Um,

11
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.190
uh,
eh,
eventually,
the first thing that,

12
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.680
that sort of brought it down was nine 11.
We were about to shoot and,

13
00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:53.410
um,
uh,
suddenly a budget,
uh,

14
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.980
Australian dollar dropped by about 25 to 70% of the night.

15
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.290
So we regrouped.
I went on to happy feet.
Uh,
we,
we,

16
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.460
we recast half a decade later and,
um,

17
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.640
eh,
Eh,
with,
from Mel Gibson's a Tom Hardy and then Shelly [inaudible]

18
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.600
and,
uh,
we were about to shoot in,

19
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.640
in the outback of Australia and massive rains came and turned the flat red earth

20
00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:24.610
into a flower garden and,
uh,
the salt lakes into it,

21
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.710
into marshland.
And,
uh,

22
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.910
so we had to wait another 18 months and eventually it didn't dry out enough.

23
00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:35.110
So he had to get to the southwest coast of,
of,
of Africa.

24
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.690
There may be a way it never rains,
eventually.
Got To shoot the movie.
And so,

25
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.990
<v 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.990
between 2001 when it was first green lit to 2013 when you started shooting,

27
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.580
what,
what,
what changes were there in the script?

28
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.990
<v 2>Um,
or in the story,
this script,
the script didn't change much.</v>

29
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.390
The,
we basically boarded the movie very,

30
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:02.190
very early on and which is a great tool to help everyone sort of,

31
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.223
uh,

32
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.180
mount the production and the work through the logistics and so on.
Uh,

33
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.990
so didn't really change a lot what the two things obviously costs change.

34
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.670
And,
uh,

35
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.730
but the biggest thing that changed was the technology things that we might've

36
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.660
done a decade ago.
Uh,
w w w might have,

37
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.850
sorry,
the things we could do a decade later,
we couldn't have done a dickhead.

38
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.260
Got The cameras.
We're much more agile.
Um,

39
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.850
we initially were going to shoot native Stereo Three d,
uh,

40
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.320
we built small cameras,
but we could build six of them.

41
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.750
And we suddenly thought,
wait a minute,
conversion to three D is there much,

42
00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:49.950
much better.
It was,
uh,
a h he goes by the,
everyone's getting much,

43
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:50.784
much better at it.

44
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.210
And so we decided to go straight digital to two d cameras and then post convert.

45
00:02:57.541 --> 00:03:01.870
And they're really good decision.
We,
you know,
put,

46
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.400
put cameras in dangerous places and uh,

47
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:11.320
we read quite a few,
but they were relatively cheap cameras and uh,

48
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.280
eh,
not the expensive ones,
but uh,
so we couldn't have done that.

49
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:17.550
And then we had things like edge,
the edge arm,

50
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.790
which is an amazing four wheel drive with a big crane on it.

51
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:26.110
And then a three headed based,
which was basically a stunt driver,

52
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:30.400
great stunt driver,
a a grip crane grip,

53
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.720
working toggles and moving the crane can move anywhere.

54
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.340
And an operator,
a camera operator,
zoom,
Pan Tilt,

55
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.870
and me sitting watching a screen.
And it was,
it was,

56
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.710
it was like being in a living,
um,
video game.

57
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.170
It was amazing that Cameron could go,

58
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.630
you could right down into the dust and then swoop up across tires of a war egg

59
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:59.350
right into an actor's face.

60
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.520
And it just gave the movie a really big kinetic energy that we would,

61
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.210
would not have been able to get without that tool.
So,

62
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.510
so those things change.
Plus I think audiences changed.

63
00:04:12.511 --> 00:04:17.140
We were getting were speed reading movies now.
So we,
we,

64
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.030
we,
we can,
we can,
movies are getting many more,

65
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.950
many more cuts in them than they did in the past.
Um,
I,

66
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.260
someone told me recently that the first Jurassic Park had about 950 shots.

67
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.610
Uh,
uh,

68
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:38.010
and I'm sure the last one where I've had two or three times more than that.
Um,

69
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.800
red wire back in 1981 had 1200 shots and this movie a little longer,

70
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.580
but it had a 2,800 shots.

71
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.330
So things are getting fast.

72
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.130
<v 1>Yeah.
And yeah,
so you're talking about technology.
I mean,</v>

73
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.120
the movies crazy in the best of ways.
I mean,

74
00:04:59.121 --> 00:05:02.030
it's a huge adrenaline ride and it's insane and,

75
00:05:02.031 --> 00:05:06.370
but you really use a lot of practical,
you shot on location.
So a lot of it,

76
00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:09.740
it wasn't green screen and it wasn't,
a lot of,
it was real stunts.

77
00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:12.680
And you actually had Tom Hardy up on that scene where he's flipping back and

78
00:05:12.681 --> 00:05:13.880
forth and the pole and everything.

79
00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:18.881
So can you talk about mixing in practical stunts and real sets and real

80
00:05:19.191 --> 00:05:21.830
locations versus using the crutches CG?

81
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.540
<v 2>Well,
it,
it,</v>

82
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.580
this film doesn't defy the laws of physics.

83
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.330
You know,
there's no spacecraft.
There's no,
uh,
it's,
it's grounded.

84
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.160
Uh,
so we,
uh,
we,
we,
it's real people,

85
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.600
real people,
real vehicles colliding in a real desert.

86
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.830
And it doesn't make it sense to do it.
See g when you can do it for real,

87
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.630
it's more logistically,
it's difficult.

88
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.610
The logistics,
you know,
particularly when you go to a far remote location,

89
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.640
uh,
because it's like a military exercise,

90
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.070
but particularly when you're working in,

91
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.210
in the dust and the car rolls and the dust simulations are great,

92
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:12.760
but you can never quite simulated,
uh,
uh,
Eh,
Eh,

93
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.040
you know,
the real thing is much more interesting.
And,

94
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.270
and so a principal was let's do it old school and then augment it.
Uh,

95
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.700
should we need to,
uh,
with,
with,
with digitally,
uh,

96
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.040
you,
you,
you know,
I used to watch the old movies where cars would do,

97
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.940
uh,
you could tell the number of takes I by the skid marks on the road when they

98
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:39.410
would do a handbrake,
do you turn?
And you could see that,
you can see,
well,

99
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.120
now you can erase,
take one,
two,
three and use take forward.

100
00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:46.220
And the same going across the desert.
You can erase that.

101
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:48.260
And most importantly,

102
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.290
you can put big harnesses on your stunt crew and your actors so that they would

103
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:58.880
be free to move on vehicles,
which are moving at speed and you know,

104
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:02.120
they're not going to fall to their death.
So that was a big deal.
And you could,

105
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.940
and you could erase the harnesses.
So that was a big deal.

106
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.890
<v 1>Well that brings up a great point because I'm really interested in knowing,</v>

107
00:07:08.891 --> 00:07:11.350
cause you guys shot for about six months.
Was it right?

108
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.200
<v 2>We shut for 138 days.
Okay.
That's,</v>

109
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.420
I guess we were in the desert for,
um,

110
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.050
I think seven months.

111
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

112
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.480
So you're there for seven months and practically some movies have like one or

113
00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:31.590
maybe a handful of stones.
You,
I imagine have stands just about every day.

114
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.580
And so how are you able to manage and balance the,

115
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.240
the movie what you need to get,
what you want to get from,
you know,

116
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.420
a storyboard and script to safety and having all the,

117
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.570
the crews do it every single day.

118
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.680
<v 2>That's,
that's,
that was the biggest issue for me.</v>

119
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.480
And I think for everybody else,
um,
you,

120
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.200
you're out there and you know,
it's an arduous shoot.

121
00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:03.640
Fatigue sets in.
It's,
it's,
uh,
you know,

122
00:08:03.641 --> 00:08:08.200
by mid day gets very hot,
there's dust everywhere.
And,
um,

123
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:13.450
and every day is a big stunt day.
And,
and,
and w,

124
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.600
W,
W so you had to be immensely prepared.

125
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.190
We had a great stunt crew,
we had great stunt rigors,

126
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.610
uh,
and we are obsessed with safety,
a safety at all costs.
And,

127
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.360
and unless you do that,
you know,
the,
the moment you let your guard down,

128
00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:34.630
even on something that seems relatively simple,
uh,

129
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.610
inevitably something can go wrong.
So you just really,
really have to,

130
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.730
you know,
we're very,
very mindful of that.
And,

131
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.540
and we,
you know,
and we came out without any broken limbs or,
you know,

132
00:08:49.541 --> 00:08:52.840
there were bruises,
there are a couple of cuts there.
You know,
there were,

133
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.260
there were,
but nothing at all major.
Um,
and,

134
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.740
and,
and,
and,
and that's partly,
you know,

135
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:08.000
people who are really determined not to have that happen.
And yet,
and yet,
um,

136
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.670
uh,
you know,

137
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.370
there was some things that we were able to do that I never imagined we could do.

138
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.860
Those guys on the Poles,

139
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.600
I always thought would be shot green screen and then we'd,
uh,

140
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.840
we'd,
we'd comp them into the vehicles moving underneath.

141
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.520
I thought it'd be too risky if something went wrong with one of those vehicles.

142
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.950
One of the benefits of the delays that the,

143
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.590
the stunt crew were able to work on them and work out a pendulum system.
Big,

144
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:41.810
big heavyweight underneath for those guys too,
you know.
And,

145
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.800
and one day I looked up and there they were coming through the desert,

146
00:09:44.801 --> 00:09:49.730
so you know,
and,
and,
and that it got so safe,
uh,

147
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.550
we were able to add some honey on top of one and that was really great.

148
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.540
It just feels more,
sorry,
how do you feel?
How do I,

149
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.830
well,
it wasn't until he got up there that he said,
Hey George,

150
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:06.700
I'm scared of heights.
And I thought,
well,
don't eat,

151
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.220
could we tried,
he wasn't joking,
he was scared of heights,
but he's very bright.

152
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.780
You know,
he got guys like,
he know he was a rugby player,

153
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:20.940
very athletic and very skilled at that sequential memory of,

154
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:25.290
of,
of events.
So the fights,
they're able to do work.
He worked very,

155
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:29.870
very well with us.
Stunt doubles and so on.
And the same as Shirley's.
She,

156
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.880
she,
she,
having been an accomplished ballet dancer also had that,

157
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:38.440
that skillset.
So they were able to take on a huge amount.
Um,

158
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.410
and that was really great.

159
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.380
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean the cast is phenomenal.
I kinda want to go back though to pay.
Um,</v>

160
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.490
you didn't really start with a script.

161
00:10:46.491 --> 00:10:49.700
You have to start with storyboards and you work with Brendan Mccarthy on this

162
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.900
and created basically the s two plus hour chasing and throughout the whole
movie.

163
00:10:53.901 --> 00:10:55.840
But you didn't start with a script.
So that was,

164
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.750
I found that really interesting in terms of you visualize the entire movie and

165
00:10:59.751 --> 00:11:04.130
kind of played it almost as a silent just action film versus,
Oh,

166
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.080
this with this character says here,
this is what this,

167
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.030
it was more visually telling the story.

168
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.760
<v 2>Yes,
it does.
It for me,
you know,</v>

169
00:11:10.761 --> 00:11:15.761
have always been interested in and action cinema for a lot of reasons.

170
00:11:16.851 --> 00:11:21.280
It's that cold movies,
uh,
you,
you,
you,
you,
you,
and,

171
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.720
and also I realized when I first got intrigued by making movies,

172
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.300
um,
I realized that most of this new language we call film language,

173
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.230
uh,
it,
it's only about 120 years old.

174
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.080
It's an acquired language and it's always evolving.

175
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:44.530
And most of it was defined pretty sound in the films of Buster Keaton and Harold

176
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.460
Lloyd and the two real westerns and Max sentence.
Uh,

177
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.350
they were essentially action movies.
So,
so for me,

178
00:11:56.351 --> 00:11:58.720
this is like a silent movie with sound.

179
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:03.250
Obviously sound is incredibly critical in the storytelling and it's amazing how

180
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:06.790
even the subtlest of sound can change the experience.

181
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:11.490
But the basic form was a silent movie.
It could be if you were deaf,

182
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.790
uh,
you could still read this movie,
uh,
uh,

183
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.130
pretty well and not lose anything.
Um,
and,

184
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:24.170
uh,
so,
so the natural form of it was,

185
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.610
it was going to be in storyboards.
We did sort of

186
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.140
do a quick draft of the basic events that happened,

187
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:37.170
but it was in the storyboard where we defined as much as we could the characters

188
00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:41.260
and the events and the design of the film.
Then when we had,

189
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:46.060
we ended up with 3,500 storyboards,
uh,
and then we,

190
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.910
and then we wrote a version before we,
which,
uh,
you know,

191
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:54.570
to the studios and so on also so that people can read it.
You can't,

192
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.670
it's very difficult to read storyboards because it misses the one important

193
00:13:00.161 --> 00:13:04.330
dimension and that is time and rhythm.
But,
uh,

194
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.110
so we used to reading screenplays so that we,
we,

195
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:12.010
we had a kind of an illustrated screenplays illustrated by several panels of

196
00:13:12.011 --> 00:13:17.011
storyboard and then basically set out in the more conventional way with dialogue

197
00:13:18.221 --> 00:13:19.900
and some description.

198
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.990
<v 1>One of the things I noticed,
I just watched the film again last night.</v>

199
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:27.991
This is my fifth time and I'm obsessed with just the vehicles and the intention

200
00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:30.970
that detail with everything.
And especially using,

201
00:13:30.971 --> 00:13:35.971
you've used a lot of items that are very practical and even the set design and

202
00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:39.310
the costumes and the vehicles that are almost,
yes,

203
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:42.550
of course his or be in a Po postflop Popkin apocalyptic world,
you know.

204
00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:47.551
And so it was the flame throwing guitars using uh,

205
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.920
it looked like there was like a bed pan or something,
like all this crazy stuff.

206
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.420
And so can you talk about just the,
the real attention to detail.

207
00:13:55.421 --> 00:13:58.420
Working with your set design has your vehicle designers and getting those

208
00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.254
details in there.

209
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:04.290
<v 2>It's very important when you're telling a story with just so helter skelter</v>

210
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.770
kinetic that you,
that you have very,

211
00:14:07.771 --> 00:14:11.930
very clear design principles.
If you're like,
uh,

212
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.780
everyone had to work to the same rule,
uh,

213
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.380
otherwise it would just be visual noise.
Um,
so,

214
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.410
so the kind of rules who work,
uh,
to,
uh,

215
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.070
that everything was basically found objects repurposed.

216
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:34.490
So if you notice that the mask that Max where's is made from a garden fork,

217
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.590
um,
uh,
the,

218
00:14:36.591 --> 00:14:41.591
the vehicles had to be vehicles which didn't have the most modern technology

219
00:14:42.241 --> 00:14:45.030
with microprocessors and crunch technology.

220
00:14:45.031 --> 00:14:48.810
And so on and airbags because they wouldn't really survive anything with a

221
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:54.450
computer computer driven or the electric electricals are too complex or the

222
00:14:56.151 --> 00:15:00.560
mechanics were too complex or sophisticated,
wouldn't have survived.
So it,

223
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.430
the vehicles had to be older.
Um,
every weapon,

224
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:07.820
if you look at the arm that Furiosa where's it's got,

225
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.920
it's got spanners and,
and stuff that you could find a,
as you say,
the,

226
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.000
the,
the guitar double naked Tar.
It is,

227
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.060
part of it is a hospital bed pan.

228
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:24.470
It's made from a guitar and it's also Framestore are and,
and uh,

229
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.990
so everything had to work from that logic,

230
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:32.020
found objects and repurposed and it also included and then also applied to

231
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:36.680
costume and language.
If you look at the language of the film,

232
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:41.240
it was phrases that we might use and corrupted in some way.

233
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:46.350
A steering wheel,
um,
um,
becomes a,

234
00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:52.130
you know,
a semi religious artifact,
uh,
[inaudible] and uh,

235
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.520
so all of that sort of unified the film to some degree.

236
00:15:58.071 --> 00:16:00.530
We were quite rigorous about those sorts of things.

237
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:05.450
The war rig was kind of a hybrid of,
of,
of of many things.
The,

238
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.970
the,
the importance,
uh,

239
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:12.800
we call it the Gig a horse was because it was like he's mobile throne.

240
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.330
He had the most resources,
so it's a double the Cadillac.

241
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.590
Um,
uh,
so we had to sort of follow that logic.

242
00:16:21.591 --> 00:16:26.240
And the other thing we said,
um,
without going on too long,
we is,

243
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.760
we said that just because it's the wasteland,

244
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:33.650
it doesn't mean people can't make beautiful things and,
and,

245
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.670
and,
and otherwise the whole thing.
We'd look like a junkyard.

246
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.090
And if you look at human behavior,

247
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.690
no matter how he impoverished or limited in our resources,

248
00:16:41.691 --> 00:16:46.460
even early Paleolithic man could do beautiful cave drawings and,

249
00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.950
and,
and,
and carvings and so on.
And so,

250
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:53.990
so if you had something you and you had the time yet,

251
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.160
you'd have to make it as beautiful as you could or interestingly,

252
00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:00.074
she could,

253
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:01.121
<v 1>which is driving,</v>

254
00:17:01.121 --> 00:17:04.120
what were you thinking of all this is going to be an awesome start.

255
00:17:04.121 --> 00:17:05.200
Let's build a vehicle for it.

256
00:17:05.201 --> 00:17:08.080
Where were you building the vehicles and being like,
oh,
I got some crazy shit.

257
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.000
Let's just take this guy.
And you know,

258
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:15.350
<v 2>it actually,
it was much more story driven.</v>

259
00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:20.180
Um,
uh,
the stents came out of story.
Uh,
you,
you,

260
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:24.650
you had to decide,
for instance,
it was really interesting stuff.

261
00:17:24.651 --> 00:17:28.280
We had a hot rod or rusted hot Rod,
which flips at one point,

262
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:33.510
and they were attacked by the spiky cars,
which we call buzzards.
Um,

263
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.130
and,
and we thought,
well,
okay,

264
00:17:37.131 --> 00:17:42.131
how would they stop a vehicle if they're basically ha scavenging anyone who

265
00:17:42.801 --> 00:17:47.630
dared to come into their territory?
And,
um,
and we thought,

266
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:48.270
okay,

267
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:53.270
there might build a kind of trap that's triggered by some sort of cable.

268
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.520
And,
and,
and,
and,
and,
uh,
we,

269
00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:02.250
we start to play with that stunt and we did a rehearsal with the stunt with,
uh,

270
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.100
with,
you know,
sacrificial vehicle.

271
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:09.720
And we found the way that stuck was constructed that if we did it right,

272
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:14.190
the car would flip in that interesting way,
particularly if it was this hot rod.

273
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:19.380
So when it came out of story,
everything came out of story.
Uh,

274
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:24.120
and that would lead to the stunt,
the guys on the Poles.
Um,

275
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.170
you know,

276
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:30.170
it's like pirates having to board a well defended a war rig,

277
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.240
which just carrying all this cargo had he get on board.
If there's spikes on it,

278
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.080
you can't approach it from the ground.

279
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:42.060
Let's see if they can approach it from above.
And then you say,
and then you say,

280
00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:46.160
okay,
maybe we can have these guys on Poles.
Uh,
uh,

281
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.180
I don't think the stents came.

282
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.370
I can't think of an example where a stunt came first.
Uh,

283
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.140
always arose out of story or the events.
Yeah.

284
00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.360
<v 1>Um,
and I want to talk about Charlie's,</v>

285
00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:01.010
their rounds Furiosa character because she was by far,

286
00:19:01.011 --> 00:19:04.640
I think one of the coolest characters I've ever seen on screen in the past few

287
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.980
decades.
It just very powerful and strong,

288
00:19:06.981 --> 00:19:10.250
actually very much surprise me because it's a mad max movie.

289
00:19:10.251 --> 00:19:13.670
But you have this amazing female world warrior.

290
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:17.590
And I heard that you brought in a eve Ensler who read the vagina monologues and

291
00:19:17.591 --> 00:19:22.370
to kind of help her and help with the five wives who were basically like,

292
00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.230
I guess the cargo,
the whole film of them,

293
00:19:24.231 --> 00:19:29.090
kind of chasing them down to give them some speeches about empowering them and

294
00:19:29.091 --> 00:19:31.840
how they should be acting and really kind of building them up to,

295
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.220
to build up their characters.
So can you talk about that?

296
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.700
<v 2>Well,
Eh,</v>

297
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:41.030
the Ozo always interested in a female road warrior.

298
00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.160
Uh,
it goes in the CIC and Medmax of road,

299
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.290
the road warrior [inaudible].

300
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:51.720
There was a warrior woman in that who appeared briefly and was killed during

301
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:56.910
that.
Always wondered,
you know,
how,
how does she become that,
uh,

302
00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:01.520
the story required once,
once,
once we,
you know,

303
00:20:01.521 --> 00:20:04.590
I realize that the basic McGuffin,

304
00:20:04.591 --> 00:20:08.040
the thing that everyone was fighting over was going to be human.

305
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:09.420
It was five females.

306
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:14.130
They needed a female champion of female road warrior.
So,

307
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.630
so the very mechanics of the story required furious.

308
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:23.400
Someone like Furiosa and the idea was as always,

309
00:20:23.401 --> 00:20:27.630
Max get swept in to that story rather reluctantly.

310
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.063
So.

311
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:34.830
So with her [inaudible] she was,

312
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:40.090
she was written that way and then he,
he was an actor.

313
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.700
Charlene,
she's the only,
but anyone who ever came to mind and,

314
00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:49.290
uh,
and,
and you,
she has that skill set.
She,

315
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.810
and she had the appetite to do it.
She's the one who said,
hey,
listen,

316
00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:57.400
she wouldn't mess with her hair.
She,
so she just says,
I shave it off.
And I said,

317
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.280
by all means,
and uh,
and it was exactly the right thing to do.

318
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.770
Interestingly enough,
there was backstory,
which we talked around,

319
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.380
uh,
you know,
around the table and,

320
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:17.430
and she knew eve and,
and,
and you know,

321
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:22.670
there's work with her on one of her boards in Africa because eve does epic work,

322
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:28.710
therefore women in Democratic Republic of Congo among other places.

323
00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.170
But interesting.
Lee enough.

324
00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:36.550
So Elise did the same sort of training as the war boys.

325
00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.690
We had military guys and,
and so because she was a warrior,

326
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:46.060
a eve mainly mainly worked with the five wives and,
and Miss Giddy,

327
00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:51.061
the history of woman who is their mentor and because they needed some,

328
00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.860
some something to give them some cohesion as well,
some shared world.

329
00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.040
So I know Charlene dipped into it a bit,

330
00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:02.980
but her main thing was to learn how to shoot,

331
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.430
shoot and how to drive.
Uh,
she,

332
00:22:06.431 --> 00:22:11.020
she already could drive a big rig,
but she could,

333
00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.650
I don't think she did done much shooting and uh,

334
00:22:14.651 --> 00:22:18.310
and obviously fight rehearsal and so on,
which was very balletic and,

335
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:23.940
and she took on a lot of that.
So,
so she,
yeah,

336
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:24.290
she was,

337
00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:29.290
she was more warrior workshop that then let's say feminists work shall,

338
00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.480
it wasn't really feminist works on,

339
00:22:31.481 --> 00:22:36.340
I mean it was mainly talking about a lot about history and,

340
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.750
and seeing how in some places in the world,
uh,

341
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:44.480
people in a lot of places in the world,
people are commodities.
Yeah.

342
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:48.110
<v 1>And you,
uh,
so casting Tom Hardy,
you know,
that was,</v>

343
00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.170
I was interesting cause you had to basically replace someone to reprise the role

344
00:22:51.171 --> 00:22:53.070
of Mad Max for Mel Gibson.

345
00:22:53.071 --> 00:22:56.450
So what drew you to Tom Hardy and at what place was he,

346
00:22:56.451 --> 00:22:58.910
did he come into the process at some point you basically realize that we can't

347
00:22:58.911 --> 00:22:59.744
use Melanie Moore.

348
00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.040
<v 2>Yeah.
Mill way back in 2000,</v>

349
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:07.090
we were going to shoot with mill and that's when,
uh,

350
00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:12.300
and then the film first filled out,
but for the first time,
uh,

351
00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:17.250
with when non living came along and we had lost almost a third of our budget of

352
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.290
a notch with the American dollar collapsed against the Australian dollar.

353
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.630
So when,
until other things,

354
00:23:22.631 --> 00:23:27.340
and then when we regroup Millie Owlette turbulence and his life,

355
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.310
and also as time was passing,

356
00:23:30.311 --> 00:23:33.970
it's not a kind of unforgiving about an old,
older warrior.

357
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.190
So thinking back to earlier days,
Max is still this,

358
00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:43.900
every man wandering,
wandering the wasteland in search of meaning.

359
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.870
And Tom Walked through the door and,
uh,

360
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.880
and he felt exactly,

361
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:54.940
I felt exactly the same feeling that I felt about Mel Gibson when he walked

362
00:23:55.521 --> 00:24:00.240
through the door 30 years before.
And,
and Tom was six weeks old when,

363
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.100
when we shot the first mode back when we started first mad max,

364
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.380
he was such a baby.
Um,
and,

365
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:12.500
and then he had that same energy immediately likable union.

366
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.400
There was that sort of danger of volcanic quality.

367
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.650
And also both of them were creatures of the theater,
the theater to train

368
00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.990
Mel and Tom.
And,
uh,
even though melt was straight out of drama school,

369
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:32.030
spent a lot of time at national drum drum school in,
in Sydney,
Australia,

370
00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.430
you know,
doing Shakespeare and,
and,
uh,

371
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:39.400
and he almost literally went from Romeo in Romeo,

372
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:44.150
Juliet one day to mad max the next.
Um,
and,
but they had that,

373
00:24:44.151 --> 00:24:48.350
that quality.
They're both very athletic and,
and also they're able to,

374
00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.440
you know,
when,
when,
when he get all that energy,

375
00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:56.790
that pent up energy and asking them to play a still character is very laconic.

376
00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.530
Uh,
it's,
it's much more,
it's much more interesting.
So that's how Tom,

377
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.980
<v 1>you brought back here to be the main villain of the story.</v>

378
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.250
He played toe cutter and,
and the first series.
So yeah.

379
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.980
What was that idea of like your hunger and bringing it back,

380
00:25:11.981 --> 00:25:15.190
but you going to be a completely different character and he's going to be crazy?

381
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:20.060
<v 2>Well,
a huge case.
Boone is a really interesting guy.
Um,</v>

382
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:20.810
he,

383
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:25.670
he's from at British military family and he was the first in about four

384
00:25:25.671 --> 00:25:30.650
generations.
That is,
he says,
rent away to become an actor.

385
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:34.240
And he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company,
uh,

386
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:39.370
and travel the world with very celebrated production of midsummer night's dream.

387
00:25:40.761 --> 00:25:43.250
I by Peter Brook,
they led,

388
00:25:43.251 --> 00:25:47.960
they ended in Australia and they formed a commune of actors in Sydney.

389
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.880
And,
uh,
he,

390
00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.730
he was just fantastic and I didn't know much about acting at all.
Uh,
uh,

391
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:58.010
back when we did the first mad max and,
and,

392
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.140
and one way or another,
uh,
um,
we,
we,
we couldn't afford to fly.

393
00:26:03.141 --> 00:26:06.310
He's a good can we use all the guys I work with?
I said,
well,
we,

394
00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.420
we can't afford to fly everyone down.

395
00:26:08.421 --> 00:26:12.400
Her budget was so low that we couldn't have flight,
uh,

396
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.680
four to fly them all down to Melbourne.
We should have cost Melbourne actors.

397
00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:17.810
And he said,
well,
what about you?

398
00:26:17.811 --> 00:26:22.340
Put the motorbikes on the train and send it up to Sydney and we'll ride the

399
00:26:22.341 --> 00:26:23.870
bikes down.
Well,

400
00:26:23.871 --> 00:26:28.871
it was just fantastic because by the time they spent three days writing down

401
00:26:28.971 --> 00:26:33.500
about six,
seven,
eight of them,
and by the time they travel,

402
00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:37.170
the 900 miles,
whatever it was,
uh,
they,

403
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:39.770
they were a biking gang and,

404
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:44.340
and they would come onto set and would get nervous.

405
00:26:44.341 --> 00:26:49.341
It was just such a wonderful thing and it really added a lot to help help

406
00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:52.400
everybody with the shoot.
And,

407
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:57.370
and then the Tokata character dies at the end of that movie.
And,

408
00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:01.170
and,
and I thought,
well,
we can bring him back and he'll wear a mask,

409
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.530
the whole movie.
Anyway,
he's got fantastic eyes and,

410
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.030
and sure enough,
all these years later,
uh,

411
00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:14.010
the Joe huge w walk under sending costume.

412
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:18.690
And he did insist that not only the stunt guys,
and not only the war boy actors,

413
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:22.680
but even the crew do the sign of the VA aid and,

414
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.450
and call him daddy.
And,
and it was fantastic.
You know,

415
00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.030
he,
he very playful and,
but,
but,
but,

416
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:36.480
but in the way I really bought into it and made it sort of fun and,
and,

417
00:27:36.481 --> 00:27:39.840
and uh,
you know,
people really got into it.
It was fantastic.

418
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:44.670
So he's one of those actors that brings,
brings a lot with him.

419
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.150
Uh,
he was phenomenal and we killed him off in this movie

420
00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:52.230
<v 1>spot.
Um,</v>

421
00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.940
so we have some questions that we gathered from the toxic Google social media.

422
00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.470
And so one of the top ones actually came in a lot was there was talk at some

423
00:28:00.471 --> 00:28:03.710
point from you about a black and white version of this and possibly even a sound

424
00:28:03.711 --> 00:28:06.290
version of this.
So is there any hope for that?

425
00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:11.230
<v 2>Well,
way back in road warrior,
the best version I have,</v>

426
00:28:11.231 --> 00:28:16.231
a sort of road warrior was when the composers in those days when they can

427
00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:21.280
conduct in the orchestra,
we'd get the answer print,
which is colored.

428
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.840
And they do what they call a slash June,
which is a very cheap,
high contrast,

429
00:28:25.841 --> 00:28:28.810
black and white print of the film.

430
00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:32.830
And they'd put their markings on there and they'd conduct to this version.

431
00:28:32.831 --> 00:28:35.670
And I remember walking in the first day,
uh,

432
00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:40.720
and looking at the road warrior and thinking,
wow,

433
00:28:40.721 --> 00:28:42.100
that's how the film should look.

434
00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:47.550
It's just something about black and white distills and abstracts the image and

435
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:54.060
forces,
the,
the kind of almost mythological,

436
00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.020
sort of allegorical quality of the story.
So,
um,

437
00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:04.240
when we came to do this movie,
I remember telling the wonderful color,

438
00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.280
colorist Eric Whip,
uh,
you know,

439
00:29:06.281 --> 00:29:10.120
can you take that scene and just make it high contrast,
black and white,

440
00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:14.410
particularly the outdoor scenes.
And it looked fantastic.
And I said,
and I said,

441
00:29:14.411 --> 00:29:15.244
okay,
we'll,

442
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:20.300
we'll do version two to almost almost hop back to the old silent era.

443
00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:27.940
And we'll do a version which just shows you can watch it completely solid.

444
00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:32.770
We can watch it black and white with just the music score,

445
00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.600
or you can watch it black and white with just the sound and to compare it.

446
00:29:37.601 --> 00:29:42.601
But by the time we do blueray went there wasn't room for to,

447
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:45.340
to put her on another disk.

448
00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.310
But definitely hope to do that in the future because there's something about it

449
00:29:49.311 --> 00:29:49.901
and you know,

450
00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:54.640
you take a picture on your smartphone and then you just make it black and white.

451
00:29:54.641 --> 00:29:59.350
And if somehow just cooler.
I don't know why I still,

452
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:04.020
I think it's the abstraction.
It takes out information and,

453
00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:09.100
and maybe gives it a more timeless quality color,

454
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:10.323
often

455
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.670
sort of anchor something in time.
I don't know what it is.

456
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.200
It might be just a nostalgia for the black and white movies or black and white

457
00:30:20.201 --> 00:30:24.880
photography.
But somehow this,
this,
this movie looked cool.

458
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.860
And another one from social is what was the most difficult scene to shoot

459
00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.260
because it looked like the entire film.
What is it difficult?

460
00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:38.080
The entire,
sometime it's the littlest things.

461
00:30:38.081 --> 00:30:42.610
It can drive you nuts.
Uh,
um,
you know,

462
00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:45.990
it like literally,
um,
uh,

463
00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:50.250
um,
you know,

464
00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:55.290
there's the shot of a little bird made up of bolts and parts of a vehicle and it

465
00:30:57.251 --> 00:31:02.190
was just nodding its head.
And I remember the last day,
um,
uh,

466
00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.800
great props guy,
George Samaj and,
and,
and,

467
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:11.140
and the script supervisors,
Sophie would determined to get those shots and,
uh,

468
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:13.030
we were racing to finish and,

469
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.080
and had little silhouette why I sought it and moving it.

470
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:22.110
And it was,
it was difficult to get it moving properly and get the,
the,
the,

471
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.920
the,
the,
the,
you know,
the background movie.
But for me personally,

472
00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:31.510
um,
the,
the,
the,
uh,
the guys on the Poles,

473
00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:36.370
initially I thought it would be difficult,
uh,
but as it,
as it turned out,

474
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.230
that was okay.
But for me,

475
00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:43.360
I'd say the most difficult thing was the war rig flipping at the end.

476
00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.570
Because initially I thought,
oh,

477
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:50.120
too much energy in that tea.
Too many,
too,

478
00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.370
too much to too much mass to put a human being in there.

479
00:31:54.371 --> 00:31:59.080
I'm just a bit worried about it.
And then we thought we'd do it a CG,

480
00:31:59.081 --> 00:32:03.520
but that was sort of cheating given that we've shot the rest of the movie.

481
00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:06.610
Everything was real.
Then we thought of doing it with a miniature,

482
00:32:06.611 --> 00:32:11.410
but they don't work very well in daylight because of dust and so on.
You see,

483
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.560
you see it miniatures,
just the,
just the physics of it doesn't work.

484
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:19.860
Then we thought of doing it with a remote control vehicle and a w w w w we

485
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:23.920
could,
we could control it accurately mean we couldn't flip it.

486
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:29.050
And it had to go between two big massive rocks and it had to land in front of

487
00:32:29.051 --> 00:32:30.130
our Phantom Camera,

488
00:32:30.131 --> 00:32:35.131
which is running at about six or 700 frames a,

489
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:38.870
I mean,
and,
um,
and,
and,

490
00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:43.910
and that suites what was going to be difficult.
So,
so,
you know,

491
00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:48.140
and,
and then it rained and,
and,
and anyway,

492
00:32:48.141 --> 00:32:52.480
Lee hours and had a great,
great driver.
Uh,
uh,

493
00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.490
there's a break in the rain.
And,
uh,

494
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.120
we did this shot and,

495
00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:02.870
and he had the sweet spot and we only had one tank.
So,
um,

496
00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.240
so that Wa I remember that,
uh,

497
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:09.650
I a new week prepared enough for him to be safe,

498
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.620
but something can always go wrong.

499
00:33:12.621 --> 00:33:17.621
But the fact that he actually landed it right there in front of the key camera,

500
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:22.130
we had lots of other cameras,
but he wanted to hit that sweet spot.

501
00:33:22.131 --> 00:33:25.010
Said that that was just technically that was difficult.

502
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.660
<v 1>Yeah.
I love that you pushed for it and just say,
we're not changing,</v>

503
00:33:28.661 --> 00:33:30.700
like this is going to happen.
And that's,
it's,

504
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
it's phenomenal because it shows on screen.
I mean,
that Labor of love and that,

505
00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.830
<v 2>yeah,
we,
well,
we,
we,
as I said,</v>

506
00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:40.310
we had people who really as hot as it was,

507
00:33:40.311 --> 00:33:44.780
they would determine to get it right.
We had gotten Norris,

508
00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:48.540
who was the hitch,
Doug Co,

509
00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:52.430
Co Coordinator and second unit director,

510
00:33:52.431 --> 00:33:55.130
and he was a 21 year old.

511
00:33:55.131 --> 00:33:59.990
His first film was on fury road,
Warrior back.

512
00:33:59.991 --> 00:34:04.280
I'm not a 90,
90,
90.
I think we shot on 91.

513
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:09.920
And,
uh,
and,
and,
and he'd,
you know,

514
00:34:09.921 --> 00:34:14.870
he,
he was,
he just kept saying,
look,
we could do it.
We can do it.
And,
uh,

515
00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.210
it was great.
It was great to see,

516
00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.760
<v 1>um,
you know,
Furiosa again,
she's just a phenomenal character.</v>

517
00:34:21.761 --> 00:34:23.440
And so one of the questions someone had was,

518
00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:27.460
is there a version of her backstory that you can tell us or he's still saving

519
00:34:27.461 --> 00:34:29.350
that I'm saving,
we're saving them.

520
00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.710
<v 2>And then I know the backstory for,
uh,
uh,</v>

521
00:34:33.711 --> 00:34:36.070
I would say Nico Service and I who,
who,

522
00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:41.380
who also came into right after Brendan and may need to go down and he's

523
00:34:42.441 --> 00:34:47.360
basically a Dramaturg and we'd go down deep into the backstory,
you know,

524
00:34:47.361 --> 00:34:50.210
I know,
I know who the due for his mother was.

525
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:55.050
I know how a man who's blind and mute,
uh,

526
00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:57.800
and can only play a guitar,

527
00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:02.570
survived the apocalypse and managed to,
you know,
make me,
uh,

528
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:07.270
so you have to know the backstory of everything and certainly we know your yeses

529
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.520
and we know Max what happened in Mexico in the meantime,

530
00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:16.190
and how each of the wives got there and so on.
But,
uh,
yeah,

531
00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.213
for another time.

532
00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:22.810
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,
so audience questions from Googlers.
Yeah.</v>

533
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:28.120
One of the unusual things about Max compared to the current crop of action

534
00:35:28.121 --> 00:35:31.810
movies is that it's an original world and original stories created just for the

535
00:35:31.811 --> 00:35:32.644
movies.

536
00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:37.350
I'm kind of curious how much you think that has to do with kind of know the

537
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.080
experience of writing and directing or like the quality of the movies.

538
00:35:40.081 --> 00:35:42.240
Mostly like whether you know,
whether you think it's,

539
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:46.290
that makes it easier to make a high quality movie.
Um,

540
00:35:46.291 --> 00:35:48.090
I'm also curious if you think we're doomed.

541
00:35:48.091 --> 00:35:52.290
It just an endless string of adaptations,
mostly in a,

542
00:35:52.291 --> 00:35:53.370
all the other franchises.

543
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:58.900
<v 2>Ooh.
Um,
that's,
um,
look,
uh,
it's a tough business.</v>

544
00:35:58.901 --> 00:36:02.860
The movie business,
um,
Eh,
to do original work.

545
00:36:02.861 --> 00:36:06.250
W W W we're seeing,
you know,

546
00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:10.890
reboots and sequels and,
and,
and,

547
00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:16.060
and that,
that's,
that comes and goes with cinema.
If you,

548
00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:21.010
if you look at early cinema,
they were always,
um,
you know,

549
00:36:21.011 --> 00:36:25.450
the first time I ever saw Clint Eastwood in a movie,
it was on TV.

550
00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.400
Was it,
Eh,
uh,
the movie's called Francis,

551
00:36:30.401 --> 00:36:34.000
the talking mule movies.
And if you look at one of those,

552
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:38.530
this one called Francis goes to the navy.
And in the background,
a young,

553
00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:42.850
Tall Sila in the group of silence,
that easy hung out with,

554
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:47.900
I think it was done a lot of Kona.
We make him laugh from,
um,

555
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.650
from singing in the right.
He,
he this Clint Eastwood and there was several,

556
00:36:53.651 --> 00:36:58.651
Francis and Francis the talking mule movies and I think that should be the

557
00:36:59.261 --> 00:37:02.980
nature of cinnamon.
I think a lot of that was,
was,
uh,

558
00:37:02.981 --> 00:37:06.580
in response to the advent of television and,
and,

559
00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:11.140
and so it was cinema scope and so it was three d stereo.
And so that's,

560
00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:15.640
the movies are always having to adapt in that way.

561
00:37:15.641 --> 00:37:19.640
I think that's what we're seeing.
If your first question was,
do you think it's,

562
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:23.170
it,
it's useful that,
that,
that,

563
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:26.020
that there's some are writing,

564
00:37:26.021 --> 00:37:30.390
directing and producing and making the film so that they're more go here and I,

565
00:37:30.391 --> 00:37:34.480
I,
I'd say that has to be an advantage.
Um,
um,

566
00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:39.630
yeah.
I mean these characters live and this world lives in,

567
00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.481
in your head,

568
00:37:40.481 --> 00:37:45.070
like imaginary friends and they pop up from time to time and you keep saying,

569
00:37:45.071 --> 00:37:47.230
I don't want to do,
I don't want to go back there again.

570
00:37:47.231 --> 00:37:52.231
And then suddenly a story takes hole and you feel a kind of gravitational pull

571
00:37:52.781 --> 00:37:56.890
towards a story and you just get to the point where he just can't wait to see if

572
00:37:56.891 --> 00:37:59.350
he can pull it off and see it up there on the screen.

573
00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.130
So I guess it's an advantage.
Yeah.

574
00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:10.560
<v 1>Okay.
You mentioned,
uh,</v>

575
00:38:10.561 --> 00:38:15.240
about the fact of the store over the characters keep on living in your head,
uh,

576
00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:20.460
uh,
and uh,
and it takes you,
it took you awhile to figure out,

577
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.700
uh,
but you have this new story that you want to tell us.

578
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:28.740
So I was wondering what exactly was it?
At what point exactly did you,

579
00:38:28.741 --> 00:38:29.220
uh,

580
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:33.060
decide that you'll have something that you want to develop into the next movie?

581
00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:38.770
<v 2>Well,
it's,
it's an interesting thing because I remember</v>

582
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.990
thinking,
well,
I'll back up.

583
00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:48.930
Story is what really is the primary driving force,

584
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.730
uh,
at bench.
It's usually supported by,
uh,

585
00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:59.490
an interest in the tools so that,
um,

586
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.520
for instance,
I really like the story,

587
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.470
the natural history of the emperor penguins.

588
00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:09.490
And I had the story and it wasn't till,
uh,

589
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:10.550
Andrew Leslie,

590
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:14.770
the wonderful cameraman who shopped the babe movies had just come back from the

591
00:39:14.771 --> 00:39:17.970
first Lord of the rings and showed me the,

592
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.970
the first motion capture of Gollum.
I realized,
Oh,

593
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.020
motion capture dancing penguins.
So that was,
that was,

594
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:30.310
that was,
that was the,
there has to be some,

595
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:34.060
something technical that,
that's interesting.

596
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:39.070
So the first idea for fury road,
uh,
was,

597
00:39:39.071 --> 00:39:44.071
was to see whether he could tell almost a continuous chase and picking up

598
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.440
everything on the run and see if he could pick up any,

599
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:53.220
your backstories characters such suggested,
uh,
uh,

600
00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:58.400
you know,
a lot of iceberg under the tip,
as I like to say.
Uh,

601
00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:03.610
that was the first exercise.
And the second one was that what they were,

602
00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:08.200
what they were in conflict over was to be human,
human cargo.

603
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:13.260
So five women.
And,
and that was,
that was the first thing.
And,

604
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.670
and then I,
you know,
I had,

605
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:21.200
I did forcibly pushed the idea of way,
but,

606
00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:25.690
but as often happens,
it just stated,
and I,
and,

607
00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.670
and without going too long a story,

608
00:40:27.671 --> 00:40:32.671
I was flying one night from Los Angeles across the Pacific to Sydney.

609
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.990
And in an unguarded moment,

610
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:40.150
much of the first two thirds of the story played out because I'd been doing this

611
00:40:40.151 --> 00:40:43.980
for so long now,
scenes play out in my head.
And,
uh,

612
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:48.250
it played out and I got really excited.
Ooh,
that would work.
That would work,
man,

613
00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:52.030
Max and get caught up up in it.
And I remember landing in Sydney,

614
00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.300
interlink telling my producing partner,
Doug Mitchell,

615
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:59.030
I think there's another mad max movie.
Uh,

616
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:04.520
and um,
and,
uh,
so yeah,
so it's,

617
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.320
and then there's that feeling,
oh Jeez.
It'd be really good to try that.

618
00:41:08.321 --> 00:41:10.720
And we could use,
you know,
we could,

619
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:15.700
I really always wanted to do stereo three d we can do,
it's three day.

620
00:41:15.701 --> 00:41:19.960
We could use,
uh,
you know,
digital.

621
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:22.450
The digital dispensation had,

622
00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:27.970
had arrived and learned quite a bit about it on the bay movies.

623
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.140
And,
uh,
I thought,
oh,

624
00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:32.980
we could do so much more that we couldn't do back in the day.
So that's,

625
00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.670
I hope that answers the question.

626
00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:36.660
<v 3>I wanted to ask about the baby movies.</v>

627
00:41:36.661 --> 00:41:40.320
Actually two has been called the citizen Kane of talking pig movies.

628
00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:45.120
This similarity of world building for something like extending babe into the

629
00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:49.830
beauty that is picking the city to something like extending Mad Max.

630
00:41:49.831 --> 00:41:54.831
Can you talk about the kind of the creative similarity and difference of just

631
00:41:54.931 --> 00:41:56.520
kind of that universe Belding

632
00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.430
<v 2>well,
um,
I think,</v>

633
00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:04.090
I think it's important.
Uh,

634
00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:10.880
it's what I think is what I was trying to get at before you see these films that

635
00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.100
Alec,
Greece and you,

636
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:18.530
you trying to create worlds and,

637
00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:24.480
and the film was you don't have time to sit and explain the details of the world

638
00:42:24.881 --> 00:42:29.881
or how they came about because you're kind of working off of what's already

639
00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:35.310
there and the zeitgeists and you're also working on a,

640
00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:40.030
an all that came before it all traditions of storytelling,

641
00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:44.820
uh,
history,
uh,
you know,
mythology,

642
00:42:44.821 --> 00:42:49.090
folk lore,
comic books,
it,
all of that.
Uh,

643
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:53.960
and when you're in,
in both those cases,
uh,
you,

644
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:56.050
you,
you,
you basically,

645
00:42:56.110 --> 00:43:00.250
the most important thing is don't,

646
00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:06.420
it is not to spend all your time or wasting too much time with exposition

647
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.990
because it's very hard to dramatize you.
You have to dramatize your exposition,

648
00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:16.440
but it's like inviting into a world that is on the one hand unique and yet

649
00:43:20.261 --> 00:43:21.094
familiar.

650
00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.190
So to get that balance right and the best way to get that balance right,

651
00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:29.250
I find is to be rigorous as much as possible about the internal logic.

652
00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.330
Um,
that,
that,
that it's there.
A conceits in the movie,

653
00:43:34.331 --> 00:43:37.000
like animals talk,
embrace them,

654
00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:41.770
declare the [inaudible],
don't apologize or explain them,

655
00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:45.490
but,
but be consistent.
Um,
uh,

656
00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:49.050
if it's in the design of the world of the buildings and there's a certain

657
00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:53.980
aesthetic,
be consistent.
Uh,
and that means really,

658
00:43:53.981 --> 00:43:57.940
really tried to,
tried to define what's important.

659
00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:02.830
And then,
uh,
making sure that everyone that's involved in the design,

660
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.670
that we're all following the same sort of rules.

661
00:44:06.671 --> 00:44:08.740
We're all working to the same principles.

662
00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:14.140
And that's what I described before about the,
the vehicles or the,
you know,

663
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:18.370
I didn't,
I didn't think of that garden fork on Max's face.
I love that.

664
00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:23.400
But it was a pull Jayco designer from England,

665
00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:28.400
uh,
W who is,
who is,
who did it.
And,
uh,

666
00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:30.880
and we,
we had some early designs,

667
00:44:30.881 --> 00:44:34.350
which just as kind of a bit of a mosque or muscle or a Cajun,

668
00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:38.490
he just suddenly send us a drawing with gotten folk.
I think it's great.

669
00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.770
It's exactly what we want.
And,
uh,

670
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:46.340
and I didn't come up with the idea of the guitar having a hospital bed pan in

671
00:44:46.611 --> 00:44:51.090
it,
um,
or,
or a good,
or a steering wheel with a,

672
00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:56.440
with a,
um,
uh,
uh,
the Nexia steering wheel,
which he holds up with,

673
00:44:56.441 --> 00:45:01.290
with adults face and,
and,
and,
and so on that,
that,
that was,
uh,

674
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:05.670
you know,
the,
that was the artist who,
who's making the steering wheel B.

675
00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.920
But in each of those cases,

676
00:45:07.921 --> 00:45:12.540
people knew it had to be found objects repurposed.
So,
uh,

677
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:17.490
uh,
the,
the Morton's mosque,
it was basically so that he can,

678
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.770
he needed a blender so he could breathe.
Um,
really,
really,
uh,

679
00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:27.030
you know,
relatively fresh filtered air,
we assume.

680
00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:30.840
Um,
but,
uh,
but it couldn't look therapeutic.

681
00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:32.820
And it also had to look for minimal after all,

682
00:45:32.821 --> 00:45:37.260
he was supposed to be this old powerful Demi God warlord.

683
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:41.940
So the horses teeth and all of that was built,
built into it,

684
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.700
and it would apply to the vehicles.

685
00:45:44.701 --> 00:45:48.030
And as some of those were pretty Atlanta outlandish,
but,

686
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:53.040
but they had to,
had to be consistent in their logic.

687
00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:58.050
Uh,
that big double Cadillac,
um,
uh,
was,

688
00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.920
was the most powerful man's vehicle.
Uh,

689
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:05.730
the guys who had flame throwers with a gap from gas town.

690
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:09.170
So they had a lot that they had those flame throwers.
Uh,

691
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:13.800
the guy with the most guns and bullets was the bullet farmer from the bullet

692
00:46:13.801 --> 00:46:16.370
farm.
Uh,
the,
the,

693
00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:21.610
the doof warrior was the equivalent of all military,

694
00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:26.290
um,
uh,
armies.
All the armies that were,
uh,

695
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.690
pre,
uh,
which predated,
uh,
the,

696
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:36.510
the ability to amplify sound.
So you have the Bugler,
the drummer,

697
00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:37.800
the Bagpipe player,

698
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:41.820
and in this world with all those hot cars and making lot of noise,

699
00:46:41.821 --> 00:46:44.640
you needed something louder.
So he needed the big speakers.

700
00:46:44.641 --> 00:46:48.150
You needed a double neck guitar and you needed to Tyco dramas.

701
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.250
It had to follow a logic.

702
00:46:50.251 --> 00:46:53.730
It just couldn't be plunked in there without some consistency.

703
00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:57.810
And the hope is that,
uh,
even the tattoos,
the marking,

704
00:46:57.811 --> 00:47:01.210
there's a logic to why Furiosa has a mark,
you know,

705
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:07.080
Mark's her body in a certain way as compared to knucks.
Um,

706
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:09.690
the spraying of,
of the silver.

707
00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:14.640
We had to have an internal logic that had to be consistent and anything that's

708
00:47:14.641 --> 00:47:18.840
straight out of those boundary conditions usually bought you out of that,

709
00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:22.800
out of the movie.
So it looks pretty wild and abandoned,

710
00:47:22.801 --> 00:47:25.260
but there's some sort of method in the madness.

711
00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:30.040
Uh,
you

712
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.650
<v 3>mentioned earlier about,
um,</v>

713
00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:36.940
sometimes story and tools,
interest in tools go hand in hand.

714
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:42.270
And you talked earlier about how the number of cuts have increased in movies in

715
00:47:42.341 --> 00:47:43.174
general.

716
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:48.240
I was wondering if you felt a normative kind of feeling towards whether that's a

717
00:47:48.671 --> 00:47:53.440
good thing or a bad thing or is that just a thing?
And also,
sorry,

718
00:47:53.441 --> 00:47:55.060
the last part of this question is,

719
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:59.860
I assume you shot some of the action sequences with multiple cameras.

720
00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.290
So how did you justify when to cut?
Um,

721
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:08.340
and were you trying intentionally to create some type of frenetic nature with

722
00:48:09.281 --> 00:48:13.660
your cuts?
Or was it like the whole conversation around cuts?

723
00:48:13.661 --> 00:48:16.060
I'm just curious,
what's your take on that?

724
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:19.790
<v 2>I don't think it's necessarily a good thing or bad thing.
It's a,</v>

725
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.040
it's a thing and you can do movies.
Um,

726
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:25.210
uh,

727
00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:30.210
we would not have any cuts at all and it's still have a strong rhythm and so on.

728
00:48:30.851 --> 00:48:34.370
And there's really good examples,
uh,

729
00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:37.100
of those,
uh,
uh,

730
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:40.990
one shot scenes in a movie like this.
Uh,

731
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:46.830
I was always struck by Roman Polanski's a statement where he said,

732
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:54.870
at any given moment there's only one perfect place for the camera in a movie and

733
00:48:56.051 --> 00:48:57.070
doing animations,

734
00:48:57.071 --> 00:49:01.000
you can always prove that because you could move the camera anywhere you like.

735
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:04.120
And it does exactly the same performance and same,

736
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:06.880
same sets and same blocking and everything.

737
00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:10.300
And by shifting point of view and cutting pattern,

738
00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:15.200
you can change a sing significantly.
The feeling of the same.
The cutting is,

739
00:49:15.201 --> 00:49:19.790
isn't is another issue.
I,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

740
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:24.630
work with Margaret [inaudible] who is also my life's partner.
And,
and,

741
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:28.630
and she said,
she,
she,
she's cut quite a bit,
uh,

742
00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:32.830
documentaries and she,
and she cut the first happy feed and,

743
00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:38.050
and,
and she said,
well,
you know,
I'm not that into action movies.

744
00:49:38.051 --> 00:49:42.280
It's not something that go out of my way,
even though we have teenage sons.

745
00:49:42.281 --> 00:49:46.300
It's not something we go out of our way to that she would go out of a way to

746
00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:50.770
look at.
And I said,
well,
that's the very reason because you will shoot,

747
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:55.450
she's done a lot of medical documentaries and things and somehow can take very

748
00:49:55.451 --> 00:49:59.830
dry material and structure it dramatically.

749
00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:04.870
And,
and it's something that I notice is very,
uh,

750
00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:07.630
it's very difficult to do.

751
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:12.430
It's not just taking the next cool shot or an or and putting in there and

752
00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:16.630
keeping a certain pace going.
Um,
it's,
it,
it,
it's very,

753
00:50:16.631 --> 00:50:18.760
very similar to writing music.

754
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:22.250
It is visual music and the,
the,

755
00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:27.520
the one thing that you're always striving for it that she would do intuitively

756
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.580
would find a very,
very powerful,

757
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:37.060
a causal relationship.
One shot to the next,
uh,

758
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:41.360
it might be pure framing and I scan,
it might be the manic,

759
00:50:41.361 --> 00:50:44.190
it might be just
it,

760
00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:46.790
it spatial usually,

761
00:50:46.791 --> 00:50:51.791
but there had to be in the same way that a composer is looking at code structure

762
00:50:52.431 --> 00:50:55.240
or tempo or,
or,
um,

763
00:50:55.670 --> 00:51:00.670
in a melodic line or whenever there's almost a mathematical basis to,

764
00:51:01.521 --> 00:51:06.400
to,
to music.
Uh,
it's almost like that in,

765
00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:08.080
in cutting,
uh,

766
00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:12.290
it's something that people only experience in the cutting room.

767
00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:17.150
And when he confronted by footage and she had to take that on and she's one of

768
00:51:17.151 --> 00:51:22.130
those editors,
I'm not good with my hands on the extras and so on,

769
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:26.780
but I'm pretty good on carts.
But she could see cuts,

770
00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:28.400
not cuts with,

771
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.750
see a progression of shots or cuts away to make cuts than I couldn't say.

772
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:35.320
But it was always underpinned by that.

773
00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:39.080
Looking for that strong connection between one shot,

774
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:44.150
the other usually as simple as where I scan,
uh,

775
00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:47.620
and,
and how you basically,
uh,

776
00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:52.940
how the inflammation I'm falls in what order.

777
00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:57.890
There's one particular bit of information,
uh,
come when do you need it?

778
00:51:57.891 --> 00:51:59.330
And when,
you know,
how do you,

779
00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:03.160
how do you make it clear to the audience where you are?
And then,

780
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:05.910
and then looking at the temper of the shots.
Um,

781
00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:11.360
and she also has a very low boredom threshold.
So no repetition,

782
00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.390
uh,
even repetition of angles.
I mean,

783
00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:19.550
it could get very boring bunch of people sitting in a vehicle,
uh,

784
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:23.310
uh,
uh,
with very limited shots.
They're sitting down,

785
00:52:23.311 --> 00:52:28.280
they're not moving it.
It happens over three days,
two nights scenes.

786
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.190
But you know,
it could get very boring.

787
00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:36.220
So you always gotta be looking for ways to have more information in each,

788
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.800
in each shop.

789
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:43.930
It must in some way progress the character or the relationship between character

790
00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:46.560
or the progression of the story in some way.

791
00:52:46.561 --> 00:52:50.270
So all of these things are dancing around in the back of your brain,

792
00:52:50.271 --> 00:52:53.760
and intuitively you're looking for those sort of moments,
which,

793
00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:57.370
which come forward.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.

794
00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:01.670
<v 1>Thank you so much for being here.
Um,
thank you.</v>

795
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:06.380
Mad Max fury road is out now on Blu ray and on digital on Google place.

796
00:53:06.381 --> 00:53:08.470
So thank you so much for being here.
Appreciate it.
Thank you.

797
