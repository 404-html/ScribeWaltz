00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.010
Julian,
did you just say that I would volunteer to take selfies with everybody?

2
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.370
<v 0>Well,
you see how many people are in here,</v>

3
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.130
you know,
I mean,
we're Google,
so we can be very efficient.

4
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.510
We can streamline this process.

5
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.140
How about if we take a selfie with one person and then green scheming and

6
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:36.490
everyone's space.
Okay.
We can do that for sure.

7
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.680
All of the people that we want to be in that Selfie,
right?
No,

8
00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:42.740
I'm happy to take selfies.
I,
it's just,
I'm just razzing you.
Okay.
Thank you.

9
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.070
Some more if you want.
So how are you?
I'm great.
Yeah.

10
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.530
<v 2>Are,
you know,
I'm a,
you said this already,
right?
I'm native San Franciscan,
so,
um,</v>

11
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.350
it's great to come home and uh,

12
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.420
it's great for my mom to come home and do a play,
right?

13
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.410
<v 0>Oh yeah,</v>

14
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.920
<v 2>that it,
it's not really a,
it's a big deal for my family,
kind of.</v>

15
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:10.910
So I love it.
And I love this theater.
I've always loved this particular theater,

16
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.800
American Conservatory Theater Act,
and I,
uh,

17
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.870
so this is a really great kind of collaboration with them that allows me to have

18
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:25.280
this hometown experience.
And to do a play like this one that I really,

19
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.580
really believe a lot in this particular play.

20
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.100
<v 0>Yeah.
So let's talk a little bit about more about the play.
Okay.</v>

21
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.570
I got to see it on Wednesday.
It was fantastic.
Oh,
great.
Yeah.
Um,

22
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.290
but I'm hoping more people here and folks on the livestream would come to see
it.

23
00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:42.970
So can you tell us a little bit about the show?

24
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.230
<v 2>Uh,
yes.
Well,
Lauren,
uh,
Lauren,
yeah.</v>

25
00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:50.980
Is the playwright Lauren and he is also a native San Franciscan.
Yes.

26
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.720
If you know anything,
I mean,

27
00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:56.250
there was a big article about her and the pink section on Sunday.
Um,

28
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.610
but very briefly,

29
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.200
she really writes a lot from her own experience in her own family and has

30
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:06.730
written two plays in fact that are inspired in one way or another by her father.

31
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.440
This particular play is inspired by the fact that her father played basketball

32
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:15.520
in Chinatown in the early seventies and was on the basketball team of kids from

33
00:02:15.521 --> 00:02:19.600
China at San Francisco Chinatown that went to China to play exhibition games

34
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.020
throughout China.
And so she's written a play about a young,
um,

35
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.380
very enthusiastic,
um,

36
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.440
Asian American boy in high school who like will's his way onto the team to go

37
00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:36.520
play in China,
um,
and kind of have this kind of,

38
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.330
what's it like for an Asian American kid to go to China experience.
Um,

39
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.430
and there's a lot more to the play and it'll a lot more is revealed in the play.

40
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.050
But,
um,
the,

41
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.440
the play also centers around the relationship between two basketball coaches,

42
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.110
a Chinese basketball players and an American basketball coach.

43
00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:57.230
And I played the Chinese basketball coach.
So that's it basically.
Okay.

44
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.910
Basically and also kind in its identity.
It's,
it's a,

45
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.530
it's a comedy with an a really strong emotional undercurrent,

46
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.670
which is very rare in plays to me.
I find the most successful plays,

47
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.870
plays that are,
are successfully funny and move you at the same time.

48
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.460
I did you find it that way?

49
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.310
<v 0>I did,
yes.
And I find that Lauren's work in particular,</v>

50
00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:21.470
she just did King of these at SF playhouse,

51
00:03:21.471 --> 00:03:24.740
which is also another story about Larry.
Yes.
Um,

52
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.920
but I really like her work because she does straddle humor and touching some

53
00:03:30.531 --> 00:03:32.900
soft points about family relationships,

54
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.510
which I think is really heartwarming about her work.
Yeah.

55
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.350
<v 2>Yeah.
He's really skilled in that and the extra added,
I mean,
I really,</v>

56
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.100
I'm here to sell tickets,
right,
of course.
But please for the really,

57
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.610
really sincerely recommend this experience of seeing this play in San Francisco

58
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.510
and also it's too late to see king of the user.
It's San Francisco players.

59
00:03:53.511 --> 00:03:57.800
But I would definitely have recommended that.
And when I went to see it,
uh,
uh,

60
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.290
king of the Hughes,
I sat there thinking,
how was this play ever done anywhere?

61
00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:06.580
But in San Francisco,
the resonance was so strong.
The,
the,
the,

62
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:09.620
the places that she mentioned is that the locations,

63
00:04:09.621 --> 00:04:13.030
the things that we all know or that many of us know,
whether you know,

64
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.270
that we draw from our own childhood experiences are,
um,

65
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.410
are really,
uh,
strong and they're much stronger.
You know,

66
00:04:21.411 --> 00:04:24.680
this play has been done king of the ease and the great leap had been done all

67
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:25.550
over the country.
Yes.

68
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.850
But there's something really special about seeing San Francisco productions

69
00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:32.210
about it.
They're going to be rare.
It's a rare opportunity.

70
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.010
But the one thing that I think you might've noticed so that the audience is kind

71
00:04:37.011 --> 00:04:37.844
of like,

72
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.070
they just get such a kick out of hearing about things that they know and that's

73
00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:44.810
not an experience you can have that often.

74
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.010
And I think one of the things that are regional theater does when it's being

75
00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:54.011
successful is kind of connecting to the community in a way that this play a

76
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.680
local playwright and a local actor,
Kevin,
help them do.

77
00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.300
<v 0>Yes,
I would agree.</v>

78
00:04:59.301 --> 00:05:04.301
And it's even more special when the audience can really relate and visually see

79
00:05:05.151 --> 00:05:09.470
the locations.
I mean in the great leap,
it's USF,
it's Chinatown.

80
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.420
Galileo high school is also mentioned and so they're already along the ride for

81
00:05:14.421 --> 00:05:17.450
you.
There's not,
I mean you obviously have to work for the story,

82
00:05:17.451 --> 00:05:21.500
but it's kind of Nice when they're already with you when they're already,
yes.

83
00:05:21.501 --> 00:05:21.700
Okay.

84
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.510
<v 2>Absolutely.</v>

85
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.510
And I had the really good experience of doing the same play in New York last

86
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.660
year and one of the major joy is of doing it again here is my seeing the

87
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:38.950
difference of how the audience reacts to certain things.

88
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.220
And I love the way the San Francisco audience response to the San Francisco

89
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:47.470
office of the play.
It's,
you can feel it and you can hear it in it's,

90
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.030
it's really exciting.
There's a line in the play where the d,

91
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.870
The American basketball coaches telling the kid,
you know,
I played,

92
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.190
I went to China and I and I coached the Chinese basketball players and they

93
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:04.100
don't want to like,
you know,
rough each other up and they don't want to,

94
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.350
they don't want to touch each other.
This,
I'm paraphrasing,

95
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:10.190
but that's what he says.
And the kid says,
ah,
have you ever been to Chinatown?

96
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
And that line is a ferry.
Perfectly funny line in New York City,

97
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:17.150
but in San Francisco,
the audience just loves it.

98
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.780
They just love knowing that the playwright really knows what yes,

99
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.510
pushy Chinese people in China town hall on the 30 stocks in our life.

100
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.110
<v 0>So true.
So,
so true.</v>

101
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.330
And you mentioned you did this play in New York and so this is the second time

102
00:06:36.331 --> 00:06:40.110
around.
What does it like to play the character for the second time?

103
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.390
<v 2>It's great.
I um,
the Ma,</v>

104
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.770
whenever you do a play in a different theater,
it's going to be different.

105
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.720
But this is even more so different than that because it's a completely different

106
00:06:51.721 --> 00:06:53.130
theater company that did the play.

107
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.800
It was completely weird for director and different actors.

108
00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.900
So I'm the real only kind of consistent thing in it.
So,

109
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.893
um,

110
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.210
and the other big difference is that the theater was very small in,

111
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.800
in New York.

112
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.800
It was a 99 seat theater and this is an 1100 seat theater and just technique

113
00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.660
wise and um,
uh,

114
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.320
physically it's a completely different production is a big set.
Is this,

115
00:07:19.321 --> 00:07:21.810
this version is much more like a Broadway show,
right?

116
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.000
Then the one we did in New York where Broadway is.

117
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.790
So that experience is really,
um,

118
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.040
a learning experience for somebody like me because you're always surprised at

119
00:07:34.771 --> 00:07:37.050
the news,
things that you can discover when,

120
00:07:37.051 --> 00:07:41.610
when the play is opened up in a much bigger way.
Right.
Lots of things.
Like,

121
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.450
like there's,

122
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.200
I have more costumes in this production than I had in the first production.
And,

123
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.440
and usually you'd think,
uh,
the play,

124
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.190
the storytelling of the play requires certain characters to wear certain

125
00:07:53.191 --> 00:07:57.900
costumes at certain times.
And that's true.
But I was able to,

126
00:07:57.901 --> 00:08:01.560
because of the theater was so small where the same thing throughout the entire

127
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.000
play and it worked really well because that character was consistent throughout

128
00:08:06.001 --> 00:08:11.001
from 1971 to 1989 this time because it's so opened up in big,

129
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.970
when I walk off the stage and I come back on again and it's a different time

130
00:08:14.971 --> 00:08:18.170
period.
You kind of want to see me dressed differently.
Yeah.

131
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:23.070
And so why I was really kind of thrown off at present President,
Oh,

132
00:08:23.071 --> 00:08:24.960
I'm gonna wear all these like met the first day.

133
00:08:24.961 --> 00:08:28.470
They show you all the sketches and stuff.
And I was really surprised at that.

134
00:08:28.471 --> 00:08:32.310
And then I,
my mind had to click over to,
oh,
I see,

135
00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:33.870
I see this differently now.

136
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.110
And that is an example of a lot of different things that have happened,

137
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.920
the way you use your voice and all of that stuff.
Um,
that,

138
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.820
that are adjustments and,
and learning experiences.

139
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.930
<v 0>How has it been just performing for some of the early audiences?</v>

140
00:08:48.931 --> 00:08:52.450
I saw it during a dress rehearsals.
I know that was the first time.
Yeah.

141
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.510
<v 2>Uh,
well,
um,
the,
uh,</v>

142
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.340
play like this with a lot of fast language and a lot of,
um,
of,

143
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.040
you know,
one at least one of the four characters and the plate that has a lot of

144
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:07.770
movement,
um,
and a lot of staging.

145
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:10.140
And then there's physical elements in the production,

146
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:11.520
like moving scenery and stuff like that.

147
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.480
These things take such time to iron out.

148
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.390
And so there's never been such a thing as,
as,

149
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.570
as a perfectly brilliant dress rehearsal because you're still working things

150
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:27.150
out.
You can never be bad ahead of schedule that by the time the audience comes,

151
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.570
it's all down.
Yeah.
You're still,
your mind is always processing things.

152
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.820
So we did a pretty clean skate on,
on,

153
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.560
um,
bat dress rehearsal,

154
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.100
but the show has definitely deepened and deepened to deepen and we'd done it

155
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:45.060
maybe six or seven times now.
And it's,
it's almost,

156
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:49.500
it's pretty much hit its stride as far as the command that we have over it.

157
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:53.580
Right.
And it's like practicing anything right over and over again.

158
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.540
The more you do it,
the better it gets.
And,
and,
and with this kind of play,

159
00:09:57.541 --> 00:10:02.400
which is kind of deep and kind of full of lots of details and stuff.
Yeah.
It's,

160
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.960
it's a kind of a,
um,
a bottomless,
well,
you know,
you don't,

161
00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:10.130
you don't ever get bored of it because there's always something new to discover.

162
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.190
<v 0>Yeah.
Got It.
That's the beauty of,
of theater I've,</v>

163
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.490
<v 2>yeah.
And good plays and the plays that are written with a,</v>

164
00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:19.850
some kind of substance or see when you're in love with the play too.
Yeah,

165
00:10:19.851 --> 00:10:24.320
I do it all the time.
I do.
And this particular play is one of the,
uh,

166
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.850
one of my favorite place that I've ever been able to do.
I love doing it.

167
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.860
I could keep doing it forever.

168
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.040
I understand why actors like Carol Channing and Yule Brenner played parts

169
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:41.560
forever and ever.
I used to think they were losers.
I used to think,

170
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.960
Oh God,
put it away,
Carol,

171
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:50.550
you're 80 years old and she's going on tour with another tour of Hello Dolly.

172
00:10:50.711 --> 00:10:53.810
She maybe did seven and real yule Brenner and seven or eight tours of,
of,

173
00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.680
but when that part things for you,

174
00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.700
you want to keep doing it and you know what you're giving the audience and

175
00:11:00.701 --> 00:11:04.180
they're loving it,
there's no way that you're going to give that up.

176
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.620
So I don't see myself continuing to do this play the like 80,

177
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:13.420
but I understand.
I understand the joy that one gets from that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

178
00:11:13.421 --> 00:11:17.260
you could certainly do it because at that age progression and you certainly

179
00:11:17.261 --> 00:11:19.100
don't age and awesome.
Yeah.
Okay.

180
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.070
<v 0>Well,</v>

181
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:27.070
I really walked away with from the play was that it's about manifesting destiny

182
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.920
and you know,
there's two characters,
um,

183
00:11:33.921 --> 00:11:37.730
and one is able to just kind of move through the world and say,
yes,

184
00:11:37.731 --> 00:11:39.890
everything is on my plate and I can grab it.

185
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.130
That's Manford and for your character,

186
00:11:43.131 --> 00:11:47.660
it's more or less like waiting for the opportunity to be told like it's now your

187
00:11:47.661 --> 00:11:52.490
time and there's a line at the end where he,
and I'm gonna paraphrase as well,

188
00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:56.800
but like basically saying that,
you know,
I didn't know that it was my time,

189
00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.850
but now it's my time.
It's always been there.
Yeah.

190
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:04.980
And I'm wondering how that parallels with your successful career that you've

191
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:06.470
had.

192
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:10.800
<v 2>Wow.
I never made a penny.
I never thought it to parallel it,</v>

193
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.890
that particularly personally,

194
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.520
I have always considered him someone that I needed to learn about because he

195
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:24.980
being,
um,
um,
uh,
a,
um,
uh,

196
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.690
a citizen of Communist China.
Yeah.
You know,

197
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:34.210
what was built into that life as p particularly yet this in this time period was

198
00:12:35.361 --> 00:12:36.830
a life of giving yourself,

199
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.730
giving over your own wishes to the wishes of the party and not,

200
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.560
I'm making choices for yourself.

201
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.060
And what's a nice juxtaposition and the play is that this,
this,

202
00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:52.450
this balls to the wall Asian American kid who doesn't know anything about that

203
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:58.700
just once and,
and you know,
is,
is going after his,
his dream.

204
00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:03.560
Yes.
And,
um,
in,
in comparison to this other character in China is,

205
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.420
um,
giving up all of his dreams because he,
he,
there's no,

206
00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.680
there's no alternative for him because of the political circumstances that he is

207
00:13:12.681 --> 00:13:16.380
in.
Personally,
I,

208
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.730
I guess what I can say is that when I was in high school,

209
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:24.940
I was just so lucky to have had a berry mentor relationship with a high school

210
00:13:27.381 --> 00:13:32.381
drama teacher who recognize potential in me and who absolutely demanded

211
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:36.693
that I

212
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:43.280
follow with or that I do not squander it to the point where she like took me by

213
00:13:44.341 --> 00:13:47.310
the hand to my own parents and said,
you know,

214
00:13:47.311 --> 00:13:51.530
I really think this person needs to,
uh,

215
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:53.860
keep doing this.
Wow.

216
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.220
And my parents were rather typical Asian American,

217
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.570
second generation parents.
They weren't super,
super,
super,

218
00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.400
they weren't tiger parents.
They were more though,
um,

219
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.910
condition down,
uh,

220
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.920
assumed that the best thing for us would be successful and stable careers,

221
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.720
doctor or lawyer.
That was it,
right?
Yes.
And,
and,

222
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:25.900
and so that was a huge paradigm shift for this person who was kind of an expert.

223
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:30.900
Right.
She knew she was a drama teacher.
Not really,
but she did go,

224
00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.720
I have credibility for my parents.
And so,
so the,
the idea,

225
00:14:35.721 --> 00:14:40.721
when you say the idea of taking your shot or looking following your bliss or

226
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.840
taking what you think is could be yours that came from outside forces that I was

227
00:14:47.271 --> 00:14:49.970
lucky to have been exposed to.
Um,

228
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.600
and I guess I do relate emotionally at the end of the play to someone who isn't

229
00:14:56.811 --> 00:15:01.790
able to do that.
Yeah.
And,
and the,
the,
the,
the,
the whatever,

230
00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:06.680
the complicated feelings that one has,
not having to have that restriction,

231
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.310
the guilt you might feel,
survivors guilt kind of thing.

232
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.890
Or what if it were me,
you know,

233
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.580
we know really we're all here just because we're here where we don't get a

234
00:15:16.581 --> 00:15:20.930
choice to be communist Chinese or not coming as Johnny's,
you know,

235
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:25.970
and in this particular plate really shows that you don't have a choice.
Yes.
And,

236
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.440
and so I don't,
you know,

237
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:30.920
I think we all kind of take for granted our freedom and our ability to do

238
00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:33.440
whatever we want and to say whatever we want.

239
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.930
And the play kind of,
um,
very,

240
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.070
very uh,

241
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:46.190
beautifully kind of reminds us of that.
And I do like that part about the play.

242
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:51.310
So I do relate to the characters inability to access his dreams based upon my

243
00:15:55.731 --> 00:15:57.560
ability to access my dreams I guess.

244
00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.370
<v 0>Yes.
It's interesting because</v>

245
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.750
a lot of times,
you know,

246
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:09.780
even like if we take the context out of the play of just being maybe an emerging

247
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:14.380
artist of color or part of the Lgbtq community,

248
00:16:14.381 --> 00:16:17.710
which you have been a huge advocate for both.
Um,

249
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:22.660
I think it's quite difficult when we are going out to pursue those kinds of

250
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.850
artistic dreams,
whether it be an acting dance or even here in text.

251
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.420
If you don't see a role model,

252
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:33.630
it's hard to really think about can I go out and like grab hold of those dreams.

253
00:16:33.971 --> 00:16:37.930
And it was great that you mentioned your high school mentor,
but you know,

254
00:16:37.931 --> 00:16:40.720
as someone who may not have that,
what is some advice that you would,

255
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:46.700
<v 2>well,
I may be advice.
I have tons of advice.</v>

256
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.330
We put the floor,
I give advice.
I think it's in,

257
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:54.340
and it is important to acknowledge that phenomenon of um,

258
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.220
uh,
representation.
I mean we,
uh,

259
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.340
we were at the point now where we're talking about representation all the time.

260
00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.960
Yeah.
It doesn't lose its meaning,
but,
but what would I love to talk about?

261
00:17:05.961 --> 00:17:10.670
What is absolutely essential about that representation is the influence that

262
00:17:10.671 --> 00:17:14.090
that represents a change and has over younger people.
Yes.
Right.

263
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.740
And that what we're really fighting for in our grown up state is what?
Well,

264
00:17:18.741 --> 00:17:22.550
we want to see more Asians.
Well,
I want to see my,
I want my stories to be told.

265
00:17:22.551 --> 00:17:25.700
I want to see sexy Asian people on the screen and all of that stuff.

266
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.930
But what we really want is for the needle to,

267
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.550
to shift because the,

268
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:36.470
because our kids don't have the,
the same street,

269
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.640
the same schism when it comes to looking,

270
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.780
searching fruitlessly for themselves in the media.
And it's,

271
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:49.770
it is shifting in a way where the exposure is greater now.
And we do that.

272
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.690
And so my advice would be,
I don't know what,
you know,
I don't,
I,
I think it's,

273
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:55.860
it's partly,
for me,

274
00:17:55.861 --> 00:18:00.300
it's always been kind of that Cokie Gandhi thing that be the change you want to

275
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.470
see thing.
You know,
that,
that there's always someone that you can mentor.

276
00:18:04.471 --> 00:18:06.360
There's always somebody,
even if you're not famous,

277
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.490
there's always someone that is looking to you for,

278
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:16.100
and we as role models,
I think people forget that,
that,
that,

279
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.270
that thing is really happening.
You don't see it happening.

280
00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:21.020
You don't feel it happening,
but it's happening.
Yeah.
He,

281
00:18:21.021 --> 00:18:25.560
young people are looking to you for an example of what it is,

282
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.190
is they are going to be,
they have no other frame of reference,

283
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:34.230
but to see a person older and more experienced than them and to do as they do.

284
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:39.060
Yes.
And to,
and so our self esteem is super important.

285
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:43.680
And our sense of sorting out all the baggage that our parents gave us and their

286
00:18:43.681 --> 00:18:48.210
grandparents gave them sorting all that so that it's a little bit easier for

287
00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:53.211
them is a fun challenge I think because we're still dealing with our own

288
00:18:53.911 --> 00:18:57.480
baggage.
But I think we do have less a little bit then we'd been,

289
00:18:57.481 --> 00:19:00.690
our grandparents had,
I hope so.
We have different kinds.

290
00:19:00.691 --> 00:19:03.860
Our grandparents didn't care about representation,
you know,

291
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.980
they don't care at all about,
um,
but then I do remember my,

292
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.240
my parent's generation of people running into the,
into the living room saying,

293
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.390
oh my God,
look,
there's an Asian person on TV.
Like that kind of thing.

294
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.300
And that's all running into the,
the,
the living room,
dude,

295
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:23.220
that wasn't that long ago.
And,
and there's still a sense of that now.
Right?

296
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.600
Oh look.
Wow.
It's a commercial with an Asian person in it.

297
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.730
So that's kind of a new trend.
Yeah.
Commercials of Asian people in them.
Um,
well,

298
00:19:32.731 --> 00:19:36.750
because for whatever reason,
we can talk about it forever about the,

299
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.970
the misnomer that Asian people,

300
00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.250
their money doesn't matter or something like that.
Okay.

301
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.250
So now it's clearly true that it's been,

302
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:49.860
it's been established that the money does matter and that's a good for us in a

303
00:19:49.861 --> 00:19:52.400
way,
and it's certainly good for our representation.
Oh,
totally.

304
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:56.280
<v 0>Yeah.
And I mean,
the success with crazy rich Asians,
I mean,
yeah.</v>

305
00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.450
Pretty is that it can be right,

306
00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:57.910
<v 2>right.</v>

307
00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:02.340
That it transcended it being an Asian movie by being popular across the board.

308
00:20:02.341 --> 00:20:02.640
Right?

309
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.530
<v 0>Yeah.
Yes.
And that's what's really nice.
Uh,</v>

310
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:10.700
I did hear it on a podcast that you did maybe a couple of weeks ago with Kq ed.

311
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:11.820
Um,

312
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:16.530
what really struck me was you did talk about the responsibility that you have or

313
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.420
producers or people who have that power of choosing story,
that they have this,

314
00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.500
um,

315
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:27.420
responsibility to create these images and characters so that yet the younger

316
00:20:27.421 --> 00:20:32.310
generation can,
you know,
yeah.
Be inspired.
So I'm wondering like,

317
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:36.120
what is,
is your personal responsibility for that?

318
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:40.170
Are you having a hand in developing?
Oh,
yeah.

319
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.150
Even when am I doing?
Yeah,
I do.

320
00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.560
<v 2>I am.
I,
I think that's one of the great,</v>

321
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.590
one of the things that comes out of frustration is the,

322
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:52.260
is the creative limitations that you're given,
create,
uh,
if you're,

323
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.910
if you're up for it,
uh,

324
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.780
opportunities for yourself or for others or for the people that you believe in

325
00:20:58.781 --> 00:21:03.750
that are experiencing the same kind of marginalization as you.
And,

326
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:04.960
and so I have,

327
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.890
I'm always working on things on my own,

328
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:12.070
like trying to kind of maintain my relationship with theaters,

329
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:16.630
like act to kind of like,
I'm already kind of thinking now what's next?

330
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:20.620
What would I do here next?
And,
and kind of coming up with,

331
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.640
you can't just pick one thing.
You can't just go to Pam McKinney,

332
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.580
the artistic director and say,
Oh,
here's the one thing I want to do.
Do it.

333
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.510
You have to kind of give her kind of a landscape of things that might work and

334
00:21:31.511 --> 00:21:35.270
see whether any of them appeal,
appeal to her and,
and all,

335
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.190
all of those things for me in evolve,
um,

336
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:43.000
Asian Americans or,
um,
uh,
you know,
uh,

337
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.610
not just me or me as a character playing,

338
00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:51.050
they're all explorations of reimagination of classic work or new work itself

339
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:59.670
that will do what this play that we're doing now is doing.

340
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.430
Um,
and when I talk about producers,

341
00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.600
I'm not exactly sure exactly what I said that time,
but,

342
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.470
or don't remember exactly,
but,

343
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:13.830
but I do feel that there's this phenomenon that we're all kind of well aware of

344
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:19.130
that's very frustrating that we don't know what to do about it.

345
00:22:19.131 --> 00:22:21.490
And that is that things that unless it affects you,

346
00:22:21.491 --> 00:22:24.970
you often don't want to do anything about something.
It's the kind of thing,

347
00:22:24.971 --> 00:22:28.660
you know,
to use a very,
um,
brutal example.

348
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:33.580
It's like the people that are most championing cancer research and stuff are

349
00:22:33.581 --> 00:22:37.960
people that cancer has touched themselves.
Right?
And this is,
this is the,

350
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:42.730
this is a kind of way in some ways for people to choose the things that mean

351
00:22:42.731 --> 00:22:45.370
most to them,
which is a nice thing.
However,

352
00:22:45.371 --> 00:22:50.371
when it comes to Hollywood that the issue of diversity doesn't ring true for a

353
00:22:50.621 --> 00:22:54.880
lot of people and it kind of defines white privilege,
what might,

354
00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:59.290
what we like to throw around this term love white privilege because a person has

355
00:22:59.291 --> 00:23:04.291
no sense of what that damage or what that pain or what that exclusion feels

356
00:23:05.861 --> 00:23:08.440
like.
So they're the ones who are doing it,

357
00:23:08.441 --> 00:23:11.380
are doing it cause they know they're supposed to or whatever.

358
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.790
So it some way to get them to feel.
That is the thing that I think is,

359
00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:20.110
is an interesting challenge to get them to understand,

360
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:24.460
to take to heart.
Um,
um,
it's the equivalent of,

361
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.160
of going to a cancer benefit and,

362
00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:32.250
and like a big cancer gala or something and watching the video that they show of

363
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:38.170
what it means to us survivor or to their family or whatever and you're going,

364
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:42.580
oh,
those are human beings.
I relate to being a human being.
That thing,

365
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:47.610
I don't have to have cancer to know that this is important and that kind of

366
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:54.100
sharing of that because there are still so many producers and people that better

367
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.070
borderline,

368
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.310
they're either doing it because they think they're supposed to and that's good,

369
00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:01.460
but there's still not really feeling it or they don't get it at all.

370
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.510
It doesn't occur to them.
And,

371
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.580
and I'm fascinated by that because I personally am really,

372
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:13.100
um,
I don't consume a lot of things that are all white.
Like I,

373
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:16.760
when I see something that seems to kind of like it's all white or not,

374
00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.670
doesn't have any Asian people in it at all.
I'm not as interested.

375
00:24:19.671 --> 00:24:23.570
I don't connect to it.
I mean,
I,
um,
and so,
uh,
like,

376
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.800
like I watched the other day,
I watched hidden figures,

377
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.430
which everybody loves that movie.
Right?
It's a great,
it's very satisfying movie.

378
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.580
But I've,
I'm,
I'm less moved by it.

379
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:40.370
I feel left out of it in some ways because as we grew,
as we,
as I've grown up,

380
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.890
it was always like,
are you black or white?
There was a,

381
00:24:42.891 --> 00:24:47.210
like a kind of question that that was a very strange one to proceed.

382
00:24:47.211 --> 00:24:51.230
People asking anyway.
I don't know.
That's just me going on about that.

383
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:55.340
<v 0>I love it.
Okay,
thanks.
It's very interesting,
but I,</v>

384
00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.000
I kind of want to tag back onto what you just said about,
well,

385
00:24:59.001 --> 00:25:03.530
I'm not a part of it and I think that's kind of the narrative that a lot of

386
00:25:03.531 --> 00:25:08.150
Asian Americans feel that were not part of the main narrative in Hollywood.

387
00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:11.710
Right.
Um,
Kinda to tie it back to Lauren and then,
yeah,

388
00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.370
I know we're talking about the great leap,
but the king of the,

389
00:25:13.371 --> 00:25:17.060
he's made a comment about,
um,
you know,
in marketing,
you know,

390
00:25:17.061 --> 00:25:19.780
there's the black people marketing the,
his attention,
right?

391
00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:25.160
And then there's Asians and we're all lumped into the Caucasian marketing plan,

392
00:25:25.161 --> 00:25:28.430
which I thought was a very interesting point.
Um,

393
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.260
and I'm wondering how do we get more visibility out there?
Like,

394
00:25:33.261 --> 00:25:37.160
how do we like raise our voices and say,
Hey,
we mad or,
or,
you know,

395
00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:39.980
make more stories about us because we want to watch it?

396
00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.960
<v 2>Well,
I would tie that into my being here today really,</v>

397
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.140
because what I'm trying to do,

398
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.080
I mean the theater wants me to come and talk about the show,

399
00:25:50.081 --> 00:25:51.910
which is great and I love talking about the show.

400
00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:57.060
But what I really want to do is to create a situation in which Asian people are

401
00:25:57.131 --> 00:26:00.520
really supporting their own content.

402
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:05.780
Because the only way to perpetuate that content is sports us be successful.
Yes.

403
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:09.820
And,
and if Pam Mckinnon the,
the,
uh,
uh,

404
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:14.880
Caucasian American artistic director of American Conservatory Theater has a big

405
00:26:15.461 --> 00:26:16.960
dud with this play,

406
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:22.200
she's less likely to do another one and then we're all more likely to complain

407
00:26:22.781 --> 00:26:27.700
about it.
And we're like,
oh,
well they act.
They don't ever do well.
Did you go?

408
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.990
Did you go see?
Yeah,
exactly.
And,
and,
and for Asian American people,

409
00:26:31.991 --> 00:26:33.580
with a lot of people like human beings,

410
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:36.970
they don't always understand the gesture of that,

411
00:26:36.971 --> 00:26:41.890
like doing your part voting,
um,
all of that stuff.
You know,
like,
yes,

412
00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:43.890
it does matter that you vote.
And yes,

413
00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:48.660
it does matter that you buy a ticket to see a play if you care about what the

414
00:26:48.661 --> 00:26:51.300
play can do for you,
you know,

415
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:56.150
the things that you're complaining about w we all complain about.
Um,

416
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.660
so that's an equation that I think could be more made,

417
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:04.560
more clear and,
and I love that and I always try to tell people,
oh,
just

418
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.590
try to support the content because the co,

419
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:12.550
and we really did that in a big way with crazy with Jay.

420
00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:18.180
That was really super gratifying to me and reassuring to me and encouraging to

421
00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:21.360
me that this generation of,

422
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:25.710
of Asian Americans put their money where their mouth was and created a sense

423
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:29.700
whether it's true or not,
that's something has changed.
You know,

424
00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:33.390
because there's a lot of articles out there now saying hasn't really changed or

425
00:27:33.391 --> 00:27:35.280
whatever is it,
what will happen next?

426
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:40.490
There's a fair amount of crazy rich Asian knock off action happening out there,

427
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:44.400
which is a really good sign that,
that um,
you know,

428
00:27:44.401 --> 00:27:49.401
I'm not into knockoffs but I'm into the representation so I'll take it.

429
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.300
But it's absolutely like there's going to be a couple of television shows and

430
00:27:54.301 --> 00:27:59.280
all of that stuff.
And um,
that's really good.
You do have to kind of,

431
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.920
in some ways,
if you're really,
really responsible,

432
00:28:01.921 --> 00:28:06.921
you take note of the people that are sponsoring Asian content and try to kind of

433
00:28:07.501 --> 00:28:11.890
support them.
That's what network television is kind of.
Um,

434
00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:17.250
one thing that it allows you to do is to see the corporations and the companies

435
00:28:17.251 --> 00:28:19.560
that support the things that we're trying to do.

436
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.510
So we don't think about that.
Right.
I don't think about it that much.

437
00:28:24.511 --> 00:28:27.840
I have to go,
okay.
Oh look,
okay.

438
00:28:27.841 --> 00:28:32.790
So these people are sponsors of the,
the whatever show,

439
00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.130
you know,
I don't know,
whatever it is,
you know,

440
00:28:35.131 --> 00:28:38.880
I'm doing this comedy central show with Aquafina in the summer and,

441
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.120
and I can't wait to see who,

442
00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.890
who buys add time on that show.
Okay.

443
00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:47.850
Last question.

444
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:53.400
I'd love to know what your mom thinks about all of this because moms are

445
00:28:53.401 --> 00:28:57.720
important.
Yes.
Because we are at the Asian affinity Google Group,
aren't we?

446
00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.830
You know,
really,
I have to say,
I still,

447
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:08.130
I consider my mother way more than I should in various everyday decisions like

448
00:29:08.131 --> 00:29:11.610
buying underwear.
I just,

449
00:29:11.611 --> 00:29:16.560
so it's so deeply ingrained to me to please her that,

450
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:21.120
that I,
that I think about her and to a fault and it's not good necessarily,

451
00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:22.800
not necessarily good for me sometimes,

452
00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:27.180
but I do do it and there are really positive side effects of that.

453
00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:32.420
And I must say that choosing this play to do it here and to do it here now and

454
00:29:33.961 --> 00:29:38.190
to kind of kind of drop everything at like as much as I could to do it because

455
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:41.920
the time commitment that it takes to do a play is really intense.

456
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.910
And that means being away from home and I have a teenage son and all of that

457
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:49.340
stuff.
So choosing to do so,
uh,

458
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:54.420
to do a play out of town was made infinitely more seductive,

459
00:29:55.841 --> 00:30:00.100
was satisfying because my mom's here and because my mom is,

460
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.820
you know,
inviting our,
my whole family,

461
00:30:03.821 --> 00:30:05.560
my whole gigantic,

462
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:10.390
her whole family who mostly are still in the bay area to come to the matinee on

463
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:15.391
Sunday this Sunday and then have this big party and up stairs in the theater and

464
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:20.080
do that kind of thing.
You know,
cause she is like,
she,
there's no,

465
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:24.820
there isn't one.
There isn't one prototypical uh,
Chinese mom.

466
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:29.100
But there were maybe four or five.
Yes.

467
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:34.690
Yes.
And my mom is the one who will do,
will do anything,

468
00:30:34.691 --> 00:30:39.190
not to brag,
um,
by using bragging words.

469
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:40.830
<v 3>Ah,</v>

470
00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.540
<v 2>if you look closely,
there's a lot of bragging going on,</v>

471
00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:50.100
but it's very classy and it's Barry,
she never says anything.

472
00:30:50.101 --> 00:30:55.101
She lets everyone else say nice things and then she says she just nods or

473
00:30:55.171 --> 00:30:57.210
something like that.
You must be very proud.

474
00:30:59.060 --> 00:30:59.893
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

475
00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.850
<v 2>So she is,
is,
is in,
in that kind of,</v>

476
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.830
it's kind of passive aggressive,
you know,
kind of like she's,

477
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:13.460
she doesn't want to shoot,
but,

478
00:31:13.461 --> 00:31:18.461
but it's wonderful to be the beneficiary or the recipient or the inspiration for

479
00:31:19.951 --> 00:31:23.190
her doing these things.
Yeah.
Inviting all the,
her,

480
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:28.080
her family and friends to Biz thing and,
and not pushing them to come see it,

481
00:31:28.081 --> 00:31:32.280
but telling them when it is and,
and hoping that they come and then feeding them.

482
00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:36.780
That's key.
Yeah.
That's,
yeah.
It's cute.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

483
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:39.780
and um,
uh,

484
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:44.840
she's kind of a mascot of the production because the last time I worked at act,

485
00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:49.950
she kind of cozied up to the house staff.
And so then she would say to me,
Oh,

486
00:31:49.951 --> 00:31:51.870
I'm going to go shopping and Chinatown.
Oh God,

487
00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:55.770
I think I'm going to come and see the second act of the play and just show up.

488
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:59.160
And they'd be like,
let her sit in the back or whatever like that.
I said,
well,

489
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.410
you can't just show up.
I mean that you have to like meet the person or what.

490
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:08.910
But she is,
she's treated very royal Lee and it's very nice.

491
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.310
It's very just like the [inaudible] tower juror.

492
00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:18.300
And she's very cute and,
um,
and,
and she's very,

493
00:32:18.301 --> 00:32:22.490
she has a very lovable personality.
She really does.
She,

494
00:32:22.491 --> 00:32:24.400
she just like were,
you know,

495
00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:29.400
she's very infectious and very kind of smiley.
I love that.
Yeah.

496
00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.390
That's great.
Thank you.
Bd.
Sure.
We have our first question over here.
Okay.

497
00:32:33.391 --> 00:32:37.380
You're on Abd.
Hey.
Um,
I'm also,

498
00:32:37.381 --> 00:32:40.010
I noticed that you're a native San Franciscan.
I know we've talked a

499
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.470
<v 4>lot of serious topics,
but we wanted to talk about some of the fun,</v>

500
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.080
Julian mentioned food talks.
Ah,
and I'm,
you know,

501
00:32:45.081 --> 00:32:47.200
I'm always curious about when actors kind of come home,

502
00:32:47.201 --> 00:32:50.870
at least back to San Francisco or actresses,
you know,
what's your,

503
00:32:50.871 --> 00:32:51.681
what's your go to,

504
00:32:51.681 --> 00:32:54.590
what is the one thing when you come back here that you need to have that kind of

505
00:32:54.591 --> 00:32:58.160
connects you back with your childhood and some of these good joyous memories?

506
00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:01.840
<v 2>Uh,
capitol restaurant,
Clay Street,
chicken wings,</v>

507
00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.460
they're famous chicken wings.
And they're,
I mean,
like,
I,
I'm,

508
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:08.740
I'm almost kind of like,

509
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:12.940
you almost kind of want to not tell people about them because you want them for

510
00:33:12.941 --> 00:33:16.270
yourself.
Um,
but that comes to mind immediately.

511
00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:21.510
My family is obsessed with the house of primary hub on bad ass obsessed.

512
00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:27.460
And we go there.
We like,
I mean,

513
00:33:27.461 --> 00:33:30.880
at the like opening of an off below,
we will go there.

514
00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:35.140
It's like we will go there for any occasion.
Well,

515
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:39.940
we'll make up some special occasion and goes
and um,

516
00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:43.930
of like,
uh,
so we do the high slot primary whenever we can.

517
00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:48.430
We just did it a couple of weeks ago.
Um,
let's see,

518
00:33:48.431 --> 00:33:51.700
what else is there a sunset bakery,
chaucey bowels

519
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:57.790
that's on like ninth avenue and Irving,
um,
or Judah.

520
00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:03.130
And,
um,
let's see what else?
Let's see.

521
00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:06.410
I'm going through all of my ethnic groups,
Mexican,

522
00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:12.570
um,
you know,
my uncle Bobby,
my mom's brother,
uh,

523
00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:17.500
uh,
replicated the retina.
You guys are mostly too young for this,
but,

524
00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:22.510
but my uncle Bobby replicated the recipe of the enchiladas at this place called

525
00:34:22.511 --> 00:34:26.980
the hot house,
which was,
um,
at playland at the beach,

526
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:30.700
which was by the cliff house.
This like boardwalk.

527
00:34:30.701 --> 00:34:35.701
They used to be there and there used to be this like a pass through window rest

528
00:34:36.191 --> 00:34:40.360
car title precursor to a food truck kind of restaurant called the hot house.

529
00:34:40.361 --> 00:34:44.830
And they had these very basic but delicious kind of,

530
00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.920
um,
uh,
enchiladas that came in,

531
00:34:47.921 --> 00:34:51.370
a little cardboard tray and he might,

532
00:34:51.371 --> 00:34:56.371
so my uncle has kept that recipe alive and it makes that a big batch of this,

533
00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.860
this Enchilada gravy that they made.

534
00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:04.510
And so that's a childhood memory of going to the hot house at the beach.

535
00:35:04.511 --> 00:35:08.380
Cause I grew up on 40th and Ortega.
I'm really close to the beach.

536
00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:13.570
Um,
those are the hot top five,
I think the ones that come to mind.

537
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:15.200
Then there'll be more that come to mind and I'll,

538
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.820
I'll blurt them out like Tourette's.

539
00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:23.110
<v 4>Sweet.
Thank you.
Sure.
Okay.
Right over here.
Thanks again for coming today.
VD.
Sure.</v>

540
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.983
Um,

541
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:28.720
this is a little bit more of a personal question.

542
00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:33.050
So I went to acting school in New York many years ago.
Uh,

543
00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:37.320
when I graduated it was the early aughts and I walked into an industry that,
uh,

544
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:42.270
was not particularly looking for dudes who look like me and I wanted to talk,

545
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.030
you talked a lot about representation to yeah,

546
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:48.550
I wanted to talk a little bit more about,
um,
the pipeline issue and,

547
00:35:48.551 --> 00:35:53.090
and for me,
I got out of the game and I'm very keen to admit that.
And um,

548
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:55.660
it was really hard for me,
but I,
I,

549
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.770
I had those prototypical parents who were like,
chase your dream,

550
00:35:58.771 --> 00:36:02.730
chase your dream.
And then it became,
I can't do this anymore.

551
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:05.490
So I,
I guess my question is,

552
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:10.410
what would you say to all of the folks who now are going into an industry that

553
00:36:10.411 --> 00:36:15.411
is just slightly more friendly to folks like us to keep them in the game and to

554
00:36:16.621 --> 00:36:17.454
keep that

555
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.600
<v 2>Oh,
great.
That is a really good positive based question.
Thank you.</v>

556
00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:23.930
And we visit the good things come from pain.
And if that,

557
00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:26.720
if you're a pain created this question and changes somebody's life,

558
00:36:26.721 --> 00:36:27.920
that's probably a good thing.

559
00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:33.150
But I will say that just before I answer is that that pain,

560
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:38.190
that rejection and that shame are universal right there.

561
00:36:38.561 --> 00:36:41.000
They're not your own.
And you know,

562
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:46.030
you have to blame really the situation much more than yourself for that,

563
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:51.590
that outcome of that.
Um,
you seem perfectly happy now.
So I'm,

564
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:56.140
I'm,
I trust that,
that we'll see.
Yeah.
Um,

565
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.550
and what I would say,
well I would,

566
00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.850
I wouldn't say anything that's that different from what people told me when I

567
00:37:01.851 --> 00:37:03.710
first started,
when it was considerably different,

568
00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.450
which was if you absolutely have to do it,
then do it.
And if you don't,

569
00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.810
you should think of something else.
It's super difficult.
It's,

570
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.060
it messes with your mind.

571
00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.660
It messes with your self esteem and messes with your sense of self worth,

572
00:37:17.661 --> 00:37:22.430
your sense of what success means.
And,
um,

573
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:23.321
you have to be,

574
00:37:23.321 --> 00:37:28.321
you have to have a extremely strong constitution and an extremely accessible

575
00:37:28.611 --> 00:37:29.540
support system.

576
00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.710
And I feel like you're right that,

577
00:37:33.711 --> 00:37:37.600
that the needle's moved to the point where young people,
you know,

578
00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:41.870
you want to kind of slap them for the things that they complain about.
Right.
Um,

579
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.770
because it was so much harder before and it is so much,

580
00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.870
there's so much more opportunity now.

581
00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:53.080
But with that opportunity comes more competition and,

582
00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:58.160
and I certainly feel that from the beginning of my career there was less

583
00:37:58.161 --> 00:38:02.990
competition and the competition has grown and the amount of younger people in

584
00:38:02.991 --> 00:38:05.150
the industry has grown,
blah,

585
00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:10.250
but so also has the amount of Asian American writers and the amount of producers

586
00:38:10.251 --> 00:38:12.770
and people that are actually making an influential choices.

587
00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:17.390
So I would just say that they really should not take for granted,

588
00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.920
especially given what you're saying,

589
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:22.910
they should not take for granted any progress that's being made.
But you know,

590
00:38:22.911 --> 00:38:27.640
young people are so clueless sometimes,
right?
Because we,
and,

591
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:32.150
and rightly so because we can't know anything that happened before us.

592
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:36.250
We can hear about it and we can take it to heart.
When,
when,
when my,

593
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:41.280
when we talked to my son who was born in 2000 about nine 11 he understands the

594
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:45.630
gravity of it.
He doesn't feel the emotion of it.
He's,

595
00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.430
he wasn't there to watch on television.

596
00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:53.730
The absolute devastation and the loss and the emotional feelings.

597
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:58.890
So if you guys know that this show come from a way came into town a few weeks

598
00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:00.090
ago,
come from away,

599
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:03.910
it's about a nine old centered around the day of nine 11 and the days after.

600
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:07.870
And it's one thing where if you're of a certain age and you're sitting in the

601
00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:08.800
audience of that show,

602
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:12.460
everyone in the audience is having the same emotional experience,

603
00:39:12.461 --> 00:39:17.230
which is a very rare thing.
You,
you,
you,
you can't in in Lawrence play,

604
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.760
she's having to explain certain really heavy things that have happened in

605
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:26.260
history and you get it from understanding what she's taught you about.

606
00:39:26.261 --> 00:39:30.170
It come from away starts and it says today's nine 11 and everyone starts crying

607
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.260
immediately and it's kind of great.

608
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:35.680
Anybody born after nine 11 it doesn't really understand.

609
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.820
This is a tangent to try to describe that these,
these,

610
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:45.310
these rather adorable young people that are becoming actors don't really

611
00:39:45.311 --> 00:39:50.110
understand the,
the things that were built on the backs of other people.
Right?

612
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:55.990
This is an ongoing discussion about everything,

613
00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.010
about aids,

614
00:39:57.011 --> 00:40:02.011
about gay people and the aids and about the Holocaust and everything.

615
00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:06.070
Everything major that has ever happened where every pain that any generation has

616
00:40:06.071 --> 00:40:10.270
experienced,
it's really hard to,
to for the following generation to feel.

617
00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:15.650
So we cut them a little bit of slack and we tried to kind of,
um,
uh,

618
00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:20.790
for me I think a sense of discipline and a sense of entitlement,
um,
uh,

619
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:24.610
a discipline needs to be encouraged and entitlement needs to be kind of,

620
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:29.350
you know,
smacked out of people sometime and,
and so,
but,

621
00:40:29.351 --> 00:40:33.970
but the advice I would give is that it requires an absolutely,
um,

622
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:39.030
steadfast constitution and that there's great joy to be had in it and that,

623
00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:43.510
that there's something actually kind of noble about it.

624
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.980
There is a sense that I learned from my first acting teacher that you are a

625
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:53.010
messenger and that if the messages that you're giving are true and are positive

626
00:40:53.501 --> 00:40:57.970
and they make people think where they make people act differently than you've

627
00:40:57.971 --> 00:41:02.110
done something where you've acted as an agent to something actually happening.

628
00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:06.870
So it's not just kind of glamor and kind of,
um,
um,

629
00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.890
acting and applause and stuff like that.

630
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.460
It could be rather useful in society.

631
00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:17.400
So thank you.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Okay.

632
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:21.650
<v 5>Thanks again for coming out.
Um,
just wanted to ask you a question.</v>

633
00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:26.680
As an Asian American who's also grown up with like second generation parents,

634
00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.190
um,
you know,

635
00:41:28.191 --> 00:41:32.870
if you ever traveled back to China and if and when you did,
did you,

636
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:34.220
how

637
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.530
<v 2>was that experience for you and you know,
how,</v>

638
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.250
how were you able to channel that when you were,
um,
you know,

639
00:41:40.251 --> 00:41:43.580
acting during the play?
I went to China on one,

640
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:47.340
two major times on the first time I went.
Um,

641
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:52.420
my dad was still alive and I was booked to be the guest speaker on a cruise that

642
00:41:52.611 --> 00:41:56.210
went to China.
And it was a super duper,

643
00:41:56.270 --> 00:42:00.650
hilariously fancy cruise with all super old white people.

644
00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.910
But I was supposed to talk about being Chinese person to them.

645
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.360
I was like,
it was a little bit like a zoo.

646
00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.213
<v 3>No,
it's like,</v>

647
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:14.190
<v 2>oh,
competing time is at four 15 BD Wong will come out and you can</v>

648
00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.640
<v 3>row pretzels at him.</v>

649
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.690
<v 2>But it wasn't really,
really many ways moving experience.</v>

650
00:42:23.691 --> 00:42:28.310
My Dad had not been back to Hong Kong since he wa he left Hong Kong.
My Dad,
my,

651
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:32.900
oddly enough,
my grandfather was born in California.

652
00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:37.910
My grandfather went back home to marry my grandma and to have my dad and then

653
00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:42.830
brought them back.
So my dad was technically not bought,
brought born here,

654
00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.220
but he was born a citizen.
Um,
and,

655
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.850
and so he had this very like,
oh my gosh,
this is where I was born,

656
00:42:49.851 --> 00:42:52.190
kind of thing that he w that really snuck up on him.
He,

657
00:42:52.191 --> 00:42:55.370
I don't think he ever even thought about going back,
but he was this opportunity.

658
00:42:55.371 --> 00:42:59.510
We went back.
So that was that.
And,
um,

659
00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:03.080
uh,
there's just,
I wish I could talk for an hour about this cruise.
It was,

660
00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.720
it was so funny because,
well,
first of all,

661
00:43:05.721 --> 00:43:09.590
I will tell you that the one thing is it was so fancy that they,

662
00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.800
they give you this little thing to fill out when you come in,

663
00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:16.880
when you check into your room and the thing to asks you what kind of liquor they

664
00:43:16.881 --> 00:43:21.680
want you to stock,
um,
the bar with the refrigerator with,

665
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:24.890
okay.
And you get four bottles of each or something like that.

666
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:29.450
And my mom is a white wine drinker and my dad was a Jack Daniel's drinker,

667
00:43:29.451 --> 00:43:32.210
so they got four bottles of white wine and four bottles of Jack Daniels.

668
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:37.690
And then that night they put all eight bottles in their suitcase.

669
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.220
<v 3>They filled out the form again,</v>

670
00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.550
by the end of the cruise,

671
00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:49.830
they had like a bevmo in under the bed.

672
00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:56.170
<v 2>I don't want to say,
you know,</v>

673
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:59.210
it's racial profiling to say that this is because they're Chinese,

674
00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.290
but you know,
no pun intended it,
you do the math.

675
00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.290
Um,
I,

676
00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:12.230
I went on a second trip to China in 2003 to make a terrible television movie,

677
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.920
but I,
that was a really interesting cultural experience for me as well,

678
00:44:15.921 --> 00:44:20.921
working with Chinese people and working in the Chinese film industry in rural

679
00:44:22.041 --> 00:44:26.960
China.
And I think really,
you know,

680
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.250
I hope you'll come see the play.

681
00:44:28.251 --> 00:44:32.250
Lauren talks about the experience of being an Asian American and going to China

682
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.330
as a very unique kind of odd fish out of water experience.

683
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.400
And that is an experience I felt.

684
00:44:38.401 --> 00:44:42.240
I didn't really feel like I was home or anything like that.
Um,
I felt it,

685
00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:47.460
it's so obvious to them that you're American before you even open your mouth.

686
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.070
They just,
you can,
you just,
you can't hide it.

687
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:55.580
And so there's always a kind of either a curiosity or a slight stain over you.

688
00:44:56.330 --> 00:45:01.140
And,
and so I felt that tension and that was no different than the way that,

689
00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.330
uh,
the,
the,
the,

690
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:06.990
the young woman and the play describes it in and in Lauren's play.

691
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.410
So apparently Laura and understands that kind of experience too.

692
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:15.180
It's pretty common.
Um,
did I answer the question?
Not really.

693
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.380
You did or
you said good things,

694
00:45:19.381 --> 00:45:20.700
but you did not answer the question.

695
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:25.770
How we learned about the Bevmo w what was the,
what was the specific question?

696
00:45:25.771 --> 00:45:29.430
I can answer it now,
I guess.
Oh,

697
00:45:29.431 --> 00:45:33.770
how do I draw on it for the play?
Well,
I would say that,
um,
uh,

698
00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:35.700
how did I draw on it for what I did really,

699
00:45:35.701 --> 00:45:40.050
really related to Lauren's words about being an Asian American,
going to China.

700
00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:44.970
And I think what I had to do really the research about how shut down at a

701
00:45:44.971 --> 00:45:49.470
Chinese person who's,
um,
not a,

702
00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.870
not a dream seeker,
you know,

703
00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:56.710
a person who was sort of a certain constitution who is a party member of the,
uh,

704
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:57.001
you know,

705
00:45:57.001 --> 00:46:01.860
a member of the party and very obedient and very diligent what there that is a

706
00:46:01.861 --> 00:46:04.180
very different kind of person than me.
And,

707
00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:09.220
and so I did have to kind of access whatever else I feel in my life that shuts

708
00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:16.620
me down or,
uh,
quiets me or keeps me from making decisions.

709
00:46:16.621 --> 00:46:21.621
And I do do relate to feeling like when I like a younger man being closeted and

710
00:46:22.651 --> 00:46:27.450
feeling kind of restricted by my sense of being closeted and a sense of not

711
00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:30.010
being able to be free and open and,
and,

712
00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.520
and speak my own truth.

713
00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:37.260
So that's the thing I would relate to I think more than going to China actually.

714
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:41.880
Thank you.
Sure.
Thank you.
I'm just going back and forth because it makes sense.

715
00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:47.220
<v 0>Awesome.
Um,
so I think a lot about inequity.
It's very heavy topic.
Yes.</v>

716
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:49.290
I think a lot about inequity.
Um,

717
00:46:49.291 --> 00:46:53.520
in one thing I've been thinking a lot about is the importance of Asian Americans

718
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:57.150
need to leverage their privilege in order to stand in deep solidarity with other

719
00:46:57.151 --> 00:46:59.070
communities of color.
So black and brown communities.

720
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.650
And I know obviously there's a nuance in various industries,
you know,

721
00:47:01.651 --> 00:47:02.580
I think the tech industry,

722
00:47:02.581 --> 00:47:06.480
we're highly represented here and that looks different than other places.

723
00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:11.370
But I wanted to hear a little bit more from you around how you think about Asian

724
00:47:11.371 --> 00:47:15.360
Americans building that solidarity with other communities of Color in the

725
00:47:15.361 --> 00:47:18.090
entertainment industry and what you see happening on that front.

726
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:22.610
<v 2>It's a such a wide reaching far reaching industry,
right?</v>

727
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:25.670
You have Hollywood and here we are.

728
00:47:25.671 --> 00:47:29.260
I'm working at an an regional theater and the regional theater has its own

729
00:47:29.261 --> 00:47:34.261
agenda and aspirations for community building and for community fundraising and

730
00:47:35.441 --> 00:47:40.150
all of that stuff.
And they're different.
I think the,
the,
the,
the wider,

731
00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:41.213
um,

732
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:46.560
Hollywood industry is driven by a kind of bottom line kind of thing that makes

733
00:47:48.791 --> 00:47:52.780
it really hard for,
um,
this,
these,
this needle to shift.

734
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:56.620
And I don't know if actually this,
this might be a similar kind of tangent,

735
00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:01.920
but what your question is reminding me of is my own baggage about fundraising.

736
00:48:03.821 --> 00:48:06.630
Like,
for example,
when I'm,
I'm pushing up the mountain,

737
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:11.500
several of my own projects,
I've co written a musical that I'm trying to,

738
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:16.360
uh,
to,
to continue to develop.
And I have say,
uh,

739
00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:19.630
several,
uh,
several other projects,
a lot of theater projects,

740
00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:24.010
and I find myself,
uh,
um,

741
00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:27.820
one of them is one that our friend is,
has been involved in who,

742
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:32.060
a mutual friend who,
which is a very diverse cast of,

743
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:36.490
of actors and other projects are Asian American projects.

744
00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:42.060
And I find myself trying to edit myself when it comes to whose money I'm going

745
00:48:42.131 --> 00:48:43.930
after.
Like I,
I found like,
oh,

746
00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.100
you can't ask an Asian American person to help me find that the diverse project

747
00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:52.090
you should really be getting to Asian American person to fund the Asian American

748
00:48:52.091 --> 00:48:54.430
project.
But I think,
well,
wait a second though,

749
00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:56.980
but I'm the Asian American making this project,

750
00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:02.250
will that be enough for them to support me to help move the needle in that way?

751
00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:07.990
Because my work as a,
as a writer will be,
uh,

752
00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.800
put on the map and then,
um,

753
00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:15.130
I will be able to have the credibility to create more and more content.

754
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:16.690
And is it,
as it turns out,

755
00:49:16.691 --> 00:49:20.350
this particular diverse project ends up having a lot of Asian people in it,

756
00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.320
but it's not an Asian project.

757
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:28.530
And so is there a kind of what I'm saying is that I perceive there to be some

758
00:49:28.601 --> 00:49:31.350
kind of invisible,
um,

759
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:35.620
limit to the amount of support I can get from the Asian American community,

760
00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:38.440
like from Asian people that have money,
I think,
oh,

761
00:49:38.441 --> 00:49:42.070
I have to be really careful about who I ask money for and what it's for.
Bail.

762
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.510
They'll want me to just,

763
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:48.160
they'll want me to just do all Asian content I think.

764
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:52.050
And so that's interesting because I guess when I,
as I'm repeating it,

765
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:56.530
I'm an Asian American artist and that's the,
um,
the content that I'm generating.

766
00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:58.990
But I know that doesn't really specifically answer your question.

767
00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:04.260
I'm also just me and I don't really understand or know what's going on out there

768
00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:09.100
necessarily about the connections between different groups.

769
00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.130
And how,
um,
you know,

770
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:16.960
Ken savage who was up here before,
um,
no.

771
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:18.580
Was He up here yet?
No,
he wasn't a pure yet.

772
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:23.210
Ken Savage who works at act and brought me here today is,
um,

773
00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:24.490
with talking about how,

774
00:50:24.491 --> 00:50:27.830
hey ha he has been in this building before because he also did a Google talk

775
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:32.650
with the,
um,
uh,
the black Google live groups.
Yeah,

776
00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:36.920
yeah,
yeah.
And,
and so that shows you that,

777
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:42.190
that kind of accessing the different groups within the theater,

778
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:48.370
the theater,
the theater is an active thing that's happening.
Um,
uh,

779
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:52.610
but I think you're absolutely right.
That's kind of solidarity is really helpful.

780
00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:56.450
I think everybody has their own kind of agenda and their own kind of unique

781
00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:01.190
challenges and that sometimes makes things difficult as you can imagine.
Yeah.

782
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:06.830
<v 0>Thank you so much for questions.
Sure.
We are out of time.
Really.
Yeah,</v>

783
00:51:06.831 --> 00:51:10.640
I know.
It's been so much fun.
I'm sorry for those who couldn't ask the questions.

784
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:14.450
Um,
but,
but I just want to thank you so much for being here today,

785
00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.840
and for those who don't have,
please go watch a show.
It's running at AACT.

786
00:51:17.841 --> 00:51:21.650
Gary stage the great leap until March 31st so thank you again.

787
00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:22.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>
