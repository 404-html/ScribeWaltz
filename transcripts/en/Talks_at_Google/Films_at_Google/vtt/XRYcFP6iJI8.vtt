1
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.583
Yeah.

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.600
<v 1>[inaudible] everyone.
Welcome to toxic Google.
I'm Kevin Valic.</v>

3
00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:11.740
And today you guys know the two from the hit show on comedy central key and

4
00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:16.340
Peele.
And they have their new film coming out on April 29th.
Kiana Keegan.

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.820
Hi Guys.
How are you doing?
Alright,

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.360
happy faces.
This is cool.
So good working environment.

7
00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:28.660
Not nary a suit to be found.
I love.

8
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.940
So welcome.
So tell me about [inaudible].
Tell us about the film.

9
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.480
<v 3>Okay,
so Keanu is,
it is a film,
a script,</v>

10
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.440
a film from a script.

11
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.210
<v 1>This is very rudimentary.
The way I'm going to be through this process.</v>

12
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.900
You write characters using words,

13
00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:52.060
there's words in the English language is on the,

14
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.360
<v 3>okay.
So a,
a key and Peele writer named Alex Rubens and myself,</v>

15
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.050
uh,

16
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.050
wrote this a few years ago with the idea that at some point someone would come

17
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:07.640
ask you for a key and Peele movie.
Um,
so we wrote,
uh,
the,

18
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.160
the most fun movie we could think of.
And it is this movie that,
uh,

19
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.820
we were originally inspired by like three Amigos and raising Arizona and uh,

20
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.280
uh,
uh,

21
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.890
true romance Zelman Louise Movies that had this heart that takes us through it

22
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.330
and putting our characters,

23
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.220
Keegan and my characters in this fish out of water scenario,
this,

24
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.850
this world of high stakes crime.

25
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.590
But we wanted to give them a reason that would,
uh,

26
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.770
ground this journey and make it,
make it feel real.

27
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.040
So we put a kitten with a do rag on as the centerpiece of the,

28
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:50.010
of the movie.
And eventually somebody caught on that this would be a good idea.

29
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:52.740
And it was new line cinemas and Warner brothers made the film for us.

30
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.250
<v 1>Was the idea always to involve a cat?
It's,
it's,
it's,</v>

31
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.440
we've a lot of people that obviously I've just seen the trailer,

32
00:01:59.441 --> 00:02:02.950
but it's absolutely ridiculous.
And did it always involve a cat where is like,

33
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:04.360
let's make a comedy action movie?

34
00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:06.880
Or what was kind of the genesis of that was actually the second one.

35
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.380
We wrote a draft of the script

36
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.460
<v 3>but didn't have the kitten in it and then we realized,
you know what we,</v>

37
00:02:12.461 --> 00:02:17.170
I know we are the two most biggest box office draws of all time.

38
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.460
<v 1>You do amazing business in Europe and Israel.</v>

39
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.080
Say this goes to somewhere like Thailand where maybe the people don't know us as

40
00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:30.730
well.
Put the cat in the poster,
boom,
boom,
signed,
sealed,
delivered.

41
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.110
We didn't expect that the kitten poster would just be,
it would be here as well.

42
00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:36.040
We thought maybe we would.

43
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.090
Maybe we'd be on the poster maybe here in the states the case.

44
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.810
But I mean you can't really lose with a kitten named Keanu.
I mean,
you know,

45
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.380
just walking down the street and I wrote me.
He was like,
I knew,

46
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.190
you know what I mean?
So it was a kid,
the movie a good to go see this movie.
Yes.

47
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.430
This black people in the tomb.
We,

48
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.090
I had read that you actually didn't know about that.

49
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.070
He was actually working on the,
I didn't,

50
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.140
<v 4>I was at work one day and he just,
he,</v>

51
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:04.450
we were just at work and he came up and said,

52
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.130
I've been working on this thing with Alex and,
and know he,
he,

53
00:03:07.131 --> 00:03:10.690
he's such a prolific writer.
I was like,
you know,
I was like,
oh,
that's good.
Good,

54
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.880
good for you.
And he's like,
no,
it's kind of pretty much a movie.

55
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.720
It's a key and Peele movie for us.
And I was,
I was like,
oh,
he's like,

56
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.670
w w was going to do a table read on Friday.
And it was like,
Gee,

57
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.750
do you want me to be there?
And he's like,
yes.
Yeah.
Keegan,

58
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:26.870
I wrote a character for you.
It's a key and Peele movie.
And,

59
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.580
and I think that first draft that we read,
the draft I read,

60
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:33.820
we read at that table read,
didn't have the kitten in it.
Right.
That sounds right.

61
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:35.620
That was the first,
yeah,
that very first draft.
Yeah.

62
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.330
And it made it more having the kit and also they make kills about six birds with

63
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:42.940
one.
It's like a neutron bomb.
It kills about six birds with one stone,

64
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.180
which is a pretty weak neutron bomb,
but just,
just so,
but that's,

65
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.380
that's just stones.
Um,
this was a big,
that's just really just a big rock.

66
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.180
It's stone.
It's really not a lot of technology involved at all.
Um,
but um,

67
00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.070
so the,
the kitten also serves to go,
I mean,
pets.

68
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.060
Pets are so close to our hearts and pets are our members of our families.

69
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.770
So it helps,
it helps justify a lot of things in the movie.
These two guys,
what,

70
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.671
what propels them.

71
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:13.150
The trigger that gets them into this fish out of water situation is that we got

72
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:14.650
to save the life of this innocent animal.

73
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.633
<v 3>You know,</v>

74
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.040
you had talked about working with Alex Rubens and Peter Atencio and you guys

75
00:04:19.041 --> 00:04:21.680
have both worked with them pretty much all the way through with key and Peele.

76
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.060
So were they really the only choice?

77
00:04:23.061 --> 00:04:27.830
Like you're directing it and you're writing it was that,
you know,
we,
the,

78
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.280
the writing of it started more of a passion project.
Let's see what,

79
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:35.360
let's see if we can make our,
our favorite key and Peele movie.

80
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.220
It was a SPEC script,
right.
There was commission.

81
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.340
They want to commission to write it.
Yeah.
It wasn't,
it wasn't,

82
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.700
it wasn't very official.
It was like,
hey,

83
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.210
we're kind of in this a position where we can sell a,

84
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.830
an actual movie at some point.
So that was,
that was that when we,
uh,

85
00:04:51.831 --> 00:04:55.670
when they,
they decided they were going to make the movie,
um,

86
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.730
Peter was absolutely our first choice.
Uh,
we,

87
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.720
we've developed a real rapport with him and,

88
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:06.721
and he knows when to push us further and he knows how to rope us back in.

89
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.870
And he's also a master of genre.
I mean,
obviously if you look at our sketch show,

90
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.610
he's covered.
He,

91
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.170
he's done a short film in every genre of film imaginable.

92
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.600
And this in a,
in a,

93
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.990
in a way this is a genre film in that we wanted to point to some of those movies

94
00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:25.050
we were talking about that,

95
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.060
that kind of early to mid nineties action comedy with substance in Heart where,

96
00:05:31.341 --> 00:05:36.170
uh,
where the bullets hurt,
where the bullets are real,
let's Keagan says.
Um,

97
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.940
so,
uh,
yeah,
you have a lot of references like boondock saints and heat and

98
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:42.790
<v 4>yeah,
and I mean,
yeah and,</v>

99
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:46.400
and to like things like boondock saints and reservoir dogs,

100
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.900
but then also more commercial stuff like speed and the movies that and movies

101
00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:55.040
that hearkened to,
and even an earlier time like,
like Beverly Hills Cop,

102
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.050
it's the same thing.
Like the violence has to be

103
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.070
<v 1>and you're still laughing hysterically and the,
and,</v>

104
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.290
and nowadays what we just call that is,
is being,
is being grounded.

105
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.540
So it's just like keep it as grounded as possible.
I mean,

106
00:06:06.541 --> 00:06:08.300
it's the most ridiculous thing you've ever heard of.

107
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.320
So let's try to keep it as real,
as had the acting,
be as real,
have the violence,

108
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:14.870
be as real as it can be.
And you guys have talked about,
you know,

109
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.230
where the name Caddo has come from and there's an obvious reference to it.

110
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.300
I mean,
we know who it's about.
Well,
I mean,

111
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:23.330
we know where the name came from galleries,
but it,
was there anything,

112
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.150
was there ever a different name for the film or for the cat?

113
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.810
There was a point where we talked about early on we talked about,
uh,

114
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.680
the title new New Jack Kitty.

115
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.510
<v 3>Well Guy,
one guy grown back there and that's,
that's all we need.</v>

116
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.410
That's one reason we just need one black guy to grown for validate is never

117
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:50.300
going to be the name of the movie.
Um,
but,
uh,
no,
as soon as we came up with the,

118
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.220
that the kittens name was Keanu,
it was that,
it was clear.

119
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.710
Keanu,
we,
we,

120
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.720
we love the idea of giving the audience a taste and having their imagination go,

121
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:06.650
what the fuck was this Keanu business?
And,
and,
and hopefully that,
you know,
that,

122
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:08.210
uh,
people would,

123
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.140
there would be this word of mouth in this discussion that would help people

124
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:15.530
answer the question.
You know,
what's this Kiana movie?

125
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:17.750
That's the key and Peele movie,
who's can peel?
Oh,

126
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:19.700
well you don't know key and Peele will shit.
Look,

127
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:23.750
this is fucking substitute teacher,
you know,
so this,

128
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.850
the word of mouth would kind of help be a discussion.
Just like,
you know,

129
00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:30.290
our sketches.
One of the great,

130
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.930
the great things about getting to work on our show.

131
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.340
It's this time where our ski,
you know,
we,

132
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.010
we make the perfect size comedy for the,

133
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:44.880
the era that we're,
we're,
we're making content for,
um,
where,

134
00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:48.740
where people can share,
literally share our bits with each other.

135
00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:52.460
And so the,
the,
the fan base of key and Peele is really,

136
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:56.270
one is a familial fan base.
You ought,
we always hear,
Yo,

137
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.530
my brother turned me onto your show and now he's not give it to my dad.

138
00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:03.080
And my dad's now a fan.
And there's always this line

139
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.960
<v 1>of,
uh,
uh,
of love that kind of comes with our fan ship.</v>

140
00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:10.970
So it's really awesome.
And can you talk about your beginnings of,
you know,

141
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.760
starting the way back from that TV and,
and keep you,
what made this work?

142
00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:17.970
Like what made you guys say gout?
You're my writing partner.

143
00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:21.270
Like I get like we get each other.
What was that?
What clicked?
Well,
all of it.

144
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.370
We met in Chicago in 2003 and m and a mutual friend of ours who was a member of

145
00:08:28.171 --> 00:08:32.370
the writing staff,
it can appeal.
She,
she said you guys have to meet each other.

146
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.630
You guys raised in similar situations,
come from similar backgrounds,

147
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.200
see comedy in a very similar way.
And she made sure that we met.

148
00:08:40.201 --> 00:08:41.910
And just serendipitously,

149
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:46.230
Jordan's Jordan was working at a theater in Amsterdam and English speaking,

150
00:08:46.231 --> 00:08:50.730
Improv Comedy Theater in Amsterdam like you do.
And,
and they,

151
00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:52.680
and they came to the states to visit us.

152
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.280
And so he was performing at the second city when I was,
and that's how we met.

153
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.300
But so really what it comes down to is that our training is the same.

154
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:01.920
Our training comes from the same place.

155
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.750
So we were speaking a similar language before,
before we even met.

156
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.050
So then we met and you,
so you add those two elements together,

157
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:13.200
having similar backgrounds,
similar point of views on the world.
It does,

158
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:17.370
it means something to be biracial in the world because you become this kind of

159
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:21.930
racial referee and you're looking at the world sometimes very subjectively,

160
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.700
but sometimes very objectively.

161
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.140
And that is what fed the,

162
00:09:27.141 --> 00:09:32.141
the partnership is having the same nomenclature about how we do process or how

163
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:36.220
we do comedy.
That's the process of how we do comedy and,

164
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.290
and then also having a similar worldview.

165
00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.170
So what influences did you guys have growing up and saying,
you know,

166
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.070
establishing your brand of humor and sense of comedy and you know,

167
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.050
that a lot of it is,
um,
uh,

168
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.300
we're both big fans of in living color.
And that's been a touchstone for us,

169
00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:58.260
that television show,
which,
uh,
in a way have changed our lives comedically.

170
00:09:58.261 --> 00:09:59.094
And the people that were,

171
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.150
was doing the comedy was amazing to see faces that look like our faces.

172
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.500
But in the midst of that,
another ingredient in the stew is,

173
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.260
I grew up in Detroit,
very close to Canada,

174
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.940
so I used to watch lots and lots and lots of British comedy and Jordan's very,

175
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.830
very well versed and enjoys British comedy.
So that,
that's in our comedy too.

176
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.970
But then also there are other other influences.
It's,
you know,

177
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.290
we would be disingenuous to say that we're not standing on the shoulders of Dave

178
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.540
Chapelle because to watch him,
it's like,
ah,
there it is.

179
00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:32.610
That's what we're going for a little,
you know,

180
00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:37.230
something in that solar system right there.
But on top of it,

181
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.930
you know,
Jordan's,
um,
what I've always loved is that you're a big fan of,

182
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.630
of Martin and I would love it if you'd just explain why you like Martin Lawrence

183
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:46.230
so much

184
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.390
<v 3>are both why he,
why he likes Martin Lawrence.</v>

185
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.710
I like Martin Lawrence doesn't to say you don't like to say I don't like him.
Um,

186
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.001
you know,

187
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:59.001
I wa I was right at that perfect age for def comedy jam and a,

188
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:03.180
um,
from Martin to come out.
What I loved about him.
He was,

189
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.730
he the,
the character that he played,
Martin Payne on his show was so flawed.

190
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.830
And I love playing flawed characters.
I love this idea.
It was kind of a,

191
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.870
it was kind of a new idea.
You know,
I grew up with Eddie Murphy of course,

192
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:22.710
and Eddie Murphy is like,
he is the guy who can get away with anything.

193
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.230
He's Eddie Murphy is bugs bunny.
He's the books on his back.
He never gets,

194
00:11:27.231 --> 00:11:30.120
he never loses.
And he's always on top of the game.

195
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:33.770
And Martin Lawrence was,
he,

196
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:38.930
he was daffy duck who was always my favorite cause that's the guy who you know,

197
00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:44.370
is,
has been put through it in trouble.
And,
uh,

198
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.900
the guy who brings about his own demise and humiliation.

199
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.620
And so I love the way that Martin as an African American,
uh,
played,

200
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:58.720
uh,
played that comedic archetype.
And it was,
it was this high status,
low,

201
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.490
low status that he would get what he deserved.
And,
uh,

202
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.480
he did it the whole time.
You love the character even though he's flawed.
And,
uh,

203
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.523
so yeah,

204
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.920
<v 1>Martin and,
and you know,
and then in the same realm,</v>

205
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.170
people like Richard Pryor,

206
00:12:15.171 --> 00:12:20.060
Richard Pryor had no qualms about being the one who lost or no qualms about

207
00:12:20.061 --> 00:12:22.880
telling stories about his life.
You know,
most people,
if most people,

208
00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:27.200
most people who were raised in a whorehouse are probably not going to make that

209
00:12:27.201 --> 00:12:29.540
be the front and center thing they're going to talk about and the comedy or,

210
00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:34.070
or their life or ever mentioned to anybody ever.
Yet it was a big part of his,
uh,

211
00:12:34.071 --> 00:12:34.491
of,

212
00:12:34.491 --> 00:12:38.830
of what he did on stage and what he did in his life and what his work ethic was

213
00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:42.450
in his worldview was.
But,
uh,
Richard Pryor,
it might,

214
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:47.500
to me the perfect comedic monster comedic machine is a cross between the actor

215
00:12:48.171 --> 00:12:52.580
Peter Sellers and Richard Pryor.
If you mix them together,

216
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.130
that would be it.
But I mean,
all,

217
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:58.700
all the British stuff to Fawlty towers and Monte Python and you know,
uh,

218
00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.970
Mitchell and Webb,
we just,
yeah.
Right.
So once you get the set,
you know,

219
00:13:01.971 --> 00:13:06.500
for county,
was there a lot of room for obviously this library for like Improv,

220
00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:10.130
like how did scenes shaped do multiple takes of the same thing with different

221
00:13:10.131 --> 00:13:13.580
things,
trying different things and oh I have this idea for this.
Yeah,
that's,

222
00:13:13.581 --> 00:13:17.940
that's where the experience we,
we've developed on our sh uh,

223
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:22.760
we had and the style we developed on our show came in handy and that,

224
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:27.770
that a shorthand with Peter,
uh,
because yeah,
that's exactly how we would do it.

225
00:13:27.771 --> 00:13:31.940
We would do it any scene three or four or five times.

226
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.930
Once we have it,
you know,
uh,

227
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.210
in a sort of standard pass on it.

228
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:43.450
Then we go crazy for three and then we do one call a five k,

229
00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.300
which means we just going for it and it's just,
Oh,
just do a fun run.

230
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.080
It's a fun one for us.
Can we have one for us,
Peter?

231
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:56.600
<v 3>And he'd go,
ah,
no guys,
is it going to be 12 minutes long?
I said,
well,</v>

232
00:13:56.601 --> 00:13:59.410
my friend,
yes it will.
And a

233
00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:05.550
12 minute takes guys,
why are turned into margin on it?

234
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:11.330
Check,
check,
check,
check,
check.
One,
two,
one,

235
00:14:11.331 --> 00:14:16.010
two.
Um,
but the,
the thing that we've,
we found,
uh,
on a,

236
00:14:16.011 --> 00:14:21.011
on our show is that whenever we're like on the cusp of laughing or breaking

237
00:14:21.981 --> 00:14:22.814
ourselves,

238
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.260
like those moments leading up to that are gold and the audience doesn't even

239
00:14:27.261 --> 00:14:30.470
necessarily know they went on,
not conscious to it to break,

240
00:14:30.471 --> 00:14:32.540
but you can just tell when we're having fun,

241
00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.370
when we're sending each other a little off balance.
So we were,

242
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.270
we try and get into that world.
Was there,

243
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.780
what was the hardest thing to shoot for you guys or the hardest thing to get

244
00:14:41.781 --> 00:14:46.430
right?
You know,
a lot of that,
a lot of action.
I mean the,

245
00:14:46.431 --> 00:14:50.420
it was very hot.
We were in New Orleans in the summer.
Whole thing was very hot.

246
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.210
Um,
there,

247
00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.070
<v 1>the,
the scene he's talking about,
we're,
we're in.
That was hair.</v>

248
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.500
That might've been the toughest scene for some reason.
Yeah.
I mean,

249
00:14:57.501 --> 00:15:00.020
we were there for,
I'm sure it was like a 12,

250
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:05.510
13 hour day and just literally the exhaustion of being tied up and,

251
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.690
and playing exhausted,
playing hurt and drained

252
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.060
<v 4>and screaming and screaming and just screaming,
screaming,
screaming,
screaming.</v>

253
00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:14.950
Yeah.
Every take Peter sometimes

254
00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.540
<v 1>a little bit more,
you know what I mean?
You know,
you know,
so yeah.
That was it.</v>

255
00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.420
Gotcha.
We're going to start taking audience questions.

256
00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:26.070
If you guys wanna start lining up at the mic.
Um,
you know what,

257
00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.920
you guys spent so many years on,
on key and Peele and it was awesome.
Um,

258
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.330
so what did you guys learn most from that show that you were able,

259
00:15:34.331 --> 00:15:36.520
cause you did obviously mostly like sketch comedy,

260
00:15:36.521 --> 00:15:39.220
so it's taking those little bits and now you're explaining it to a full feature

261
00:15:39.221 --> 00:15:40.270
film.
So what were you,

262
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.780
what'd you learn from there that you're able to use in your feature length film?

263
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.550
Oh,
I was just going to say that,
you know,

264
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.440
any given scene in the movie has to have a beginning,
a middle,
an end.

265
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:55.620
And we had been doing all of these small,
tiny movies.
But the,

266
00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:58.210
the,
so that,
that's what you,
that's what you can,

267
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:02.260
that's what you can glean from the shorter form.
The short form allows you to go,

268
00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:04.150
well,
every scene should have a purpose.

269
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.360
Clearly there has to be a thread through the film and every scene has to have a

270
00:16:07.361 --> 00:16:11.320
purpose serving the one story.
But then it also,

271
00:16:11.321 --> 00:16:14.380
I think naturally makes you make,
every scene has a beginning,

272
00:16:14.381 --> 00:16:16.530
middle and end so that the scenes are just going to go,

273
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.570
you're at the end and you move on to the next scene and you lose momentum.

274
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.830
And I'd like to think that we've manufactured a film where the momentum keeps

275
00:16:23.831 --> 00:16:26.440
building and building and building and building until it gets to its,

276
00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:30.640
it's proper climax.
Gotcha.
And is there anything kind of in TV or film or,

277
00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.600
or Broadway or whatever that you guys haven't done that you guys want to do?

278
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.630
Like what's next for you guys?
What do you guys,
um,
you know,

279
00:16:37.631 --> 00:16:39.940
we're all sorts of different things.
I mean,

280
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.670
I'm a I d I just directed a movie.

281
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.180
I directed a horror film called get out that I'm very excited about.

282
00:16:46.181 --> 00:16:50.320
I'm editing it right now and I love writing,
directing,
so I'll

283
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:52.803
take it.

284
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.440
<v 4>Oh No,
it didn't come and come 10 at Tom's going to hurt later.
That's going to,</v>

285
00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.340
yeah,
that's going to catch on.
It's going to jump on your back at 3:00 AM.

286
00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:07.260
That is going to be a really sloppy farming.
That's going to be,

287
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.420
that's how the by biology,
human biology works.

288
00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.320
When you have a sneeze and it doesn't come later,
it's a fart.

289
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.940
So if it doesn't come out immediately it becomes a butt fart.

290
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:23.830
That's how it happened.
I mean,
uh,
but sneeze,
that's uh,
that's redundant.

291
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:26.650
I

292
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.900
had it all teed up.
My head butts niece knows at Google,
but fucks

293
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.750
more of this,
more of what I'm doing right now.

294
00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:42.760
I'm more of these is what I want to do in my future.
Um,
no,
I,

295
00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:46.200
<v 1>I um,
I'm going to be doing a lot of theater,</v>

296
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:48.900
a lot more theater in the future and a lot of classical theater.

297
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.320
That's my training.
Um,

298
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.020
<v 4>my entire career has pretty much been a 19 year detour from,</v>

299
00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:00.600
from checkoff.
So,
which is what my plan was to do for the rest of my life.
Um,

300
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:03.630
so a lot more theater and a lot of the projects that are coming my way now that

301
00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:07.500
I'm working around and picking our are dramatic projects.
It's lots of drama.
So,

302
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.180
yeah.
Awesome.
Hi there.
Thanks.
Thanks for coming.
This was fantastic.

303
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:14.040
Thanks for wearing those bitch and shorts.
It's what I have to say.

304
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:14.953
<v 5>Got It.</v>

305
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.120
<v 4>Be as bro Ish as I possibly can.
So I think I'm succeeding.</v>

306
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.440
And also thank you for liking Mitchell.
Um,

307
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.780
like he was David Mitchell and Robert Webb.
No one ever likes that.

308
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.530
Love Mitchell and Webb.
Mitchell and Webb.
Yeah.
Um,
I was wondering,

309
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:35.970
is there something that you like or dislike about like TV versus movie and vice

310
00:18:35.971 --> 00:18:40.130
versa?
You know,
both as

311
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:45.190
<v 3>actors,
there's a lot of waiting around and both,
which is,</v>

312
00:18:45.191 --> 00:18:49.190
you know,
sounds like a dream job in a way,
but there's this,

313
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.960
those strange stress involved.
Um,
the,

314
00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.620
because
because you're,

315
00:18:56.621 --> 00:19:01.130
you're putting yourself out there on the line and you're doing it with a,

316
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.890
in this collaborative process and if things go great,
you,

317
00:19:04.891 --> 00:19:09.490
you get to celebrate it.
If they don't,
you're the face of the disaster.

318
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:15.070
Um,
so I,
that's present in both things.

319
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:19.810
I think the big difference obviously with,
with a film then,
then our show is,

320
00:19:19.811 --> 00:19:23.440
it's like,
you know,
were in there for two months and then,
uh,

321
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:27.960
and then we're out and it's done.
And it was this isolated thing.
So I,

322
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.130
I prefer,
I think we both prefer the film pace at this point.

323
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.180
<v 4>I know.
Yeah.
I mean the,
the,
the,
the advantage of that television,</v>

324
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.350
I agree with him,

325
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.490
but the advantage some will tell you from an actor's point of view that

326
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.690
television has,

327
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:47.760
is that you can explore a singular character for longer.

328
00:19:47.761 --> 00:19:51.540
If you're doing a long form narrative,
it would be a wonderful thing.
It was,

329
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.190
it was a wonderful thing for Bryan Cranston to be able to be Walter White for

330
00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:57.180
all of that time.

331
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.320
And for him and Vince and the rest of the creative team on that show,

332
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:06.090
to let Walter grow in different ways and show different facets of his being.

333
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.300
Because when you have a 57 hour movie,

334
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.030
you're just going to have more chance to show,

335
00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.000
to show different facets of a human then,
then you can in a movie,

336
00:20:15.001 --> 00:20:19.040
which is why I think movies are harder to write too.
Um,
so I'm just,

337
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.830
that's my one little,
that's my pro for television over cinema.
But,

338
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.560
but you're right in regard to Payson and work,

339
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.020
you just kind of give it your all and it's,
it's,

340
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.410
it comes across as if it's a shortened the sports season.

341
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.600
So you give 110% and then,
and then you're done.
Thank you.
Thank you.

342
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:37.703
Thank you.

343
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:44.020
<v 5>Um,
I'm a boy fan.
Are you now?
I would've never guessed that.</v>

344
00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:48.130
Really.
I've been waiting for a long time.
Um,
I was

345
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.870
<v 3>wondering,
can you talk about the casting process for Keanu?
Yeah,
we,
you know,</v>

346
00:20:52.871 --> 00:20:57.860
we,
we did it.
Old School.
We had auditions and a lot of catnip,

347
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:03.400
catnip.
Um,
we,
uh,
as far as the actual cats,

348
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:08.430
there were three types of cats and we knew we were in for the whole litter when

349
00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:13.750
we,
when we picked them.
Um,
we went with the smoky gray,

350
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:17.970
smoky gray over the Tuxedo family.
We were going for a dog short,

351
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:22.000
black hair Tuxedo,
but we didn't pick him as far as Rhonda Clia.
Ironically,

352
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.670
as far as the,
the actors go,
I mean,

353
00:21:24.671 --> 00:21:27.880
method man came in and audition for this movie.
Like,
I mean,

354
00:21:27.881 --> 00:21:32.710
you can imagine like,
you're like,
you know,

355
00:21:32.711 --> 00:21:35.550
like couple of years ago,
you write this movie like,
Eh,
I don't know,

356
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.810
maybe we'll get to do this someday.
He did.

357
00:21:37.811 --> 00:21:40.240
Method man comes in and goes to put down a script,

358
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.500
this improvise,
let's do it.
And He,
you know,

359
00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:49.180
he came in and we literally jumped up and we improvise,
man.

360
00:21:49.181 --> 00:21:51.910
And he's just,
he's holding it down and he's grounded.
He knows,

361
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:57.190
he knows all his lines enough to jump off and follow us if we're doing different

362
00:21:57.191 --> 00:22:00.190
than,
and he already had the role as far as I skins cern.
Right.

363
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.380
We never had the heart to what,
we were terrified

364
00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.820
to tell him that he did not need to audition.

365
00:22:05.821 --> 00:22:10.540
Did not say he's making all the way out here from New York

366
00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.400
flight was horrible.
He,
we really want to see what you bring to the table.

367
00:22:15.401 --> 00:22:20.190
Missing teeth
choices you make.
You call it methylamine colon cliff.

368
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.810
We call them we clam cliff.
Did you call him?
We didn't.
We didn't.

369
00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:29.830
He wanted to audition for it.
He,
he,
yeah,
he came in and uh,
we,

370
00:22:29.831 --> 00:22:33.010
the,
the moment we heard that he,
he wanted to audition,

371
00:22:33.011 --> 00:22:37.350
it was like beaming and he's here.
Oh really?
Okay.
Um,
so that was that,

372
00:22:37.351 --> 00:22:41.590
that was super cool.
And then we,
you know,
the,
the,
the gang and this movie,

373
00:22:41.591 --> 00:22:46.210
Tiffany Haddish,
Jason Mitchell,
uh,
Darrell,
Brit Brits,
Gibson,
tomorrow,

374
00:22:46.211 --> 00:22:51.040
neighbors,
our neighbors,
they all auditioned.
And uh,
you know,

375
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:55.300
each one of them brought this,
this ground.
There's this feeling of reality.

376
00:22:55.301 --> 00:22:58.510
They're kind of like a bad news bears of gangs,
you know,
it's like,

377
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.780
it's the blips,
it's the guys kicked out of the bloods and the crips.

378
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.550
And so there are a little bit,
they're kind of extreme characters,

379
00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:07.960
but at the same time they really,

380
00:23:07.961 --> 00:23:12.400
they ground the thing and make it believable when we're talking to these,

381
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.580
uh,
you know,
the street hardened criminals may,

382
00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.480
may make the situation believable.
So they were just,
I mean it's,

383
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:23.110
it's just such a talented ensemble will forte to who's just,
Oh yeah,

384
00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:25.300
we'll work today.
And he was,
he was kind of,
you know,

385
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.900
I think as soon as we started looking for people,
we went,
oh,

386
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:33.520
forte is Holka.
He is this character.
Yeah.
So that was,
uh,

387
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.890
that was a no brainer.
He was the easiest.

388
00:23:35.891 --> 00:23:39.100
He was done and then Nia long wanted to come and play.

389
00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:43.000
So that was also a dream come true.
Um,
just very,

390
00:23:43.001 --> 00:23:46.010
very surreal getting to put together this movie out

391
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.290
<v 4>of like,
people you've admired.</v>

392
00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.770
Like I just a mosaic of people that you admire or just opening up a box of

393
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:54.890
chocolates like,
oh,
that we'll have this one.
Yes.
Yeah,
it was great.

394
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:56.703
<v 6>Awesome.</v>

395
00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:01.090
So you guys have touched on this a lot about how building on other ideas is the

396
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.720
basis of escalation,
like the movie and also in the show.
Um,

397
00:24:04.721 --> 00:24:07.870
so as a new improviser it's really easy to trash talk and idea.

398
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.950
So I'm wondering how you build on an India without saying,
oh,
this idea is wrong.

399
00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:13.000
My ideas better.

400
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:14.600
<v 4>Um,
the,
the,
the,</v>

401
00:24:14.601 --> 00:24:19.580
the first thing to do is just always know that the rules,

402
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:22.840
the rules that were established had been established,

403
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.500
have been established for about 70 years.
Um,
when you go,
or even 80 years,

404
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:28.880
if you go back to Neva Boyd,
never,

405
00:24:28.881 --> 00:24:33.050
Boyd was Islah Spolan Zero and then you have Paul Sills and all the second city

406
00:24:33.051 --> 00:24:33.530
people.
And then,

407
00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:37.010
and then here we have the committee that was here in San Francisco.
So,

408
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:41.660
so you have to worship the rules above your ego.

409
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:45.380
And now there's a bunch of different techniques that human being can used to

410
00:24:45.381 --> 00:24:48.530
block ego.
Let,
we can't really go into and do right now.
But,

411
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.740
but that's the most important thing.
Most board things remember really,

412
00:24:51.741 --> 00:24:53.000
really brilliant.

413
00:24:53.001 --> 00:24:56.990
People have been doing this and going about it this way for such a long time.

414
00:24:56.991 --> 00:24:59.780
I mean,
he's like,
my big thing has always been like,
I don't like that idea.

415
00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.613
But then they go,

416
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:06.050
if it was good enough for Mike Nichols and Alan Arkin,

417
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:11.330
then I guess it's good enough for me.
It,
you know,
so it's because you never know.

418
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.890
You never know what's through that door if you don't open it.

419
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.980
So if their partner,
if your scene partner's shows you the door,

420
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:24.060
it's not only your job to open it,
it's your job to open it with verve and,
and,

421
00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.920
and,
and so that's the thing.
The thing is every mistakes,

422
00:25:27.921 --> 00:25:31.010
a gift and improvisation,
every mistakes,
a gift,

423
00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.580
every challenge is an opportunity.
So if you think of it that way,

424
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.190
then know that you're doing the art.
I hate to,

425
00:25:38.191 --> 00:25:40.700
I hate to make it sound scientific,
but you're doing the art correctly.

426
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.690
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
So don't,
don't worry about your idea.

427
00:25:44.691 --> 00:25:49.310
Might find its way into their idea.
If you just keep yes and yes.
Sandhya sand.

428
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.400
For those of you who don't know what improvisation is,

429
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:56.870
I've been speaking mandarin for the last two minutes,
but,
but these are,
you know,

430
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.970
but these are life skills,
so it's very,
yeah.
Thank you.

431
00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:06.730
Hey guys.
Hey.
Hey.
Question about Keanu.
Uh,

432
00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.310
when you pick you on you,
did you uh,

433
00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:13.080
did he prefer to be pit with the grain or against the green?

434
00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.130
<v 5>You ain't never met a cat.</v>

435
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.260
Oh Man.

436
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:26.130
<v 4>And the cat man.
Any cat?</v>

437
00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:32.280
<v 5>You got to go with the grant.
We got the one cat in the world.</v>

438
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.290
Talk about fuck my for up.

439
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.630
Toss it up.
Give me a little rush.

440
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.120
<v 4>No,
no.
Yeah,
we,
we had a bunch of kittens.
They're all,
they're all with grain.</v>

441
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.350
<v 5>You're all with grand.
Thank you.</v>

442
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.320
Great question.
Great question.

443
00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:09.980
<v 7>Hi.
Um,
thanks for coming.
I'm a huge fan since your days on mad TV.
Um,</v>

444
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:14.900
my question is about the movie title and when you guys were in the creation

445
00:27:14.901 --> 00:27:15.660
process,
uh,

446
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.890
did Kenny Reeves know that you guys are making it and did you guys talk to him?

447
00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.210
Do you have a certain reaction every day?

448
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.000
<v 5>Okay.</v>

449
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
<v 4>We just spoke to him right before you walked in here.
No,
he,
he,</v>

450
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:31.130
as far as we know,
he,
he's known about it for about a month,

451
00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.430
maybe a month and a half.
We,
the trailer since the trailer,

452
00:27:34.431 --> 00:27:35.900
when the red band trailer came out,

453
00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:40.730
his sister saw the trailer and then she sent him a link of the trailer and then

454
00:27:40.731 --> 00:27:42.440
Karen was like,
that's fantastic.

455
00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:48.220
<v 5>And then I,
and then I read an article,
I don't know,</v>

456
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.270
just say an article this morning.

457
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.350
<v 4>I read an article this morning that they said that somebody interviewed Keanu</v>

458
00:27:52.351 --> 00:27:55.560
about the move and you said a pair of these,
those guys are wacky.

459
00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:00.470
<v 5>Can you just can,
I can never even imagine him uttering the word Wacky,</v>

460
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.860
wacky,
and said it several times

461
00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.130
in this article.

462
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:11.550
<v 4>Like,
like it was like the packages that kind of wacky.</v>

463
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:17.070
I see.
Those guys are wacky.
Yeah.
Thank you.

464
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.880
Hey,
come on man.
It's the ultimate compliment.
Wacky.

465
00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:27.150
Hey,
um,
so love the anger translator sketches.

466
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:31.330
Uh,
I was just wondering,
for the White House press correspondence a dinner,

467
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:36.300
did you get the chance to practice with Obama for a very long time?

468
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:41.250
Ah,
yeah.
Well I think in his world,
10 minutes is a long time,
so yes,
yes,
I did.

469
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:43.770
I mean,
you know what I mean,
if given everything he has to do in a day.

470
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.980
So I was in the West Wing and,

471
00:28:45.981 --> 00:28:48.630
and was waiting in a room and the western called the map room,

472
00:28:48.631 --> 00:28:51.720
which is FDR is room.
And there was,
I was staring at this,

473
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:56.060
this framed map on the wall that FDR had made that,
uh,

474
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:59.490
about where the allied troops were going to land and all this kind of,

475
00:28:59.491 --> 00:29:01.530
if it was really amazing.
And then on the wall,

476
00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:06.480
just racks and racks and racks of maps from,
from the thirties back ad infinitum.

477
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:11.640
And um,
and then he just walks in and he's a very tactile guy.
And so he's just,

478
00:29:11.641 --> 00:29:13.890
you know,
you just kind of there and he's just on you.
Just this,

479
00:29:13.891 --> 00:29:15.730
like whenever he goes,
let's go,
hey,

480
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.350
<v 5>let's call him mister president.
And then you're just like,
I didn't hug him.</v>

481
00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:25.340
He did it.
No red dots please.
He ran up up in here.

482
00:29:25.341 --> 00:29:28.690
He just ran up on me in here,
rehearsed

483
00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.450
<v 4>and we rehearsed for about 10 minutes.
And then they,
uh,
and then they left and,</v>

484
00:29:33.451 --> 00:29:38.020
and you know,
and the first thing he said to me was,
was that you'll get,

485
00:29:38.021 --> 00:29:41.410
we're going to go through this now and you have to really,
you know,

486
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:44.500
gotta keep it together.
We've got to keep it together.
I was like,
yes sir.

487
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.190
Absolutely.
So he says his first line,
which is,
you know,

488
00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:50.890
so I thought that I would,
you know,
if you remember his first line of something,

489
00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:52.810
like I thought I would,
and he's reading off this script and he goes,

490
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.040
I thought I'd bring out my anger translator Luther.
And then my first line is,

491
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.150
hold on to your lily white.
But yeah,

492
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.230
we're two lines into the rehearsal.
And he goes,
oh

493
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.353
<v 5>right,</v>

494
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.990
<v 4>I got to keep it together.</v>

495
00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:17.110
<v 5>Yeah,
yeah.
Mother fucker.
You got to keep it together.
Your career is locked in.</v>

496
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:22.550
This could be the biggest day of my life.
Don't fuck it up,
you know?

497
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:25.020
Okay.

498
00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.020
<v 4>It was great.
No,
he was great.
What a amazing straight man.</v>

499
00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.600
<v 5>And,
and he was terrific</v>

500
00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:32.390
<v 4>because at the end he just was like,</v>

501
00:30:32.391 --> 00:30:34.610
the last thing he said to me before we finished the,

502
00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:38.270
the rehearsal was he just kept on asking about Jordan,

503
00:30:38.271 --> 00:30:40.730
which I thought was so sweet.
And he was just like,
yeah,

504
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.780
how's bill feel about it?
And I was so,
he was,

505
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:53.530
he was great and he just kept asking about him.
So it was,
it was terrific.

506
00:30:53.531 --> 00:30:56.980
He's really,
it's like you can't have a better fan,
you know,

507
00:30:56.981 --> 00:30:57.814
can have a better fan.
It's,

508
00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:02.710
and not about who he is in the world so much as a person that you were doing

509
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.410
homage to them and they know about it.
And then this,

510
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.660
this character gets to become,

511
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.650
I don't know that this has ever happened in the history of television that I

512
00:31:11.651 --> 00:31:13.540
don't even know how to articulate it correctly.

513
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:18.810
That a fictional character with a person doing in precision becomes a real tool

514
00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:23.560
in the real world.
It's,
it's,
it's,

515
00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:26.740
it's mind boggling because he used Luther,

516
00:31:26.741 --> 00:31:30.410
he literally used Luther cause he's like the campfire me,
fuck it.

517
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:35.500
<v 5>You know what I mean?
It's like,
it was amazing.
It was really quite amazing.
Yeah.</v>

518
00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.693
Cool.
Thank you.

519
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:37.823
<v 4>We can do these quick.</v>

520
00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:38.953
<v 5>Okay.</v>

521
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.670
<v 4>A,
um,
when you guys are writing,
I do you find that,
um,</v>

522
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:47.200
you cycled through hundreds of ideas until you go,
that's the one,

523
00:31:47.201 --> 00:31:48.730
that's what we're going with or is it,

524
00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:52.210
you have some that you're not sure about but you try it out and then saying and

525
00:31:52.211 --> 00:31:54.420
then eventually working into something that's really good.

526
00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:55.680
<v 5>Okay.</v>

527
00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.850
<v 3>We definitely overwrite,
we come up with a lot of premises.</v>

528
00:31:59.851 --> 00:32:04.470
We write a lot of drafts and uh,
so,
so that at the end of the day,

529
00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.380
you know,
when,
when,
when you get to that point where you're like,
oh man,

530
00:32:07.381 --> 00:32:09.870
we can only afford one more sketch and this episode,

531
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.840
<v 5>no,
as far as people,
you're welcome.
How's it knows smart.
Thank you.</v>

532
00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:22.853
<v 4>Woo.</v>

533
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:27.100
<v 5>Yes.
Sorry about that.</v>

534
00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:29.200
But yes,
to answer

535
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.260
<v 3>question,
we,
we write,
we write a ton and then,
uh,
we,
we,</v>

536
00:32:33.261 --> 00:32:34.650
we only pick the cream of the crop.

537
00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.990
Um,
I kittens and I've learned two things.
One,

538
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.090
they grow up extremely quickly and two,

539
00:32:44.091 --> 00:32:46.730
they have no sense for ever doing what you want.

540
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.630
Like were there moments where you regretted the choice of having a cat in the

541
00:32:50.631 --> 00:32:51.464
movie?

542
00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:58.170
<v 4>Absolutely.
And,
and,
and we had two sets of kittens.
We,
yeah,</v>

543
00:32:58.171 --> 00:33:01.470
one day literally reached into the thing with like Grossberg done,

544
00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:05.340
we're using teddy.
You know what I mean?
It was like,
yeah,

545
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.190
<v 3>eventually you have to figure out,</v>

546
00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.550
you have to figure out to tell the kitten to do something you don't want it to

547
00:33:10.551 --> 00:33:14.030
do.
And then,
then,
and only then will you get the shot.

548
00:33:14.031 --> 00:33:16.960
You were actually looking for.
But yeah,
very,
very tricky.
And,

549
00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:20.000
and you don't think about that.
You think it's just a prop.
It's another,

550
00:33:20.001 --> 00:33:21.830
it's another actor.
You have to be mindful of.

551
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.010
I don't gentlemen.
Hey,
how's it going?
What's happening?

552
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:33.370
Can you mentioned you about to do theater now or start moving towards that?

553
00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.850
Are there any artists that we need to look for a,

554
00:33:36.851 --> 00:33:40.390
that you're mentoring or any pro pro djs out there that we need to be able to

555
00:33:40.391 --> 00:33:43.720
look out for?
Anyone that's come to you and said,
hey,
look out for this guy.

556
00:33:43.721 --> 00:33:45.760
He's going to be the hint hint.

557
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.860
<v 5>I see what you did then.
Yeah.</v>

558
00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:55.310
<v 4>Do you want to knows big care?
Know this brother that I saw it</v>

559
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:56.283
<v 3>Google</v>

560
00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.630
<v 4>and he wasn't afraid to ask for what he wanted</v>

561
00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:08.920
to be nice cap had on a t shirt with a colloquialism mountain.

562
00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.250
Um,
it's something that I know Jordan,

563
00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.040
I have both been approached with our reps about is,

564
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:20.830
is curating or help curating and,
and mentoring other artists.
And,

565
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.100
um,
and so I'm kind of in the process of doing that now,
but it's,

566
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:25.240
we've been so busy,

567
00:34:25.241 --> 00:34:28.800
I've not had the time to dedicate to looking at people's work.
And,
um,

568
00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:31.760
there is a group of guys that I like a lot that are on comedy central that and

569
00:34:31.761 --> 00:34:35.380
Kumi central.com and they have a web series right now called um,
uh,
six guys,

570
00:34:35.381 --> 00:34:40.120
one car.
And it's amazing because they're African American sketch guys,

571
00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.640
but they're not trained at the upright citizens brigade.

572
00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:45.610
They're not trained at second city.
They're not treated Improv Olympic,

573
00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.540
but they have an aesthetic that's close to our training and I'm really

574
00:34:49.541 --> 00:34:53.350
fascinated by them.
And so I may or may not work with them in the future.

575
00:34:53.351 --> 00:34:57.780
I'm trying to figure out where I fit or how it can benefit them.
And um,
and,

576
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.630
and that,
is there something I,
that I really do want to do more in the future?

577
00:35:01.631 --> 00:35:04.900
It's,
it is,
it's near and dear to my heart.
And,
and it is to Jordan too.
It's,

578
00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.220
it's been a big thing for us to want to,

579
00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:11.980
to mentor a Young African Americans who want to get into improvisation.

580
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.140
<v 3>Thank you.
All right,
last question.</v>

581
00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:22.180
<v 4>Dang it.
I'm up there.
Come on.</v>

582
00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:24.330
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

583
00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.590
<v 4>You see crowd,
this is good.</v>

584
00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.340
As a very positive group.

585
00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:37.150
My own opinion on this boat,
which of you makes the better looking woman?

586
00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:43.290
It's Jordan.
100% well,
now you know it's,
look at these luscious lips.

587
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:47.730
It's debatable.
It's debatable.
I mean,
we have different assets.

588
00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:50.940
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

589
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.740
<v 4>Is it is.
Mine is here.</v>

590
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:58.110
Keegan's a figure is,
but I lacked curves.

591
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:02.950
I don't have child bearing years.
We can debate this all day,
but,
but you're,

592
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:06.150
you're a bit Meagan.
Seriously,

593
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:12.000
not seriously.
I am saying seriously.

594
00:36:12.001 --> 00:36:13.320
Shut your mouth

595
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.130
and I like Thai tea right now.

596
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.650
<v 5>Who are you going to get home?
Meagan?
Why?</v>

597
00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:27.840
You're going to walk through seven miles,
one foot in front of the other.

598
00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.530
How are you?
How are you going to get home?

599
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:35.590
I'm going to drive in this fucking automobile.
More power.
Tea.
Yeah.

600
00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:41.540
You were complaining about your shoes.
No.
Yes.
You were

601
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:49.290
wasting the Google People's time.
You're going to screw the status.
Gosh,

602
00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:53.920
you're going to get a question.
Alright sweetheart,
you agree with me,

603
00:36:53.921 --> 00:36:57.910
right,
right.
It's him.
But Hey,
you know what is him?
He's right.
He's right.

604
00:36:57.911 --> 00:37:01.660
That it's debatable.
It's debatable.
Debatable.
How was your opinion?

605
00:37:01.661 --> 00:37:04.930
Is that it was debatable.
You did start with,
I have an opinion.

606
00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:09.850
I know my definite opinion about this.
I'll either one.

607
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.810
I will unveil it at the end of this question.

608
00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:20.120
I was hoping for Megan.
All right,

609
00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:23.570
sorry my brother.
You know a lot of lot hottest shenanigans.
Yep.

610
00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:24.493
<v 4>At your expense.</v>

611
00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:29.270
Now I feel weird because I was going to ask a serious question and,
all right.
Uh,

612
00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.860
so you guys talk a lot about a race.

613
00:37:32.861 --> 00:37:35.530
It feels like that that's what a big part of what your comedy is about.

614
00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:40.540
That's what I really like about it.
Uh,
do you bring that to Kiana?

615
00:37:40.541 --> 00:37:44.680
Where are you trying to say let's focus more on just making a movie.

616
00:37:44.681 --> 00:37:47.650
That's like what you said before.
Just funny.

617
00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.600
Like this kind of style of,
this is a bad question.

618
00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.700
<v 5>No,
it's good.
It's not a bad question cause</v>

619
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.450
<v 4>I,
I will say this and this is something I think I've,</v>

620
00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:00.130
I haven't said in a while,

621
00:38:00.131 --> 00:38:05.131
but I do believe that it has validity if you have melanin in your skin.

622
00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:09.820
The movie's about race because we just don't live in a world.
That's it.

623
00:38:09.821 --> 00:38:12.280
That evolved yet.
You know what I mean?
Because I beat because our,

624
00:38:12.281 --> 00:38:15.010
I'm not going to do it.
I'm going to do it because our limb,

625
00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:17.170
because we still have a limbic system,

626
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:22.030
we're still categorizing because remember we remember when we had to categorize,

627
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:26.500
that's a saber tooth tiger.
That's a poisonous plant.
This is wheat.

628
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:31.390
And so the limbic system worked.
It was effective and now we use it.

629
00:38:31.391 --> 00:38:36.220
Now we use it for the wrong reasons.
You know,
we go,
that's different than me.

630
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:39.250
Must be bad.
And so until,

631
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:44.170
until we find a way to short circuit that fight or flight lizard brain part of

632
00:38:44.171 --> 00:38:47.020
us,
I think if you are a person of color,

633
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:52.300
it just is about race.
Whether you won.
Now in this film,

634
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:56.500
I do think we still,
we're deliberately sending up stereotypes,

635
00:38:56.590 --> 00:39:01.390
social and cultural stereotypes.
100% with consciousness.
Absolutely.

636
00:39:01.391 --> 00:39:05.200
Absolutely.
I mean,
this,
the satirical element of this,

637
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.840
of this movie is that,
you know,

638
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:11.200
we haven't seen guys like us as leads of a,
of a film.

639
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:16.500
And so part of that is asking the question about the stereotypes of black men of

640
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:21.580
Hispanic men have and women in,
in movies up until now.

641
00:39:21.581 --> 00:39:25.510
And what happens when we place ourselves in one of these heightened genres?

642
00:39:25.511 --> 00:39:29.250
And we're definitely lampooning the concept of machismo.
Yeah.

643
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.730
And then we'll be yes.
And what place it has in,
um,

644
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.460
African American culture and in just a culture of being a male.

645
00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:41.370
And Are you black if you don't display a lot of machismo?
Are you black?
Eh,

646
00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.970
how black are you if you,
you know,
it's that,
it's,
that's all being explored.
So,

647
00:39:45.971 --> 00:39:49.120
yeah.
Yeah.
Fantastic question.
Thank you.

648
00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:49.660
<v 5>Well done.</v>

649
00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:54.660
[inaudible].

650
00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:58.840
<v 4>Thank you guys so much for being here.
Kiano comes out April 29 to go see it.</v>

651
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.640
April 29.
Thank you guys.
Please.

652
00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.030
<v 5>That's it.</v>
