00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.820
Hello everyone.
Welcome to talk to Google on Kevin Bell

2
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.130
<v 1>today.</v>

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.530
We are very pleased to welcome Mr John Boyega from Star Wars episode seven,

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.380
<v 0>Force Awakens.</v>

5
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.380
[inaudible]

6
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.360
<v 1>oh good.
Oh,
fantastic.
I never do that,
I suppose.
No.</v>

7
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.670
So welcome.
Um,
huge movie.
Um,

8
00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:34.330
so we'll start off kind of with you in your beginning and your life.

9
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:36.340
You grew up in southeast London.
Yes.

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.110
And so you got involved with acting and stage work and uh,

11
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.370
then right into tap dancing,
dance.

12
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.303
<v 2>Drew.</v>

13
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.910
<v 1>So what drew a Jj and Kathleen Kennedy and Lawrence,
uh,</v>

14
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.620
for you for this role?
What,
what,
what was it?

15
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.970
<v 2>Um,
I mean it all started four years ago.</v>

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.650
I was going to say a long time ago in a galaxy,
but far away,

17
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.430
but I'm not going to do that.
Wait,
we're in a room full of nerds,
aren't we?
Oh,

18
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:05.720
I'm home.
Oh,
great.

19
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.420
I've met Jj at bad robot.
I went to me,
he's producing partner.
And then,
um,

20
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.270
as I was walking to go in and meet his producing partner,

21
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:19.740
I saw Tom Cruise and JJ Abrams just walk out of a room.
I was kind of like,
okay,

22
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:21.550
that's Tom Cruise.
Cool.
And then,
uh,

23
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.840
Jj walked up to me and just expressed how much he loved my first ever film a tap

24
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:31.690
the block.
And uh,
he said you guys watched it.
Oh yeah.

25
00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:35.590
Great.
And then he said that I love you in the movie.

26
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.460
One day I'll get you in something,
we'll just have to think of,

27
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.450
of what's of what's right.

28
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.040
And then four years later the opportunity came through for me.
By the way,

29
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:48.820
my agent is,
is,
is at the back.
You should probably give him a round of applause.

30
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.170
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

31
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.780
<v 2>I was released into a world of auditioning for the biggest role of my life.</v>

32
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.360
<v 1>Well,
I mean,
so you said it,
so you kind of were getting out.</v>

33
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:06.690
Jj Abrams is a huge kind of geeking out about star wars and stuff like that.

34
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:10.090
So what was it like working on set with him and just being on these iconic set

35
00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:12.870
someone up from the original trilogy and also some of the original characters?

36
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.280
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean I had no shame on a star wars set.
I still have no shame.</v>

37
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.410
This is the only time I'm going to experience star wars like this for the first

38
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:27.120
time.
Um,
and so for me,
I just,
I geeked out as much as I could.

39
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.630
I brought merchandise to set for various cost members to sign.

40
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.040
I did,
I took selfies like Harrison,
he wouldn't take it.
Take your selfie.

41
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.180
We're working together kid.
And it was,

42
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.060
it was nice to know just having that experience.

43
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.030
Uh,
but it's,
it's always nice.

44
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.020
I run around the Millennium Park and I had a fat burger right by the chest set

45
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:54.260
on the Millennium Falcon.
Like I,
you know,
I lived on that thing.

46
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.390
I had a good time.

47
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.290
<v 1>And so your character Finn is a,
we seem as a storm trooper.</v>

48
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:01.750
It's one of the first shots that we actually see in the teaser trailer when this

49
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:03.010
first came out.
Um,

50
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.320
and eventually you team up with these like Grizzly carrot characters,

51
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:09.040
ray Han solo BB eight.
So what can you tell us about,
that's not sport?
Like,

52
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:09.851
I know we can't do that,

53
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:13.900
but what can you tell us about your character in terms of just who fit is

54
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.420
personality wise?
Is he angry?
Is He sad?
Yeah.
Courageous.
What,
what,
what,

55
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.263
what is his character?

56
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.710
<v 2>Um,
it's been sweating.
Um,</v>

57
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.150
Finn Finn is a very interesting character as you know,
like the,
the clones,
uh,

58
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.980
before,
uh,
did not match up positive day five years that we've missed.

59
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.810
And so now storm troopers actually bred from birth their babies and Brett to

60
00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:40.560
fight,
uh,
uh,
from,
from a young,
a young age.
And Finn,

61
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.030
it was just one of the many storm troopers,
but something ignited in,
in,

62
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.170
in the young lad.
And he escapes the first order.

63
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.500
And then he ends up on Jack Hu and he finds the piece of full ray pay by Daisy

64
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.880
Ridley and,
uh,
the Bull Bba,
I call him the ball.
But yeah,

65
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.700
they'd BBA and they all go off on a,

66
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.530
an amazing adventure together in which they encounter you.
And the old,

67
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.450
that was my highest.
And again,
by the way.

68
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.950
<v 1>So what inspirations in terms of,
uh,</v>

69
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.910
actors or characters from previous movies where you kind of drawing from to

70
00:04:16.911 --> 00:04:17.744
develop them?

71
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.560
<v 2>Um,
it was so funny.
Uh,
my second to last audition,
which was a screen test,</v>

72
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.970
I was contemplating what it,

73
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.940
what it is to be fin and what it means to be,

74
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.480
be a character who is so unique and uh,
and charismatic and,

75
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:39.330
and somewhat awkward in this big universe who doesn't fit in.
Um,
and I,

76
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.860
I re I went on Youtube,
I should have said Google button.
Ama Cause Youtube.

77
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.970
All right,
where are we on them?
Oh,
you do?

78
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.933
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.050
<v 2>Yeah.
So I went on Youtube
and,</v>

80
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.013
um,

81
00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.570
there's a amazing video of Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill's original audition

82
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:03.790
tape.
You should see it off of this,
off of this talk.

83
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.740
And I watched it and I don't know what it is.
It's just star wars energy.

84
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.840
In a normal movie.
If your ship was on fire and you're about to die,
you know,

85
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:17.770
there'll be phone calls to the family,
tell them I love them.
Oh,
Kestrel music,

86
00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:22.210
boom,
the end install wars is like,
hit the lightspeed.
Woo.
I'm not,

87
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:26.950
for me it was like,
you know,
a great way of experience in [inaudible].

88
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.710
So I kind of embodied that in my audition.

89
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.120
<v 1>That's great.
Uh,
and so we're just,</v>

90
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.000
what's incredible about this movie and about just watching the trailers and just

91
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:35.870
get,
everyone's getting excited.

92
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.500
It's kind of the return of practical effects and practical sets and in real

93
00:05:39.501 --> 00:05:39.951
locations.

94
00:05:39.951 --> 00:05:44.060
So what were some of the most impressive sets or puppeteers or or puppets,

95
00:05:44.061 --> 00:05:46.250
I mean,
um,
or characters that you got to work with them?
Sure.

96
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.870
<v 2>For me it was the first time I went on set was in Abu Dhabi and Jack who was</v>

97
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:56.830
real,
like JJ is so dope.

98
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.230
He had the droids move in,

99
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.230
in between takes that makes it feel like Disneyland.
Like they actually,

100
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:05.240
they're like,
they exist.
I felt like a kid,

101
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:08.540
like those creatures would move and you know,
and I'm just there like,

102
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.740
well,
I wear a real planet.
This is the closest we're ever going to get to Iti.
Um,

103
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.140
and so it was amazing to see the practical effects puppetry and a metronics,

104
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.520
um,
or played a vital part.

105
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:25.820
And the CG is just an enhancement of what's already there.

106
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.720
So it's good to know that Jj went back to 1977

107
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.140
<v 1>there.
Was there a person on this stuff that you,
besides daisy,</v>

108
00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:34.510
who you really get along with the best and you really connected with?

109
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.090
<v 2>Harrison's my best friend.
Um,</v>

110
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.560
he wouldn't say exactly like that,
but that's what he means.
Well,

111
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.070
I mean we,
we,
we've had it,
we've had a really good bond.

112
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.370
I think one of the things I'm most excited for people to discover,

113
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.400
it's fin and Han Solo's relationship.

114
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.340
It's fin has no respect for him.

115
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.180
And in return the Han Solo is just,
you know,

116
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.490
like this snotty little kid that it's a great combination and the,
and,

117
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:05.330
and a great chemistry.

118
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:07.520
So Harrison is someone that I got to spend a lot of time with

119
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.250
<v 1>in Lawrence,
Kansas and came back to write the film.
Yes.</v>

120
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.080
He wrote empire strikes back and return of the Jedi.

121
00:07:13.081 --> 00:07:16.050
So what was it like kind of having,
was he,
was he there on set?

122
00:07:16.051 --> 00:07:19.200
Was He helping you with your character in star wars kind of folklore and stuff?

123
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.840
<v 2>Yeah,
absolutely.
I mean,
he collaborated with JJ a lot and he was on set to,</v>

124
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.090
to tweak the,
the scripts.
And you know,

125
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.690
what's great about Larry and in terms of weight in terms of the way he writes,

126
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:33.050
is that there is space for you to put your input into,
into the dialogue.

127
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.280
I think that specifically with me and daisy,

128
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.330
we had to create these characters from scratch.
And to have a right to the,
uh,

129
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.560
enables you to breathe in between the dialogue is great.

130
00:07:44.561 --> 00:07:48.850
So you can throw in some Improv,
um,
and it,
and it,
and it works out well.

131
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.900
<v 1>Is it daunting to,
cause you're kind of taking on,</v>

132
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.180
you're creating a brand new character in this universe.

133
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.590
So is that a little daunting for you as well?

134
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:59.550
<v 2>I mean,
June the auditions,
it was because it,
you,
you had I had,</v>

135
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.700
before I present to you in a few days,
I had to present it to Disney.

136
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:07.760
I had to present fin to JJ and I had to be,

137
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:11.990
it had to be approved to before come into you guys who are the ultimate judges.

138
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:15.650
You guys are the gods that decide whether a film does well or not.
Uh,

139
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.040
and you know,
that was the time when I was kind of like this,

140
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.730
this could either be really bad or I can work hard and it could be good.

141
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.090
<v 1>Well that's actually interesting too.
Cause now that you have,
you know,</v>

142
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:28.340
episode seven is done.
So now with Ryan Johnson picking on him,

143
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:31.850
so they do you have influence over your character now?
Like to say I like,

144
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.110
I feel like you should be doing this

145
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:38.010
<v 2>episode eight.
Can we talk about,
you caught me in my little sneaky.</v>

146
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.490
That's fine.
Survives finserve um,
so we have some questions from uh,

147
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:48.070
some,
uh,
Googlers who Dana Hung Klein's gonna.
Fabulous.
Read on.

148
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.800
<v 3>So our first question from the global audience is,</v>

149
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.650
what is your favorite piece of star wars paraphernalia that you own?

150
00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:01.110
<v 2>Ooh,
I have a lot.
Um,
I have,</v>

151
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:01.850
uh,

152
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:06.390
a a star wars comic book that's actually based on the first draft that George

153
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.240
Lucas ever,
ever wrote.
And Luke Skywalker is called Luke stock.

154
00:09:10.241 --> 00:09:13.800
Kayla Han Solo is like an alien,
like a furry thing.

155
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.020
And it's all different.

156
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:19.890
It was his first ever draft that they made into a comic book.
Um,
and,

157
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.060
and I own that and I love it dearly.
Femi can we check the,
I still have that.

158
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.713
I'm going to read it again.

159
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.120
<v 3>Um,
so who would you,
John,
not your character.
Uh,</v>

160
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:36.020
rather facing a fight the aliens of Star Wars or the aliens of attack.
The block.

161
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.150
<v 2>The aliens have a tap the block every day,
all day because it's fun</v>

162
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.910
and they're more dumb.
So then survival is,
is pretty much guaranteed.

163
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.740
I'm sorry for the rest of the costs,
but yeah,

164
00:09:50.741 --> 00:09:52.030
definitely getting into the top of the block.

165
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.090
<v 3>Uh,
what was your hardest day on set that you can tell us about it?</v>

166
00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:00.970
<v 2>Hottest Day on set.
That's such a good one.
Gosh,
Jj.
Um,</v>

167
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.780
I was obviously,
as you've seen from the,
from the,
the trailers,

168
00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.950
me and daisy are in a really intense scene where there are Thai fights is

169
00:10:11.951 --> 00:10:15.520
chasing us down and not loads of explosions.
And,
um,

170
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.820
the scene starts here with Jj just saying,
okay,

171
00:10:18.821 --> 00:10:21.460
just run from here to there.

172
00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.510
Make sure you fit your dialogue in within that space.
Make it fast,

173
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.380
make it actually,
this is star wars,
have fun.
I'm like,
okay,
cool.

174
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.490
Jj backs all the way up.
Jj goes further.

175
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.770
Jj goes behind a plastic tent,
the camera's covered up.

176
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:44.230
Crofty starts to go away.
And I'm like,
what's going on?
And on.

177
00:10:44.231 --> 00:10:48.880
Daisy was just like,
I think there's going to be explosions.
I was that three,

178
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.930
two,
one.

179
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:58.670
I think it was hard.
It was like,
okay.
Again,
we've done that so many times,

180
00:10:58.671 --> 00:11:01.040
but it looks fun.
It looks fantastic.
Well,

181
00:11:01.041 --> 00:11:03.620
that's so your heart's dance that what was the most exciting day besides the

182
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.980
first day you were on set where you just stopped and just,

183
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.510
I think made the most exciting day is,
uh,
receiving the light saber.
Um,

184
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.880
obviously we know Finn Battles.
Um,

185
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.680
a storm trooper that has an amazing Tom Fhfa,

186
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.690
and the day they handed me that say bond called action.
It was,
uh,

187
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.980
it was a glorious day.
The cost is in ruins.
There was storm troopers everywhere.

188
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.790
I had a light saber.
I was just like,
I'm legit.
The black antiquing right?
Yeah.

189
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:32.803
<v 0>No.</v>

190
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.540
<v 3>Uh,
amongst you and your costars not their characters.</v>

191
00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:49.350
Who Do you think could make the Kessel run in less than 12?
Parsecs

192
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.580
<v 2>oh
my gosh.</v>

193
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.810
Carrie Fisher.
I mean it'd be a hard land.

194
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.200
We probably hit lightspeed before we hit a rock,

195
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.670
but Carrie Fisher would definitely get us there for sure.

196
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.180
<v 4>And finally we hear you're pretty good impressions.
We already heard one today.</v>

197
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.170
Do you have a favorite star wars universe impression aside from Han?
Apparently

198
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.970
<v 2>uh,
dual or do not.
There is no try.</v>

199
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.420
<v 0>We have some audience questions.</v>

200
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:24.871
<v 4>Well,</v>

201
00:12:24.871 --> 00:12:29.610
so the mikes are opening up for audience so thanks so much for being here John.

202
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.420
No problem.
Quick question.
Hopefully you can answer without doing any spoilers.

203
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.330
Why is fin out of breath and every shot?

204
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:41.310
<v 2>I don't know.
I don't know.
This is messed up.
You messed up.</v>

205
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.250
Thanks.
I was like Jj,
my,
you've got to clean me up in this man.

206
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:49.260
Do some Michael Bay stuff.
Do you know what's so funny about that?
I love that.

207
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.930
I think we're too used to seeing characters that have it figured out with to

208
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:56.320
where you used to heroes who are in trailers just like this.

209
00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.930
She much have him out of breath looking awkward and let's see if he ever rises

210
00:13:02.931 --> 00:13:04.970
to glory.
That's why I say so.

211
00:13:04.971 --> 00:13:07.850
I commend Jj for having me sweating wall up in that tree.

212
00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:13.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

213
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.440
<v 4>Can you tell us your experience the first time watching star wars?</v>

214
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:21.420
<v 2>Um,
I watched star wars last week,
none.</v>

215
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.430
And I did my first,
my first,

216
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.590
the time watching star wars was when the phantom menace came out.
Um,

217
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.620
I'm a nineties baby.
It was born in 19 to soak it up.
Old People.

218
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.890
Oh yeah.
Young people in the house.
Oh yeah.
Um,

219
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.470
I'm then I watched the phantom menace.

220
00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.720
By the time I wasn't really interested in character arcs and story.

221
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.740
I didn't know much about it.
I just saw lasers and ships and stuff like,
okay,

222
00:13:45.741 --> 00:13:49.160
cool,
I'll watch it.
And then after I watched the prequels,

223
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:53.020
I then found out about the originals and started reading the comics time play

224
00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:56.780
the video games,
and then I was just a star wars.

225
00:13:56.781 --> 00:13:59.570
And that for the rest of my life.
Yeah.
Great.

226
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.040
Was there a character that you wanted to play,

227
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:04.700
like you identified most with and the films?
I know,

228
00:14:04.701 --> 00:14:08.600
you know what I'm going to say it's on so low because everything,
I don't know.

229
00:14:08.601 --> 00:14:11.150
I love the character that represents us.
To be honest.

230
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.000
If each individual here was in star wars,

231
00:14:14.001 --> 00:14:15.950
you would not be Luke Skywalker come on.

232
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.490
You weren't being like trying to fight the forces of good and all that kind of

233
00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:24.240
stuff.
You'd be on trying to make money as a bible.
Yeah,
that's why I like,

234
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.320
that's why I like him so much.

235
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.800
<v 4>Um,
so just kind of like playing off your Instagram reaction to the trailer,</v>

236
00:14:30.801 --> 00:14:32.510
which is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

237
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.230
Have you seen the movie and if so,
did you react like that during the film?

238
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.590
<v 2>You know,
it's so funny.
I was so steel during the film.</v>

239
00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.580
Kathy Kennedy was next to me watching it together.
Um,
and it's,
it's,

240
00:14:43.581 --> 00:14:47.900
it's just so strange.
Like I was there obviously when all these films were shot,

241
00:14:47.901 --> 00:14:50.600
but it's strange thing and everything edited together.

242
00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.240
And seeing visual effects here in the music.

243
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:58.070
John William kills it in this movie.
And you know,
I was just like,

244
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.590
oh my gosh,
I'm watching stole his we've,
and I'm in the store,
me by my name.
Yeah.

245
00:15:00.591 --> 00:15:04.690
I'm in it.
Oh my gosh,
that's me.
Yeah.
That's how I react to it.

246
00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.100
<v 4>Yeah.
After the air,
you don't throw you the,</v>

247
00:15:08.101 --> 00:15:11.630
were like a bunch of Nobel stone in the universe,
like a throne.

248
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.790
Mara [inaudible] father,
like kind of iconic characters,

249
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.220
but now they are not there.

250
00:15:16.221 --> 00:15:19.230
So have you read all those books or what's your opinion about the,

251
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.520
<v 2>a lot of the extended universe books and,
um,
I mean,
I mean,
I'm not,</v>

252
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.630
I'm not really into the stall with comics as much as I'm into like the marvels

253
00:15:27.631 --> 00:15:31.160
and the dcs.
It's just because I experienced,
I was through the movies.
Um,

254
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.300
but I do love playing the video game.

255
00:15:33.301 --> 00:15:38.130
Is anyone playing battlefront at the guys?
You would never beat me.

256
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.540
Literally.
I am so good.
Um,
so yeah,
that's,

257
00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:45.030
that's my experience of the books and stuff.

258
00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:50.450
<v 4>Um,
I,
so I had another question about your reaction video.
Uh,</v>

259
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.070
obviously we're really excited.
Uh,

260
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.670
was that your first chance to let people know,

261
00:15:55.671 --> 00:15:57.590
like your friends and family that you are,

262
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.940
I mean basically a jet I in this movie like,
and how hard was it to keep that in?

263
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.200
<v 2>I don't know what the Jeddah is.
What was that?
No idea.</v>

264
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.880
It's just some guy in a leather jacket,
right?
Yeah,
I dunno.
Um,
I was,
I was,

265
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I mean that was the first time I ever saw the trailer and the,

266
00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.600
the main frame it was just put together in the way that shocked me.

267
00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:19.700
So I had to jump over the,
so far for a second.

268
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.330
But it wasn't the first time I had shared my excitement.

269
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.590
My Mom and dad got to come on set,
you know,
while I,
while I was filming.

270
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.180
And actually they,
they came on set when I was doing the lightsaber battle with,

271
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:35.960
with the storm trooper.
My Mum was crying.
She was just like,

272
00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:40.640
don't let that white thing hard to how my dad was just like,

273
00:16:40.641 --> 00:16:41.220
go on,

274
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.760
<v 5>knock him out,
knock him out.</v>

275
00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.450
Did your parents like Star Wars?
Where the,

276
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.630
<v 2>did they?
My mom doesn't have no idea what it is.</v>

277
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.640
<v 5>No idea.</v>

278
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.750
<v 2>I'm like mom,
Luke Skywalker clay.
Once it'd be a jet,
the force is,
she's like,</v>

279
00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:58.860
when do you show up?

280
00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.550
<v 4>All right,
I'm going to be that guy and not ask about star wars.
Um,</v>

281
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:06.110
and just since you already brought it up,

282
00:17:06.111 --> 00:17:09.020
what do you think happened to Moses and his crew out there of the events of

283
00:17:09.021 --> 00:17:12.940
attack the block?
Do they keep fighting aliens or does he get out of prison?
What?

284
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:15.720
<v 2>I doubled off of the film,
one of the top of the block.</v>

285
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.830
I pitched an idea to Joe and I said we could have a teaser trailer with just the

286
00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:24.780
Big Ben.
There are more aliens that come down and Moses is just galloping across

287
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.720
Westminster Bridge on a police horse with a nice,

288
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.970
with loads more use around him just to go to war.

289
00:17:30.971 --> 00:17:34.080
So I think Moses is back on the streets and uh,
he,

290
00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.480
he's definitely up for killing way aliens for sure.

291
00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:41.010
<v 4>Awesome.
Thank you.
So going back to the,
uh,</v>

292
00:17:41.011 --> 00:17:45.450
the expanded universe a bit,
obviously Disney d canonized a lot of it.

293
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.560
Is there,
is there some bit of it that you wish,
uh,
was,
uh,

294
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:53.070
was persisted into the,
uh,
the episode seven?

295
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.850
<v 2>It would,
it would have been good to discover,
um,
Darth Vader's secret apprentice.</v>

296
00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:58.330
Uh,

297
00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:02.110
it would have been good to discover that to see how he kind of would mesh with

298
00:18:02.111 --> 00:18:03.880
the,
with the franchise films.

299
00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.960
But I think the main thing I trust what we would give him before in terms of the

300
00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:12.210
films I always think is important to expand on the original story.
Um,

301
00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.370
and even though we don't get to experience the expanded universe,

302
00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.900
there are risks being taken in force awakens that won't make it the same old

303
00:18:19.901 --> 00:18:20.870
story.
So we,

304
00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:24.760
we will still feel like we're getting a piece of the expanded stories.

305
00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:25.983
That's great.
Thanks.

306
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.820
<v 4>I'm curious to get your honest opinion on the ridge or the prequel trilogy.
I,</v>

307
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.300
nobody else is gonna see this,
so he can just say what you really think.
Okay.

308
00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.630
<v 2>Um,
when I watched the prequels,</v>

309
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:48.730
all I saw with imagery and I was young cause I wasn't really looking for what

310
00:18:48.731 --> 00:18:52.870
you guys hold most dear,
which is you guys love the character arcs.

311
00:18:52.871 --> 00:18:57.460
You guys love the,
the,
the,
the fight between good and evil a space opera.

312
00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.950
I wasn't looking for that win when I watched the prequels.

313
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:04.550
All I was looking for with action explosions.
So it was great for me.
Um,

314
00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:08.590
and I,
I was touched by revenge of the fifth.

315
00:19:08.591 --> 00:19:11.740
I enjoyed it at the end.
In the end,
the ending was,

316
00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:15.820
was quite touching to me to see how it joins up to the other other stories.

317
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.040
A lot of people are very critical about them and I get it,

318
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.620
but the force awakens is not that Disney were we supposed to do

319
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.210
one more question.

320
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.600
<v 4>Okay.
I kind of in the same vein as this question,
uh,</v>

321
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.410
how personally responsible do you feel for whether this movie's a success or a

322
00:19:34.411 --> 00:19:35.190
failure?

323
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.430
<v 0>You don't want to be the next charge our banks,
right?
That would be awful.</v>

324
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.720
<v 2>Um,
I,
I don't feel responsible,
but to what,</v>

325
00:19:45.721 --> 00:19:49.170
I've already got my escape plan through the tunnel on 45th street,

326
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.210
you guys will never see me again.
Um,
uh,
you know,
we,

327
00:19:53.211 --> 00:19:56.970
we all feel responsible that we all do.
Um,
um,

328
00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.850
I remember Ted in Harrison,
like,
dude,
if this flops,
I'm standing behind you make,

329
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.790
you're going to take most of it,
but it's not going through.

330
00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.470
It's going to be amazing.
I just know it because there's this,

331
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.470
there's a general feeling in a natural,
uh,
uh,

332
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.830
geekiness that connects all star wars fans and it,
and it touched me in,

333
00:20:13.831 --> 00:20:16.110
if it can't touch me,
I know that he's going to touch everybody else,

334
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:21.350
but the guy that we really need to pray for is JJ Abrams because I mean,

335
00:20:21.631 --> 00:20:25.920
the most pressure is,
is,
is on him.
You know,
we,
we as actors,
we come in,

336
00:20:25.921 --> 00:20:30.150
we filmed the project to just go by j j see you later.
Oh yeah.

337
00:20:30.151 --> 00:20:31.320
Good luck editing the film.

338
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.880
And so I think he turned into Moses and one of the biblical characters growing

339
00:20:35.881 --> 00:20:39.360
facial hair in the editing room because he was there for a long time.

340
00:20:39.361 --> 00:20:42.920
But he's done a fantastic job.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Well,

341
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:43.763
thank you so much.

342
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:47.703
