00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.973
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.420
<v 2>Any drugs?
Oh,
welcome to talks at Google today.</v>

3
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:18.600
It is my pleasure to welcome Hugh Jackman,
Taryn Edgerton,

4
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.850
and at Dexter Fletcher for Eddie the Eagle.

5
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.090
<v 1>Thank you all for being here.</v>

6
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.800
<v 2>So can you tell us a little bit about the story of Eddie Edwards?</v>

7
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.020
<v 3>Yeah,
uh,
I mean,
this one.
Yeah,
I've forgotten.
I think Edwards was a,
uh,</v>

8
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.160
a British ski jumper back in 1988 who managed to get himself,

9
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.420
uh,
uh,
to the 1988 Calgary Olympics.
Um,

10
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.290
and he was profoundly untalented when it came to ski jumping bots.

11
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:51.980
He was full of lots of ambition and he was at a lifelong dream to be at the

12
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.360
Olympics and he got himself there.
So that's kind of loosely the story.

13
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.050
Anyone here old enough to remember?
Ada was Idi Amin?

14
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.390
<v 2>Be Proud,
be proud guys.
Um,
so Tara,
you play Eddie in the film.
Yes.</v>

15
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.460
What,
it was this great kind of character,
physical transformation for you.
Um,

16
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.170
what did you,
did you have any sort of rituals?
I'd for maybe carbs?
Yeah.

17
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.770
To prepare,
you know,

18
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.620
how'd you get into it?

19
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.170
<v 3>Dedicated,
very,
very dedicated to pastry.
Um,</v>

20
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.090
yes,
there was that.

21
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.630
I don't say he was such a kind of a character fall looking guy.

22
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:35.090
He had this very prominent um,

23
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.220
underbite under deep sonorous voice as I'm noticing that this it,
um,
yeah.

24
00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:42.290
And he had like,
you know,
a ginger mustache.

25
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:45.110
Did you have what kind of coke bottle glasses?

26
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.940
It was just a great fun opportunity to try something wildly different.
Really.

27
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.760
Yeah.

28
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.500
<v 2>Speaking of wildly different,
so who your character is fictional.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

29
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.280
did you,

30
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.310
did you find it sort of liberating and having more room to play or was it a

31
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:01.990
little,
little intimidating and having to sort of create this,

32
00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:04.700
this character who fits into this narrative that people are familiar with?

33
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.790
<v 4>It's certainly easier creating a character when you have someone like Eddie</v>

34
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.520
Edwards who I remember and suddenly everyone in England knows at least visually,

35
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:16.130
but there remember he's anti because it makes it much harder.

36
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:17.380
Not to mention for Taryn,

37
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.540
he watched the movie for the first time with the real guy.

38
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:24.830
Eddie Ed was an all his family and friends.
Now that is that kind of pressure,

39
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.310
that pressure.
Yeah.
Bump,
easy breezy.

40
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.770
And I played the,
a fictional coach,
uh,
has been on old,

41
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:36.230
has been sort of ski jumper who is now an alcoholic.

42
00:02:36.231 --> 00:02:37.670
So I did a lot of research for that.

43
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.990
<v 2>You also a character actor in this?
Yes.</v>

44
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.880
<v 4>I don't know if anyone knows ginger,
Ginger Baker or has seen a documentary.</v>

45
00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:49.470
You go edge and you're begging the drummer.
The drama.
Yeah.
So I based him on,

46
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.530
on Ginger Baker who to me was this kind of the epitome of rock and roll by the

47
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:59.440
way.
You should see this documentary.
Beware Ginger Baker.
He was a very,

48
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:02.560
very famous drama nine to be the greatest rock and roll drummer of all time.

49
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.450
But when he wasn't driving,

50
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:08.440
he was like basically almost killing himself in some way,
shape or form.

51
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.200
And if he hadn't a found drumming when he was 14,

52
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.380
he would've been in jail by the time he was 15.
And so he was pure,

53
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:15.960
pure rock and roll.
And that's who I kind of

54
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.820
<v 2>basis character on.
Uh,
so Dexter,
yeah.
To know,
you know,
how,</v>

55
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.850
how did this feel and get me because it'd been in development or there'd been

56
00:03:23.851 --> 00:03:26.130
interest for a while and yeah,
you guys got it done.

57
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.450
<v 3>Yeah,
exactly.
Well,
there's,
we have a great producer,
Brian,</v>

58
00:03:29.451 --> 00:03:32.900
the name of Matthew Vaughn,
who's also a great film director in his own right,

59
00:03:32.901 --> 00:03:37.790
the towns work with on Kingsman.
He directs in Kingsman,
uh,
produce that as well.

60
00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:41.900
And he's a,
uh,
an old friend of mine and he kinda dug out the script.

61
00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:43.190
It had been sitting around for a long time,

62
00:03:43.191 --> 00:03:48.050
but it takes someone like Matthew Vaughn who's,
um,
amount of vision,

63
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.030
who dug out the script and said,
hey,
look,

64
00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:53.330
here's something really interesting for the siren and you to start tackling.

65
00:03:53.331 --> 00:03:56.810
And I've been speaking to Hugh Jackman.
Right?
Okay,
this already sounds good.

66
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.500
So then we've got hold of the script and that was about two,
two years ago.

67
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.080
So it was really about two years ago when things really started to happen in

68
00:04:03.081 --> 00:04:07.190
earnest.
And,
uh,
Eh,
like any film,
it's certain amount of alchemy.

69
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.740
Alchemy is involved,
you know,
and,

70
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:12.080
and the right things have to come together in order to create that magic moment.

71
00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:15.740
And,
and this just happens to be one of those magic moments.
Hello everybody.

72
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.510
Yeah.
Yeah.
So it's,
it's just,
you know,

73
00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:24.470
things have to sort of all come together and the stars have to align and uh,

74
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.520
and yeah,
and we will have a good experience.
Can you,
Jacqueline has to be free.

75
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.430
That's really when it came down to got it done.

76
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.210
We'd like the Hugh Jackman for 15 years.
Suddenly you've got a six week window.

77
00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:36.044
We grabbed it.

78
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.130
<v 2>Um,
so speaking of magic moments,
I feel like the,</v>

79
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.820
the 88 Olympics were just the sort of,
you know,
it was,
it was Eddie's story.

80
00:04:44.821 --> 00:04:48.770
It was the Jamaican bobsled team.
Yeah.
And I'm curious if you guys think,
um,

81
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.410
you know,
we live in sort of this age of viral illness and,
and uh,
you know,

82
00:04:52.411 --> 00:04:55.800
there's an instant spotlight,
but in the,
in the 80s,
it wasn't necessarily that,

83
00:04:55.801 --> 00:04:59.380
you know,
but the Olympics around the few events that everyone watches.
Yeah.

84
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.170
Do you think any story,

85
00:05:01.171 --> 00:05:03.810
like if he was ski jumping today would have as much heart or,

86
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.460
or which I think is like a compliment to him as a person or,
um,
do you think

87
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.070
<v 3>I would wonder Robin.
I don't know what I mean,
the thing about it then was the,</v>

88
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.010
it took time for that story to reach around the world and it sort of grew and

89
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:19.390
built and built my men.
Um,
you know,

90
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:22.420
and I think it was the information was coming from another side of the world and

91
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:23.770
it took longer to get back.

92
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:27.100
And so I suppose the as boy longevity in that way that,
you know,

93
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:30.190
it's kind of more in the consciousness cause you've got to really seek out

94
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:30.710
whether it's,

95
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.880
it's so it's not that it's so quick and you swipe it away and that's it.

96
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:35.800
It's gone.
It's a quick thing.

97
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.830
It sort of hangs around and things lingered for longer.
Well,

98
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.090
you know,
catches,

99
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.040
<v 4>I goes,
I was in Australia,
I remember we were all kind of transfixed by him.</v>

100
00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:50.520
And you know,
in the closing ceremony he's kind of mentioned by one summer.

101
00:05:50.521 --> 00:05:55.500
I just,
they go on here.
Right.
He,
he,
he was on Johnny Carson flew him down and,
uh,

102
00:05:55.501 --> 00:05:57.660
there's a great clip if you to see it,

103
00:05:57.661 --> 00:06:01.190
a youtube of him on Johnny Carson with Burt Reynolds and Burt Reynolds is an

104
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:04.910
aura of this guy,
Eddie Edwards.
And he's,
this is going from Cheltenham,

105
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.820
England on Johnny Carson.
He said he's very funny.
And yeah,

106
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.230
it kind of caught this cause I think it was such an unusual thing.

107
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:16.990
He was very much the every man doing this crazy,
crazy sport.
It was subtle.

108
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.250
This is before we extremely extreme sports existed,

109
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:23.720
but ski jumping is basically an extreme sport where people die all the time,

110
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:26.120
but it really did capture their,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

111
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.430
I probably only would have been more today,
I reckon.

112
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.170
<v 2>Hmm.
Um,
one of the things I love is that it,
yeah,</v>

113
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.040
I think the movie tells me that his whole story,
he,

114
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.300
it's like you don't have to win to be a winner.
Um,
I think he's,
you know,

115
00:06:39.301 --> 00:06:43.050
it's very earnest story and it's nice to see somebody who succeed at their
dream,

116
00:06:43.051 --> 00:06:46.260
even though their dream is,
it's,
they're reaching for the stars,

117
00:06:46.261 --> 00:06:48.660
but it's not necessarily over analysis reaching for stars and that it's not,

118
00:06:48.661 --> 00:06:52.380
I want to put you in a gold medal Olympian is I wanted to be an Olympian.
Um,

119
00:06:52.381 --> 00:06:56.640
so we're curious if there's any sort of moments in your own lives that you feel

120
00:06:56.641 --> 00:06:59.400
like,
hey,
this was really personally important to me.
You know,

121
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.040
other people might not necessarily see it as the same level of achievement,
but,

122
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.420
<v 3>oh,
that's a good question.</v>

123
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.260
Was when did it get to the Google headquarters?

124
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.550
Woo.
Uh,
uh,
yeah.
I mean,

125
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:18.630
I suppose we would have those moments in our lives.
I mean,
you know,

126
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:24.100
what defines Eddie is that he has this kind of unwavering self belief and that

127
00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:28.110
gets him to where he wants to go.
And I think that's what's the interesting mess.

128
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.030
Part of the,

129
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.840
one of the many messages that this bill Maher's but I think what's so strong

130
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:36.980
about it is that you know how you have that belief in yourself and it's,

131
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.280
and then see how far that gets you because you will be beset with many doubters

132
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:47.180
and your own self doubt.
But if you can just take it that bit further,

133
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.820
you will end up at Google headquarters.
You know what I mean?
It's,

134
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.300
that's part of what it is.
That's a,
that can take you so far.

135
00:07:56.301 --> 00:07:57.130
And Yeah,

136
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.660
<v 4>I love what you said actually.
I've sort of been saying exactly the same thing.</v>

137
00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:04.330
Copying a friend of mine who saw the movie that you don't have to win to be a

138
00:08:04.331 --> 00:08:07.290
winner.
And I think kids often today,
if you asked him,

139
00:08:07.291 --> 00:08:10.120
you know who their role models are,
they,
it's,
you know,

140
00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:12.970
Larry or Sergei or a Steve jobs or it's,
you know,

141
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.780
Lebron James is this people that Uber achievers in life and,
and I'm like,

142
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:20.540
mom,
that's great.
But you know,

143
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.590
very few people can achieve that level of perceived success.

144
00:08:25.781 --> 00:08:28.700
But that doesn't mean you're not a winner if you don't get there,
you know.

145
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:32.110
And what about the firemen or what about the school teacher,
what about that?

146
00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:36.010
And I mean this is probably going to sound a bit like self promotion in a way,

147
00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:39.880
but I do this,
uh,
you ask him,
you know,

148
00:08:39.881 --> 00:08:41.020
what things in our life,

149
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:45.220
and I was lucky enough to go on a trip with world vision to Ethiopia and I met

150
00:08:45.221 --> 00:08:47.270
her a coffee farmer,
uh,

151
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.470
called Duke Carly and cut a long story short,

152
00:08:50.471 --> 00:08:54.700
about three years later we opened up a cafe in two cafes in New York and we sell

153
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.560
Espresso Code to college dream.
And every time I walked into this cafe,

154
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:02.790
which is about the size of their coffee table there and I just get a flat wide

155
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:06.210
and I know that all the profits in that are sort of directly and we buy beans

156
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:09.300
from him directly and give him fair trade prices and all that.

157
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.210
Somehow that makes me just feel fantastic.
It's a small little cafe in,

158
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.600
in a city filled with cafes.

159
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:19.410
But it gives me a kind of feeling that is as great as anything I've done.

160
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.373
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

161
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.310
<v 5>yeah.
Follow that.
Yeah,</v>

162
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.520
go ahead.
We'll go.
Is

163
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.620
Always,
always wanted to be a Google hair gray.

164
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.960
The reason I've been so quiet this far is because this is really is quite a

165
00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:42.590
moment
here.
There's some amazing restaurants here.

166
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.450
Is the Vegan restaurant open?

167
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.140
<v 4>No,
I,
that's what,
we can make it open.
We will open it today.</v>

168
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.190
I don't know really things that were important to me that didn't seem as

169
00:09:54.191 --> 00:09:57.460
important as everyone else.
I don't know.
I think,
you know,
the,
the,
the,

170
00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.580
the big thing in my life was probably getting into drama school when I was about

171
00:10:00.581 --> 00:10:03.220
19 and,
but that was very important to my family as well.

172
00:10:03.221 --> 00:10:04.960
So that was really lame answer,
isn't it?

173
00:10:04.961 --> 00:10:07.720
I'm trying to think of anything more interesting.
But yeah,
that was,
that was,

174
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.540
that was the sort of big thing in my life that felt like a real kind of

175
00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:14.620
insurmountable challenge.
And in fact,
the first year I tried it was,

176
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.980
they didn't look at me twice,
but yeah,

177
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:20.160
<v 2>second year I got in,
sorry.
Yes.
There we go.
There you go.
Um,</v>

178
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.700
so I'd love to talk about,
you guys had a great sort of on,

179
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.510
on through chemistry and it's,
it's a very sort of intimate film,
you know,

180
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:27.901
it's very,

181
00:10:27.901 --> 00:10:31.200
it's two characters and it's kind of first it's you versus the world and then

182
00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:34.950
it's youtube versus the world.
Um,
what was the onset experience like?

183
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:36.930
Always.

184
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.280
<v 5>Yeah.
We don't get,
we don't talk anymore.</v>

185
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.310
It's amazing.
This in yesterday,
Joe,
Joe Friends,
I mean,

186
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:51.260
very tense.
Do,
would start every day with the same,

187
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.860
same goal and give it to them.

188
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.920
Let's make a movie every morning we'd walk on the sad side of animal and make us

189
00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:02.070
laugh and everyone would clap and we get going.
And I,

190
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.490
this man is one of the funniest,
most talented man I've ever worked with it.

191
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.220
And uh,
we just had a blog.
I had a blast.
Oh No,
I did have a blast.
Basically.
Was,

192
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.540
there was,
there was a pause there.

193
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.300
I basically made it my mission when I started this film.

194
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.290
I have to when you first meet here,

195
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:21.290
he's so approachable and kind of intimidating.
Won't let you look him in the eye.

196
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.950
But um,
but so friendly and lovely.
Yeah,

197
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.460
<v 4>I completely completely took advantage of this.</v>

198
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:32.110
So what I did was I made it my aim making this film to try and make Hugh Jackman

199
00:11:32.111 --> 00:11:33.370
laughing every take

200
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:38.240
<v 5>possible.
So they were the detriment of the film completely.
And I don't care.</v>

201
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.650
So we'd start and do seeds that the camera turned around on him and I'd be in

202
00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:45.380
the middle of a scene and I just sort of decide to pull a funny face or the

203
00:11:45.381 --> 00:11:48.200
exaggerated Eddie face I like to call it,
which is something like this.

204
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.343
<v 2>Okay.</v>

205
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.250
<v 5>Would immediately crack up every time.
Oh,
I loved it.</v>

206
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.420
Every second of it.
There's already,
give me one of the really,

207
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.170
really funny,

208
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:06.640
there's a really fun game you can play watching this movie and I need to name

209
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:08.220
actually maybe it was called it like a drinking game.

210
00:12:08.221 --> 00:12:11.760
Like it's a good drinking game.
So we'll call it [inaudible] Perry.

211
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.553
I'm the game is,

212
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:18.690
is that cues character laughing or is that just a few crops and I think you will

213
00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:23.470
never use it as to yeah,
you'd be quite drunk
at the end of it.

214
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.260
<v 2>Um,
so I have a few rapid fire questions for all of you.
Uh,</v>

215
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.860
what sport do you think should be in the Olympics that isn't already

216
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:31.003
<v 4>golf?</v>

217
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:38.300
<v 5>Wow,
that was fast.
I actually can't think of a single sport at the moment.</v>

218
00:12:38.301 --> 00:12:39.250
And drone racing.

219
00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.270
<v 2>Okay.
Yeah,</v>

220
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.520
I'd like to see some seriously fast medic drone racing and we go,
yeah,

221
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.580
we could have our first Olympian in that city right here.

222
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.570
Put me sitting in this room,
that person today,

223
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.210
he's got a drone at home and weren't.
Okay.

224
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.400
<v 5>Think of a spool.
That's how little of a sports where I am.</v>

225
00:13:01.401 --> 00:13:03.100
I can't think of one sport.
Okay.

226
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.240
<v 2>That's not already in the Olympics.
Pogo stick video games.</v>

227
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.063
<v 5>Three legged race.</v>

228
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:13.460
<v 2>Um,</v>

229
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:18.400
so Eddie's mom has this adorable sort of sweet bull jumper a that says the,

230
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.200
I am editing

231
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.580
<v 4>mom.
What would your wool jumper say?
I've got one.
Oh,</v>

232
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:28.250
<v 5>says I play Eddie.
So,
ah,
I have,
I really off.</v>

233
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:33.190
Someone made it for me and I love it.
And they may go with my mum as well,

234
00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:38.040
so I'm at that says I met his mom could have a single for there

235
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:45.450
<v 2>deal breaker.
Nobody else has a jumper idea.</v>

236
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.960
Sometimes you go,
thank you.
Just let that one hang in here.

237
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.170
What,

238
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:58.940
<v 4>or a song,
what would your theme song be in the film?
In life.</v>

239
00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:00.470
In life.
Oh,
okay.

240
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.550
<v 5>She's a mania.
Very good.</v>

241
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:08.773
Very good.

242
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.960
<v 2>It is.
The competition
isn't,</v>

243
00:14:15.961 --> 00:14:19.880
it is actually speaking of music.
I do I have to ask,
um,
the song at the end?

244
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.680
<v 4>Yes.
You guys want to talk about though?
Yeah.
Matthew,
Matthew Vaughn,</v>

245
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.250
the producer and decks,
the,
the soundtrack is fantastic.

246
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.220
If you like eighties music,
if you hate me,
these music,
you'll hate the sound,

247
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.990
but it's really,
you want me,
he's lying now.
It's really,
it's really fantastic.

248
00:14:36.991 --> 00:14:40.860
And so he wanted to have a call song for the,
for the ending.

249
00:14:40.861 --> 00:14:45.861
And so when out to a whole bunch of bands and Gary Barlow and orchestral

250
00:14:46.171 --> 00:14:49.710
maneuvers in the dark,
OMD came up with this song.
They did write it together,

251
00:14:49.711 --> 00:14:51.830
right?
Yeah,
yeah.
And then,
uh,

252
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.230
they were going to perform it and because the real idiot was as they do anyone,

253
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.970
if anyone gets any notoriety that he recorded a single,

254
00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:05.000
does that have any really,
but in England it goes to number one.
Okay.

255
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.480
And this is the country,
was it nearly the elephant that went to number one?

256
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:13.970
We have exquisite.
So

257
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:21.410
Eddie did once.
So Taryn Sang the lead on the bandwagon as well.

258
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:22.360
No,
that's not,

259
00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:26.870
you got from the back and I did the backing vocals for it and we've seen this,

260
00:15:26.871 --> 00:15:30.650
uh,
this song,
which if you watch,
do the credits,
you,
you can check it out.

261
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:33.760
Sort of an eighties pop song,
isn't it called gold thrill me.
Yeah.
The,

262
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.440
I just felt it was a fun thing to do.
You know,
that it was just,

263
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.810
it was in and he were very gracious and very keen and,

264
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:45.290
and went in the studio and recorded his bit in London.
And you are in Australia,

265
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.600
Australia,
the bills and because we weren't talking at the time,

266
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.370
that's why you couldn't have them in the same room.

267
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.610
Can the same contemplate that bad?
Can I tell a little song?

268
00:15:52.611 --> 00:15:54.560
I'm going to embarrass you now.
Can I get to tell the story?

269
00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:56.690
Because he'd lay down,
he'd go there anyway.
So

270
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:03.430
have you looked at me and said,
don't
really.

271
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.450
Anyway,
so uh,
he,

272
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.350
he had already done it and they sent it over.
I said,
it's just fantastic.

273
00:16:10.351 --> 00:16:13.490
I was speaking to,
Matthew said,
yeah,
Taryn came in.
Gary Barlow is here.

274
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.510
Do you guys know Gary Barlow?
He's very,
very famous English.

275
00:16:16.511 --> 00:16:18.120
So he was performing what was his band

276
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.140
and now writes on his own anyway,
so he knows what he's doing.

277
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.310
And so Taryn came in and apparently he said,
okay,

278
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.230
if you want to go into the booth to really interrogates,
yeah.

279
00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:35.070
Do you want me to do it like an 80 style or kind of carries like,

280
00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.800
Gary was like,
okay,
like not knowing.
He goes,

281
00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:44.400
I'm just wondering if this guy can sing little eyes.
And he saw and he said,

282
00:16:44.401 --> 00:16:47.220
he went in there and Matthew Vaughn said to Gary goes,
Carey,

283
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.870
he's better than you.
And it was phenomenally.

284
00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.810
I was there.
It was amazing.
It was amazing.
You two seem to enjoy seeing.

285
00:16:56.811 --> 00:16:59.330
So Dexter,
and to ask you this,
if you could direct them in a musical,

286
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.900
what would it be?
Oh,

287
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.650
I was just watching a little bit of singing in the rain with which I love seeing

288
00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.110
it in the right.
It would be great.

289
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:12.230
But then they started singing a w not Philadelphia story being in at high risk

290
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.000
high society.
That would be their choice.

291
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:20.340
I'd love to though.
I haven't got the feet first.

292
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.530
He's roses,
roses.
It's fine.

293
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:34.980
The mom May,
are you doing
Friday?

294
00:17:34.981 --> 00:17:36.300
All I'm thinking about it is that first of all

295
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.930
I already had as this one was singing,
is the Google bus to local by the way?

296
00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.010
Yes it is.
Yes.
It

297
00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.200
will take a few in a second or stay exactly where you are.
Your choice.

298
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.870
Um,
what,
uh,
what do you hope audiences will take away from this film?

299
00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.910
So I think we will,

300
00:17:59.911 --> 00:18:04.911
we always felt like we wanted to create something that was just uplifting and

301
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:10.791
fun and uncynical and not kind of trying to be Trixie or dark or edge in any

302
00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:16.380
way.
It's just,
no,
no,
no,
go ahead.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Did I say no,
no,

303
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:20.970
no.
Just that we wanted it to be really,
um,
really,
yeah,
really uplifting.

304
00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:23.220
And for people to leave the theater with a spring in their step.

305
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.560
And I hope I got to people feel,

306
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.770
it's certainly the way I felt when I first watched it.
Anyway,

307
00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.290
you kind of reminded me of the full Monte when I read it.
You know,

308
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.310
it's got that grading which target naked in it.

309
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.433
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

310
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.490
<v 4>There's one dude saying,
well,
you're not dude,
I,
I'm sort of moving,</v>

311
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.180
<v 5>oh gosh,
naked.
Oh Gosh.
Nude.</v>

312
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.030
I'm fine.
Physical shirt.

313
00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.290
<v 4>And it kind of sneaks up on you,
the film.</v>

314
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:50.550
And people do really end up leaving with a smile on their face and a happy and,

315
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.380
and again,
more.
My friend said,

316
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:57.330
which I'm a parent and really is a great film to show kids or your kids.

317
00:18:57.331 --> 00:18:58.900
It's a great message for them,
I think,
you know.

318
00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.060
<v 3>Yeah.
I absolutely what the guy said,
you know,</v>

319
00:19:02.061 --> 00:19:04.480
we want people to come out feeling good and,
and,

320
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.530
and having a good experience and feeling like,
Hey,

321
00:19:06.531 --> 00:19:10.180
tomorrow maybe I'll tackle something that I've been putting off for a while.

322
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:15.050
I don't know.
That's a big thing,
but also just to understand how dangerous these,

323
00:19:15.051 --> 00:19:16.760
this ski jumping is.

324
00:19:16.761 --> 00:19:21.761
You know what these guys do and it's trying to capture that sense of danger and

325
00:19:21.921 --> 00:19:26.510
fear of someone at the top of a nightly meter ski jump who still then goes for

326
00:19:26.511 --> 00:19:28.580
it and still takes that on.
You know,
there's,

327
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.570
there's lots of excitement in that and um,
yeah,
there's,

328
00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:35.180
there's many wonderful things to take away from the film.

329
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.750
Mostly a ticket for your friend I think to take away.

330
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.520
<v 4>Hey guys,
thanks for coming in to Google today.</v>

331
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.030
I got a question for Terry [inaudible] he was going to sing.

332
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.400
<v 5>I can sing if you guys want.
It wouldn't be to privilege.</v>

333
00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.650
<v 4>Um,</v>

334
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:54.400
you were just talking about how it's one of the scariest sports in the Olympics,

335
00:19:54.401 --> 00:19:57.490
right?
It's absolutely crazy.
It's mind blowing when you watch it on TV.

336
00:19:57.491 --> 00:20:01.300
It must be one of the most intense things that you could possibly do.
So,
Taryn,

337
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:05.570
did you give it a try?
Ski Jumping?
Yup.
Are you his slopes guy?

338
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.833
<v 5>Uh,</v>

339
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.300
<v 4>should I buy level with you before we started making this movie,</v>

340
00:20:13.301 --> 00:20:16.840
I'd never been on a pair of skis in my life.
So for me,

341
00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:20.500
learning to ski was enough of a challenge.
And the moment an actor in a movie,

342
00:20:20.501 --> 00:20:22.270
he says,
okay,
I'm going to do my own ski jumping.

343
00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:27.370
The gods of insurance descend and smash you into the ground.
So,

344
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.900
um,
actually I was weirdly,
I was totally fine with not doing,

345
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.640
<v 5>we're gonna see jumping.
I don't know why</v>

346
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:40.960
you,
you
just arrived.

347
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:43.223
<v 4>I was,
I'm gonna do it.</v>

348
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.800
<v 5>That's what Matt and then he got to the top of the job.</v>

349
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:53.340
There is no flipping way that it is absolutely crazy.

350
00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:58.870
Attos,
Tom Cruise,
get insurance for his movies.
I have no idea.
I was,

351
00:20:58.871 --> 00:21:02.380
like I said,
the Dexter Tom Cruise,
it's hung cruise or do the jump.

352
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.920
He would do it.
He probably would,

353
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.820
<v 3>I said challenge.
This is going on the Internet.</v>

354
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.390
Hi.
Thanks for coming.
Um,
so my favorite character in the movie is Janet,
his mom.

355
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.920
Um,
and I'm wondering is she still alive and how'd you get my material for Joe to

356
00:21:22.921 --> 00:21:26.880
play a character?
She said yes,
that is real.

357
00:21:26.881 --> 00:21:31.620
Mum is still a still around there and did in fact many jumpers with different

358
00:21:31.621 --> 00:21:35.300
slogans and various members of the family.
Um,

359
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.570
we pry around with the facts a bit in the film because it's,

360
00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.840
it's a story that we're telling and I,

361
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.420
but she did actually end up in Calgary as well,
a newspaper flu.

362
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:50.640
It is parents out there and surprised him,
which I didn't really feel was,

363
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.060
it was a tough thing for ready at that time.
But suddenly,
you know,

364
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:58.950
his mom and dad turned up and some girlfriend that he'd had,
you know,

365
00:21:58.951 --> 00:22:02.550
and they try to create this big drama.
So I stayed away from that.
But his mom,

366
00:22:02.551 --> 00:22:06.890
his mom and dad is still around and uh,
and they've seen the film with Eddie,
um,

367
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:11.360
that I love that place screening.
Yeah.
That and I love it.
But,
uh,
Joe is just,

368
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.580
it's a lovely actress.
Yeah.
She's a fantastic actress.

369
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.710
I feel personally that was kind of the sort of beating heart of the movie in

370
00:22:19.711 --> 00:22:22.590
some ways,
isn't she?
She's absolutely lovely performance.

371
00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.940
It's my favorite character too.

372
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.183
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

373
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.420
<v 3>I think your mom and dad are important because they're the heart of the home,</v>

374
00:22:30.421 --> 00:22:33.860
you know?
And,
and that's important that we understand where we're,

375
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:37.560
he comes from and you know,
and dad's a bit of a tougher carrots of Bersanti.

376
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:41.040
It's just out of fear for his,
his son,
you know,
he's just,

377
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.370
he's trying to protect him in a different way and mum's trying to encourage him

378
00:22:44.371 --> 00:22:47.700
and of course those two forces pull against each other.
And,
um,

379
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.910
but she's always been there from the beginning.
She,
yeah.
She's,
she's great,
sir.

380
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:52.543
Thank you.

381
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.940
<v 4>Speaking of tougher characters,
uh,
Hugh,</v>

382
00:22:57.941 --> 00:23:02.640
your character has a sort of shadow over his sort of career.
Yeah.

383
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.100
It's played by Mr Christopher Walken.

384
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.580
What that like having him as your sort of,

385
00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:15.610
we found out about two weeks into filming.
Yeah.
Uh,
that,
uh,
my coach,

386
00:23:15.611 --> 00:23:19.810
we played by Christopher Walken and we were just jumping around and there's a

387
00:23:19.811 --> 00:23:22.060
one a moment I won't never forget.

388
00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.570
Obviously when he did the scene with us in the,
in the locker room,

389
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:31.060
it was,
he's walked in.
So cool.
So common,
everyone went silent.
Right,

390
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.980
which is actually the way it's written in the script,
but the,

391
00:23:33.981 --> 00:23:38.981
he shot the commentating scene before that and Tara and I had finished shooting

392
00:23:39.341 --> 00:23:43.270
and we stuck around cause we wanted to go and see him work and I'll never forget

393
00:23:43.271 --> 00:23:44.104
standing there.

394
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.690
Christopher Walken sort of up there in this commentating booth and we are sort

395
00:23:47.691 --> 00:23:52.490
of hidden so he can't see us at the booth and is there and we're watching the

396
00:23:52.491 --> 00:23:56.510
monitor and indexing and all of us is like an action

397
00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:03.530
or I caught it.
Fantastic.
And he does a great walking impression.

398
00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:08.150
Yeah.
Unfortunately it was.
And because of in the moment Christopher was cast,

399
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.500
he was basically in a Christopher Walken and post all day for all day.

400
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.180
We're going to roll them now

401
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:20.780
<v 1>the movie.
But he started doing it to Christopher Walken without realizing</v>

402
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.980
Chris,
we've got to do it again.
You're gray.
I love you.
I love it.
I love it.

403
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.850
But we're going again.
You're a navigator.
Those

404
00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.220
<v 4>you've got to eat.
He has one line.
It is five words,</v>

405
00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.500
and in the middle is five word line.
Yeah.

406
00:24:38.501 --> 00:24:43.501
He puts a 15 second pause in the middle of a five word line and it's brilliant.

407
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.420
Yeah.
No one else could pull that thing up.
I mean,
honestly,

408
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.470
Julie,
give us a little,
I'll,

409
00:24:49.471 --> 00:24:52.810
I'll read the script three times and then if I like it,
I'll do it.

410
00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:00.630
<v 1>That's what he said.
If there's a,
a a better twice.</v>

411
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:05.220
<v 4>I got one more time.
I'll see how it goes.</v>

412
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:07.990
You Jack.
When I like him,

413
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:09.083
<v 1>good.</v>

414
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.350
