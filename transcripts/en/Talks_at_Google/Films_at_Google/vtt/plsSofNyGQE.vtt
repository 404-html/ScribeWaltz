00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.100
Kevin halford and Steve [inaudible].

2
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.450
<v 2>So welcome guys.
Alright,
yeah,
we're super pumped.
The guys have,</v>

3
00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:32.620
you guys are at Google where going saw the film last night is so phenomenal and

4
00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:34.780
it has such a cool story of how you guys got it made,

5
00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:37.500
which was you guys started in Indeigogo,
uh,

6
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.300
big crowds starter campaign and um,

7
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.340
it was so crowdfunding campaign and it was so cool to see that you guys

8
00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:49.960
announced it and then have it launch it within a day or two and basically racked

9
00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:54.490
up basically your goal,
which was like $2 million,
right?
Yeah.
Ended up with 4.75.

10
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.430
Yup.
That's very good.
Yeah.

11
00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.840
But humbling,

12
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.190
<v 3>very humbling.
You know,
we were pretty anxious about it going in,
you know,
uh,</v>

13
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.450
we knew that the studio in particular wasn't sure that the fans were still out

14
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:11.960
there and we had no idea how this was going to go down.

15
00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:13.130
So we did a lot of preparation.

16
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:17.900
We made content for the 30 days of the entire campaign.
And,
uh,
yeah,

17
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:18.231
I mean,

18
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:23.231
somebody bought the $35,000 squad car within the first hour or two a,

19
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.170
we got interested a lot of save the date for our package to be a,

20
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.200
the groomsmen at the,
at the wedding.
I was at $25,000 back.
But yeah,

21
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:34.490
we got $2 million in two ways from doing that.
The save the date.
We tried,

22
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.450
we tried,
somebody actually did an Indiegogo campaign to fund,
uh,

23
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.860
bringing us to their wedding,

24
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.410
but I don't think they raised the money for that one.

25
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.770
<v 4>But it could have gone the other way.
I mean it,
you know,
if,</v>

26
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.640
if people didn't care,
fund it,
the studio would have said,
well,
we're,
we're,

27
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:52.690
you're not making it,
you know,
we're not going to release a movie.

28
00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:53.524
Nobody wants to see.

29
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.840
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
did you have any inkling in terms of like,
is this going to do well?</v>

30
00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:01.050
Like did you,
did you,
when you,
before you did have you,
obviously you're nervous,

31
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:03.100
but what,
what made it now it's like this is,

32
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.450
<v 4>you know,
moving,
making eh,</v>

33
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.660
in order to think you can make a film starring you and your friends and get it

34
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.480
into

35
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.430
<v 2>theaters,
you have to be like a real relaxed kind of dumb high stakes gambler.</v>

36
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.290
Right?
I mean you,
you,

37
00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:24.850
you make outrageous requests of people like to fund this movie with us in it.

38
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.440
<v 4>And uh,
and it,
it,
it sometimes it works,
right?
I mean,</v>

39
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.950
and so taking that risk was for us,
we were like sure.

40
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.370
But also I think the first one was a very grassroots kind of feeling movie.

41
00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:38.740
You know,
it didn't have like a huge box office thing,

42
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:42.550
but people saw it on DVD and they saw it in their living rooms and it had this

43
00:02:42.551 --> 00:02:43.720
feeling,
this grassroots feeling,

44
00:02:43.721 --> 00:02:46.600
which I think the crowd funding thing lend itself for

45
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.480
<v 2>to where people want it to be directly involved in their own way.
Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:51.310
Cause it did well in the box office,
but it really,

47
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.160
how I discovered it was actually on DVD.
Yeah.
And so,

48
00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:57.460
which is a market that doesn't exist.
That's right.
Yeah.

49
00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.890
Thanks to California

50
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.700
<v 4>disrupting ticking off technology.
Thanks.</v>

51
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.770
I guess in this era though,
when you have,
um,

52
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.920
you have Netflix and Hulu and Amazon,
but I guess the studio owned the rights,

53
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:13.300
so they weren't allowing it to basically,

54
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.190
<v 2>okay.
Yeah.
They controlled the rights to the SQL and they basically,</v>

55
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:20.980
they said to me,
we're not going to fund it,

56
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.190
but we're never going to let you make it somewhere else because we don't want it

57
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:28.420
to be a hit somewhere else and have us look bad.
So they said,
so you fund it,

58
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.300
and then if it's a hit,
then we'll fund the third one.

59
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.190
<v 4>Oh Wow.
Really?
That's the way it is.</v>

60
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.170
So then they said they gave us parameters and they said we had to raise,

61
00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:42.090
you know,
a certain amount to shoot the movie.

62
00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:43.710
And then also we had to raise the entire P and a,

63
00:03:43.711 --> 00:03:47.910
the prints and advertising budget.
And they set that at $10 million.

64
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.680
And so ultimately the,
the raise we had to do was over $20 million and a,

65
00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:55.940
and so the crowdfunding campaign really kicked that off.
Um,
you know,

66
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.660
got us four and a half million dollars.

67
00:03:57.661 --> 00:04:02.400
It got us the confidence of the studio and it enabled us to shoot for seven days

68
00:04:02.401 --> 00:04:04.890
and like 20 pages of the,
of the movie.
Um,

69
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.100
and then we were able to get finance series on the back of that.

70
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.990
<v 2>But in the end the studio came in and is paying for all the advertising.</v>

71
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.680
<v 4>Once they saw the movie,</v>

72
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.410
we had to create the film first so it make it successful.
Yeah.
Right.

73
00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:20.160
And was there any a point I guess,
I mean cause it's been 17 years now,
I guess,

74
00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:20.821
since the original.

75
00:04:20.821 --> 00:04:24.480
So was there any point during this 17 years where you want to do with SQL right

76
00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:27.150
away?
Or was there just not a competence thing?
Cause it did do,

77
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.760
<v 2>we didn't want to be,
um,
you know,</v>

78
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:34.540
we didn't want to sort of follow and be the police academy guys.

79
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.630
It really more than anything.

80
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:41.050
It's like we want it to make other movies so that we wouldn't be only known for

81
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:44.780
that thing.
So we made,
you know,
club dread and beer fest and Simon Salmon.

82
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.650
Now we figured it was time to come back and grow the mustache.

83
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.210
<v 4>Some didn't change.</v>

84
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.960
We have a history and a history of a sketch comedy group for five years before

85
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:55.520
he made movies.
We were doing live sketch comedy shows in New York City.

86
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.070
So we always enjoyed playing,

87
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.480
trying different characters and different plots and stuff like that.

88
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.110
A little bit about the origins of Roman lizards.
So you guys all,
all in college,

89
00:05:03.111 --> 00:05:03.351
right?

90
00:05:03.351 --> 00:05:08.351
We're all part of Colgate university and was always you five or was it 14 first

91
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.100
was 14 people.
And so was there ever,

92
00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:16.820
is there a last member of broken lizard and then several,
lots of them?
Yeah,
many.

93
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.700
Yeah.
But a lot of that,
I mean,
you know,
like in New York,

94
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.380
the only place that would allow us to perform when we were first in New York

95
00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:27.480
City was a gay cabaret club called the duplex.
And,
um,

96
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.860
and the backstage that was just a teeny little stairwell,

97
00:05:30.861 --> 00:05:35.240
it's probably like six stairs and an emergency exit.
And you know,

98
00:05:35.241 --> 00:05:39.290
I think that group started off with nine people and,
uh,
the core group here,

99
00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:43.310
like we just bugged the shit out of those people so badly that they quit one by

100
00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:45.170
one,
like one guy.

101
00:05:45.171 --> 00:05:49.220
And it was a tricky one guy in his letter of resignation said that like our mom

102
00:05:49.221 --> 00:05:54.080
jokes gave him headaches and he couldn't stand to be with us anymore.

103
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.890
So here we are,
there's the fun.
Um,
so,
but you guys,

104
00:05:59.891 --> 00:06:04.700
so the kicks are the Indiegogo started two of 2015.
Right?
It was one of 2015.

105
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.240
Then you shot it in twice at 16 or 17.
Trying to understand what we've,

106
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.750
what we've found out is we,

107
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.970
we'd raised the money and then I got to be kind of later in 2015 and then

108
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:17.720
someone informed us that if we didn't spend the money by the end of the year,

109
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:22.040
we had to pay taxes on the income.
So whatever,
you know,
half of it,

110
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.600
we'll have to go,
hey,
we have to go away to taxes if we didn't spend it.
So,
uh,

111
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.100
we immediately went into production and we,
uh,

112
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.480
we shot for about six or eight days or something like that to,
to,

113
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.970
to kind of start to start the ball rolling.
And then that,
like Steve said,

114
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:40.460
that's what helped us then raise the more money that we needed,

115
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:43.500
that one concept and then we shot the rest of the rate of 2016 because these
are,

116
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.040
these are the questions that come up,
you know,
an independent filmmaking too,

117
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:50.120
because the questions that we debated was,
all right,
well,

118
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:53.750
we've got this four and a half million dollars,
should we just shoot,

119
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.840
try to shoot the whole movie with us and do it really,
really,

120
00:06:56.841 --> 00:06:58.670
really bare bones and then,

121
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:04.370
or should we just shoot a portion of it and make it as kick ass as we possibly

122
00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:08.250
can.
So we shot the whole opening sequence that you saw last night,
um,

123
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.020
and then a bunch of the pullovers and the mountain uniforms and uh,

124
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.640
and it turned out great.

125
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.410
That was the whole thing also is that we finished it in 2016.
Uh,
and we shot,

126
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.070
we finished that,

127
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.810
then we did a little reshoot 70 and then the movie was in the can edited mixed

128
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:28.370
and done in the summer of 2017 and we went to the Fox studio and they said they

129
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:31.160
were trying to figure out a release date and we were hoping like late summer or

130
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:33.290
whatever it was.
And they're like,
you know,

131
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:36.680
for 20 falls on a Friday in 2018

132
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.070
so what do you mean?
It was like,

133
00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:43.550
we're thinking about waiting until four 20 because we think it's the perfect

134
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:46.670
release date for you guys.
And we're like,
well that's eight months from now,

135
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.620
a year off our lives.
Uh,
and so that's,
you know,

136
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.660
ultimately the decision they made.

137
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:53.000
It was a marketing decision and then we were upset at the time.

138
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:54.890
But at this point now,
it just seems like a smart,

139
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.760
they've created a holiday for us release.

140
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.080
Our movie in Jag has used the director of both films.
Um,

141
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.540
now that you're at eight months is such like sit on it.

142
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:10.400
Was there a temptation to go back in and tweak it at all?
You know,

143
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:13.430
I watched it last night and I'm like,
there are about six changes.

144
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:17.150
I still want to make time.
It's done.

145
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:22.040
It's thousands of bricks.
I just closed my eyes during those,

146
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.630
those mums for you guys.
I mean you guys have,
obviously I'll write on the film,

147
00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.910
right.
And wrote the,
wrote all these films were broken lizard.

148
00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:32.870
And so what does that writer's room like when you guys are working together?

149
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:37.670
It's fun.
Uh,
it's,
I mean it's really fun.
We've known each other since college,

150
00:08:37.671 --> 00:08:40.850
so it comes pretty easily.
Yeah.
Like riffing on trust.

151
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.270
I think we have a shorthand for how we work with each other.
I mean there's,

152
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:43.491
you know,

153
00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:46.580
when we first started you'd get these ridiculous fights that would last,

154
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:49.970
you know,
hours over the stupidest joke or whatever it is.

155
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.190
I think we've learned how to be a little bit more efficient since the,

156
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.160
that time and uh,
and we can

157
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.610
<v 2>insult each other and still come back the next day and be friends and we can</v>

158
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.290
look,
families agree and whatever.
But the,

159
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:03.570
I think the bottom line of our writing room is if you can make the other guys

160
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:07.500
laugh,
it's going to get in the movie so that your sounding board is,
do you,

161
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.590
does your decision decisions?
Trump all this is the director know,
hey,
what

162
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.080
do you fight them on of stuff though there a,

163
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:21.170
there's a a bit from Steve Stand up that these guys wanted to put in the movie

164
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:26.440
because the,
you know,
they'd seen it on the,
on the standup station.

165
00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:30.150
It really worked really well and they said,
we should do this,
this bed.

166
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:32.910
It's like this in the car.
Where are we at?
We're,
we're po,

167
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:37.290
we're posing as French speaking mounties right.
And so there was a,

168
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.160
there's a very dirty joke that,
that he has,
I won't ruin it,

169
00:09:41.161 --> 00:09:43.650
but it's a very dirty joke that if you say it in French,

170
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:46.380
it sounds like something really dirty.
And he's,
they were like,

171
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:49.020
let's put this in the movie.
And I'm like,
Eh,
it's more of a standup joke.

172
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.960
And we fought for probably eight,

173
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.380
seven or eight drafts and they kept saying,
let's put it in the movie.
I'm like,

174
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.680
ah,
I don't really like it,
you know,
and then I have to start insulting the joke.

175
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.880
And then finally we put it into the thing and I'm like,
fine,
we'll shoot it.

176
00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:07.650
I'll just cut it later.
Uh,
and then because of some,

177
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.520
I was in this one scene and then we had to juggle it based on the plot.

178
00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:14.910
I ended up now in the scene and now I'm telling these jokes and I'm like,

179
00:10:14.911 --> 00:10:16.250
I don't want to Kelly's Damn Joe.
Right.

180
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.130
And then we shoot it and we put it in a movie.

181
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.910
And of course it's the most popular scene in the movie.
And I'm like,

182
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.750
thank God I was in that,
in that scene

183
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.200
that happened sometimes fighting for a joke.
Sometimes like survivor,

184
00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:34.620
you got to form alliances,
there's five of us and you try to get a majority,

185
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.120
right?
So if you really like a joke,
you sometimes try to form alliances.

186
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.510
You get a majority,
you got to sell it.

187
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:41.460
You've got to sometimes get on its feet and act it out.

188
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.180
And then if they see it like okay I get you're doing with that and they then

189
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:46.770
kind of get on board.
Oh yeah,
no it's,

190
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.500
it can be rough sometimes if you believe in something,

191
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:53.320
you just have to take a stand here and keep coming back draft after draft and

192
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.980
making your pitch and you'll take some ridicule.

193
00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.490
It's guys will insult like everything you stand for.

194
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.740
But eventually one day like one guy will turn and be like,
you know,

195
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.540
now I like this fucking joke.

196
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.450
And then you can see it start to happen and then you have three or five of them

197
00:11:09.451 --> 00:11:09.810
and you're like,

198
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:13.500
it's ducks have bats back and forth cause you do those in the movies.

199
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:16.410
Is that coming from real life where you pass back and forth where if this joke

200
00:11:16.411 --> 00:11:21.310
works,
if this joke kills,
then you got Kevin and I are in the edit room,
uh,

201
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.530
and we will fight over whether a joke is funny or not.

202
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.400
And then when we get in the finally you look in the screening room last night,

203
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.230
I'm like,
fuck you dude.

204
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.040
Sometimes there's that silence.
You know

205
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.060
what?
He always does his like,
there'll be like,

206
00:11:42.061 --> 00:11:44.880
it'll be a big laugh and joke.
I thought it was great and he'll go,

207
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.560
it was more of a grown
and then it will never give it.

208
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.320
Those are the best moments because it's like,
uh,

209
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.230
we'll have the test screening in front of a live audience for the first time.

210
00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:59.080
It's not friends and family and the line is coming up.

211
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:02.890
It's coming and that happens and let's say there's a laugh,

212
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.520
you'll just see like two guys who had the disagreement.
We'll just

213
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.590
<v 4>lean forward.</v>

214
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.940
You record it for the labs,

215
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:15.410
but then you go back and you hear and you listened to see if they will laugh at

216
00:12:15.411 --> 00:12:16.440
the joke when it's on the screen.

217
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.440
Can you talk about a little bit about the filmmaking process that you guys,

218
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.830
how it was back in the early 2006 now we have social media and now we have

219
00:12:22.831 --> 00:12:25.740
digital cameras and everything is completely different than probably what you

220
00:12:25.741 --> 00:12:27.320
guys experienced back in the,

221
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:31.900
<v 2>yeah,
I mean the social media element is like when you make something,
uh,</v>

222
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.400
uh,
artistic,
you know,

223
00:12:34.401 --> 00:12:39.020
you're going to be attacked in some form,
right?
So it's like,

224
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.720
it's just sort of the way,
I mean,
everybody has a voice now,
anonymous voice,

225
00:12:44.721 --> 00:12:49.160
which is too bad,
but the weight of whatever,
no,
it's fine.
Um,

226
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:52.700
but you know,
you just stepped to,
you know,
you have to really,
I mean,

227
00:12:52.701 --> 00:12:55.450
it used to be that you opened the New York Times and they would insult your

228
00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.920
movie and then,
and you know,
you're like,
Hey,

229
00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:59.900
I'm here with my friends and relatives are reading this thing,

230
00:12:59.901 --> 00:13:02.900
but now it's literally all over Twitter and everywhere.
Right.

231
00:13:02.901 --> 00:13:05.360
So it's just the way it goes.
I mean,
there's a lot of,
you know,

232
00:13:05.361 --> 00:13:08.660
you just have to try to keep the positive way of going.

233
00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.270
<v 4>Um,
like skin.
Yeah,
no,
for sure.
Um,</v>

234
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.920
and then in terms of your shoes out,

235
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.960
because you have continued to direct and shoot,
um,
a lot of series as well.

236
00:13:18.961 --> 00:13:22.410
And so,
um,
how have you evolved,
I guess,
essentially as a filmmaker?

237
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.930
Like what did you,
I guess I've learned from your,
you know,

238
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.100
decades of working on film into that you put into this one?
You know,

239
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.780
<v 2>I shout over a hundred episodes of television,
so,
uh,
I've shot,
you know,</v>

240
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.760
25 sex scenes and 25 fights and bunch of dinner scenes.

241
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:43.200
And I tried different lenses and different scenes and handheld and dollies and I

242
00:13:43.201 --> 00:13:47.250
kind of figured out what I like the most.
And then when we make a film,

243
00:13:47.251 --> 00:13:51.390
I just do that favorite version.
And so it's,
it's made things,
you know,

244
00:13:51.391 --> 00:13:52.920
like all the decision making in a,

245
00:13:52.921 --> 00:13:57.710
how should I shoot this all that time that I would've spent thinking about it.

246
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.330
Now I already have an opinion about it.
Gotcha.

247
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.760
<v 4>And as you guys are writing your characters and writing this together in the</v>

248
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:04.750
room,
um,

249
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.840
you obviously have probably strong opinions for your characters and maybe other

250
00:14:07.841 --> 00:14:09.520
characters.
Who is the most challenging?

251
00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:12.130
The right for and who is the most fun to write for it?
Well,

252
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.580
I think we had a policy for a long time and obviously the SQL kind of blew it

253
00:14:15.581 --> 00:14:20.581
out of the water but we always did was we would not cast the script until we had

254
00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:23.060
written multiple,
multiple drafts.
Cause that's what happened.

255
00:14:23.061 --> 00:14:25.450
It's like a guy when they go off to my character,
got to think of my jokes.

256
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:30.340
But if you keep it,
you know,
without being cast you can write for everybody.

257
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.550
And so we had kind of a long process where we did that.

258
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.460
This one was a little different now because you already knew what character you

259
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:39.730
were and then anything that was just fucking insane.

260
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.030
They just gave to my character.
We all right for him.

261
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.510
Those are the fun things.
It's like we have with server troopers.

262
00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:49.780
We did a table read with each guy playing different roles,

263
00:14:49.781 --> 00:14:52.460
basically auditioning to see,
you know,
for different parts.

264
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.740
I was supposed to read Farba after Kevin and so he read Pharma and then we were

265
00:14:57.741 --> 00:15:00.830
done with that and we're like,
all right,
let's go again.
Steve,
do you want to,

266
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:05.150
you ready to play fire?
But I was like,
Nah,
I think we're done here.

267
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.120
We had tried to beforehand.
Yeah,

268
00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:11.830
I tried Farba he tried Pharma and then he got Farber like you got it.

269
00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.130
Got It.
Yeah.
We're just not,

270
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.990
we're not as big a difference as the asshole course.

271
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:25.520
And when you're,
um,
when you're writing a sequel,

272
00:15:25.521 --> 00:15:28.430
a lot of times what happens is,
which does not happen in this film,

273
00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:31.010
which is really,
really rare in terms of lot of sequels.

274
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.970
They end up tending to be basically a lot of the same jokes and a lot of same

275
00:15:34.971 --> 00:15:36.890
stuff that you guys handled it really well where yes,

276
00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:40.850
you do reference me out and funny things like that and like gafcon and stuff,

277
00:15:40.851 --> 00:15:45.260
but you aren't,
you aren't retreading the same stuff.

278
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:49.340
It's like new jokes,
but kind of referencing the old,
but it's really,

279
00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:52.490
really great.
We exist in the same world that you do.
Right?

280
00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:57.491
So we're aware of the issues with comedy sequels as well.

281
00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:03.220
And so we approached it with that mentality not to go down that kind of road.

282
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.510
And there wasn't any pressure from the studio.
They'd be like,

283
00:16:05.511 --> 00:16:06.750
you have to follow this structure.
Anything.

284
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.520
The pressure is more internal studios if they financing but they didn't finance

285
00:16:10.521 --> 00:16:15.200
it.
So
amongst us there's different opinions about how much,

286
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.710
how referential should be versus you know,
versus not.
You know,
I think,

287
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:19.781
I think what we said on,

288
00:16:19.781 --> 00:16:22.700
and ultimately we would take maybe one of the old jokes and then we'd put new

289
00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:24.920
spins on it and it allows you to reference it.

290
00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:29.450
But at the same time have a new laugh and the fans,
the fans will be like,
okay,

291
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.150
you gotta a,

292
00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.710
you gotta bring back the stoners and you have to have me back to the local cops

293
00:16:33.711 --> 00:16:35.510
and you have to do pull overs and you should do the meow game.

294
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.580
We want you to bulletproof jock strap again.
For sure,

295
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.700
but don't you dare make the same movie as the first one.
Um,

296
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.190
and I guess shenanigans me out,

297
00:16:46.191 --> 00:16:49.120
is that stuff from real life that you guys are pulling from?
Yeah,
no,
no.

298
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.440
I think that's the thing.
Like we,

299
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.240
I think a lot of times we do our best writing when we're hanging out together.

300
00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:54.600
I tried to make in the movies and then you know,

301
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.740
I'll find a thing will pop up and I'll make everybody laugh and it's like,
hey,

302
00:16:57.741 --> 00:16:59.390
let's figure out how to stick that in there,
you know?

303
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.790
And that's where we ended up doing.
I want to talk a little bit,

304
00:17:01.791 --> 00:17:04.730
go back to the Indiegogo campaign campaign because there was some really

305
00:17:04.731 --> 00:17:08.360
interesting,
we did wrench in the best men at a wedding that we talked about.

306
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.280
There was one for naming rights in the film for names of characters of towns

307
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:17.700
that make it in a few people.
This guy shot,
he fits snugly,
gets his name.

308
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.550
One of my favorite lines in the movie too,
right?

309
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:27.170
I got to deliver that line and I loved it.
Yeah.
There's like four,
four,

310
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:28.120
or five names of guy,

311
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.980
people who donated an Indie Gogo and their names are in the movie in one way or

312
00:17:30.981 --> 00:17:31.400
another.

313
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.910
And it's funny because we did get studio notes on the cut of the movie and

314
00:17:34.911 --> 00:17:38.030
they'd be like,
why you say the name shotty Fitz Nutley,

315
00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:42.070
what does it or why is this Matt?
So under the,
why is that name in there?

316
00:17:42.071 --> 00:17:45.500
Why don't you cut for time?
Cut that line out.
I'm like,
wow,
they're investors.

317
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:51.780
We have to put that,
put that in,
earned it.
Um,
the most ridiculous one,

318
00:17:51.781 --> 00:17:56.520
which there were very,
very shockingly no takers.
The decent proposal.

319
00:17:56.521 --> 00:17:59.580
I'm going to read this because this is ridiculous.
This is it.
And to the Lyme,

320
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.390
if you kick in 25 million and provide our entire tire dream budget,

321
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.050
we will be so grateful that one of us will father your child and all caps,

322
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.070
selling sex as a perk isn't allowed yet.
And our wives went murderous.

323
00:18:11.071 --> 00:18:15.810
But one of us will act as a sperm donor and giving your child a celebrity DNA.

324
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.360
You don't know what you want,
not,
you don't know which one

325
00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:25.110
you put a salad spinner spending up.
Kinda guess we thought,
you know,

326
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.750
I'll be funny we do that.
And then you don't know who you're getting.

327
00:18:27.751 --> 00:18:31.890
So if your kid comes out Indian and then you know who it is or if it gets fat

328
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.420
and you know,
or short or whatever it is.

329
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.900
But maybe it's a hybrid where it comes out short fat,

330
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.730
Brown and Blue Eyes.

331
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.360
But after reading that,
I'm thinking there,

332
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.900
were there any prizes that you didn't include it because they were too

333
00:18:48.901 --> 00:18:52.110
ridiculous?
Cause that is,
I don't know how you can get more ridiculous than that.

334
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:52.950
What'd you probably can think of?

335
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.130
Which it's an interesting thing like we didn't even realize,
you know,

336
00:18:56.131 --> 00:18:58.350
a lot of this,
the crowd funding it is,
you know,

337
00:18:58.351 --> 00:19:02.760
a cost benefit analysis versus how much of your time can you spend just fulfill

338
00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:04.960
the perks versus the money you raised.
And,
and,

339
00:19:04.961 --> 00:19:06.630
and this is another thing we need from you.
I was like,
you know,

340
00:19:06.631 --> 00:19:11.631
you raised four and a half million bucks and you ended up having like 30 40% go

341
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:14.110
to the overhead of fulfilling that and then you know,

342
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:18.360
so I think it was a thing about trying to make sure that whatever we did it was

343
00:19:18.361 --> 00:19:22.770
not so expensive or time consuming,
that immediate kind of ridiculous to do.

344
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.240
You know,
I think we're going to do like,
you know,

345
00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:26.730
private screenings in people's basements or backyards have like parties,

346
00:19:26.731 --> 00:19:27.960
but it was so time consuming,

347
00:19:27.961 --> 00:19:31.440
you just could have funded the schedule to like find the time to fly to a middle

348
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:35.190
of Oklahoma and I would take a whole three days find there and partying back.

349
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:36.343
Yeah.
Gotcha.

350
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.770
Is there anything that you guys wish that you could have included in the film,

351
00:19:40.771 --> 00:19:43.890
but as you start going through the editing and stuff,
you're just like,
hmm,

352
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.380
that doesn't really work.
But then you watch the final thing and like shit,

353
00:19:46.381 --> 00:19:49.440
I wish up with that.
I mean we,
we,

354
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.790
we cut it and we try to put all the very best stuff in it.

355
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.440
I mean it doesn't,

356
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:59.340
it's not really a situation where you left out something great.

357
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.140
I think there's a timeliness issue though too.

358
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.500
Like when we shot the first one like we were talking to was 2015,
2016.

359
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.270
I mean it was,
it was,
uh,

360
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.770
it was a joke that Donald Trump was running for president and do them in 15
here.

361
00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.870
What I mean,
and now it's a different world.
So like you can't really make those,

362
00:20:12.871 --> 00:20:14.580
like you saw it last night.
We have a,

363
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.210
we have a Stephen Hawking joke in the movie and now it looks like it's in poor

364
00:20:18.211 --> 00:20:22.620
taste and it wasn't,
it was shocked too years ago.
You know,

365
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.230
what the intended to be important.
But now people were like,
oh,
you know,
so that,

366
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.590
that creates a little bit of a problem.
I said,
is there anything,
um,

367
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.510
from the first film that is,
it's a lot of it like sneaks into the pop culture,

368
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.830
like kind of general,
just when you're talking to friends,
like,
I got you good.

369
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:38.311
You fucker.

370
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:43.311
Or writing and that kind of stuff where it surprises me that people sometimes

371
00:20:43.471 --> 00:20:45.630
don't associate that with the movie.
They're like,
oh yeah,
people just say that.

372
00:20:45.631 --> 00:20:47.170
It's like,
well no,
that actually came from this film.

373
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.810
Like does anything like that surprise you guys in terms of a line that you're

374
00:20:49.811 --> 00:20:52.330
like,
I can't believe that caught on?
Yeah,

375
00:20:52.331 --> 00:20:56.380
I mean that me out thing is ended up on posters and tee shirts and people get

376
00:20:56.381 --> 00:21:00.760
tattoos of it and these are good
baseball players.

377
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:04.310
Sneak it into interviews.
But you do,

378
00:21:04.311 --> 00:21:08.560
you do like you just run across these things where you appreciate the fandom and

379
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.410
they're like,
we had someone came to our show and they,

380
00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:14.710
over the years they had collected our autographs and then they tattooed our

381
00:21:14.711 --> 00:21:17.950
autographs onto their forearm.
And you're like,
Jesus.

382
00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.870
I mean that's a fan.
There are some horrified looking fascinating.

383
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:27.990
I mean that's how we fell for like why'd you do that?
I mean that be out joke.

384
00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:33.410
<v 2>Cause we were all in a room at about four or five in the morning and we were,</v>

385
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.780
we were,
we were smoking in like a,
in a motel.

386
00:21:35.781 --> 00:21:38.510
We were all living five and we were just staying in the motel when we're

387
00:21:38.511 --> 00:21:43.511
pitching TV and we riffed on this idea that a wizard,

388
00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.920
what if a wizard turned your tongue,
uh,

389
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:51.970
into like a a cat and the and but the only way you'd know is because the,

390
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:53.060
the cat would,

391
00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:58.060
would substitute the word meow for now and we laughed about that for like hours

392
00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.280
and somebody wrote on a Napkin,

393
00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:06.340
meow equals now and then three weeks later when we were in a writing meeting for

394
00:22:07.311 --> 00:22:07.911
super troopers,

395
00:22:07.911 --> 00:22:10.220
two someone pulled up an app and you are going remember this joke and you're

396
00:22:10.221 --> 00:22:12.110
like,
yeah,
how are we going to do that though?

397
00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.080
And we kind of revamped it and rework it but it is,

398
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:17.130
<v 4>that was the scene that every,</v>

399
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.340
we went to every studio to try to get money for the movie and every studio

400
00:22:20.341 --> 00:22:23.640
passed on it and they would talk about that scene.
They're like,

401
00:22:23.641 --> 00:22:27.090
like for instance,
we don't understand this scene here on page 55.

402
00:22:27.091 --> 00:22:29.040
It's got all these [inaudible] hours.
Want to have to go like

403
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.860
two and a half pages of mostly me out.
What is that?

404
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.510
How does that advance the story?

405
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:43.650
Where's your guys' a biggest pet peeves shouldn't bother me and I know half the

406
00:22:43.651 --> 00:22:47.850
country does it,
but I hate when people say,
I'll do a Margarita.

407
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.100
I sit there,
I sit there seething,
I'm like,
William,
will you do it?

408
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.950
I hate it when a,
when a waiter says,
I've got a three lamb chops left tonight.

409
00:22:58.951 --> 00:23:03.390
I've got a nice cut of Philemon at like he,
I've got that.

410
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.480
You don't got that.
I will say,
hey,

411
00:23:06.481 --> 00:23:10.020
what a waiter asks me if I've ever been there before.
Yeah,

412
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.440
it's a nice rock and business and would order food.

413
00:23:13.441 --> 00:23:17.130
Let's do it doesn't matter if you've been there before,
I guess.

414
00:23:17.131 --> 00:23:19.080
I guess that's scares you.
Just hate restaurant.

415
00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.860
I love to see Brian Cox back and I thought that was so,
yeah,

416
00:23:22.861 --> 00:23:25.740
it's fun to see him cause he's gone like really serious.
And I'm like,

417
00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.210
so was that a struggle to get him back or was he like,
no,
I'm getting,
Huh?

418
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:33.120
Oh yeah,
it's fine.
I mean he,
you know,
he's a guy.
When you did the first one,

419
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.020
you know,

420
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:38.610
he kind of lamented the fact that he didn't get offered comedies a lot.

421
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.091
You know what I mean?

422
00:23:39.091 --> 00:23:42.030
He's a serious actor and he had to get to do comedies and a lot of these actors,

423
00:23:42.031 --> 00:23:43.560
they just want to do something funny here.

424
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.120
So when they get that opportunity they embrace.

425
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.590
<v 2>So I think when the second time came around he was happy to come back and do it</v>

426
00:23:48.591 --> 00:23:51.380
again.
He was original Hannibal and so you know,

427
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.450
everyone saw him as a serial killer.
No one really could see him.

428
00:23:53.451 --> 00:23:57.020
There's plenty of comedic role and so on.
Our script went out in the wires.

429
00:23:57.021 --> 00:24:01.250
His agents actually read it and sent us Brian's head shot and said Brian would

430
00:24:01.251 --> 00:24:03.710
love to play that part.
Wow.

431
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.500
I want to talk about rob Lowe as well cause he's also in this,

432
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:07.790
he pleads a car and

433
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.950
he's ridiculous and this and it's so funny cause he does some ridiculous things.

434
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.580
Was that tough getting him to do that?
He has gone to actually mark comedy,
um,

435
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.050
you know,
in the past few years and stuff.

436
00:24:18.051 --> 00:24:20.120
But was that tough to get him kind of on board with that?

437
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.320
I worked with rob on a television show and he was a,

438
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.580
I always joked with him that he was like a comedian stuck in the leading man's

439
00:24:28.581 --> 00:24:32.510
body because he's a very funny guy and his rhythm is perfect,
you know,

440
00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:36.230
either in parks and rec.
He's very,
very funny and he's extremely good luck.

441
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.840
Uh,
but I said to him,
I said,
do you,

442
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:44.780
would you ever consider being in super troopers?
Because yes.
Any part,

443
00:24:44.781 --> 00:24:47.960
I don't even need to see the script.
And you know,

444
00:24:47.961 --> 00:24:50.930
we have a joke in there that is,
well I'm not going to ruin it,
but it's,

445
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:54.440
it's a really outrageous joke that he has to do.

446
00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:58.970
And I'm like,
I don't want to show him that joke.
Cause he'll say no,

447
00:24:58.971 --> 00:25:00.080
he'll read the script and be like,

448
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:02.390
I can't ruin my whole reputation for this movie.

449
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:06.330
So we cut the joke and these guys were like,
we're not cutting the job.

450
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.080
You're going to make him do that Joe.
And I'm like,
I'll do it.

451
00:25:09.081 --> 00:25:09.980
Let's get them in the movie.

452
00:25:09.981 --> 00:25:13.310
So we got him in the movie and then we were shooting the scene.

453
00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:17.690
These guys are like good over there and told him to do the job.
So I did.

454
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.360
And I started telling the thing and he goes,
oh yeah,
we have to do that.

455
00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:26.160
And then he really elevated it to them.
So hopefully we don't ruin his career.

456
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:28.341
Will Sasso,

457
00:25:28.341 --> 00:25:33.341
isn't it with Canadians in terms of learning about any of the law or anything

458
00:25:33.351 --> 00:25:36.710
like that?
Because there was that border territory war.
I mean,

459
00:25:36.711 --> 00:25:41.090
I've spent a lot of time shooting television Canada,
so I have,
uh,

460
00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.560
you're worried about,
you know,
there's,
they are,
uh,
you know,

461
00:25:44.561 --> 00:25:48.230
there are obviously a smaller country by population and they're,

462
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:52.820
they're convinced that we're thinking about them.
Right.
And I said,

463
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.410
we're not right.
And they're like,
no,
no.
I mean,
you know,

464
00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.000
we all know about the,

465
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.650
the United States government supporting the separatist movement in Quebec

466
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:06.680
because they're trying to cleave,
that's their word,

467
00:26:06.681 --> 00:26:11.150
cleave the country of Canada in two so that the,

468
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.750
the u s will then sneak up and take all the western oil,

469
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:19.700
oil interests and leave the east coast.
Cause cause it's,
it's poor.
And I said,

470
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:21.280
nobody's ever said that down there.

471
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.080
So we thought that'd be kind of like,
you know,
cause that's sort of,

472
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:31.080
that's sort of,
uh,
a thing that sort of is,
is,

473
00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.710
is a part of how the Canadians feel in this movie.

474
00:26:33.711 --> 00:26:37.730
It's like they don't like us coming up there.
And it's true.
I'll tell you this,

475
00:26:37.731 --> 00:26:41.300
you guys don't know this.
This is hot off the presses.
Oh,
uh,

476
00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.800
we just received a letter,
I swear to God

477
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.170
<v 4>from,
uh,</v>

478
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:51.190
the royal mounted and police accusing us of using their IP illegally.

479
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.540
And uh,
they've said they've sent a legal letter toss now to seize and desist.

480
00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.690
It's in your inbox.
Just came in like an hour ago.
Wow.

481
00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:01.933
Did you leave?

482
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.680
That's fine.
You got Atlas,

483
00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.820
<v 3>you have to Canada.
And they're like,
you know,
we did,</v>

484
00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:15.760
we burned down the White House in the war of 18,
12,
eight.

485
00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:21.790
And you look at them funny and then,
you know,
you go look it up on Google and uh,

486
00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.460
discover that.
No,
that actually did not happen.

487
00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:27.040
They rented out their land to the British so the British could do it.

488
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.470
<v 4>Just so you know,
it's in their history books.
That's a birth though.</v>

489
00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.270
They burned down,
but they didn't,
um,

490
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.320
the success of the first movie in the fandom around it.

491
00:27:37.321 --> 00:27:41.040
Where there a lot of celebrities in Hollywood that reached out to you asking to

492
00:27:41.041 --> 00:27:44.190
be a part of the film?
I mean,
you just mentioned rob Lowe,
but,
um,

493
00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:46.200
was there anyone who was like,
oh,
I gotta be in your next,

494
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:49.630
<v 2>uh,
there,
there,
there,
there were,
and we've,</v>

495
00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.460
we've put some of them in a,
and they're,

496
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.640
they're not in the trailer because we kind of wanted to reveal a them when you

497
00:27:58.101 --> 00:27:58.934
go see the movie,

498
00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:03.670
<v 4>Hey guys,
one sequel in the Ken,
any updates on another potential sequel,</v>

499
00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.000
Aka Pot fests.
Slash smoke the problem.

500
00:28:07.001 --> 00:28:09.520
We make one and now you want a different one?
You can see it again.

501
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:10.900
I haven't seen it yet.

502
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.470
<v 3>No,
but that was actually one where it's like,</v>

503
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.910
that was supposed to be a joke at the end of beer fest and says,
you know,

504
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:18.630
you know,
really shows up and I'm a part of super secret.

505
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.260
Wayne smoke competition coming soon.
Pop Fest.
Uh,

506
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:26.010
and then all the Hollywood stoners came out of the woodwork back then.
I mean,

507
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:31.260
well Willie was like,
we are making this fuckin movie rat and Snoop Dogg,

508
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:35.640
you know,
said,
you know,
he did city sent to invited us for a meeting with him to,

509
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.590
everybody wanted to be at.
So you know,
where if the movie does well,

510
00:28:39.591 --> 00:28:41.490
if super troopers two does well opening weekend,

511
00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:43.620
then that conversation can certainly happen.

512
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:45.910
<v 4>Our Future depends on four 20.</v>

513
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.620
I think for a lot of Comedians or actors you've had like call successes,

514
00:28:53.621 --> 00:28:57.880
they often get defined in your career by that and it can probably come back to

515
00:28:57.881 --> 00:28:58.610
haunt you.

516
00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:02.920
You guys have any like Larry stories of being pulled over by the police and

517
00:29:02.921 --> 00:29:05.350
having them do things to you and just be like,

518
00:29:05.351 --> 00:29:06.610
you'd please just give me a ticket.

519
00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:11.870
<v 3>Uh,
I got pulled over and doing 120 miles an hour.
Um,</v>

520
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.090
I was driving from la up to San Jose on the five north,
if you've been on that,

521
00:29:15.091 --> 00:29:17.490
it's hundreds of miles of pure pristine,
straight black highway.

522
00:29:17.491 --> 00:29:21.000
And I was on the highway after midnight.
I was one of the only cars there.

523
00:29:21.001 --> 00:29:21.751
I was doing one 20.

524
00:29:21.751 --> 00:29:25.140
I was fired up about the fact that there were no cops on this highway.

525
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.490
Uh,
and just when I was really feeling cocky about it,
boom,

526
00:29:29.491 --> 00:29:33.510
the guy got me and uh,
this cop came up with the card.
He was,
he was so mad.

527
00:29:33.511 --> 00:29:38.160
He was like,
Mister,
do you have any idea how fast it super troopers?

528
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.010
<v 4>I like you got me.
He's like,
oh</v>

529
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.370
<v 3>my God,
you guys are hilarious.
We play all those games you guys play.</v>

530
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.020
We play the meow game.
We would play the repeater.

531
00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.470
I was like bulletproof jockstrap strap.
He's like,
oh,

532
00:29:50.471 --> 00:29:51.610
we're not that fucking crazy.

533
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.030
But then he went on to admit that super troopers was his favorite movie and that

534
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.640
his nickname was Mac after my character.
Uh,

535
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.950
and then he let me out of the speeding ticket and there we were on the side of

536
00:30:02.951 --> 00:30:07.390
the road,
you know,
taking selfies and people are driving by like,
what the fuck?

537
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.390
So that's happened to all of us by the way.

538
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.410
<v 4>Uh,
I'd love to know your favorite character,</v>

539
00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:18.520
broken lizard or otherwise that you guys have each plate or written?

540
00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.620
Yeah,
I'll say far,
but I mean I got say far because he's so fucking crazy.

541
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:24.880
It's like,
you know,
you did,

542
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:28.210
you get to do shit that you aren't really allowed to do in the real world when

543
00:30:28.211 --> 00:30:32.350
you play a crazy asshole.
You know what I mean?
And it allows me to,
I don't know,

544
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.210
be a jerk,
I think,
which I think is a lot of fun.

545
00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:39.160
But that's what we try to mix it up in our movies where one guy is the crazy guy

546
00:30:39.161 --> 00:30:40.360
or the two dimensional guy.

547
00:30:40.361 --> 00:30:43.930
And I think we all tried to lobby to get that part because that's always the fun

548
00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:45.090
farm.
Slowly,
you know,

549
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.610
<v 3>you're really good at it.
Thanks man.</v>

550
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:51.930
Really just add gum and mustache and gum and yeah,
you're off to the races.

551
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.460
It's deformed.
Uh,
I like playing,
um,
Juan Castillo and club dread.

552
00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.990
Uh,
just cause you know,

553
00:30:57.991 --> 00:31:02.991
I got to do an entire movie in a speedo and make out with everybody.

554
00:31:03.301 --> 00:31:07.770
It was awesome.
Thank you very much.
That's my dad's accent right there.

555
00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.740
<v 4>Uh,
I played a character freak your weekend puddle cruiser,</v>

556
00:31:11.741 --> 00:31:13.060
which probably no one in this room have seen,

557
00:31:13.061 --> 00:31:16.960
but it was a movie we made before super troopers and a I,
like Kevin said,

558
00:31:16.961 --> 00:31:20.230
it's the kind of far out character I played as long hippy with long hair and

559
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:21.920
earrings and uh,

560
00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.580
it was fun to go shopping for that kind of character and get into that kind of

561
00:31:24.581 --> 00:31:27.520
weirdness.
Uh,

562
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:32.380
I think I probably like playing a very bad run eth.
Uh,

563
00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:38.050
you know,
it's fun to play like a,
you know,
a male prostitute,

564
00:31:38.051 --> 00:31:39.330
but try to give it humanity.

565
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.013
<v 3>Good.</v>

566
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:46.720
<v 4>I guess my question is really about with the current industry,</v>

567
00:31:46.721 --> 00:31:51.610
with the Netflix's and the Amazon's kind of throwing a lot of money around and

568
00:31:51.611 --> 00:31:53.110
movies being made and TV shows,

569
00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:57.310
is there any interest in you guys doing some sort of a sketch comedy TV series

570
00:31:57.311 --> 00:32:00.610
or anything like that?
Obviously creating a movie is very difficult,

571
00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:02.230
takes a long time,

572
00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.530
but TV shows might be a little bit easier to pump out and allows you guys to

573
00:32:05.531 --> 00:32:08.440
kind of switch between different characters as you guys are used to.

574
00:32:08.441 --> 00:32:10.000
And you're in your sketch comedy background,

575
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:14.840
<v 3>are you offering,
I wish it's crazy.
It's,</v>

576
00:32:14.841 --> 00:32:18.230
the landscape has changed so much.
Like he used to go into ABC,

577
00:32:18.231 --> 00:32:23.080
Fox and NBC and CBS and pitch a Sitcom and you'd be like,
yeah,

578
00:32:23.081 --> 00:32:23.630
and you know,

579
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:28.430
we could do like maybe this episode in this episode and now with like Netflix

580
00:32:28.431 --> 00:32:30.350
and Amazon,
you actually have to have a finished script,

581
00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:33.680
<v 4>the whole Bible and all prepared.
And then you go,
like,</v>

582
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:38.180
when you go to like Netflix and Amazon,
those reception areas,
zoo over there.

583
00:32:38.181 --> 00:32:43.040
Now there's pockets of,
of creative teams.
They're all sitting with a celebrity.

584
00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:45.980
Like you're like,
oh,
there's Josh Duhamel and uh,

585
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.360
they're going to go and there's Ed Falco,

586
00:32:47.361 --> 00:32:49.400
they're going to go pitch a TV show with that celebrity there.

587
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:52.940
It's absolutely a phenomenal film.
I'm so excited for everyone else to see it.

588
00:32:52.941 --> 00:32:55.220
So it comes out on four 20.
Super troopers.
Two.

589
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:56.320
Thank you guys so much for being here.
Okay.

590
00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:01.410
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
