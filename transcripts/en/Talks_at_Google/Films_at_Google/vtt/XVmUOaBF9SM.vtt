00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.680
Hi everyone.
Welcome to talks at Google.
My name is Dana Han Klein.

2
00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:07.840
And today it is my pleasure to welcome David Guggenheim

3
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.130
aren't here today for,
he named me Malala.
Uh,
it was a wonderful documentary.

4
00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:18.170
Can you tell us how you got involved in it?

5
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.860
<v 2>Well,
the producers of the movie,
um,</v>

6
00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:24.100
Walter Parks and Lori Mcdonald's wanted to make a,
uh,
a movie.

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.630
They had gotten the life rights to her,
uh,
to make a movie with an actor.

8
00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:31.180
And they went and met with her where she lives in Birmingham,
England.

9
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.350
And there were so blown away they thought who could play her because they

10
00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:37.540
thought it should be a documentary.
So they brought it to me,

11
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.620
<v 1>probably a good decision.
Um,
so they brought to you,
it was an excellent decision.</v>

12
00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:44.190
So they brought it to you and all the movie.

13
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.480
I did see the movie and it was an excellent,
is there,

14
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.830
there's no one who could play her.
She's herself,
you know,
um,
what she did,
um,

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.860
on documentary played by Malala herself.
It's interesting.

16
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:57.100
I'd see that as a followup maybe.
Yeah.
That's cool.
Um,

17
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.390
so where are you on board right away?
Or were you,

18
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.760
did you have to be convinced or were you just like,
I,
I'm so excited.

19
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:02.810
I would love to make this documentary.

20
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.280
<v 2>They call me and I said,</v>

21
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.400
give me a few days and I just read everything I could read because the story of

22
00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:13.460
a girl being shot on her school bus is this.

23
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.050
But I wanted more and I wanted to know if there's something I could add to it

24
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.700
because there was a book about her and everything.

25
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.420
And I immediately fixated very quickly on this father daughter relationship.

26
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.750
You know,
he,

27
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.610
her father names her after girl who speaks out in this killed for speaking out.

28
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.080
I felt like epic Greek
thing.

29
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.770
And so she's born with this name that has all this meaning to it.

30
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.450
And it made me want to know,
you know,

31
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.700
did she become this girl just because her father named her this or because of

32
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:47.534
another reason.

33
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.460
<v 1>He sort of set her destiny possibly for her.
Um,
uh,</v>

34
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.170
one of the,
um,
I,

35
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.720
that was one of the things I noticed that it's this kind of beautiful father

36
00:01:56.721 --> 00:01:59.420
daughter story.
Um,
what,
what,

37
00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:02.060
what was it like striking the balance between telling his story because it is

38
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:04.970
such an important part of the backstory of how she came to be,

39
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:08.180
how her personality was shaped and telling her story because they are so

40
00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:09.290
intertwined.
She,

41
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.020
I think she said at one point like they were like two extensions of the same

42
00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:13.990
soul.
He says,

43
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.760
<v 2>we're,
we're like one soul in two different bodies.
And in fact,
there was a,</v>

44
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.740
one of my editors said,
we can't put that in the movie.
It's too creepy.

45
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.560
But I said,
no,
it's beautiful.
Like the idea,
and I have two daughters,
uh,

46
00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:30.550
this idea of one soul into different buddies that's attachment that they have.

47
00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:34.060
And it's really,
when you see the movie,
there's this incredible attachment.

48
00:02:34.061 --> 00:02:38.830
And I had these two daughters
and they are a complete mystery to me.

49
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.040
Like my son makes perfect sense.
It's like,
man,
you know,
we just look.

50
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.170
It's like we were,
but my daughters,

51
00:02:44.171 --> 00:02:49.171
I don't know how to talk to them and I want them to feel my love and I want them

52
00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:54.550
to be anything they want to be.
And yet I have no clue as to how to be a father.

53
00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:55.810
And so making this movie,

54
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.290
I found out that I learned from this Pakistani 7,000 miles away from my live,

55
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.200
this Muslim man how to be a father to my own children.

56
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.540
<v 1>It's interesting you bring that up,
that you connect with your son easily and,</v>

57
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.710
and,
and Malala,
his mother is this figure in this movie,
you know,

58
00:03:13.711 --> 00:03:15.210
obviously she loves her mother very much,

59
00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:18.350
but I was almost expecting to see more of her.
Yeah.
But it,

60
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.810
it kind of became clear in that she,

61
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.180
she has this very unique connection with her father.

62
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.650
Was there at any point where you're going to try and explore the mother's a

63
00:03:28.651 --> 00:03:31.050
story more or,
or is it just,
was it immediate?

64
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.730
<v 2>Everybody asks about it because of the mom is sort of hovering in the background</v>

65
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.290
and she's a traditional path tune woman and sort of being on camera seen as

66
00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:41.030
immodest.
Um,

67
00:03:41.031 --> 00:03:44.180
and so it took me very long time to get her to want to be in the movie.
In fact,

68
00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:45.350
she didn't want to be in the movie at all.

69
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.010
And then at the very end I showed them a cut of the movie.
Um,

70
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.420
and the mother whispered something to Malala and patched,

71
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:55.280
turn and Valassis my mother wants to be in the money.

72
00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.370
So I interviewed her at the last thing I did.
And so she's in the movie.
But um,

73
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.810
and if you know this family is,
I know them,
you realize that the mother is,

74
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.870
is the source of Malala is a spiritual strength and mall has this tremendous

75
00:04:11.031 --> 00:04:16.031
sense of forgiveness and right and wrong that she gets from,

76
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.640
from her faith.
And um,
she gets her mission from her father,

77
00:04:19.641 --> 00:04:23.250
but she gets to sort of steely strength,
um,

78
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.500
from her mom.
And then,
uh,
just last week corporate Chi,

79
00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:30.840
her mom gave my kids these beautiful pass tune close.

80
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.700
My kids from la are like dressing like past hands now.
It's like very smart.

81
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.800
<v 1>It's a cultural exchange.
Yeah.
Um,
well as you said,
you know,
I,
you,</v>

82
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.020
you obviously had to get to know his family to make this film.
Um,

83
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.320
and in a sense,
because you were making a film,
it's a little bit your story too.

84
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.250
Um,

85
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.390
what are the parts that you think you brought to it that helped enhance Malala

86
00:04:53.391 --> 00:04:53.870
story?

87
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.840
<v 2>That's really interesting.
Um,
did,
I made this movie waiting for Superman,</v>

88
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.760
which is about the public school system.

89
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.480
And in that case I narrated that movie and I put my opinion in it.

90
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.940
It was like an editorial,
like Davis thinks this.
Um,

91
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.760
and that's very different from this movie where I really feel like my job in

92
00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:15.510
this was to,
to pull their story out of them.
And I said to this one,
I met them,

93
00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:18.330
I was like,
let me help you tell your own story.

94
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.300
So if you were listening just casually,

95
00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:24.420
if you would think that Malala is narrating it,
she isn't,

96
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.350
but she's actually talking to me about what happened.

97
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.420
And in that discussion she tells her own story.
And so that was my,

98
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.530
I guess if I,
if you were,
say I'm in the movie is only in a,
in a choice,

99
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.210
the sense that,
um,
I decided not to tell this big political story.

100
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.310
This is like the rise of the Taliban and that part of the world,

101
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:47.520
which is a very important thing to explore.

102
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.700
But to me what was interesting is that the,
the,
the,
this,
this,

103
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.760
this universal question of what,

104
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.500
what is it about a girl growing up this role?

105
00:05:57.501 --> 00:06:02.450
What is it that makes her feel confident and what would lead this ordinary girl

106
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.190
to make this extraordinary choices,
brave choice,

107
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:11.540
to risk her life for something she believes that actually turns her into this

108
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.390
incredible person.
I wanted to know,

109
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.790
I wanted to go really deep into those choices.

110
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:17.621
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

111
00:06:17.621 --> 00:06:21.040
I thought one of the wonderful things that I got of it as an audience member was

112
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.270
Mala is this wonderful,
eloquent,
you know,
powerful,
inspiring figure.

113
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.100
But there are these wonderful little moments where she's,
she's a teenage girl,

114
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.610
Girl.
Um,
and you,

115
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.040
you realize how much kind of responsibility we've assigned to her and how much

116
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:36.670
she's taken on herself,
but then,
you know,
she's giggling about,
boy,

117
00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:41.200
she likes that.
She doesn't want to admit she likes.
Yeah.
Um,
and so for you,

118
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.680
like is that something you discovered have getting to know them or is that

119
00:06:44.681 --> 00:06:48.370
something that you had like an inkling of going into this that you wanted to

120
00:06:48.371 --> 00:06:51.130
tell?
Like a regular person,
regular person's story?

121
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.690
<v 2>Well,
now I know how ignorant I was.
Um,</v>

122
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.320
but I guess it's nice to go in when you're making a documentary to start kind of

123
00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:02.321
ignorant and educate yourself by making the movie and sort of as your world

124
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:02.691
opens.

125
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:07.691
But I really thought I knew a lot about Muslim culture and Muslim people and I

126
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:12.090
really didn't.
And so when I rang the doorbell,
other their house,
I said,
oh,

127
00:07:12.091 --> 00:07:15.050
I had all these,
all this pre conceived notions.

128
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.550
And then Malala answered the door and I went inside and there are kind of loud

129
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:21.770
and chaotic and funny and they're teasing each other.

130
00:07:21.771 --> 00:07:23.920
And Marla was punching her brother's and there,
you know,

131
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.560
she's online looking up pictures of Brad Pitt and uh,

132
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.150
and yet they're also very deep people with a sense of purpose.
And I was like,
oh,

133
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.990
their kitchen table and their family is like my kitchen table.
And um,

134
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.770
to see that ordinariness to see that she's on one hand a girl who can go up to

135
00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:47.021
President Obama and ask them a question that no adult would be brave enough to

136
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:51.140
ask.
She asked him about,
why are you sending drones into my country?

137
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.690
You know,
she was 17 at the time.
I would never dare ask that question.

138
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.550
Um,
it's probably the most sensitive question of his entire presidency.

139
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.380
People will look back and say,
why did you do that?

140
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.080
She can do that very easily.

141
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:10.680
And then she can go home and pick up her laptop.
And,
you know,

142
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.560
search for pictures of Roger Federer or it's like,
it's this double,
double,

143
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.730
double life that she has.
Um,

144
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.890
and it's important to see her that way because if you see her as this sort of

145
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:24.260
larger than life icon,
you forget

146
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.990
that she's just an ordinary girl.
And,
and,
and that's important because I want,

147
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.160
I really want this more than anything.
I want young girls to love this movie,

148
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.180
to feel like it's,

149
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.740
it speaks to them and that they can have a hero that they can believe in,

150
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.960
not just a hero that tells him that they're fat or they're dumb or they're not

151
00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:48.580
famous enough and that this girl will actually is,

152
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.200
is inspiring in a way that can,

153
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.840
can challenge girls to speak out more.

154
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.460
<v 1>I thought,
um,</v>

155
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.520
<v 2>it was,</v>

156
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.140
it was kind of lovely seeing that and it was also lovely hearing her unbridled

157
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:05.310
passion for education and not just in the context of speaking to it like the UN

158
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.790
General Assembly.
You know,

159
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.550
you asked her what her favorite book was and you looked like you'd asked her

160
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:11.430
like to make Sophie's choice or something like that.
She was just like,
no,

161
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:12.780
I can't,
I can't pick it.
And it's,

162
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.010
it's someone who likes this is a company of people who are interested in

163
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:19.020
education and further ourselves here.

164
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:21.330
I think for us it's something we very much relate to.

165
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.970
And obviously with waiting for Superman,

166
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:26.520
it's something that you're passionate about.
Um,
what,

167
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.060
what are some of the other things that you think,
um,
you know,

168
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:33.270
we can do in addition to helping Malala,
uh,
to,

169
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:37.080
to kind of push education forward?
One thing is,
is

170
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.020
there's a lot of lip service we give to education.
Yeah.

171
00:09:41.021 --> 00:09:44.160
It's really important in our kids.
I've got three kids and it's like,

172
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.950
and then it's real.
There's two messages.

173
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:49.470
One is it's really important and then you're with your friends.
It's like,

174
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.160
it's really boring and I have to go home and have to do my homework.

175
00:09:53.161 --> 00:09:57.090
It's a chore.
And when you,
when you see the story,

176
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.150
you see a girl who is,
um,

177
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.840
who loves her school,
she grows up in her school.
It's,

178
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.560
there are other girls in her town that don't get to go to school.

179
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:09.690
So it's like this precious,
precious thing.

180
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.040
And now the Taliban comes in and starts blowing up schools and starts flogging

181
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.010
girls for going to school.

182
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:19.340
So suddenly school is this the most precious thing in her life,

183
00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:21.600
which for all of us in America anyway,

184
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.530
it can be something that we take for granted or it's like a means to an end.

185
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.130
Not to do this,
to get somewhere.
And the idea that,
that,

186
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:34.180
that these ideas that our father was teaching her were precious and um,

187
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.520
and that to remind ourselves of that and that,
you know,

188
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.880
it could easily,
it could easily be taken away from us.

189
00:10:41.881 --> 00:10:46.881
And the other thing is that if you look at human beings as,

190
00:10:47.061 --> 00:10:51.720
as I do,
that every human being has some untapped potential.

191
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.590
I mean,
here,
clearly here at Google,
um,

192
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.460
people have gotten to where they are because I've had this potential that's that

193
00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:04.260
they've found a way to tap that probably is
so much more potential that,

194
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.590
that,
that,
that everyone here can still be tapped.

195
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.090
But you'd look at people who don't have an education as people who have,

196
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:17.130
we have yet to tap that resource.
And if you don't,

197
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.480
it's a very tragic thing,
but it's also what's so hard.
It's an invisible thing.

198
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:26.310
You can see refugees without a home and that's something you can look at in

199
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.540
struggle with.
But an unfulfilled potential is hidden and invisible.

200
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.910
And this idea that Malala is showing us that is what makes this story so,

201
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.643
so beautiful.

202
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.370
<v 1>Um,
and have fun today.
Um,</v>

203
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.730
I'd love to talk about a storytelling kind of device you use.

204
00:11:46.731 --> 00:11:49.400
I'd love the animation in this film.
It was beautiful,
you know,

205
00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:53.260
it was a great way to kind of not fill in the gaps but illustrate what were

206
00:11:53.261 --> 00:11:56.020
saying,
um,
in an interpretive way.
What,

207
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
how did you decide to sort of use that as a vehicle?

208
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:04.610
<v 2>I try not to make documentaries that are good for you.
You know,
that,
oh,
you know,</v>

209
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.390
do you want to see the Martian this weekend or do you want to see,

210
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.080
he named me Malala and you know,
there is some of that where you say,
you know,

211
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.340
we really should go see this movie.
And sometimes that's important,
but I,

212
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.810
I want to fight against that.
I want to tell a really good story.

213
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.760
I want people to be moved.
I want people to laugh.
I want people to cry.

214
00:12:24.761 --> 00:12:27.340
And at the end of it,
I want it to sort of move them.

215
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.970
And maybe there's a message in there,
but,
but you know,
we'll get to that later.

216
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.670
You know,
maybe you think about it on your car ride home.

217
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.720
But I like my movies to be an experience and I'm so,

218
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:41.100
I'm always to finding ways in which to tell the story in a new way.
And,
and,
um,

219
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.540
I came to this thing where it's like they're telling me the story of these

220
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:44.650
things a long time ago and it's like,

221
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:49.180
let's build an animation company in my studio.
So I,
we,
my office is in Venice.

222
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.430
We built an animation studio and we,
instead of,
you know,

223
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:59.290
having serious photos of the Swat valley now,

224
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.170
um,
I,
we got these,

225
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.100
these young animators from cal arts in California,

226
00:13:06.101 --> 00:13:10.870
and we drew these very beautiful
painterly,

227
00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:13.820
almost storybook images of their life in Pakistan.

228
00:13:13.821 --> 00:13:17.340
And it has another feeling to it.
And,
um,
so you,

229
00:13:17.341 --> 00:13:19.930
you really want to feel like you're watching a movie and your x and you're sort

230
00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:23.860
of,
you're diving into a world that's going to sort of put a trans on you.

231
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.060
<v 1>Yeah.
It's um,
I mean they were beautiful and it,</v>

232
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:32.330
it was in stark contrast to sort of the documentary footage that I'm assuming

233
00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:34.350
you guys got from the news and you know,

234
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.360
the previous historical footage of the actual kind of conditions they were in.

235
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:40.763
Um,

236
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:45.990
<v 2>one thing we're fighting against here in America and I realized it is how</v>

237
00:13:46.171 --> 00:13:48.840
ignorant I was of this very deep,

238
00:13:48.841 --> 00:13:52.470
rich culture in this very deep and rich religion.
Is it the,

239
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.600
and this is a company that's about information,
is that the,

240
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.660
the information that most Americans get of this part of the world is very

241
00:14:03.781 --> 00:14:07.860
narrow,
very negative.
And,
and we know that like,
you know,

242
00:14:07.861 --> 00:14:12.861
you get images of Isis and horrible things and not just horrible things but

243
00:14:12.931 --> 00:14:17.931
horrible things for a very long time and things that feel like they'll never get

244
00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:20.400
better.
And so when you see them as a,

245
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.240
I always think about my own emotional state is when I see these stories,

246
00:14:24.241 --> 00:14:25.920
I just want to do this.
I want to turn away.

247
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:31.470
And so I thought my job is just to introduce you to this beautiful family that

248
00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:34.780
is not that they're funny,
they're irreverent,
they're,

249
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.990
they're hilarious.

250
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.640
And the world where they lived in Pakistan was actually not a dangerous place.

251
00:14:41.641 --> 00:14:42.510
It was paradise.

252
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:47.990
And so part of this movie is about Paradise Lost and how the paradise all of us

253
00:14:48.271 --> 00:14:51.930
live in could easily be corrupted in the same way.
There's was,
you know,

254
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.620
when Malala was one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight,

255
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.990
it was a beautiful peaceful place.

256
00:14:56.991 --> 00:15:01.250
And then only when the Taliban came in did hurt that the snake come into the

257
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:03.230
garden and their world,

258
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.840
this precious world that they created was that under threat.

259
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.530
And that's so much more interesting than the narrative.

260
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:14.360
This sort of limited diet of information we get from this part of the world.

261
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.480
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,
I think you said it beautifully and it's,</v>

262
00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:20.870
it's one of those things where it's just like,

263
00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:22.790
what if that were to happen to one of us?
You know,

264
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.090
like if suddenly you couldn't go back to the place that you were born and

265
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:29.510
couldn't you be with the,
you know,
that your friends for threat of death.

266
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:32.780
I don't think that's anything we as Americans,
Westerners,
whatever,

267
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.680
ever think about crossing your minds.

268
00:15:34.681 --> 00:15:37.340
And I don't think it's necessarily something that would have crossed her mind

269
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.130
until it happened to her.
Right?

270
00:15:39.131 --> 00:15:43.310
So it's just this sort of horrifying thing to watch happen to someone who is so

271
00:15:43.311 --> 00:15:44.390
positive and wonderful.

272
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.170
And who knows what would've happened if it hadn't happened.
Right?

273
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.140
<v 2>But if you heard about Malala is a lot of us did,</v>

274
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.740
a girl got shot on a school bus.
He's like,
oh,
this is just a scary,

275
00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:57.280
dangerous place where this happens all the time.
And it's just like,

276
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.320
like the streets of Chicago,
people get killed every night.
It's like,

277
00:16:00.321 --> 00:16:02.810
it's just another thing.
Um,
but no,
it,
I,

278
00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:07.370
the story when you watch it has so much more dimension to it.
And it is,
um,

279
00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:12.371
so much so important for us to go deeper than this sort of surface story.

280
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.600
And you know,
this,
the Google,

281
00:16:14.601 --> 00:16:17.810
like you do the first search and the Wikipedia page and it tells you the first

282
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.550
two things and that's one thing.

283
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.640
But when you know how to go deeper and you can find the richness of a really

284
00:16:25.161 --> 00:16:28.370
nuanced story,
um,
that's where

285
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.880
you learn about the world in a really important way.

286
00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.760
<v 1>Did you feel a sense of responsibility telling a story?
It's,
you know,
it's,</v>

287
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.340
it's very much more all this story and as you've said,

288
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:42.810
a lot of us I think were from the,

289
00:16:42.811 --> 00:16:45.360
I hope we're familiar at least with the basic details of it,

290
00:16:45.361 --> 00:16:50.361
but this is a sort of opening up to this massive medium where people are going

291
00:16:50.641 --> 00:16:52.350
to see all of this.
Like where did,

292
00:16:52.351 --> 00:16:55.490
where did you feel your role responsibility wise came in?

293
00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.300
<v 2>If you ask my wife,
uh,
she would tell you that the most miserable,</v>

294
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.310
most consistently miserable,

295
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:08.230
like from gutter to the spare to pit of despair.

296
00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.380
I was in the below the pit of despair for about six months.

297
00:17:11.381 --> 00:17:16.381
Making this movie because I knew that this was a special story and I felt a

298
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:23.980
tremendous sense of responsibility to get it right because she's so special.

299
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:25.900
But the movie wasn't working,

300
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.350
so I would have a cut of the movie and I bring friends over and we'd watch the

301
00:17:29.351 --> 00:17:34.150
movie and people be scratching your heads and,
and um,
and I was like,

302
00:17:34.151 --> 00:17:37.900
maybe this is a movie I can't pull off.
Maybe this will suck forever.

303
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.360
And I'm only over a very long time.
We edited for 18 months,
which is a really,

304
00:17:43.361 --> 00:17:44.650
not with three editors did.

305
00:17:44.651 --> 00:17:48.400
I finally figured out sort of how to put it together because it's a very

306
00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:52.020
complicated story structure when you see it.
But yeah,
I mean I just,

307
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.880
because we don't get enough information from this part of the world because,
uh,

308
00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:03.960
my daughters don't get enough real heroes.

309
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.400
Um,
because her voice is so unique and so clear,

310
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.140
I felt a tremendous responsibility to get it right so that to the,

311
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.740
a lot of people would get to know her the way I got to know her.

312
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:18.800
<v 1>Curious to like,</v>

313
00:18:18.801 --> 00:18:22.040
what from your perspective wasn't working about it or do we not want to go back

314
00:18:22.041 --> 00:18:22.874
to that dark place?

315
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.800
<v 2>Everyone who watched it would say,
ah,
this is good intentions,</v>

316
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.840
not good film.
You know,
and you know,
it's,
it's,
you know,
you know,

317
00:18:33.841 --> 00:18:36.300
when something sucks.
So it,
it was,

318
00:18:36.301 --> 00:18:39.350
it was not good for a long time and,
uh,

319
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:43.920
sort of disjointed,
confusing,
boring,

320
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.190
Phalon suck.
Thanks for

321
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.960
<v 1>taking the time and not abandoning it and keeping at it.
Cause you know,
it's,</v>

322
00:18:51.961 --> 00:18:53.670
it's tough on any sort of project.

323
00:18:53.671 --> 00:18:56.050
I think we all know here if we want to kind of throw it away and you know,

324
00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.440
just be like,
oh,
it's someone else's prom now where I can't do it or,
yeah.

325
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.530
You know,
so it's,
I think,
yeah,
you know,

326
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.780
good things only come out of the fifth that kind of struggle,

327
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.920
<v 2>the struggle as true and,
and,
and,
you know,
when you get in a bind,</v>

328
00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.110
um,
creatively,

329
00:19:09.111 --> 00:19:13.610
sometimes it's this third your way out of it that helps you find those,
those

330
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.100
interesting ideas.
Like the animation was like that.
It's like,
well,

331
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:22.280
how do we tell the story of the girl she was named after a hundred years ago?

332
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.370
Like,
well,
you can't,
like,
what am I going to do?

333
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.740
You know,
do reenactment with reenactment with guys,
with helmets,

334
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.460
like the spears running after each other.
I like,
that's stupid.
And,
um,

335
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.890
so we're not the animate it,
you know,

336
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.460
so why not do something completely opposite,
um,

337
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.120
something you would never see in a documentary and,
um,

338
00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:50.870
why not get
this great composer,
Tom Newman,
who did the music for this movie?

339
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:51.741
Um,
you know,

340
00:19:51.741 --> 00:19:56.430
he didn't finding Nemo and Wally and Shawshank redemption.

341
00:19:56.431 --> 00:20:01.431
Then why not get a proper film composer and make it feel like a movie?

342
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.490
Like you're going to on a Saturday night.

343
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.880
<v 1>Was there kind of a magic moment for you where it came together or was it just</v>

344
00:20:07.881 --> 00:20:10.310
kind of slowly realizing like,
oh,
it doesn't suck anymore?

345
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:16.280
<v 2>Um,
yeah,
there was one screening where you just like,</v>

346
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:23.420
the lights came up and everyone would just didn't say anything and you just felt

347
00:20:23.421 --> 00:20:26.810
like they had just experienced what,

348
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:31.550
what I have experienced in getting to know her.
And,
and,
uh,

349
00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:36.080
I think for those of you who are watching and you watch this film there,

350
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.450
there is this tremendous sense of like,

351
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:43.550
wonder about her and this sense of like,
oh,
I never knew that before.

352
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:48.400
But also this sense of,
oh my gosh,
what this girl did.

353
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.580
This unknown girl from the middle of nowhere took this incredibly brave choice

354
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.200
to speak up for what she believed and she helped change the world.

355
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.180
And she captured everyone's imagination.
And when you,
if you could,

356
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:07.420
the idea of if you,
if you go through that and experience that,
um,

357
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.500
at the other end,
the audience is like,

358
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.320
and there's no describing that.
I can only just go

359
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.220
there.

360
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.090
<v 1>Yes,
it was wonderful.</v>

361
00:21:18.091 --> 00:21:20.430
And there were definitely a few moments in our screening where the air just kind

362
00:21:20.431 --> 00:21:24.300
of went out of the room in a good way.
It was just like,
yeah,
we felt it.
Yeah.

363
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.420
<v 2>I think that's what I'm always trying for us.
Like there's,
there's documentary,</v>

364
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.660
which this is a documentary,
but there's a documentary and then there's,
uh,

365
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.360
an experience that I'm working on the experience.

366
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:40.250
<v 1>Yeah.
Know you're telling a story.
It happens to be based in reality.</v>

367
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.880
It happens to be a person's story,
but it's still a story in it beginning,
middle,

368
00:21:43.881 --> 00:21:46.790
end.
And you know,
it's,
it's,
it's a journey for us all to go on

369
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.380
<v 2>and people overlook that.
Like storytelling is this,
I guess storytelling,</v>

370
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.420
but it's,
it,
it's,
and my father may document her too.
I said,
you know,

371
00:21:55.421 --> 00:21:59.560
movies or a story.
You get to learn how to tell a story.
It's a complete mystery.

372
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.580
Like what is a good story?
Like we know,
we know how to build a chair,

373
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.920
we know how to build a table,
we know how a car works,
but how do you,

374
00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.280
how do you tell a story?
And so

375
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:18.850
that itself is really delicate and complicated and complex.

376
00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:19.701
<v 1>Um,</v>

377
00:22:19.701 --> 00:22:23.120
I'd love to know what was one of the most rewarding parts of working on the film

378
00:22:23.121 --> 00:22:23.954
for you?

379
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:32.440
<v 2>You know,
I've directed movies,
I've directed commercials,</v>

380
00:22:32.441 --> 00:22:33.880
I've directed a lot of television,

381
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:39.310
and all those things are fun and sometimes inspiring,
sometimes

382
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.153
incredible.

383
00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:48.060
But the idea of making a documentary that actually has this larger thing to it,

384
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.410
there's no better feeling in the world,
like with inconvenient truth,

385
00:22:53.411 --> 00:22:58.411
the feeling like I told the story and people are are changed after having seen

386
00:23:00.161 --> 00:23:04.390
it and people are changing their lives and the conversation is moving forward.

387
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.960
And even waiting for superman where it's like,
you know,

388
00:23:07.961 --> 00:23:11.320
people are debating this and people are disagreeing with this movie or people

389
00:23:11.321 --> 00:23:15.130
are liking this movie and,
but,
but there's no better feeling in the world.

390
00:23:15.131 --> 00:23:19.250
And introducing this girl and her father,
um,

391
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:24.040
to the world is,
is such a,
a wonderful experience.

392
00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:25.130
There's no better feeling in that.

393
00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:25.950
<v 1>Um,</v>

394
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.340
so what's one of the most surprising things you've learned about Malala and her

395
00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:32.430
family during this experience and then what's the most surprising things you've

396
00:23:32.431 --> 00:23:33.810
learned about yourself during the extreme?

397
00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:38.700
<v 0>A
two parter.</v>

398
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.360
<v 2>The surprising thing is like,
it's like a grocery list of surprising things.</v>

399
00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:47.270
I mean just how funny she is,
how kind she is.

400
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.230
Like,
I got an email,
an email from her today saying,
you know,

401
00:23:51.231 --> 00:23:55.630
the movie's coming out today in la,
in New York.
And you know,

402
00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.290
I've made movies with famous actors and famous politicians and,

403
00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.380
and no one cares about me.
I'm just the director who annoys him with the camera.

404
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:08.480
Malala was a very first person of any movie I've ever made who she sent me.

405
00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:12.470
And she goes,
I know this is a vulnerable stressful day for you and,

406
00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.310
and I know that the reviews are coming out and I just want to tell you that I

407
00:24:16.311 --> 00:24:21.260
love this movie and I'm proud of you.
An 18 year old girl.
I mean,

408
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:26.120
I mean,
how,
how remarkable is that?
And she's got,

409
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.300
she's got lots of things to do,

410
00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.300
but the fact that she's just had that,

411
00:24:32.301 --> 00:24:36.830
that kind of kindness about her to reach across and think about me with is very

412
00:24:36.831 --> 00:24:38.360
lovely.
So I mean,
just,

413
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:44.190
<v 1>I don't think you could ask for a better endorsement than she,
she goes,
you know,</v>

414
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.470
you have five stars.
Do you have my FiveStars done?
So,

415
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:54.450
but I'm your favorite yourself.
Say
My last question for you is,

416
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.291
what's the subject,

417
00:24:55.291 --> 00:24:58.950
either documentary or fiction fictional that you haven't covered yet that you'd

418
00:24:58.951 --> 00:24:59.784
like to?

419
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.230
<v 2>Well,
I'm,
I feel like as a director,
um,</v>

420
00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:08.750
you have a cup

421
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:13.640
that as you tell your stories,

422
00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:19.010
the cup empties of this fluid that is full of something and you fill that cup by

423
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.660
living and by reading and experiencing things.
And so,
um,

424
00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.440
if your cup is full,

425
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:31.460
then you're ready to make a movie and when Your Cup is empty,

426
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:32.930
you should never make a movie.

427
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.410
And right now my Cup Cup is past empty that there's been,
you know,

428
00:25:36.411 --> 00:25:37.550
the dashboard has been like,

429
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.170
<v 1>can you filter mixed Metaphor Cup in dashboard.</v>

430
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:46.520
<v 2>But the idea is that like,
I should mind,
my plan is to be a dad,
but you know,
um,</v>

431
00:25:46.521 --> 00:25:49.970
there's so many stories out there.
There's so much to tell.

432
00:25:49.971 --> 00:25:54.110
There's so many things that aggravate me and make me feel passionate.

433
00:25:54.111 --> 00:25:58.820
And um,
so it could be anything.
It can be anything

434
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.210
<v 1>forward to seeing whatever that may be.
Someday.
Hi,
I haven't seen the movie yet,</v>

435
00:26:04.211 --> 00:26:05.740
but I'm very excited to watch it.

436
00:26:05.741 --> 00:26:09.610
I'm going to pick it over Martian if you gotta pick it up with the marshy.
Yeah,

437
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:14.360
yeah,
for sure.
It looks good by the way.
Yeah,
no,
I know.
But,
uh,
still some,

438
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:19.470
I'm very interested actually that how knowing and interacted with Mandela

439
00:26:19.581 --> 00:26:20.414
change.
Did you,

440
00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:22.830
<v 2>how</v>

441
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:27.270
<v 1>she impacted you in a way that especially you mentioned your relationship with</v>

442
00:26:27.271 --> 00:26:28.310
your daughters.
Yeah.
Yeah.

443
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:33.000
<v 2>So I figure,
you know,
in La,
you know,</v>

444
00:26:33.001 --> 00:26:37.080
we believe in equality and girls are equal to boys.

445
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:42.060
And um,
and over there in Pakistan,
that's a patriarchal society.
And then,

446
00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:43.773
mmm.

447
00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:48.470
Malala's father

448
00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.060
believed not only,
not only did he say she was equal,

449
00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.820
he believed she was equal and he acted on it.

450
00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.720
And sometimes when I went after I would visit them,

451
00:27:01.721 --> 00:27:04.690
I would come to home to my house and I say,
you know,

452
00:27:04.691 --> 00:27:06.070
you say your daughter's equal,

453
00:27:06.071 --> 00:27:08.830
but like when you read the newspaper and you want to share it with somebody,

454
00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.120
I do it with my son

455
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.070
and I looked past my daughter and I think,
you know,

456
00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:20.400
in Pakistan there are these really strong lines of discrimination.

457
00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:22.840
Girls can't go to school.

458
00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:28.720
All girls can have a name or girls have to wear a certain thing.
In our world,

459
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:32.860
there are much more invisible lines there.
Cues that I think girls get,

460
00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:34.690
you know,
they're,

461
00:27:34.691 --> 00:27:37.060
they're told they're equal and they believe they're equal to a certain age.

462
00:27:37.061 --> 00:27:38.860
And then there's this thing called the affiliate complex.

463
00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:43.000
If you heard this word like at a certain age,
girls start to get,

464
00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:45.050
they start to shrink.
And I,
you know,

465
00:27:45.051 --> 00:27:46.840
and I worry about with that with my daughters.

466
00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:51.900
And so I would go home after spending time with this family and calm and say,

467
00:27:52.601 --> 00:27:57.280
I have to be,
uh,
I not only have to say my daughter's equal,

468
00:27:57.281 --> 00:28:00.910
but I have to believe it and I have to act on it.
I mean,

469
00:28:00.911 --> 00:28:04.720
he took a family tree that had any,
you haven't seen the movie.

470
00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:09.070
So one of the scenes is,
uh,
when she was born,
there's a family tree

471
00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:14.910
and it's the soft side clan,
Pashtun,
Cayenne.

472
00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:20.250
And it goes back 300 years and he unrolls it and meticulously handwritten family

473
00:28:21.671 --> 00:28:26.260
tree.
But,
but on the,
on the family tree,
going back 300 years,
there are no women.

474
00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:32.550
They didn't think that you should record a woman.
So the woman's Dope,

475
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:35.020
the women,
your soft side women don't exist.

476
00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:40.960
And the day after she was born and he takes a pen and draws a line and he rates

477
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:45.790
Malala and he says,
I'm not going to just give lip service to this.

478
00:28:45.791 --> 00:28:49.630
I'm going to say that she is,
you know,
she exists.

479
00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:54.400
And there's a wonderful thing when you go to another culture is at one culture,

480
00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.880
you know,
it's like this,
um,
feedback loop.

481
00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:02.350
And so I'm telling them things about my daughters and they're saying,
oh yeah,

482
00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.210
but then suddenly they're telling me something.

483
00:29:04.211 --> 00:29:08.530
And so I learned that's what I learned.
And,
and I,
and I go home tonight,

484
00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:13.780
you know,
a different father because I met this father and this daughter.

485
00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.340
Thank you.
Thank you.

486
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.920
<v 1>It's,
it's interesting to hear you say that.
It's,
I,</v>

487
00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.800
I come from a family where there's only daughters.

488
00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:25.150
So my dad didn't have a choice in,
in terms of it did.
There's just two of us.

489
00:29:25.151 --> 00:29:26.500
But it's,
it's,

490
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:30.760
it's nice to see someone else leading by example and seeing somebody else who

491
00:29:30.761 --> 00:29:32.920
does have a dad who's equally,
you know,

492
00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:37.030
my dad's wonderful and supportive and he loves us for who we are is encouraging.

493
00:29:37.031 --> 00:29:41.770
I don't ever think I felt growing up that like I was meant to be inferior.

494
00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:46.650
You know,
we're in a very west Western society.
I grew up in the west and it's,

495
00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:50.760
oh no,
I never felt,
yeah,
unequal.
Uh,
you know,

496
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.860
encouraged to pursue education.
It's,
it's wonderful.
And so it's,

497
00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:57.850
it's really frustrating for me to see that there's people in the world who don't

498
00:29:57.851 --> 00:29:59.020
have that same opportunity.

499
00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.750
<v 2>But when you went out of the home and into college and things like that,</v>

500
00:30:01.751 --> 00:30:05.000
did you feel cues like that or didn't matter,
uh,

501
00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:09.240
meaning meaning it or even in the workplace or even in college?

502
00:30:09.241 --> 00:30:12.630
Do you feel like you always feel treated equally?

503
00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:16.960
<v 1>Oh,
no,
no,
no.
Which is,
which is why it's,
it's wonderful to have Malala as it,</v>

504
00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.840
you know,
she's this young kind of symbol of equality.

505
00:30:20.841 --> 00:30:22.820
I think she even says at one point,
you know,
we're going to better the event,

506
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:26.210
but it's not about that.
It's about,
you know,
being,

507
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:31.010
being given the same opportunities and all that,
that sort of fair play.
Um,

508
00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.360
but it's,
it's,
it's wonderful to see somebody else who had a dad who doesn't,

509
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:39.860
yeah.
Didn't treat her any differently or impact,
encouraged her to do that.

510
00:30:39.861 --> 00:30:41.900
And it's nice to hear you as a father saying like,

511
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.700
I want to look at my daughters and,

512
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:47.990
and look at them as I wanna put my money where my mouth is and you can kind of

513
00:30:47.991 --> 00:30:49.760
treat them with the same sort of thing.

514
00:30:49.761 --> 00:30:52.710
I think that's what the Malala is asking of all of us.
Yeah.
Yeah.

515
00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:55.610
If she can get you to change just in a micro way,

516
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:57.530
hopefully she made the rest of us too.

517
00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:03.150
<v 2>There's a story that her father told me that I'm still in in parts of Pakistan.</v>

518
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:06.370
Women don't have names.

519
00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:11.850
So you would go to a doctor's office and I would bring my daughter and it'd be

520
00:31:11.981 --> 00:31:16.150
the daughter of Davis or my wife.
It'd be the wife of Davis for my mother.

521
00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:19.330
My mother doesn't have a name.
It's the mother of Davis.

522
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:24.850
And so that seems like you have a name.
We have names,
we named things.

523
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:29.370
No big deal,
but heard of them having a name.
It's like the first sign of,

524
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.200
of percentage of,
of,
of,
of saying you exist.
And in fact,

525
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.120
in Nazi Germany,
the,

526
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.650
the quickest way to sort of destroy people is to say you don't have a name.

527
00:31:41.651 --> 00:31:42.640
We're going to put a number on you.

528
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:47.170
We're going to get to where dad to a number on you.
You are now nameless.

529
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:52.830
And so this idea of naming it says it has a real sort of strong kind of epic

530
00:31:52.961 --> 00:31:54.700
thing to it.
And that's why that's in the title.

531
00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:57.620
<v 1>Thank you.
That's it.
That's an important thing.
Um,</v>

532
00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.970
well thank you so much for joining us today.
My name is Malala is in theaters.

533
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.040
Thank you.
Thanks.
