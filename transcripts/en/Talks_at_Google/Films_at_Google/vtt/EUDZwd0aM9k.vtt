00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.260
[inaudible].

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.650
<v 1>Hi everybody.
Welcome.
Welcome to David Cross.
And Amy said,
Doris,</v>

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.150
I'm cliff longer already.
I work in the toxic Google program.

4
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:17.550
Thank you so much for being here.
Thanks for having a handrail.
Yeah.

5
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.380
So if you actually,
if you saw the film yesterday,

6
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:22.140
which I know we had a screening last night,
please do.
We asked,
just know,

7
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:25.530
like live tweeting of spoilers or anything as the film was not yet available.

8
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.590
So we want to make sure that that is something we take care of.
But that said,

9
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:29.790
we are here to talk about hits,

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.020
which is written and directed by David and starring Amy starring snoring.

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.120
So,
uh,
honestly,
uh,

12
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.510
let's just look at the sign for a second as I do love the tagline based on a

13
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:46.290
true story that hasn't happened yet.
Now,
if you've seen the film,

14
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.390
I might argue that it may have happened.

15
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.760
<v 2>Well,
yeah,
there's a not to give,
uh,
uh,
one of the spoilers out,</v>

16
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:56.030
but one of the things we,
that's in the film,
uh,

17
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.620
actually did happen roughly four months after we were at Sundance.

18
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:02.960
It was a national story.
I can't say it otherwise.
It'll,

19
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.370
but you know what I'm talking about.
So I felt very vindicated.
Um,

20
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.410
but that's just one aspect of this story that's happened and I'm sure it's

21
00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:15.480
happened in Florida or perhaps happening as we speak.
Um,

22
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.010
<v 1>that's said.
So what inspired you to write this particular story?</v>

23
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.710
<v 2>Uh,
and when did you write it?</v>

24
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.410
I wrote it in June of 82 and a very,

25
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:32.580
very precious ahead of my time.
I had been reading a lot h g wells and I'm,

26
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.950
no,
I wrote it,
uh,
the,
the inspiration for this particular,

27
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.900
there's two parts to this answer.

28
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.960
One is I was at a Sundance festival a couple of years ago and,

29
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.870
um,

30
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.870
I saw two particularly egregious indie films that,

31
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.810
uh,
bothered me in different ways.
Um,

32
00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.090
one was just kind of an eye rolly like boring plodding movie where nothing

33
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:04.480
happened,
but it ticked all the indie film boxes.
A,

34
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.290
I'm sure there was Glockenspiel in there at some point.
And,
um,

35
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.220
and then I saw a movie right after that,
like the,

36
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:15.720
the next day that really I hated and it was just fraudulent bullshit.
And,
uh,

37
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.520
and it was being celebrated at a,
at the film for a festival for Indie film.
And,

38
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:25.290
um,
uh,
and then I was complaining about it and I thought,

39
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:30.120
all right,
enough,
you know,
uh,
uh,
I should put my money where my mouth is.

40
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:33.660
If the,
if these things bother me,
go make your own fucking movie that you like,

41
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.890
you know,
and uh,
and quit bitching about other people's stuff.
I mean,

42
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:42.750
that's what critics do.
Um,
uh,
they don't actually create things,
I'm sorry,

43
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:46.650
they just tear them down.
But uh,
uh,
so just don't do that.

44
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:47.940
Go actually make something.

45
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.270
And then the re the second part of that answer is because of all the ideas I

46
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:57.660
kind of have floating around on little pieces of scratch paper on my desk.
Uh,

47
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.260
this is the one I,
I could shoot the cheapest,
which meant I had the better,

48
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.060
better possible.
You know,
there was a greater possibility of getting it made.

49
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.280
So I figured,
cause I live not too far from liberty.
Have a place up there and uh,

50
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.950
and a lot of the people,
you seem packed,
the waitress,

51
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.900
a friend of mine who's a at Baker's tap where your character works,

52
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:24.110
that's her bar and that's the bar I go to my wife and I go and a m.

53
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.310
So it was calling it a lot of favors and a,
and I stayed at my place,

54
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:29.020
people crashing my house and you know,

55
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.700
so that was the reason for this particular idea.
Oh Wow.
Very nice.

56
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.750
All right.
We done.

57
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.650
<v 3>Yeah.
So speaking of making the film,</v>

58
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:41.530
you use Kickstarter in order to fund part of the film?

59
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.140
<v 2>No.
Uh,
we use Kickstarter to distribute it.
Okay.
Uh,
we had made the film,</v>

60
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.050
we went,
uh,
we were at Sundance,
uh,
which was,
uh,

61
00:03:51.051 --> 00:03:55.200
a immeasurably helpful for the life of the film.
Uh,
uh,

62
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.190
and we got some offers,
you know,
you,

63
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.440
I'm not that well versed in the business end of things.

64
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.580
And that's partly by choice.
I know it's a,
it's probably stupid on my part,

65
00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.520
but I just don't follow numbers and things like that.
And I don't,

66
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:15.330
I don't care to,
but,
uh,
you know,
we,

67
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.390
the producers hired a sales agent in the,

68
00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:21.720
and this is standard for any movies at festivals.
You hire a sales agent,

69
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
the sales agent acts on your behalf to talk to the distributors who've made

70
00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:33.630
offers.
And they do this all without,
you know,
I'm not privy to that stuff.
And,

71
00:04:33.631 --> 00:04:34.464
uh,

72
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.640
and sales agents are one of those businesses that are so numerous in America

73
00:04:38.641 --> 00:04:42.600
where somebody just invents their own reason to exist and then now you have to

74
00:04:42.601 --> 00:04:45.930
use them because that's this standard,
you know?
Um,

75
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.320
and so the,
the,
but their best,
their interests are,

76
00:04:51.321 --> 00:04:54.630
and about the film or getting it to as many people as possible,

77
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:57.630
their interest is as getting as much money as possible.

78
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.640
And I don't give a shit about that.
And so the producers,
we got very standard,

79
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.710
uh,
distribution,
uh,
plans for,

80
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:09.030
for a movie like this,
uh,

81
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.380
a low budget indie movie with no big bankable stars.

82
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.930
And it was la per week.

83
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.003
<v 3>New York.</v>

84
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.560
<v 2>No.
And we got,
uh,
you know,</v>

85
00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:28.970
La for a week,
New York per week,

86
00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:32.750
and then maybe Chicago and a handful of other cities and then straight to VOD

87
00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:33.630
and apples,

88
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.290
<v 3>apples,
apples.
I,
how old am I
right.</v>

89
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:42.010
Turns on apples
and your Google play of course.

90
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.870
That's terrific.
No,
I don't know what Google is.
I,
uh,
uh,

91
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.440
I've seen the sign everywhere.
You know,
your font is complete,

92
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.070
your colors are off.
Anyway.
Um,
uh,

93
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.830
I would like somebody here though to explain to me how to get the Google ad

94
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:58.220
things

95
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.310
<v 2>off my Gmail and it just constantly coming up.</v>

96
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.730
<v 3>Well,
there will be a Q and a later,</v>

97
00:06:02.731 --> 00:06:06.990
which we'll have David asked the questions and you guys can answer ads for Uber.

98
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.550
<v 2>She's a reprehensible company and a,</v>

99
00:06:09.551 --> 00:06:13.660
and I keep getting ads for them on my phone and like,
what if I die?

100
00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:15.190
And somebody was like,
oh,
he's in an Uber.

101
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.200
<v 3>No.
Anyway,
we need to bring that back around.</v>

102
00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:21.720
You mentioned having the most amount of people see this film.

103
00:06:21.721 --> 00:06:24.000
So one of the ways you're doing that,
it's releasing it on bit torrent,

104
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.700
a bit torrent.
Vhx

105
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.280
<v 2>uh,
and,
and then,
you know,
that's,
that's a,
uh,
uh,</v>

106
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.570
a great way to get as many people to see it as possible.
And that,

107
00:06:34.571 --> 00:06:39.550
and the producers were the ones who came up with that idea.
Um,
but I was also,
uh,

108
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.330
you know,
I want people to see it in the theater.
I think it's a,

109
00:06:43.331 --> 00:06:48.160
a vastly different experience watching a film in the dark,
uninterrupted,

110
00:06:48.161 --> 00:06:52.090
no cell phone,
no pets or kids or phones or,

111
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.750
or any outside disturbance,
you know,
it's a different experience.
And,
um,

112
00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:01.090
and when we're kind of losing that,
uh,
and so,
uh,

113
00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:01.810
my,

114
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.810
so we started a Kickstarter campaign to get it into as many theaters as possible

115
00:07:07.931 --> 00:07:11.980
and now it's going to be in a 50 theaters,
theaters who would never,
ever,

116
00:07:11.981 --> 00:07:16.090
ever play in ever.
And,
um,
uh,

117
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:19.390
and I learned about,
I didn't know about three rivers,
Michigan,

118
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:22.750
never heard of it before,
but now I do because it's going to play there tonight.

119
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.670
Um,

120
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.680
<v 3>you're also having a pay as you go format.</v>

121
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.320
<v 2>Um,
pay what you want,
pay as you go well,</v>

122
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.020
<v 3>cause then we lock you in unless you paid to leave.
Um,
uh,</v>

123
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.800
but,
uh,
pay as you go.

124
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.760
You're not staying in this theater for a week,
young man,

125
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:43.760
until you can get some money from somewhere and you'll be able to see all these

126
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:48.120
first one films.
Sure.
We didn't think this out thoroughly,
but,
um,

127
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.800
uh,
yeah,
so it's pay what you want because you know,
we use

128
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.780
<v 2>Kickstarter funds to go and rent the theaters and paper the staff and all that</v>

129
00:07:55.781 --> 00:08:00.310
stuff.
And um,
and you know,
uh,
to,
to supplement it.

130
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.151
We use Kickstarter.

131
00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:05.980
So hopefully we'll be able to offset some of our costs were by people pitching

132
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:07.450
in whatever they want.
But,
um,

133
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.740
but the idea was just to get it in as many theaters and in front of as many

134
00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:16.420
people as possible.
That's why I made the film not to make $100,000 from,

135
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.390
you know,
IFC films or whatever.
Just don't,

136
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.210
not that they just use them as an example.
But

137
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.820
<v 3>so as a now a feature director,
would you do it again?
Absolutely not.
No,</v>

138
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.450
no.
Yeah,
it was great.
Yeah,
it was fun.
And it would your work with David?
Yeah.

139
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.240
<v 4>Oh yeah.
Thanks.
It was,
he was a great director,</v>

140
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:37.140
but he kept encouraging you to make stuff up,
you know,
improvise.

141
00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:40.200
You're saying what you want,
you know,
you know what's on the page.
But for me,

142
00:08:40.201 --> 00:08:41.790
when I take the time to memorize something,

143
00:08:41.791 --> 00:08:44.610
I'm so proud of myself that I know every word that I,

144
00:08:44.611 --> 00:08:47.390
sometimes I can't get that out of my head,
you know what I mean?
And I'm an,

145
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.490
I am an improviser,
so I,
but I,
for this,
you know,

146
00:08:50.491 --> 00:08:52.860
I don't think I improvised anything.
It was just also,

147
00:08:52.861 --> 00:08:56.580
it was great and I got to work with Meredith.
You Find Meredith,
by the way,

148
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.530
<v 2>that was a casting,
cause the,</v>

149
00:08:59.531 --> 00:09:02.630
the girl who was going to play Meredith,
um,

150
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.720
backed out about a month before we were supposed to start shooting it.
You know,

151
00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.160
that's,
uh,
it really fucks you up.
It's a,
it was a,
uh,

152
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.740
that was tough and we thought we were going to lose some of our investors,

153
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.000
investor money and stuff and it was really not cool.
Um,

154
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:22.890
so then we had a scramble and I went out to La and,
uh,
do you know Gina Mccarthy?

155
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.580
Yup.
Yeah.
So Jeannie,
I called genie and was like,
I've got an emergency.

156
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:31.170
Here's this script.
I sent it to her and,
and she,
cause I don't know,

157
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.110
young girls,
I don't know or I don't know that,
you know what I mean?

158
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:37.920
I don't know that world.
I don't,
I don't,
uh,
restraining order.

159
00:09:37.921 --> 00:09:39.120
I'm not allowed to,

160
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.370
but I don't know that everybody else in the film are friends of mine.
And,
uh,

161
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:46.750
and I,
you know,
called Amy and called,
you know,

162
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.520
Matt and Dave and all those people and uh,
and they were like,
yeah,
sounds great,

163
00:09:50.521 --> 00:09:54.810
but I just don't know.
And,
and Jake who's place,
uh,
Corey,
I dunno,

164
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.400
he's 16.
And,
uh,

165
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.470
so Jenny McCarthy set up a couple of weekends sessions and I flew out to La and

166
00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:04.410
we read a lot of people.
And then,
um,

167
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.510
and then I kept going back to Meredith who had gotten the script,

168
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.830
couldn't be in la,
so sent an audition,
like read the lines,

169
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:18.180
had somebody hold an iPhone.
Um,
and she was awesome.
She was great.

170
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:23.520
And,
uh,
I kept,
she was like one of my first choices.
I kept coming back to her,

171
00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:27.000
but that was reading people live and we'd have callbacks and then a third round

172
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:29.660
of callbacks for like winnow it down to like three or four people.
And,

173
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.290
and I just kept going back to Meredith and,
uh,
um,
and my wife,

174
00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:37.540
who's in the business was very instrumental and going,
you got to,

175
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.470
you got to give her the opportunity to come in live.

176
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:43.680
And so I flew back to New York because she was here.

177
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.320
And I asked UCB for their theater for a couple hours in a red her and,

178
00:10:48.321 --> 00:10:52.680
and my wife,
uh,
read along.
And,
um,
uh,

179
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.760
and then literally there were a couple of women who were on the east coast that

180
00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:59.760
I couldn't see.
So,
uh,
who were there and then we just knew it was Meredith.

181
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.710
So that's,
I'd never heard of her before.

182
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.420
<v 4>She,
I think she did soap operas.
Right.
But it was great working with her because,</v>

183
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.840
you know,
she gave it her all.
So it was easy to,

184
00:11:09.841 --> 00:11:12.970
to the expression because I'm like,
what are you doing?
Are you doing this more?

185
00:11:12.971 --> 00:11:16.500
I mean,
she was doing,
she just did it.
It gave 100%.

186
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:19.650
So it was fun to be in scenes with her cause I just felt like she was,

187
00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:21.030
she really was that character.

188
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.840
<v 2>But you,
so you didn't improvise at all,
do you?</v>

189
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.930
<v 4>I don't think so.
Maybe a word here and there,
but no,</v>

190
00:11:25.931 --> 00:11:28.300
and I just had a tooth pulled and it was a death in my family,

191
00:11:28.301 --> 00:11:33.000
so it wa I wasn't up to par.
Which one was worse.
Ooh.
Um,

192
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.260
but it also,
when I read the script,
which I thought,

193
00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.410
I mean I laugh when I got the script by laughter when everything down that made

194
00:11:38.411 --> 00:11:40.900
me laugh.
I,
it was hilarious.
But you know,

195
00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:43.780
at Burton when I said that my character would eat Doritos,
I was like,

196
00:11:43.781 --> 00:11:46.000
I can't do the to be,
I can't eat Doritos.
I just want to take a poll,

197
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.300
we can find something else saying me.
So he gave me marshmallows,

198
00:11:49.301 --> 00:11:50.910
which was great because then it gets stuck in line,

199
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:54.910
missing tooth and it was very comfortable.
Perfect size

200
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.980
<v 2>fee.
That's something could get stuck in a missing too.</v>

201
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:04.490
<v 4>I mean just had to teach you just went through the experience and stitches.</v>

202
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.040
It seems like every time I do a movie of stitches in my mouth.
Okay.

203
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.180
<v 2>No it was over a year and a half.
I had 44 total stitches I think.</v>

204
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.780
Oh my God.
Terrible.
Yeah.
So that's fine.

205
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.380
I'm a first generation American British,
so

206
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.430
<v 4>DNA is not good.</v>

207
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.350
You mentioned Amy that a,
you had to,
uh,
you did not improvise a lot,

208
00:12:27.351 --> 00:12:29.990
but is that how you'd like to work as an actor,
David,
to have?

209
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.570
<v 2>I do.
And,
and,
uh,
um,
I mean in the way,</v>

210
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.480
any anytime or any project I've done,
uh,

211
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:41.640
I've always cast with an eye towards people who are skilled or adept at,

212
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:42.390
uh,

213
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:47.390
improvising because I think you just find parts of your character that,

214
00:12:48.091 --> 00:12:52.140
that maybe I as the writer having discovered and there and there,

215
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:57.230
it's really cool and it,
and it opens up all new worlds.
And,
uh,
um,
uh,

216
00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:02.340
and I can't help but improvise sometimes,
especially if I know that the,

217
00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:06.030
they've got what they wanted that was on the page and,
uh,

218
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.670
it's almost like Tourette's from me.
They just can't,

219
00:13:08.671 --> 00:13:12.900
I'm doing scenes and I can't not do it.
And,
uh,
um,

220
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.580
I mean,
we,
we did that a lot on the,
we,
we shot a pilot.
Uh,

221
00:13:17.581 --> 00:13:21.390
we got to work together on this pilot that,
that didn't go.
Um,

222
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.300
but we had a couple of scenes and we were improvising all over the place.

223
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.330
You just can't.
And it's such a joy.
It's a fucking treat.

224
00:13:27.331 --> 00:13:29.400
And it's the thing I missed about acting in this,

225
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.120
like especially the scenes in the diner,
um,
uh,

226
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.240
a number of which aren't in the film,
the,

227
00:13:35.241 --> 00:13:38.640
there'll be in the extras just because they were too funny and it fucked up the

228
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.700
flow of it.
But,
um,
uh,

229
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.930
I so wanted to get in there and just be,
you know,
just want to play,

230
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:46.801
you want to play.

231
00:13:46.801 --> 00:13:49.770
It's really frustrating not to do that and just sit behind the thing.

232
00:13:49.771 --> 00:13:54.420
But I laughed a lot and uh,
uh,
yeah,

233
00:13:54.421 --> 00:13:57.930
I mean I always,
I always liked to make sure we get what's on the page,

234
00:13:57.931 --> 00:14:01.230
what's necessary and then just have fun.
And we,
we,
we do Todd,

235
00:14:01.231 --> 00:14:04.620
Margaret and I tell the directors,
I,
you know,
that shot,

236
00:14:04.621 --> 00:14:08.280
you want that really cool shot from up there where it kind of pushes in,

237
00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:11.730
but it's like a rack focus thing from the top of the roof that's going to take

238
00:14:11.731 --> 00:14:15.540
an hour to set up,
lose it.
Because I'd rather spend that hour,
you know,

239
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.800
with the actors finding shit.
It's much more valuable to me

240
00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.450
<v 4>and Ian Design everything.</v>

241
00:14:21.451 --> 00:14:24.420
Like at one in the bar scene that someone had made de Martini,

242
00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:27.300
but they put like an orange and umbrella and a cherry.

243
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.160
I don't know if you remember that,

244
00:14:29.161 --> 00:14:31.320
but you immediately saw to the lens and you were like,

245
00:14:31.321 --> 00:14:33.840
get that thing out of there.
Who did this?
You know,
and you would scratch it.

246
00:14:33.841 --> 00:14:34.940
But I always said,
oh,
that's good.

247
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.230
You really paid attention to those little details,

248
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.750
<v 2>lived there.
I wouldn't,
uh,
um,
I mean that's,
you know,</v>

249
00:14:41.751 --> 00:14:44.660
that's their job is to come the set director to do the right stuff,

250
00:14:44.661 --> 00:14:45.494
but it's just not,
yeah,

251
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.700
<v 4>it wasn't right for the scene.
It's called a flag.
By the way,
bartenders,</v>

252
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:51.853
<v 2>if there are any,
uh,</v>

253
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.670
<v 3>would be bartenders here.
So as a director,
writer,
actor,
stand up,</v>

254
00:14:57.671 --> 00:14:58.930
what's your favorite of the jobs

255
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.613
<v 2>craft services?</v>

256
00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.250
<v 3>I do.
I'm the guy who puts</v>

257
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.100
<v 2>the peanut butter filling into the pretzels,
the nuggets.
And um,</v>

258
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:09.540
and I,

259
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:14.540
I studied for two years abroad and a bra outside a factory outside of Beijing to

260
00:15:16.021 --> 00:15:19.570
learn how to do that.
And it is a treat.
Um,

261
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:25.170
and you see the people's faces light up when you get that Costco Tub and you

262
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:30.360
<v 3>then in the bowl of chowder.
It's so good.
So good.</v>

263
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.650
I how was crest services on own budget?

264
00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.200
How many raisins can you like?

265
00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:42.900
It was a really tiny wonder over here has the delicious,

266
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.480
<v 2>so I actually,</v>

267
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:51.160
I did one of the few things you can control and I know this from,
from,
from,

268
00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.750
you know,
uh,
working in front of the camera on so many low budget things.

269
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.390
One of the things I knew as a producer that I,

270
00:15:58.391 --> 00:16:01.000
I could control was catering and I,

271
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.090
and I said to them early before we started shooting,
like,

272
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.650
let's find some extra money,

273
00:16:05.651 --> 00:16:10.630
a little bit extra money to make catering good so that it doesn't suck because

274
00:16:10.631 --> 00:16:14.230
we're asking these people to work really hard lugging around cables and setting

275
00:16:14.231 --> 00:16:18.970
up lights.
It's in the summer and nobody's getting paid anything six day weeks,

276
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.320
you know,
just make sure you have a good lunch.
It makes a huge difference.

277
00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.530
<v 3>And the hotel had a radio that was nice.</v>

278
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:32.610
It said radio when everyone
was like,
why does it smell like chlorine?

279
00:16:32.611 --> 00:16:33.444
There's no pool.

280
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:40.340
Ended up radio only played the Casey.
Casey was top 40,
from 1987.

281
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:45.170
Bless his heart.
It's on a loop.
I have a green.

282
00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.730
You have any questions in house?
If you do,

283
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.320
there's two microphones in both the aisles.

284
00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:51.180
A I'll call on you if you're up there.
Just want to let you guys know.

285
00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.910
I'm so liberty New York,
it's a,

286
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.350
the reason you've actually filmed everything in house as you said.
Um,

287
00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.330
it's where you're living up there.
I don't live in La,
right?

288
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:03.680
<v 2>Really?
I live in a town about 22 minutes roughly.
Boy,
that is roughly,</v>

289
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.130
<v 3>it's exact,
uh,
roughly 22 minutes,
17 seconds.</v>

290
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:14.170
<v 2>Uh,
the little town dividing line.
Um,
no,
I live,
yeah,</v>

291
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.700
20,
25 minutes away.
So,
uh,
or have a place up there.
And um,
uh,

292
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.890
but when we were scouting like liberty and I just on my own,
uh,

293
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.850
actually before this,
there were producers involved when I was looking.

294
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.140
Uh,
I mean,
all the stuff you see in the movie,
all that signage that's real,

295
00:17:32.141 --> 00:17:35.750
that's there,
that's in liberty,
uh,
tons of American flags in,

296
00:17:35.751 --> 00:17:39.220
in various forms of,
uh,
of,
you know,

297
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:43.060
from new to ratty and torn.
But,
uh,
um,

298
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.560
it's,
you couldn't,
I mean,
he can't,
I mean,

299
00:17:47.561 --> 00:17:51.090
that's a lot of production value.
That's,
that's essentially for free,
you know,

300
00:17:51.091 --> 00:17:54.120
and I even toyed with calling the movie liberty for a little while,

301
00:17:54.121 --> 00:17:57.600
but liberty would have been good.
I like hits though.
It's Kinda perfect.

302
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.130
Hits has the double meaning,
which I like.
So,
yeah.

303
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.700
<v 1>All right.
So,
um,
in addition to this film,</v>

304
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.130
I know everyone here wants to hear your talk about some other things,

305
00:18:07.131 --> 00:18:07.911
so if you don't mind,

306
00:18:07.911 --> 00:18:10.910
I just wanted to ask you what it feels like to be as busy as you must be

307
00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.640
considering Todd Margaret arrested development,

308
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.560
which is something that sounds everyone's mind.

309
00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:17.170
If there's going to be another season,
if there's going to be the,

310
00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.990
<v 2>I haven't heard a thing about it.
Uh,</v>

311
00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:24.730
and not that that's out of the ordinary.
I mean usually,
uh,

312
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:29.580
Jason was really good about keeping everybody linkedin.
Um,

313
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:34.330
which would be a great name for a website that would allow like that down.

314
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.860
Will you bing and see if this
person,

315
00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:46.240
uh,
uh,
no,
I don't know.

316
00:18:46.241 --> 00:18:48.760
I haven't heard anything.
I Know Mitch is busy.

317
00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.390
I know will's doing this other thing.

318
00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:55.540
The thing about arrested that was so difficult was it,

319
00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.850
and I don't think people understand this.

320
00:18:57.851 --> 00:19:00.310
Like when it's a studio and you're doing a show,

321
00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.970
you're all these people are hired for that set period of time.

322
00:19:03.971 --> 00:19:06.970
And we weren't and it didn't go that way.
Otherwise,

323
00:19:06.971 --> 00:19:11.971
every and between a third and a half of the cast lives in New York,

324
00:19:12.071 --> 00:19:13.810
you know,
and uh,

325
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:18.040
you would have to bring her buddy out there and give him a,
you know,

326
00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.740
if he didn't live there like a stipend to,

327
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.160
to put them up in hotels or whatever it is.
And um,

328
00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:29.370
and that's where you are and you're paid to be there for eight months to shoot

329
00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:33.190
it.
And they didn't do that.
And so there was a,

330
00:19:33.191 --> 00:19:37.450
it got spread out for a much longer than than we thought it would.

331
00:19:37.451 --> 00:19:41.260
And we were getting calls,
all of us,
you know,
uh,
yeah,

332
00:19:41.261 --> 00:19:45.040
I know we just sent you home,
but can he come back Tuesday for a scene?
You know,

333
00:19:45.041 --> 00:19:49.690
stuff like that.
And uh,
that was spread out over,
um,
over a year,
well over a year,

334
00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.680
year and a half.
Um,
and so that makes it really,

335
00:19:53.681 --> 00:19:55.810
really difficult and everybody's so busy.

336
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.840
But I can't say that I,

337
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.740
I think I speak for everybody that we would love to do something again.

338
00:20:02.741 --> 00:20:03.580
It's a really,

339
00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:09.810
nobody is a unaware or unappreciative of how special that show is and how much

340
00:20:11.981 --> 00:20:16.960
fun it is and how universally loved it is a,
except in Nigeria.
Fuck them.

341
00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.990
But it's such a fun character.
Do great people to play with and great writing.
So,

342
00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.530
you know,
but I haven't heard anything at all.
Sorry,
one more.

343
00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.330
The rumors about Mr Show.
I,
uh,

344
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:35.430
Bob and I are working together to work together.

345
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.170
We have been meeting for about a month now.
A little over a month.

346
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.040
I'll fly out to la for a week.
I buy care fly back there though,
you know,
um,

347
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:49.390
and been writing stuff.
I've gotten together with the other writers and we,

348
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:54.220
I cannot say specifically what we're going to be doing,

349
00:20:54.221 --> 00:20:58.250
but we will be doing something.
We're very excited about it.
Uh,

350
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:03.040
it won't be Mr Show per se,
but it will be a sketch show that Bob and I,

351
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.410
you know,
same sensibilities,

352
00:21:04.411 --> 00:21:09.411
same hopefully same group of people and a look for it in a TB bucks soon ish.

353
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:13.220
Yeah.

354
00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.930
<v 4>And then with one than I've always wanted to work in London.</v>

355
00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.820
And is it really different to,

356
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.480
to shoot something there like the post to the United States?

357
00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:22.530
Like what's the difference?

358
00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.470
<v 2>Uh,
I,
I have not noticed the accent difference at all.</v>

359
00:21:28.471 --> 00:21:32.520
Everybody keeps mentioning it.
Um,
it's,
uh,

360
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:37.380
it's a little less,
um,
and this is both good and bad,
but it's a little less.

361
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.800
Um,
it's,

362
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.980
it's definitely more,
uh,
uh,
people don't give a shit.
There's no,
uh,

363
00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:50.730
this idea of like locking down streets unless you're this massive budgeted,

364
00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.240
you know,
if it's Sherlock or Harry Potter or something.
Yeah.

365
00:21:54.241 --> 00:21:57.600
Of course he can lock down streaks,
but you know,
it just,
you just,

366
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.820
it's not like New York or la when you're,

367
00:21:59.821 --> 00:22:03.090
when you get a big police presence that allows you to shoot the thing.

368
00:22:03.091 --> 00:22:07.590
And we with Todd,
Margaret,
our budget's so low and we have to steal so much shit.

369
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.150
In fact,
we were shooting,
we were shooting a scene in front of a,

370
00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:17.690
it was in the first series and it's when I'm first going to the pub with Sharon

371
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.590
Horgan Alice,
and we're shooting this thing and this guy walks up the street,

372
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:26.040
this,
uh,
like 55 60 year old black guy.

373
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.580
And he comes up and he sees the camera and he's like,
hey.
And he tips his hat.

374
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:34.380
And he had,
and uh,
he starts talking to us and it was just like,
that's,

375
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:38.220
it's not like they don't care.
There's no like,
oh,
you don't,

376
00:22:38.221 --> 00:22:42.660
you don't instinctively go,
I'd better cross the street.
Or,
um,

377
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.890
uh,
it just,
they don't care.
And the,

378
00:22:45.891 --> 00:22:49.380
the positive side of that is I've,
I'll go to us,

379
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.580
there's a couple different pubs here that a lot of the comic community,

380
00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:56.490
uh,
Goto and um,
there's one,

381
00:22:56.491 --> 00:23:01.491
especially in Dean Street and it's a small pub and you go and you're sitting

382
00:23:01.771 --> 00:23:03.120
there,
you're like,
Holy Shit,

383
00:23:03.121 --> 00:23:07.350
I'm sitting there with these comedy gods and everybody's having drinking.

384
00:23:07.351 --> 00:23:11.010
Nobody gives a shit.
You know,
I was having a drink with Simon Pegg.

385
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.480
Nobody gave a fuck.
And,
and you don't get that here.
People are like,
oh my God.

386
00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:15.923
Yeah.

387
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:19.250
<v 4>But did you,
and did you like living there?</v>

388
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:23.740
<v 2>I love it.
Yeah.
I,
I'm really,
I really like it and I,
if it's,</v>

389
00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:28.240
it gets very lonely for me if my wife's not there and,
uh,
um,
you know,

390
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.600
especially,
you know,
work is great,

391
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.510
but at the end of the day,

392
00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:39.250
everybody's got families or partners that they go back to and then you're just

393
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:41.140
sort of sitting there.
Sometimes they'll throw you a bone,

394
00:23:41.141 --> 00:23:44.320
they can tell you're lonely and they'll have a few drinks with you at a pub,

395
00:23:44.321 --> 00:23:46.490
but then they got to get back and everybody,
you know,

396
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.540
it's public transportation is,
is,
uh,
is,
is,
uh,
prevalent,

397
00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:54.050
but it's a bit of a mess and can be,
and,
uh,
you know,

398
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.460
in London is really spread out.

399
00:23:55.461 --> 00:24:00.461
So you find yourself from about seven o'clock on just by herself eating your,

400
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:06.800
you know,
your 28th dinner by yourself and,
you know,
um,
uh,

401
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.910
so that gets kind of lonely and,
uh,
if,
if my wife can't be there,

402
00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:15.080
but I had my dog shipped out last
the last series,

403
00:24:15.081 --> 00:24:19.250
so that was kind of cool.
Um,
but I love London.

404
00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.570
<v 3>Yes.
Dammit.
Here Allen.
Now I here hear a question.</v>

405
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.730
<v 5>Yeah.
Um,
you mentioned that Meredith was hard to cast,
but we're going,</v>

406
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.510
the other characters in the movie,

407
00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:33.410
each one seems so unique and so different from everyone else.

408
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:37.130
Regarding casting.
Did you have,
did you have anyone,

409
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.540
any actors in mind for the characters or did you know one lead to the other?

410
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.400
<v 2>Um,
I had,
uh,
early on,</v>

411
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.020
um,
I was,
I don't,
I'm not sure if I had anybody as I was writing it.

412
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.550
I think Derek waters popped into my head is Larson,
uh,
pretty early on.

413
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.130
And then,
uh,

414
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.770
I think maybe when I was doing a second draft or third draft,
uh,

415
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.090
I thought of James a dummy and early on,
um,

416
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.150
and I thought of,
uh,

417
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:14.540
Matt Walsh after doing a show with him and Improv show in which he ended up

418
00:25:14.541 --> 00:25:18.530
doing the scene that was really pointed.
It turned into a very real grounded,

419
00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:22.910
pointed thing.
And it was like,
that's my Dave stupid.
Um,
so,

420
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:27.560
and I think comics get a
short shrift,

421
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:32.330
um,
in being cast in regular dramatic parts.

422
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.180
I mean,
I,
Amy's not funny at all,
but,

423
00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.880
<v 3>and I mean the movie and Karen,</v>

424
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.860
Amy,
you can do it and it,
and you're great and you,

425
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.200
<v 2>I believe you.
And,
uh,
and I feel that way about everybody in the film there.</v>

426
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:52.610
I believed them.
You know,

427
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.611
<v 5>that was my next question.</v>

428
00:25:53.611 --> 00:25:57.180
If you had to like convince anyone to do it or if anyone was like David Cross,

429
00:25:57.181 --> 00:25:58.710
who's this Schmuck,
I don't want to work with him.

430
00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.580
<v 3>Well,
I wasn't going after 90 year old bud billion.</v>

431
00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:10.250
Nobody said WHO's this schmuck?
But,
uh,
um,

432
00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:15.750
I didn't know people still use that word because
I don't think,

433
00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.890
I mean,
well,
there was the girl who I did it,
I

434
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.300
<v 2>know who I knew through a friend,
um,</v>

435
00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:26.090
who bailed on the,
the one it was going to be Caitlin.
Um,

436
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:31.200
I won't say her name,
but uh,
uh,
outside of that,
everybody,

437
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.330
yeah,
everybody kind of jumped at it,

438
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.460
like really went out of their way to make it work too.

439
00:26:35.461 --> 00:26:38.550
Like a lot of the people who came in from La,
we're,
you know,

440
00:26:38.551 --> 00:26:40.840
we're good enough to figure out their schedule.

441
00:26:40.841 --> 00:26:45.600
So I didn't have a problem with anybody.
Really.
Thanks.
Yes,
sir.

442
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:50.580
<v 6>Hi.
Uh,
this is a question for Amy.
Um,
I,
yes,</v>

443
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:56.060
I love your work.
Um,
I'm curious,
uh,
if you could talk at all about,
uh,

444
00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:00.800
projects you're currently working on or future projects you're looking at.
Um,

445
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.300
and I was wondering specifically,

446
00:27:02.301 --> 00:27:06.590
are you going to be working at all with Stephen Colbert in the future?
Uh,

447
00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:08.660
with his,
uh,
upcoming new show?

448
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.820
<v 4>Hey,
I know called bear has asked me to be a guest on the show already,</v>

449
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.100
which is fine.
I'm looking for,
I think Steven's going to be great.

450
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:15.870
Everything's Steven does is great.

451
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:20.100
I'm going to Miss Letterman and I missed the Colbert report,
you know.
Um,

452
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.460
and right now Paul Danella and I are working on a writing project and I'm trying

453
00:27:23.461 --> 00:27:26.070
to have a baby.
Just kidding.
Usually that people grow up.

454
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.000
Got this new wig made for myself.
Crystal.
He'd be the wings on the heart.

455
00:27:35.001 --> 00:27:35.541
She holler.

456
00:27:35.541 --> 00:27:40.160
I flew to North Carolina a scoliotic so that you can get a baby.

457
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:41.733
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

458
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.750
<v 4>the Heather lawless wig that she wore in the Archie all are,</v>

459
00:27:44.751 --> 00:27:46.450
but it's got more bald spots on it.

460
00:27:46.451 --> 00:27:51.200
It's Denise and I paid $3,000 for it and I can't wait to bring it alive.

461
00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:54.350
I mean,
I go to bed like this thinking,
okay,
who is this woman going to be?

462
00:27:54.351 --> 00:27:58.520
I can't do Heather's character.
So,
um,
I'm just obsessed with,
and I'm just,

463
00:27:58.521 --> 00:27:59.660
it's just something for myself.

464
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:02.480
It sounds queer to say I'm going to go play and my wig,

465
00:28:02.481 --> 00:28:03.520
but that's what I'm going to do.

466
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.450
<v 3>But that's awesome.</v>

467
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:09.670
<v 2>Come up with characters and start figuring out who they are and what,</v>

468
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.500
<v 4>yeah,
that's,
I love nothing more than that.
So yeah,</v>

469
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.140
<v 2>I do.
I do the same thing with bud plugs.</v>

470
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.760
<v 3>So tell me
about,</v>

471
00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.300
I get a new one in the mail and I'm like,
who is this guy?

472
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.140
Three dimensional.
Yeah.

473
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.880
<v 4>Flood characters.
The grounded</v>

474
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.300
<v 2>thank you also for Amy.
Um,
yeah,
it basically asks the same question.</v>

475
00:28:33.301 --> 00:28:37.680
I loved your work with Stephen Colbert and Paul Denelle,
strangers with candy.
Um,

476
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.470
were any of your lines a improvised

477
00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.080
<v 4>cause?
He said some crazy things like it's hard to,</v>

478
00:28:43.081 --> 00:28:45.810
because not everybody provisors so it's hard when you're in a scene with

479
00:28:45.811 --> 00:28:48.990
somebody who does and they're scared to death if you change the script,
you know,

480
00:28:48.991 --> 00:28:52.140
but we left some wiggle room for that.
And when we were writing it,

481
00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:56.280
we certainly did.
We'd sit around and then we'd get up on our feet like the,
uh,

482
00:28:56.281 --> 00:28:59.940
the,
uh,
the cafeteria scene where I first meet little nut,
you know,

483
00:28:59.941 --> 00:29:03.900
when I like you take you take care of my baby.
Um,
we were up til three 30,

484
00:29:03.901 --> 00:29:06.690
four o'clock in the morning and improvising that scene because we had no idea

485
00:29:06.691 --> 00:29:10.980
where that episode was going to go.
And David Cross,
you did an episode and um,

486
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.370
we were,
uh,
lamb blood had to get thrown in my face.

487
00:29:14.371 --> 00:29:16.230
It was so hard not to laugh at him.

488
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.590
And then I knew that blood was coming and I only was going to have two chances

489
00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:20.970
cause I'm cause I'm wardrobe.

490
00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.050
But that show was a blast because there's nobody who's in charge.

491
00:29:25.051 --> 00:29:29.010
We were in the woods doing a show that nobody,
you know,
it was like five 30,

492
00:29:29.011 --> 00:29:32.510
Sunday.
I mean,
knew,
know what he was going to watch that.
So,

493
00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.440
and we didn't know we had fans till we did Wigfield and then all the ugly people

494
00:29:36.441 --> 00:29:39.680
came out and we were like,
who are these people?
And we were like,
oh my God,

495
00:29:39.681 --> 00:29:43.180
there's a stranger new candy.
They know,
and that's when we noticed that,
you know,

496
00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:47.830
we had followers.
Okay.
I'm happy with that kind of audience.

497
00:29:47.831 --> 00:29:52.270
The uglier,
the better.
That's great.
Yeah.
Awesome.
Thanks.

498
00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.980
Yes.
Hi.
I have a one quick question for each of you.
Um,
to David,

499
00:29:57.981 --> 00:30:00.530
one of my favorite movies of yours is run money run.

500
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.530
I was just wondering if there's any chance for a sequel.

501
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.540
<v 2>I mean,
if we did that character as a 50 year old,
uh,</v>

502
00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.620
I,
we're left running.

503
00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:15.810
<v 4>Okay.</v>

504
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.520
<v 2>Uh,
I,
I would,</v>

505
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:22.350
I would love to get the chance to do that idea.
Right.
Um,

506
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:27.000
uh,
you know,
we,
there's,
we talked about a lot,

507
00:30:27.001 --> 00:30:29.720
but that movie was not what we intended and it,

508
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:33.160
it got cut together in a completely different way.
And,
uh,

509
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:37.200
then we had a desired,
but,
um,
I don't think,

510
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:41.640
I mean it's a fun character do and it kind of comes from like early stand up

511
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:45.630
that just from growing up in Georgia.
But,
uh,
I just,

512
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:50.280
I think maybe I'll do an older version of a,

513
00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:51.510
I dunno,

514
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:56.110
<v 4>there'll be role whiny role in his wheelchair.
Okay.
Um,
and then to Amy,</v>

515
00:30:56.111 --> 00:30:58.130
I love your work on broad city.
Um,

516
00:30:58.131 --> 00:31:01.240
and I just wanted to hear a little bit about kind of how you work with,
um,

517
00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.330
Alana and Abby.
And that was a blast.
I went to,

518
00:31:04.331 --> 00:31:07.630
I wear a size five shoe and I went to wardrobe and they handed me size nine.

519
00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:10.660
I was like,
perfect.
I totally knew what the show was going to be,
you know,

520
00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:13.840
so I had a word tube socks,

521
00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:17.140
but that was a character I've been working on for a while.
So it was a nice,

522
00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:17.740
you know,

523
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:22.360
I kind of got to use it a little bit on that show and that there was a lot of

524
00:31:22.361 --> 00:31:25.630
Improv with those girls are really still a really,
really funny.

525
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.360
I that was a great,
great time.

526
00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:33.280
That needs to be watching the new episodes in the season.
Yeah.
Hilarious.
Yeah,

527
00:31:33.281 --> 00:31:38.210
that was funny.
Size nine shoe.
Yes.
So,
uh,

528
00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.620
I think a lot of New Yorkers go and try and do Improv,

529
00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:45.280
like situational Improv and kind of casual way and you can go watch shows

530
00:31:45.281 --> 00:31:46.900
everywhere.
It's like sort of an entry point,

531
00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.860
but it seems like such a big step to improvise as a character.

532
00:31:50.861 --> 00:31:53.830
You really understand and be consistent.

533
00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:58.060
And that wig anecdote really like sparked my imagination of how you're figuring

534
00:31:58.061 --> 00:32:01.120
out who these people are and getting ready to improvise,
particularly.

535
00:32:01.121 --> 00:32:02.980
And this applies,
I think for both of you guys.

536
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.970
Is there a certain process you have when you're figuring out who someone is so

537
00:32:06.971 --> 00:32:11.890
that you can be spontaneous about that as opposed to,
you know,
a more,

538
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.790
a predetermined character?
Well,

539
00:32:13.791 --> 00:32:18.020
I feel comfortable if I have a mole or a hump or a wig.
And I know people say,
Oh,

540
00:32:18.021 --> 00:32:20.390
you're just hiding behind that.
And I'm like,
okay,

541
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.100
that's fine that I'm hiding behind it,

542
00:32:22.101 --> 00:32:25.610
but I just feel like I need to feel something different.
You know what I mean?

543
00:32:25.611 --> 00:32:28.440
Just something to give me a little hook.
Uh,

544
00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:32.600
when I just look like myself or yet improvising,
he'll,
you know,
it just doesn't,

545
00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.080
it's not,
it's not as fun for me.
So I prefer to have,

546
00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.770
that's why I like English shows,
you know?
I mean,
I know those,
the real teeth,

547
00:32:39.771 --> 00:32:44.630
but you know,
I like how broad they can be and really put it out there.

548
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:48.100
But for me personally,
and it helps if I have a little something,
it does,

549
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:52.880
you know,
unusual like a mold or a hump or wig or something like that,

550
00:32:52.881 --> 00:32:55.000
that to Sarah and scar or anything.

551
00:32:56.350 --> 00:33:00.220
<v 3>I mean,
I posted it.
I feel like the place,
I know it's there.</v>

552
00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.720
I know that butt plug is in me.

553
00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:10.050
<v 2>Uh,
yeah.
I mean I would concur that it's,
he,
it's um,</v>

554
00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:15.380
putting on any kind of accoutrement uh,
gives you an idea.
Um,

555
00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:16.781
I remember when,

556
00:33:16.781 --> 00:33:21.520
when Bob and I were starting to write Mr Show and there was a,

557
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:25.090
we were in,
uh,
this,
the shitty offices,
tiny,

558
00:33:25.091 --> 00:33:27.610
tiny little shitty offices in Hollywood.

559
00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:32.380
And in one of the drawers somebody had left,
uh,

560
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.260
the hat,
uh,
which was a cap with a ponytail,

561
00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:42.370
like sewn onto it.
So He'd put on the cap and that became grass valley.
Greg,

562
00:33:42.371 --> 00:33:45.370
there was no concept prior to that to putting on this hat.

563
00:33:45.371 --> 00:33:49.850
Go and look at this thing.
It was like a bad sketch about a bad improv group,

564
00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.550
taken hats out.
And then,
uh,

565
00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.110
but we just started playing around with that and that became grass valley Greg

566
00:33:56.111 --> 00:33:58.310
and then built this idea around it.
Um,

567
00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:03.360
but he also looked like the guys I lived in Cambridge for a little while and um,

568
00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:08.560
all those kind of molecular biology guys who brew their own beer and ride those

569
00:34:08.561 --> 00:34:13.440
recumbent bikes to work and um,
he looked like that guy too.
Anyway,
uh,

570
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.520
I hope that answered your question.

571
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:17.103
<v 3>Planes</v>

572
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:21.560
<v 4>straight like when you were in law and order or even boss,
because you're funny.</v>

573
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.420
It's like Bill Murray,
you know your niche,

574
00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.790
you want to laugh even though they're playing perfectly straight,

575
00:34:25.791 --> 00:34:27.860
but you're just so good at that.

576
00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:30.920
And I always think about you when I have to play something straight and you
just,

577
00:34:30.921 --> 00:34:35.030
you just do it.
And,
but yet,
you know,
he's still want to laugh at you,

578
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:37.580
but you're really good at just playing completely straight.

579
00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.040
<v 2>I've got a funny face.</v>

580
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.680
<v 3>Yeah,
no it not your face,</v>

581
00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:45.990
<v 4>just the energy you put behind it or something,
then it's good.
Yes.</v>

582
00:34:45.991 --> 00:34:46.830
So the guy in the beard

583
00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.120
<v 1>to continue in the Mr show vein,</v>

584
00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:53.710
I just wanted to let you know that I'm out of every DVD,
blue ray.

585
00:34:53.711 --> 00:34:58.510
Anything I've ever owned,
nothing has more watchable factor to it than that does.

586
00:34:58.511 --> 00:35:00.730
I've,
I've seen that probably hundreds of times.

587
00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:04.210
I just wanted to let you know that,
uh,
what's this law and order,

588
00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:08.510
<v 3>Ms Mr Show?
Oh yeah.</v>

589
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:12.240
So good break.
Cause I have

590
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:15.450
<v 2>DVD of the uh,</v>

591
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.200
NBC nightly news from August 14th,

592
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:22.370
19 that I,
I have watched a million.
Yeah.

593
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.321
Think of it.

594
00:35:24.321 --> 00:35:27.830
There's a price of milk rose cause it's something had happened in Korea.
But,
uh,

595
00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:33.550
<v 1>what do you,
do you,
I sorry if I missed this.
Uh,
I came a little bit late,</v>

596
00:35:33.551 --> 00:35:35.380
but do you do any work with Bob Anymore?

597
00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.660
<v 2>Yeah,
uh,
um,
Bob and I over the years have,
have done,</v>

598
00:35:39.661 --> 00:35:44.040
we've done some benefit stuff,
uh,
and we will write sketches for that.
And,
uh,

599
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.820
and we,
uh,

600
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:51.260
did a Mr Show tour and then we did put out a book last year,

601
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.630
two years,
something year and a half ago,

602
00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:59.820
which was a compilation of a couple of movie scripts.

603
00:35:59.821 --> 00:36:04.410
And then other sketches that we wrote that never made it,
um,

604
00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.190
uh,
in part because run running run was such a dismal failure.

605
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.730
And so we had these and we were like,
we're never going to make,

606
00:36:11.731 --> 00:36:14.280
these were never going to get a chance to make them,
you know,
these are,

607
00:36:14.281 --> 00:36:17.730
these are made written by and meant to start,
you know,

608
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:22.440
the guys in their early thirties,
and it's just not who we are anymore.
And,

609
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:28.080
and rather than just keeping,
you know,
staying on the shelf,
uh,
we put those out.

610
00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:32.700
So we toured behind that.
Um,
and this is just last year,

611
00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:37.890
a year,
what?
It was like a year.
Wait,
what is it now?
It's a 24,

612
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.440
2015,
but I'd be,
okay.
So,
uh,

613
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:44.100
it was like a year and four months ago,
something like that.
Sorry.

614
00:36:44.101 --> 00:36:47.040
I Ms. Wall of not,
I,
I can't Google it.

615
00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:53.780
<v 3>Um,
uh,
and,
uh,</v>

616
00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.880
<v 2>and we,
we have a master number of sketches that,</v>

617
00:36:58.881 --> 00:37:00.600
that we'd like people to see and,

618
00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:05.900
and we knew that the 20th anniversary of the first year Mr Show was coming up.

619
00:37:05.901 --> 00:37:08.840
So,
um,
you know,
we,
we are,

620
00:37:08.841 --> 00:37:13.070
we're in talks about doing it and we will do something.
I promise.
I know it's,

621
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.600
it's a,
I don't,
not to jinx it,
but it's going to happen.

622
00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.090
So we've been getting together.

623
00:37:20.091 --> 00:37:24.560
I leave for la on Sunday and I'm going to be there.
I mean this is all,

624
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:27.240
you know,
we're ready to go and uh,

625
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.580
I'm not back home until mid July cause I got to go straight to London as soon as

626
00:37:31.581 --> 00:37:36.260
we're done there.
Tip for a tod Margaret.
So,
um,
I'll miss you all.

627
00:37:36.261 --> 00:37:40.830
I think how the city has grown and changed.
Um,

628
00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.500
but yeah,
at least Sunday for La and we'll be there working on it.
Cool.

629
00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.110
Well please pass my compliments along to Bob as well.

630
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:52.780
<v 3>Just has to compliments on the bottom as well.</v>

631
00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.930
I'll make sure you guys absolutely.
Yes.

632
00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:01.140
<v 7>Hi.
Yeah,
thanks for coming.
We have such,
um,
two days in a row now.</v>

633
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.620
Really funny people that are also associated with UCB.

634
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.510
<v 3>Dick Cavett was here.
Yeah.
And,</v>

635
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:14.460
<v 7>um,
so there are a ton of people that go through UCB for classes,</v>

636
00:38:14.461 --> 00:38:18.150
which means there are a lot of people who love Improv and love to be funny.

637
00:38:18.151 --> 00:38:20.700
And uh,
those classes fill up really quickly.

638
00:38:20.701 --> 00:38:24.750
And I wonder if there is a site linkedin already for business people where we

639
00:38:24.751 --> 00:38:29.751
connect and we sometimes have mentors that we reach out to or we connect this

640
00:38:30.391 --> 00:38:33.630
improv people in some way or other.
These are not the Improv people.

641
00:38:33.631 --> 00:38:38.200
So I'm imagining that Improv people have their own way of reaching out and

642
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.131
networking.

643
00:38:39.131 --> 00:38:43.930
And I wonder if you can give us some inside insights into maybe if you are a

644
00:38:43.931 --> 00:38:46.780
mentor for others or if others are mentors for you.

645
00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.130
<v 2>I know I you're talking about,
um,
I think this is right.</v>

646
00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:57.170
There's the third Barstill from the left counting as you walk in the door of

647
00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:02.480
McManus McManus tavern.
There's always notes left under there.

648
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.700
<v 7>That's,
that's,
I mean it's a little archaic</v>

649
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.280
<v 2>can it's old school,
but that's how improv people connect with each other.</v>

650
00:39:09.281 --> 00:39:11.660
And then they'll say,
yeah,
even though

651
00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:17.440
they're not tech savvy at all.
Uh,
uh,

652
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.200
and I,
I truly didn't understand that.

653
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:25.110
<v 7>Well,
yeah,
sorry,
sorry.
It probably was not a question.</v>

654
00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.340
Um,
so the question is,
uh,

655
00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.100
do you find time to mentor others and how do you connect with those people and

656
00:39:32.101 --> 00:39:36.630
do other people also become your mentors?
Is it like this official thing,

657
00:39:36.631 --> 00:39:39.960
Sheryl Sandberg's book?
It's like,
don't ask for a mentor,
but then a Google,

658
00:39:39.961 --> 00:39:43.460
they're like,
ask for a mentor cause they'll help,
you know,

659
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.330
I think lesson learned is don't trust Google.

660
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.970
<v 2>Well not officially.
I don't know of people who really,
I mean,</v>

661
00:39:51.971 --> 00:39:56.950
I'm sure there are some who kind of,
uh,
more,
uh,
in a,
in a structured way,

662
00:39:56.951 --> 00:40:01.630
mentor somebody.
But I,
I don't know of anybody off hand.
Uh,
uh,

663
00:40:01.631 --> 00:40:06.190
I'm trying to raise my wife and that's a difficult thing to do.

664
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.580
Um,
and,
and guide her through this world.

665
00:40:09.581 --> 00:40:13.360
It's a full time job.
It is.
And,
uh,

666
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:18.820
um,
but I don't,
I don't really do that.
I mean in the,
I mean,
look,

667
00:40:18.821 --> 00:40:23.680
we,
we all help people along and that's one,
one of the great,

668
00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:27.430
uh,
um,
unspoken things,
you know,
uh,

669
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:31.600
or underappreciated things about comics in this industry and comic actors and,

670
00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.340
you know,
uh,

671
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:39.140
we all bring people up and a I'm,
and,

672
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:44.050
and encouraged other people to hire them and work with them and take people who

673
00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:47.360
you know,
deserve a chance.
You know,
I,

674
00:40:47.361 --> 00:40:51.130
I got my start on writing on the Ben Stiller show.
I was a guy in Boston,

675
00:40:51.131 --> 00:40:55.570
nobody had heard of.
And,
uh,
and that's where I bet Bob Actually,
and,

676
00:40:55.571 --> 00:40:57.490
um,
you know,

677
00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:02.520
so I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Janeane Garofalo Ben Stiller and Judd

678
00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:07.300
Apatow.
I wouldn't be sitting here.
And,
um,
I saw tenacious d at a,
uh,

679
00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:12.520
a place called a Al's bar and something called no talent night in downtown la a

680
00:41:12.521 --> 00:41:16.140
long time ago,
you know,
brought them into like said,
hey,

681
00:41:16.141 --> 00:41:20.560
I'm doing these series of shows.
So,
and then they in turn brought people in and,

682
00:41:20.561 --> 00:41:24.630
um,
and Bob,
uh,
uh,
are,
is,
