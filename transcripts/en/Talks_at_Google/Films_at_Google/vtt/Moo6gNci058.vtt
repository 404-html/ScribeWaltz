So the,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.340
I can't

49
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.560
see the light to get assault as God damn

tissue.

54
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.960
You can build your life on promises,

55
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.320
promises to try it

56
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.410
out.
And I can work,

57
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:17.460
I can outwait your disdain to all this nonsense

58
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.330
<v 0>come hell or high water
floods.</v>

59
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:54.463
<v 3>Hello?</v>

60
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.823
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

61
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:45.130
<v 4>Hello.
Hey,
uh,
so first off,
thanks for coming.</v>

62
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.600
I appreciate it.
Um,
I'm going to,

63
00:15:47.601 --> 00:15:50.530
I want to start with like some broader questions and then sort of work my way

64
00:15:50.531 --> 00:15:54.910
down to more specific stuff about your work.
I like your strategy.
Thank you.

65
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:59.560
Um,
so first question is like in tech,
so we have this,

66
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:07.030
we have a huge,
one of our buzzwords is pivoting.
Okay.
Um,
and you know,

67
00:16:07.031 --> 00:16:10.630
you've,
you've done academia,
you know,
you went to Princeton,
Yale,

68
00:16:10.631 --> 00:16:15.340
all but dissertation,
you,
you know,
movies,
TV shows,

69
00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:19.090
Expos,
Californication and now music.
So I guess my question for you is,

70
00:16:19.091 --> 00:16:23.200
you seem to have to pivot

71
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.450
novels too.
I wanted to ask you more about that later as well.
Um,

72
00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:33.310
I read Bucky fucking done.
You did.
Yeah,
I did.
Um,
so yeah,
you seem to

73
00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.870
be giving compliments later on.
Um,
so you seem to have

74
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.560
compliments off the top,
but anyway,
go ahead.
Okay.

75
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.010
So you seem to have pivoted a lot successfully in your career.

76
00:16:48.011 --> 00:16:51.850
So how are you able to do it?
What sort of challenges did you face?

77
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:57.270
<v 5>Uh,
well,
I mean,
I just think,
uh,</v>

78
00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.630
it's not that I get bored so easily.
I just think I just have,

79
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.400
I've looked for other modes of expression to,
uh,
convey whatever it is.
I,
I've,

80
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.130
I feel I was put here to convey.

81
00:17:08.131 --> 00:17:12.430
So just finding different ways of expressing whatever it is on my,

82
00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:15.830
my mind or my heart at the time.
So,
um,
you know,

83
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:20.870
I started out as a writer on published and then I became an actor and then I

84
00:17:21.481 --> 00:17:23.550
went back to being a writer,
actor,

85
00:17:23.551 --> 00:17:28.140
and then I discovered music and started writing,
you know,
lyrically that way.

86
00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.640
And uh,
also rediscovered myself as a prose writer at the same time.
So,

87
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.660
I don't know,
it wasn't really like intentional,
it's more just like,

88
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.850
I don't know how to,
how to phrase it in a way that makes total sense,

89
00:17:41.851 --> 00:17:46.550
but it's just like looking for another,
a window out,
uh,

90
00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:51.570
or window open,
uh,
to communicate something through that open window.

91
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.990
I've lost it now,
but,
um,

92
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.230
I think about your question.
Um,
you know,

93
00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.800
had afforded me a lot of opportunity cause I had notoriety as an actor to be

94
00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:06.630
given a listen as a,
as,
as,
as a musician or a read as a,

95
00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:11.210
as a novelist.
Uh,
at the same time though,
you know,
I'm open to attacks,

96
00:18:11.211 --> 00:18:15.780
so just,
you know,
being a dill a ton.
So it's both.
Uh,
I get,
uh,

97
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:20.460
I get an opportunity to reach more people than I probably would if I didn't have

98
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:23.850
any kind of notoriety,
but also I don't get taken seriously.
Like,

99
00:18:23.851 --> 00:18:26.700
what the fuck are you doing?
You know,
you just stay in your own lane.

100
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.060
<v 4>Yeah.
Is Your,
uh,
is your Twitter,
um,</v>

101
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.180
taglines still Dillard taught?

102
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:36.720
<v 5>No,
but that's good.
It was when I used to actually involve myself in it.</v>

103
00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.850
<v 4>Yeah.
When I first of all we do is still tight.
I really like that tagline.</v>

104
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:46.190
Bring it back.
Right.
Okay.
Um,
yeah,

105
00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:48.350
so I guess my second like,

106
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.160
so I think from a lot of your writing,
like I said,

107
00:18:52.161 --> 00:18:54.620
I read Bucky fucking dent.
I really enjoyed it.

108
00:18:54.621 --> 00:18:58.130
You can talk more about it if you want it to is uh,
David's second novel.

109
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.000
It's set in.
So the main character lives in the Bronx.
Much of it is,

110
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.300
it's like all set in New York.
Yeah.
I'm in hell or high water.

111
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:10.310
A lot of your songs also reference New York and your first album.
So,
um,
you know,

112
00:19:10.311 --> 00:19:14.330
what are your favorite New York bonds?
Um,

113
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.310
where can we find you on like a random Tuesday night?
So,

114
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.620
<v 5>uh,
I grew up in New York,</v>

115
00:19:22.621 --> 00:19:26.010
so it's in me just as a reference,
you know,

116
00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:30.780
it has all this feeling for me and,
and uh,
I,
I don't say that I love New York.

117
00:19:30.781 --> 00:19:32.700
I'm not one of those guys.
Like,
I,
I kind of love,

118
00:19:32.701 --> 00:19:37.680
hate it with a emphasis on hate a lot of the time.
So,
um,

119
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.560
I find myself just writing about it in a weird way.

120
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:44.530
As much as I always talk about leaving it,
uh,
just I'm,
I'm,

121
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:49.440
I feel like I'm destined to never leave it in some way.
Um,

122
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.040
even though I think I've been trying to leave it for most of my adult life.

123
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.040
So I think that's kind of the push pull with me in New York.
I mean,

124
00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:57.570
I grew up not far from here.
I grew up,

125
00:19:57.571 --> 00:20:00.600
I told you 11th street in second half of year and it's all,

126
00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:02.820
it's all very different now.
But,
but you know,

127
00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.880
this is my favorite neighborhood of New York.
The,
the East village is the,

128
00:20:06.881 --> 00:20:08.830
and the,
and the West village.
Um,

129
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.810
to me that really has a lot of nostalgia because I used to hang out.

130
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:17.670
I did hang out here.
Um,
there was a movie theater where the equinoxes now,

131
00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.940
which is just tells you everything you need to know about New York,

132
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.590
on Greenwich since and uh,
and 12th

133
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.230
<v 4>I think it is.
Okay.
Um,</v>

134
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:36.130
so I think I want to get a little more into your current album.

135
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.440
Um,
I know that some of your songs,

136
00:20:39.441 --> 00:20:42.860
I think spiral was written by your bandmates yeah.

137
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:48.250
Marvel son was kind of a collaborative effort.
I assume you the rest is solo.

138
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.173
Do you prefer

139
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.980
<v 5>really solo?
But the,
the other ones would have been songs that I,</v>

140
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:58.720
I first wrote on my own and then brought to the guys and we worked on him.

141
00:20:58.721 --> 00:21:03.340
So yeah,
I guess the inspiration would be solo and then,
you know,
the,
the,
uh,

142
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:06.730
the actual execution of them would be more of a team effort.

143
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.750
<v 4>I see.
Do you prefer like one over the other?</v>

144
00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.700
<v 5>I'm just not good enough to really bring it home myself.
I mean,
I'm not,
I'm not,</v>

145
00:21:13.701 --> 00:21:16.740
uh,
I'm not like a skilled musician and,
uh,

146
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.780
I throw chords together and put words and melodies on those chords.
And then,

147
00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.490
you know,
when we first started working,

148
00:21:22.491 --> 00:21:25.740
I will introduce you to the guys when they come back up.
Um,

149
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:30.740
if they haven't left already,
I left.
Um,
you know,
it was like,

150
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:33.710
they were like,
oh,
this song needs a bridge.
And I'm like,
ah,
what's bridge?

151
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:39.260
So architectural question,
I didn't understand.
So,

152
00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.960
so it's been a learning process for me,
collaborating with them,

153
00:21:41.961 --> 00:21:45.670
I'm sure a learning process for them.
And I will say that,
uh,

154
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.420
one of the good things about working with somebody who has no education in that

155
00:21:50.421 --> 00:21:55.421
particular field and just as feel is that I may I make mistakes that are

156
00:21:56.181 --> 00:21:59.240
interesting.
Sometimes I make mistakes that are horrible sometimes,

157
00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.820
but I also make mistakes that are interesting and that,
that might,

158
00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.590
that might make sense here at Google.

159
00:22:03.591 --> 00:22:07.760
I don't know how they tell you to be in the culture or whatever.
They feel fast.

160
00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:12.650
I don't understand what that mean.
It means if you're on a bad road,

161
00:22:12.651 --> 00:22:13.610
get off at quickly.

162
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.710
<v 4>Yeah,
I guess like make mistakes but learn from them fast.</v>

163
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.320
<v 5>I used to always quote this backup thing was,
was fail again,
fail better.</v>

164
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:27.070
I wonder if,
uh,
if,
if it's been ripped off by you guys.

165
00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:28.830
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

166
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.640
<v 5>Fast.
Alright.
Feel fast.
I'm going to ponder on that.</v>

167
00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.900
<v 4>Um,
yeah.
So related to that,
um,</v>

168
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:42.230
a little Birdie told me or some publication I read that,
um,

169
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.910
you didn't pick up a guitar until like,

170
00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:49.740
you didn't learn guitar until like three years or so before hell or high water.

171
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:53.880
Yeah.
Um,
is there a reason why,
like first of all,
I guess,

172
00:22:53.881 --> 00:22:58.290
do you regret picking it up so late and was there a reason why you chose to,

173
00:22:58.291 --> 00:23:02.300
you know,
self learn versus get a teacher or you know,

174
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.130
when you obviously have the resources right.

175
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.840
<v 5>It did.
We just got to check in.
We can afford guitar lesson.</v>

176
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:19.920
<v 0>Good.</v>

177
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.060
<v 5>You guys want to take it over?
Um,</v>

178
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.360
I,
uh,
well,
you know,
it's a good question cause I actually have an answer for it,

179
00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:31.690
which is,
uh,
I didn't want any homework.
I mean,

180
00:23:31.691 --> 00:23:34.840
I didn't want it to feel like I was doing it for anybody.

181
00:23:34.841 --> 00:23:39.130
I just wanted to teach myself the chords and the songs that I wanted to play on

182
00:23:39.131 --> 00:23:43.840
my own in my room by myself.
And nobody ever asked me to sing as he,
you know,

183
00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:46.760
that first song was rough.
I have trouble,
you know,

184
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:50.090
I mean it's like my pitches learned.
So I,
nobody ever said,
you know,

185
00:23:50.091 --> 00:23:52.730
David's got to be in the choir because we got to hear that voice saying,

186
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.230
so there I am.
There I am,
you know,

187
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.750
learning my chords and singing as best I can in my room.

188
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.910
And the last thing I wanted was to have to,

189
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.790
all my life I've been doing homework as you,
as you referenced,

190
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:07.910
I've been in school.
When I,
when I act,
I got to learn lines.

191
00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:12.530
I got to show up prepared.
I have homework every day.
I didn't want homework.

192
00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:16.280
I didn't want somebody to have to,
you know,
you did not practice David,

193
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.960
you did not do your scale.

194
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:20.630
So I just want it to be fun without any kind of pressure.

195
00:24:20.631 --> 00:24:23.540
So this is the only time in my life it's ever been.

196
00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:27.230
Everything I've ever done was for somebody else's appraisal.

197
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:31.910
So it makes no sense that I would actually bring out this music for other

198
00:24:31.911 --> 00:24:35.030
people's appraisal at this point.
But that's,
that's where I'm at.

199
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.920
<v 4>So you want to keep it as your own thing,
right?
Just you.</v>

200
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.900
<v 5>Well,
no,
obviously not.
Obviously not.
I,
I bring it out,
you know,
I,
I,</v>

201
00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:47.910
at some point I started to feel like it was worthwhile and it was good and I

202
00:24:48.191 --> 00:24:49.060
wanted to share it.

203
00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.210
And it has a lot to do with the guy who just spoke Brad Davidson.

204
00:24:52.211 --> 00:24:56.230
And he was really pushing me to,
you know,
get better and,
and,
and so this,

205
00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.550
you know,
so the songs are worthwhile.
Um,
and so,
you know,

206
00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.900
it was just me being pushed eventually.
And then it's just ironic that,
you know,

207
00:25:04.901 --> 00:25:07.390
something that started out just for me,
uh,
you know,

208
00:25:07.391 --> 00:25:09.880
ends up being something that I do in public.

209
00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:15.230
<v 4>Um,
I also,
I think in the Cambridge sort of,
um,</v>

210
00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:15.811
<v 5>it's just,</v>

211
00:25:15.811 --> 00:25:18.840
I can never get all those guys to come to my house with all their stuff and set

212
00:25:18.841 --> 00:25:20.580
up in my living room.
So I got to do it out here.

213
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.890
<v 4>Um,
I think in the,
in the Cambridge performance set,
uh,</v>

214
00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:29.530
so David also performed in our Cambridge office.
You're joking that,

215
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:34.420
you know,
people used to tell you like,
don't sing.
Like,
you know,

216
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.200
they're told you like you weren't a senior and then you got a voice teacher.

217
00:25:38.201 --> 00:25:42.550
And that's of reminded me of kind of the age old question of like talent versus

218
00:25:42.551 --> 00:25:45.880
grit.
Yeah.
Um,
I don't know.
I wanted to get your thoughts on that.

219
00:25:45.881 --> 00:25:48.230
Like you're obviously a great singer.
No,
no,

220
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:52.650
<v 5>no,
but,
but I,
but I,
but I have a voice,
you know,
and,
uh,</v>

221
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:57.520
and I get up there and I sing.
Um,
well I,
I,
you know,
um,

222
00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.790
I can,
I'll make mistakes,
you know,
um,
um,
pitchy like the Santa American idol,

223
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:05.930
you know,
pitchy,
but grit versus talent.
I think grit is a talent.
You know,

224
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.180
I played a lot of sports in my life and I've seen guys with tons of talent,

225
00:26:11.181 --> 00:26:15.520
but no grit.
And you kind of tend to blame people with no grip,
uh,

226
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.660
in a way that you wouldn't blame somebody with no talent.

227
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:21.110
And I really do believe that grid is a talent.

228
00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:23.890
I don't know if it's learned or if it's genetic,
but,
um,

229
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.360
it's one thing I've tried to teach my kids as a resiliency.

230
00:26:26.361 --> 00:26:29.490
I guess that's another word for it,
is the ability to,

231
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.760
to keep at something when you suck or,

232
00:26:31.761 --> 00:26:34.910
and that was one of the reasons why I took up guitar aside from wanting to

233
00:26:34.911 --> 00:26:39.180
please myself in my room was I had young kids and I,

234
00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.530
I was adamant that I would find something that I didn't know how to do.

235
00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:46.470
And I wanted them to beat musicians,
not for their job,

236
00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:49.830
but I just wanted them to have that opportunity in their lives.
And I thought,

237
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:52.950
well,
you know,
I'm always preaching at them that you got to keep working,

238
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.260
so I'm going to show them I'm going to work,
you know,

239
00:26:55.261 --> 00:27:00.060
I'll try and get better at this thing that I'm not good at.
And you know,

240
00:27:00.061 --> 00:27:01.940
lucky me,
they both play guitar.
My,

241
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.620
my son's actually a really good guitar player at this point,

242
00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:09.570
so a way better than me.
So,
um,
you know,
when you start young there's a,

243
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:13.410
there's a real advantage,
but,
um,
there's jam together,

244
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:19.290
you know,
if I sneak in like,
like he,
he doesn't want it.

245
00:27:19.291 --> 00:27:22.680
He doesn't,
he doesn't want me there,
you know?
But if I sneak in with a guitar,

246
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.110
you know,
if he's playing,
he'll heal me.
But he plays,
he,

247
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:32.830
he loves like the music that I grew up with.
He listens to like late 60,

248
00:27:32.831 --> 00:27:36.500
70 students.
He's playing a wish you were here by pink Floyd and he's like a,

249
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:39.490
he's on a time warp or that I love and I hope he never gets out,

250
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:44.030
<v 4>I guess.
So in this,
um,</v>

251
00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:49.850
<v 5>big fan of grit,
I guess I'm a fan of talent as well.
Okay.
But a thesis.</v>

252
00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:53.660
Yeah.
I,
I,
I'm all,
I'm all about the grip.
Okay.

253
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:57.690
<v 4>Um,
so I guess in this album you,
um,</v>

254
00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.730
I know like one of the songs,

255
00:27:59.731 --> 00:28:03.570
Jericho is a song kind of written to your father.

256
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.650
Do you have any songs that you particularly are hold close to your heart or

257
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:09.810
you're kind of,
yeah.
Agnostic?

258
00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:15.500
<v 5>Well,
I'm agnostic with a yearning for something greater.
Sure.</v>

259
00:28:15.501 --> 00:28:19.580
I think we all have to be joined with something greater than our selves or our

260
00:28:19.581 --> 00:28:23.600
Egos.
But,
um,
I,
I think,
you know,

261
00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:26.480
all the songs I was thinking like,
oh,
I'm at Google,

262
00:28:26.481 --> 00:28:30.200
I'm going to say something really clever that all the songs are like,

263
00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:34.310
and I don't know what writing code is,
but all the songs are like writing code.

264
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.570
Language is like writing code.
I don't know what writing code is.

265
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.880
Let me just emphasize that.
But the language is a code.
We think of languages,

266
00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.150
something that's opaque and transparent to our thoughts,
but it's not,

267
00:28:50.151 --> 00:28:52.640
it's an act.
It's an actual code and it's,
it's,
uh,

268
00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.630
it's slippery and it's,
it's inexact.

269
00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:01.670
And so when I write songs,
I love that fact.
When I,
when I speak,

270
00:29:01.671 --> 00:29:04.020
I don't love that factor.
When I try and make my heart clear,

271
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.090
my mind clear to somebody,

272
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.580
then it's frustrating because words are always inadequate.

273
00:29:07.581 --> 00:29:12.530
But in a song they can,
it can get much bigger than,

274
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.320
you know,
the code you're writing about something,

275
00:29:15.321 --> 00:29:18.860
but it's coding for something else.
I,
it's not what code means.
I know I,

276
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.610
so forgive me,
but I just had that thought coming over here.

277
00:29:22.611 --> 00:29:27.500
But what was the question?
Jericho's about my father coded.
Yeah.

278
00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.340
A lot of my songs,
like half life is,
you know,
the code is,
you know,

279
00:29:31.341 --> 00:29:34.460
you could say it's divorce,
you could say it's mid life.
You know,

280
00:29:34.461 --> 00:29:36.800
there's many different ways into that song.

281
00:29:36.801 --> 00:29:41.801
And I deliberately vague specifically vague enough to,

282
00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:46.660
to make it both personal to me and hopefully universal to other folks.

283
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.570
<v 4>So it's like as any artists,
you leave it up to the interpreter,</v>

284
00:29:49.571 --> 00:29:50.500
you put it out there.

285
00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:56.710
<v 5>Well,
yeah,
I mean I think any song,
I mean,
you know,
I,
I could,
I could,</v>

286
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:59.800
I could sit you down and I could walk you through a song and tell you what I

287
00:29:59.801 --> 00:30:02.980
thought I was writing.
And that will be interesting if you said,
well,

288
00:30:02.981 --> 00:30:06.370
actually I thought that song was about this and hopefully what you're,

289
00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:08.040
your interpretation wouldn't be about,
well,

290
00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:10.510
something happened in David's life and he did this and he did that,

291
00:30:10.511 --> 00:30:15.460
but it would be like to your life.
Um,
so yes,

292
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:18.190
there's something especially less about movies,

293
00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:22.930
television and novels and more about music,
which to me is very much,

294
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:25.310
you give that to other people and you,

295
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:29.640
you'll let them kind of make it their own for them.
You know,
that's,

296
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:33.580
this song now belongs to you and you make it mean what you want.

297
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.640
I think more than the other art forms,
songs are really like that.

298
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.900
<v 4>So before I ask this final question,
if you,</v>

299
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.630
if anyone in the audience has Q and a questions,

300
00:30:43.631 --> 00:30:46.900
you can start lining up and the two microphones on the side now.

301
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:53.500
No one's getting up.
Okay.
Um,
wow.
I think,
I think,

302
00:30:53.501 --> 00:30:56.140
um,
you know,
a lot of us who work here,

303
00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:58.290
<v 5>you want it,
you guys want to ask me anything?</v>

304
00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:04.350
<v 4>So a lot of us who,
you know,
I think people in general strive to keep improving,</v>

305
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:08.520
right?
So,
and like you put out an album and now we have a second one.

306
00:31:08.521 --> 00:31:11.580
You have three books are,
sorry,
you have two books out.

307
00:31:11.581 --> 00:31:15.240
Now you have a one forthcoming miss subways in,
oh,
sorry,

308
00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.210
a third one coming out in May,
miss subways.
Um,

309
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.240
how do you approach your work and just like continuing to

310
00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:25.500
<v 5>improve?
I think he's just improved by doing,
you know,</v>

311
00:31:25.501 --> 00:31:29.290
I think that's how I learned how to be an actor.
I'm,
and I was lucky enough to,

312
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:34.230
to get a job.
I started fairly late for,
I thought,
you know,
at 27,

313
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:39.090
27 ish,
I had gone to graduate school,
as you mentioned,
summer job.
Right.

314
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.510
Well,
and it turned into that.
Yeah.
So,
so I really,
uh,

315
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.650
was lucky in that one of the first jobs I got was,

316
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:48.990
was the x files and I got to go to,

317
00:31:48.991 --> 00:31:53.250
I had to work every day for like 14 hours a day being an actor.

318
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:57.900
And after a couple of years of that,
I,
I learned,
you know,

319
00:31:57.901 --> 00:32:01.050
but I didn't know.
I thought I knew,
I guess what's,

320
00:32:01.051 --> 00:32:04.500
what's blissful is that if you think you're better than you are in the
beginning,

321
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.130
that's,
I don't know how you can teach that to somebody,
but it's like,

322
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.650
have more confidence than you should have.

323
00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:14.820
And then you go forward and you try things and then eventually as you get actual

324
00:32:14.821 --> 00:32:17.730
experience you realize,
oh no,
you actually sucked back then,

325
00:32:17.731 --> 00:32:19.980
but that time has passed and now you're okay.

326
00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:23.850
You're actually so you don't have to worry about it so much unless it's my case

327
00:32:23.851 --> 00:32:26.580
when it plays in reruns and you get to watch how bad it was.

328
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.590
<v 4>All right.
Uh,
we're going to open up for Q and.
A.</v>

329
00:32:31.591 --> 00:32:36.591
I guess we'll start here cause there's more people there and Hey David,

330
00:32:36.991 --> 00:32:40.280
how are you?
I'm Sarah,
sir.
Hey,
uh,

331
00:32:40.281 --> 00:32:44.930
so you're clearly a multi talented artist as we saw you perform today.

332
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.440
Curious to know which musicians dead or alive have inspired you to make your

333
00:32:51.621 --> 00:32:53.480
music or any favorite songs.
Yeah.

334
00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.290
<v 5>Um,
well I mean</v>

335
00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:01.890
to say that I'm inspired would,
would be to say that I could actually,
you know,

336
00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:06.050
do something in the vein of them on purpose.
I can't do that.
I'm in a more,

337
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:09.210
a more of an unconscious like songwriter.
Cause like I said,

338
00:33:09.211 --> 00:33:12.900
I'm not schooled in that way.
So if I tried to write a Beatle song,

339
00:33:12.901 --> 00:33:16.640
I couldn't do it.
But certainly I feel inspired by the Beatles or,

340
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:21.090
or petty or,
or Bowie or,
you know,
sly and the family stone.

341
00:33:21.091 --> 00:33:25.550
And I do want to get a little more funky in my music.
You know,
I want,

342
00:33:25.551 --> 00:33:29.760
I want a little more slack.
Go George Clinton.
That's a little too funky.

343
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.870
Atomic dog.
Yeah.
Some of them like that.
I mean,

344
00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:38.010
I'm really sly and the family stone for me,
uh,

345
00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:44.190
uh,
you know,
even like seventies,
like,
like,
like,
uh,
Ohio players,
you know,

346
00:33:44.191 --> 00:33:46.170
stuff like that.
But,
you know,
I don't even know.

347
00:33:46.171 --> 00:33:50.010
We got to talk about doing shit like that.
Ready?
Yeah,
we're ready.

348
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:54.590
A Fleetwood Mac is another band that I really liked the sound of,
uh,
you know,

349
00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.960
the stones I love,
but I don't know how I'm influenced by them,
but you know,

350
00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.980
you definitely have a petty,
petty,
petty welcome.

351
00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:04.343
Thank you.

352
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.930
<v 4>Hello.
Um,
I'm also a native New Yorker.</v>

353
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:12.570
I appreciate what you said about loving it and wanting to leave it.

354
00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.840
I'm actually leaving to move to La and I was wondering if you could give any

355
00:34:15.841 --> 00:34:19.560
advice to a New Yorker moving tail.
I whom?
What to do

356
00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:23.893
<v 5>sunscreen.</v>

357
00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:33.290
I love La.
I got to say,
I think if people want to leave la too.

358
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.740
I Dunno.
Where are you going to move in la?
You don't know?
You don't know where?

359
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:41.540
I'm not sure.
Maybe Santa Monica.
Sure.
You've got your,

360
00:34:41.541 --> 00:34:45.170
you're fine.
You know cinema.
I love Santa Monica.
Venice.

361
00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:49.310
I love if you come from New York,
you kind of want to see the ocean I feel.

362
00:34:49.311 --> 00:34:52.910
And then I always,
I always like to see the ocean.

363
00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:55.280
So that's kind of where I've lived in La.

364
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:58.520
I feel like I like to see the end of the world,
the edge of the world.

365
00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:02.120
I like to see the edge of the world.
I see no more people.

366
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:04.543
Just fish.

367
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.400
<v 4>Hi David.
Thanks for coming.
My name's Tibi.
Um,</v>

368
00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.980
my question for you is I think fans of yours,

369
00:35:11.981 --> 00:35:14.500
we all know you for your sense of humor.

370
00:35:14.501 --> 00:35:16.840
And I think even back in the x files days,

371
00:35:16.841 --> 00:35:19.790
we saw you inject humor into what could otherwise be like really dramatic

372
00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:22.960
character.
And then you kind of finally got to explore that in California cation.

373
00:35:22.961 --> 00:35:24.580
So my question is,

374
00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:28.600
was starting out in such a serious character and kind of a serious world,

375
00:35:28.601 --> 00:35:30.100
was that kind of,
um,

376
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.390
almost a struggle to be able to show that side of yourself or tap into it?
Um,

377
00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.860
<v 5>well,
it was more,</v>

378
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:42.770
it was more like a PR perceptual thing for others because the,

379
00:35:42.771 --> 00:35:45.090
the character was so well,
it was dry,

380
00:35:45.091 --> 00:35:48.390
but you had to be paying attention if you wanted to think of Mulder was funny.

381
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.380
It was very easy to,
to,
to think of him as not funny at all.
So,

382
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.760
and it was important for me always to,
to inject that as you say,
into the show.

383
00:35:56.761 --> 00:35:58.380
And it was always something,
you know,

384
00:35:58.381 --> 00:36:03.070
even going back to the last time we did it this year,
it's just,
um,

385
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.160
the fighters always,
you know,

386
00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:09.510
me wanting to make it funny and real and the studio saying,

387
00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.130
but people are dead.

388
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:18.000
And to me that this was never a good enough argument,
you know?
Um,

389
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:22.860
to me the funny is the gold of it,
you know,
so,
uh,
so it was more,

390
00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:26.250
but it was more when I was coming off the show just to,
uh,

391
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.060
people didn't perceive me that way.
No other people didn't perceive me that way.

392
00:36:30.061 --> 00:36:33.660
I'm at,
it's just,
I don't look funny,
I think,
I dunno,

393
00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:38.070
I don't look like I'm going to be funny or something.
So yeah,

394
00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:39.740
I had a struggle with that a little line.
It was a,

395
00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:44.500
it was also finding the right comedy for me.
I mean,

396
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.970
when I,

397
00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:49.970
when I got off the x files is the first time it was really the hay day of like

398
00:36:49.981 --> 00:36:53.420
a,
you know,
Ben,
Ben Stiller and,
and uh,

399
00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:57.740
even going to like Jim Carrey,
Steve Corral will Farrell on these,
these,

400
00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.940
this is a different kind of comedy than I do.
And,
um,

401
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.280
so I was kind of for Lauren about all that,
I was like,
Hey,
you know,
I can't,

402
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.290
I can't go against those guys doing that stuff.

403
00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:12.510
I was looking for more like seventies style comedy in the movies.

404
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.690
So when I took Californication was really like,
oh,

405
00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:18.190
that's kind of when I can do this,
you know,

406
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:22.050
articulate in that way and not knock a Manchild,
not like a boy,

407
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:26.100
like a a man in a man's world and whatever,
you know,

408
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:30.720
doing that stuff.
So I thought I could do that.
Definitely.

409
00:37:30.721 --> 00:37:31.560
It was super hilarious.

410
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:38.540
<v 6>Hi,
I'm Cory.
Thank you for coming in.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

411
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:43.020
you've worked in a lot of different mediums,
TV,
film,
usually like writing.
Um,

412
00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:45.980
and they all have really different ways of pulling in your creative process.

413
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:50.790
Which do you really prefer?
What do you think reflects your work as an artist,

414
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:54.810
collaborative work or kind of individual heads down in your room alone?
Work?

415
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:57.210
<v 5>Well,
both.
I mean,</v>

416
00:37:57.211 --> 00:38:01.470
I think the novels represent my most selfish,

417
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:05.370
just me in a room,
you know,
I have an editor and he edits me,

418
00:38:05.371 --> 00:38:09.830
but it's really just,
that's just coming from,
from me.
Um,

419
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:13.010
that's not collaborative.
Um,
it,

420
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.940
music is very collaborative with the band.
I need it.
Um,

421
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:21.540
film and television is by nature,
extremely collaborative.

422
00:38:21.541 --> 00:38:25.560
And I love that I'm a good director.

423
00:38:25.561 --> 00:38:27.390
Hires is like a good president,

424
00:38:27.391 --> 00:38:32.010
hires people who are better than he is or she is at the things that he or she

425
00:38:32.011 --> 00:38:35.230
doesn't do.
And we see what happens when

426
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:41.010
that doesn't happen.
Although it's,

427
00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:44.650
it's almost an impossibility to think of somebody who is not better than our

428
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:47.230
current president at anything.

429
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:52.990
And yet he finds people that are less better at it than he is.
Interesting.

430
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.010
Um,
so that's what a director does.
So directors,
uh,

431
00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.790
like the immune system of the film,
he like,

432
00:39:00.791 --> 00:39:03.080
he keeps all the bad ideas out and let's all other,

433
00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.940
it's other people play with our good ideas.
So I really enjoy it.

434
00:39:06.941 --> 00:39:08.830
I do like to collaborate very much,

435
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.640
but there came a time when I wanted to sit down and just write in my own voice

436
00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:17.230
and that's what the novel is kind of represented.
I'm sorry guys,

437
00:39:17.231 --> 00:39:21.730
we don't have time for any more questions.
Um,

438
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:26.860
yell it out.
Well,
I'm Elmont why my mom,

439
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:30.210
<v 7>David,
do you and your band have a name?</v>

440
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:34.860
<v 5>Chihuahuas?
I can't remember which was the hand that I modeled.</v>

441
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:36.533
Oh yeah,

442
00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.320
it was before this Bulova watch catalog.

443
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:45.930
<v 7>Do you and your band hub</v>

444
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:49.970
<v 5>for one more song?
Yeah.
Cool.
You asked if</v>

445
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:53.390
there was a song that was meaningful to me.

446
00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:57.190
So actually the last song that we're going to do,
uh,

447
00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:02.150
also involves my father.
Um,
it's called stranger in the sacred heart.
And this,
uh,

448
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:07.280
we were touring in Europe and we were in Paris and I went to this church called

449
00:40:07.281 --> 00:40:11.060
the sacred heart,
which is in the neighborhood of the hotel.
I was staying at him.

450
00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.250
I was told by the folks there that,
uh,

451
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:16.900
the people,
uh,

452
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.530
the custom there is to pray for others,

453
00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:26.320
not to pray for yourself and actually to pray for the world.
Really?
Yeah.

454
00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:31.050
Um,
not just Paris,
not just French people,
but actually the world.

455
00:40:31.051 --> 00:40:35.220
And I thought I'd never heard that before and I really liked it.

456
00:40:35.221 --> 00:40:36.510
So the song,

457
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.760
along with the fact that my father had died in Paris a few years earlier,
uh,

458
00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:46.320
of came together.
Okay.
It's called stranger in the sacred heart.

459
00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.080
Okay.
Hmm.

460
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:57.230
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

461

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:19.050

Stranger.
