1
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.960
Well,
good afternoon to everybody here in mountain view.

2
00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:07.830
Thanks for coming out to our Googlers tuning in at offices around the world.

3
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:12.240
Good day to you as well.
Um,
so we're in for a treat today.
Uh,

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.490
the gentleman to my right probably need no introduction,

5
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:17.580
but I'll still have ventured eight to try to give him one.
Anyway,
uh,

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.540
gentleman to my immediate right is none other than director cow Patrick Alvarez.

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.370
He's an la based.
He's a feature director,
writer,
producer and editor.

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.520
The Stanford prison experiment,
which we're here to talk about today.

9
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.550
Marks his third film as a director in 2010 he won the someone to watch award at

10
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:38.130
the independent spirit awards for his directorial debut.

11
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.780
Easier with practice.

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.420
The Stanford prison experiment was at this year's Sundance Film Festival and the

13
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.300
Nantucket Film Festival and I think at one,
two awards at Sundance.
Yup.
Okay.

14
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.210
Very cool.
Exciting stuff.
And Gentlemen,

15
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:54.660
to my further rights is Phillip Ge Zimbardo Phd,

16
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.510
Aka doctors z doctors and Barto.
Um,

17
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.720
he's one of the most distinguished living psychologists having served as

18
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:03.240
president of the American psychological association,

19
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.110
designed and narrated the award winning 26 part PBS series,

20
00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:11.160
discovering psychology,
which hooked me into psychology as a high school student,

21
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.870
a and has published more than 50 books in 400 professional and popular articles

22
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:20.430
and chapters among them shyness,
the Lucifer effect,
Lucifer effect,

23
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.570
the time cure,
and the time paradox.
He's bit of a,

24
00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:27.180
a Google toxic Google veterans,
so we're excited to have him back here.

25
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.870
He's a professor emeritus at Stanford University.

26
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.470
He spent 50 years teaching and studying psychology,

27
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.120
received his phd in psych from Yale University and his areas of focus include

28
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:43.500
time,
perspective,
shyness,
terrorism,
madness,
and evil.

29
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.450
Really glad you're introduced to me first.

30
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.710
They gave me a lot more to say here.
We'll close it up.
We'll wrap.

31
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:56.130
But I best known for his controversial Stanford prison experiment that

32
00:01:56.131 --> 00:02:00.600
highlighted the ease with which ordinary intelligent college students could

33
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:02.820
cross the line between good and evil.

34
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:06.630
When caught up in the matrix of situational and systemic forces.

35
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.660
We'll talk a little bit of heroism letter,
which is what he's got in his shirt.

36
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.560
But uh,
let's get started.
Just so you guys know,
I'll do some Q and.
A.

37
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:17.870
We've prepared for the first half of the hour and then we've got a mic for a,

38
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.470
for the audience to do Q and a as well.

39
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.340
So the first part I want to talk to you doctor Zimbardo and kind of set the

40
00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:28.110
stage for us.
Okay.
So your study spe Stanford prison experiment in 1971.

41
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.580
This is 10 years after Milgram's study began in 1961.

42
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.410
Um,
what's going on at this time?
Why are studies like this so popular back then?

43
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.740
Well,
I should fry mentioned an interesting coincidence,

44
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.290
little Stanley Milgram and little Philipson Bardot,

45
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:47.880
sat side by side and James Monroe high school in the Bronx and in 1949,

46
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:52.260
950 and they had kids who were talking about situations that,

47
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.070
you know,
kids,
I grew up in the south Bronx,
he grew up in the north Bronx.

48
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.070
You know,
you know what,
in what way does where you go make a difference.

49
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.510
<v 1>And we conclude it makes a big difference.
Um,</v>

50
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.240
now his study in 1963 at Yale,
um,
uh,

51
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.610
used,
um,
adults,

52
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.920
20 to 50 year old men mostly and no car.

53
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.510
He said no colleges though high school students and there was no selection

54
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:19.720
factor.
They just anybody who,
who answered living in new haven,

55
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:24.700
Connecticut and they've got four bucks an hour,
uh,
uh,
for study on memory.

56
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.650
So,
so that was a lie.

57
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.660
So the idea was that he would recruit young men,

58
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.020
young and middle age men,
uh,

59
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.620
in what they thought was this study to help people improve their memory.

60
00:03:36.621 --> 00:03:41.500
And there were,
the way they going to help is by hurting.
So there was,
uh,
another,

61
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.700
another participant who they didn't realize was the confederate.
So one,

62
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.140
so the real subject is the teacher that confederate is the student pupil.

63
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.160
Um,
and teaching,
give some to learn when I get it right,
you say good.

64
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.650
When they get it wrong,
you deliver punishment.

65
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.590
And the way you deliver punishers like pressing a button on a shock box,

66
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.630
the shock box has 30 switches.

67
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.220
Each starts with 15 volts and each switch increases by 15 volts.

68
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.340
The problem is that the confederate starts to make mistakes.

69
00:04:10.341 --> 00:04:12.730
So it's a dumbed down.
It gets shocked more and more.

70
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.900
And there's a point at which the confederate begins to scream and yell and I got

71
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:21.790
a heart condition and everybody says,
I don't turn the experiment.

72
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:25.160
I didn't want to go on disparities in a white lab coat.
So that's the beat.

73
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.020
That's the authority.
Obedient and experiments simply says,
I'm sorry,

74
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.880
you must continue.
The teacher.
The,
the experiment requires you continue.

75
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.020
So in order to get out,
you had to say three times I quit,
I quit.

76
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:42.520
I quit once or twice is not enough.
And when it gets to 300 volts,

77
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.150
the guy is screaming and out of control and everybody says,

78
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.380
I don't want to go on.
So everybody verbally,
uh,
complains.

79
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:54.640
Everybody verbally,
uh,
denies wanting to go on.
The problem is,

80
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:55.474
what did they do?

81
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.170
Two out of every three of the thousand subjects goes all the way to 450 volts.

82
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:05.020
And that point,
the guy is unconscious could be dead.
So it really shocked,

83
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.720
shocked the nation Shockton world.

84
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.060
And the reason I did my study and then I'll get back to answering crow,

85
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.180
what was happening at the time period is it's rare that somebody says do bad

86
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:19.600
shit.
Okay,
you're in a group and everybody's doing bad shit.

87
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.690
You're in a corporation and people begin to cheat and lie and steal and Oh,

88
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.500
you play a role.
If you're a manager,
your role is you're the bully.
Um,
uh,
your,

89
00:05:29.501 --> 00:05:30.700
the traditional husband.

90
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.590
So what we want to see what happens when you're in a situation where situational

91
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:40.210
forces push you in a negative direction and nobody says you should do good to do

92
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:44.550
that.
There was something about the sixties and seventies,
which for me,
I,

93
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:47.950
I miss because there was a time of revolution was time of questioning.

94
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.410
People are so it's a civil rights,

95
00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:54.590
a happening and a antiwar activities are happening.
Um,
uh,

96
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.310
really the start of feminism.
So it was really a time,
a very,
for me,

97
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:02.420
a very exciting,
exciting period of,
of social change.

98
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.490
And I think Milgrom tied into that now.
I must say he was a little Jewish kid,

99
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:10.760
meaning in 1948 he was concerned,

100
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:12.680
could the Holocaust happen again here?

101
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.160
Could he and his family ended up in a concentration camp.
We said,
Stanley,

102
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:19.520
don't be stupid.
You know,
that's Nazi Germany,
you know,
we're Americans,

103
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.730
we're not that kind of people.
And He,
I was still remembering saying,

104
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.060
I'll bet they said the same thing before the Nazis recruited them to be in the

105
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:32.910
SS.
It could happen here.
So I see that.
Thank you for the context.
So in,

106
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.340
in the film and also in interviews,

107
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.930
you've said that you had no idea what to expect from your study.
So based on,

108
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.600
based on Milgrom,
did you not have an inkling that,

109
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.560
that what happened might've happened or that folks would respond to the

110
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:48.770
authority in the way that they did?
Well,
in Milgram's thing,

111
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.470
it's really a one on one confrontation.
Somebody says,
do bad shit,

112
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.810
do it or you don't.
In our thing,

113
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.140
we're not telling them to do anything bad or good.
We say be a guard.
Well,

114
00:06:57.141 --> 00:07:00.500
in your mind,
you know,
you've seen movies,

115
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.760
you've seen cool hand Luke ac and heat up at night and seen other movies that

116
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:06.960
guards had power.
Okay.
Um,

117
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.770
so essentially we assumed that they would be verbal abuse.

118
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.670
And the question is how long would it take?
Again,
nobody wanted to be a guard,

119
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:20.290
as you'll see in the film because guards were like,
uh,
uh,

120
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.420
police spent who in a seventies were called on college campuses to break up

121
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.290
antiwar rallies.
So cops,
police,
policemen,
cops are pigs.

122
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.020
I ain't going in those days.
Um,

123
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.350
and so essentially it's that in our study,
um,

124
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.890
it was difficult for the kids to get into the role of guards.

125
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.650
They put on military uniforms,
which felt awkward at first.

126
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:43.820
And you'll see the opening scenes people,

127
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
the audience laughs at the opening scene.
You know,
they didn't want it.

128
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.980
They didn't want to be in that role.

129
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.560
And it took one day before everything changed as you can,

130
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.390
as you saw in the movie.
And Kyle,
we'll talk about that transformation a day too.

131
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.970
I see.
Okay.
And not to give too much away from the come.

132
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:01.760
A lot of us were there last night.
We had a screening just just down the street.

133
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.240
But um,
two quick questions there.
One in the film,

134
00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:07.100
as you're sitting in one of the hallways,

135
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.980
I guess one of your colleagues come and he kind of confronts you and he says,

136
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.210
what's your independent variable in this study?
Would you answer that for us now?

137
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:14.861
Yeah.
So,

138
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:19.861
so in every experiment there's something you very manipulative and there's

139
00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:23.840
something you measure when you do a correlational study.

140
00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:28.610
You mentioned two things.
Uh,
so I wanna know,
um,
are extroverts,

141
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:33.140
um,
uh,
uh,
more open to new experience than introverts.

142
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.100
So I give scale of extraversion openness to experience and I do a correlation to

143
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:37.520
say,

144
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.350
do they go together and in experiments that the thing you want to see is,

145
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.670
does behavior change?
And that's called the dependent variable.

146
00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:51.320
It's dependent on what your manipulate and what you manipulate is called the

147
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:54.380
independent variable.
Just the terms.
So in this case,

148
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.440
the manipulation was random assignment of a group of 24 students have to be

149
00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:03.780
guards and have the prisons in the movie.
They do that thing of flipping a coin.

150
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:07.170
But in fact there's a table of random numbers that you give everybody a number,

151
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:09.780
then you pick out the number of prince and the president going.

152
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.570
So the reason you do that is at the beginning of this study,

153
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.450
they should be no systematic difference on any dimension between prisoners and

154
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:21.090
garden and the height and weight and,
uh,
emotional background,
etc. Wonderful.

155
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:23.610
Thank you.
And then the last thing here,
just to set the context,

156
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.060
what are the results of the study?
What if people don't know?
What did you learn?

157
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:30.300
What'd you take away?
Yeah.
Uh,
what's interesting about this study,

158
00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:32.760
it's been called infamous controversial,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

159
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.240
That's after the fact.
There was in 1971,

160
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:40.680
Stanford University had one of the very first human subjects research committees

161
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.320
that I submitted this study too.

162
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.070
And every student filled out in informed consent to say,

163
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:51.440
I will be an experiment in which,
you know,
uh,
there'll be high stress for,

164
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.990
there'll be minimally adequate diet,
um,
you know,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

165
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.340
I can leave the experiment if I,
when I,
I can,

166
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.410
I can terminate my,
my performance or participation,

167
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.750
uh,
simply by saying I,

168
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.910
I quit the experiment or something like that.
For me,

169
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.490
that's a magical phrase.
How to use those words.
I quit the explorer.

170
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.970
If you say I want out there wasn't good.
And so they fill out that form.

171
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.490
The problem was before you knew the results,

172
00:10:20.491 --> 00:10:23.970
it was kids playing cops and robbers in the basement of Stanford University.

173
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.330
What could happen?
Nothing.
If anything,
what they said was,

174
00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:28.350
you've been 70 the committee,

175
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.400
you need it to have a fire extinguisher because there was only one entrance is

176
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:33.080
no windows.

177
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.210
So if there was a fire and you'll see in the movie that's happened to this
thing,

178
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.470
they use the fire extinguisher against the prisoners.
Um,
you know,

179
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:44.130
so in hindsight you say,
wow,
it's really unethical.
People suffered.

180
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.480
How could anybody allow this?

181
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.370
They couldn't imagine as I couldn't what happened in two days.

182
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.940
Um,
and I,
it's not clear in the movie,
but on day,

183
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:58.150
at the end of the day one I told my graduate students and my team,
we've got,

184
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.480
if nothing changes,
we're going to end this and nothing's happening.
I mean,
it's,

185
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.350
it's so awkward.

186
00:11:02.351 --> 00:11:07.050
It's embarrassing to sit and then day two prisoners revolved and suddenly

187
00:11:07.051 --> 00:11:11.810
everything changes.
Wonderful.
Thank you.
This is for both of you,
the review on,

188
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.540
so how'd you get involved in the project?
Why,
why this film was time?

189
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:20.470
Talk to us about how that happened.
Well,
you know,
the uh,
uh,
for me and the,

190
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.640
and then

191
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.140
<v 2>we can,</v>

192
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:25.620
I'll backtrack a little bit to then with Dr Zimbardo's initial involvement.
I,

193
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.930
the script there,
there had been,
there has been,

194
00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:30.510
or you can chime in at any point and I guess the project had been pretty much

195
00:11:30.511 --> 00:11:31.720
since the experiment happened.

196
00:11:31.721 --> 00:11:34.680
Someone has been trying to do a film out of it and you know,

197
00:11:34.681 --> 00:11:36.180
there's been various iterations.

198
00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:38.160
There was the writer of in the heat of the night,

199
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.330
we met you and brought you down to Los Angeles.
This is back in the 70s,
you know,

200
00:11:42.331 --> 00:11:44.580
then in the,
there was another version.

201
00:11:44.581 --> 00:11:48.630
So at some point then there was a version of the 90s that Leonardo Dicaprio is

202
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:52.600
going to do before titanic happened.
Um,
it was gonna be him and Vanessa del Toro.

203
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.400
Um,
and then there,
and then,

204
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.610
and then it led to this version happening and there was this producer who's,

205
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.460
who's from,
from,
from the area named Brent Emery,

206
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:05.170
and he reached out to you and he,
um,
yeah,

207
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:09.430
it took an option on the,
on the rights of the story and piece together.
They got,

208
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:13.290
they got Chris Mcquarrie involved who has a movie coming out in two weeks about

209
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:17.410
the new mission impossible movie.
And,
and he brought in a guy,

210
00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:18.970
he writes with sometimes some Talbot.

211
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.030
So Tim started writing the script at the same time.

212
00:12:22.031 --> 00:12:24.370
Then that filled was writing the Lucifer effect.

213
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:27.550
And so they were always in touch with each other,
sharing the research,

214
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:28.690
sharing the documents,
everything.

215
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.810
It was sort of like a perfect little storm for Tim to write the script.

216
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:34.920
And the first thing he did was like,
throw everything in there and just said,

217
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.630
okay,
let's just start.
I've read it and it's like a 300 something pages,
whatever,

218
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:39.280
280 page script did it?
Yeah.

219
00:12:39.281 --> 00:12:42.610
It starts with waking up on the morning of the experiment ending and put in

220
00:12:42.611 --> 00:12:43.301
every detail.

221
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:47.500
And then really I think the writing of it for Tim and what Tim did so well was,

222
00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:48.220
okay,
what do you,

223
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.360
what do you pull out and an effort then who are the people we follow and the

224
00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:56.740
experiment to,
you know,
where's the structure?
And it really became a,
I think a,

225
00:12:56.741 --> 00:13:00.940
um,
an act of,
of,
of structuring a story around a lot of characters.

226
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.980
And then the project got cast off.
I had a,
what was a,
not a star,

227
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.230
you know,
kind of probably the equivalent of the cast we have now.

228
00:13:08.231 --> 00:13:13.231
It was like Ryan Philippi and Jesse Eisenberg and Giovanni Ribisi and Channing

229
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:17.730
Tatum.
And you know,
at the time,
yes.
Before they became famous.
I mean,
yeah.

230
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.830
I went down and met with all these guys and they all have become famous,
young,

231
00:13:20.831 --> 00:13:25.140
accurate,
and it was,
you know,
13 years ago.
Yeah.
And uh,
I think could,

232
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.950
he couldn't raise the money.
Yeah,
it was,
it was,

233
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.550
they were trying to make it a much bigger,
a bigger budget film.

234
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:32.860
It was a different time,
independent films in a very different time.
I mean,

235
00:13:32.861 --> 00:13:33.680
this was,

236
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.000
I was just going into college at the time and I'm remember reading about the

237
00:13:37.001 --> 00:13:40.380
project and it didn't come together as hundreds.
I mean,

238
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:44.050
in the time I've been talking,
you know,
five movies have died in Hollywood,

239
00:13:44.051 --> 00:13:45.970
you know,
it's that kind of people that have the billboards,

240
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:47.770
how many people have died from smoking this year.
It's like,

241
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.710
you can do that same with Hollywood projects and it didn't happen,

242
00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:52.030
but the script was so well,

243
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:55.750
well appreciated that the word of the script kind of always lingered around or

244
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.300
you read these articles of the great unproduced scripts are,

245
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:02.110
and it was always on there.
And Brent always held onto the rights.

246
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.290
The producer I mentioned earlier and this actor for my first phone,

247
00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:06.190
Brian Garrity,

248
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.670
who's one of the stars of the hurt locker and a bunch of other films.

249
00:14:09.671 --> 00:14:13.210
He had audition prob probably had addition for the film,
you know,

250
00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:16.870
10 years earlier in 13 years earlier.
And they were,
he was friends with Brendan,

251
00:14:16.871 --> 00:14:19.180
they were talking one night and Brent that along story short,

252
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.640
long story long Brent was like,
oh yeah,

253
00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.340
I was still trying to get the Stanford prison experiment movie made and Brian

254
00:14:24.341 --> 00:14:26.440
was like,
oh you should send it to my friend Kyle.

255
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.710
And some of the point of that whole story is that it really like sometimes these

256
00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:30.191
things are,

257
00:14:30.191 --> 00:14:34.330
here's this project that when people had been laboring over 40 years and it just

258
00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:36.700
came down to like two guys sharing a drink and Ben,
someone being like,

259
00:14:36.701 --> 00:14:37.870
Oh I should send that to my friend.

260
00:14:37.871 --> 00:14:42.871
And then I read the script and started to really read about the experiment,

261
00:14:42.911 --> 00:14:43.451
learn about it,

262
00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:46.630
realize that the script had stayed so true to what the experiment was.

263
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.870
And from there I got involved with the project.
This was a few years ago.

264
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.700
And since then it's,
I took off,

265
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.810
I took a little time away to make an effort to make the film I made before.
Uh,

266
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.140
and then,
but it's really been it for Hollywood terms,

267
00:14:59.141 --> 00:15:03.590
it went by three years for a film to get made as short.
I hate to say that,

268
00:15:03.591 --> 00:15:06.620
but it is a really short period of time.
I see.
So,
uh,

269
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:09.620
this is a question that came up a little while ago and discussion and the

270
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:13.310
question was why not a documentary wide drama and is it because you inherited

271
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:16.100
the project after it was already written as a drama or,
no,

272
00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:18.860
cause I mean I got sent,
you know,
scripts or bio pics.

273
00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:21.890
So people's lives are books and you know,
all the time.
And you have to,

274
00:15:21.891 --> 00:15:23.900
I think when it's something that's contemporary IEE,

275
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.050
there's video of it and there's interviews of the time and there's a book's been

276
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:30.050
written,
you know,
we're not talking about something that's totally undocumented.

277
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.050
You say,
okay,
well why,
why do this?
Why are you doing this as a film?

278
00:15:33.051 --> 00:15:36.560
I think a lot of people make movies and the rationale is based on true people

279
00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:38.750
are biopics are situations and the rationale is,

280
00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:40.520
well there just hasn't been a movie yet so you've got to do it.

281
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.760
And that's not enough for me.
And so when I looked at the documentary,

282
00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:44.870
the quiet rage,

283
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.020
the documentary that doctors and Bartow made about the experiment,

284
00:15:48.021 --> 00:15:48.854
and I read the book,

285
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.510
I felt that they had done such a good job encompassing the studious nature of

286
00:15:53.511 --> 00:15:57.440
the experiment.
But what those,
those couldn't do and they wouldn't be able to,

287
00:15:57.441 --> 00:15:59.330
they wouldn't be as good and materially as they are,

288
00:15:59.331 --> 00:16:02.210
is try to create the more experiential or the more emotional,

289
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.370
some something that an actor can bring to the film.
And so,
you know,

290
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.130
you watch the footage and just like in the film,

291
00:16:07.131 --> 00:16:11.270
it's just one camera at the end and it was very expensive to run video in 1971

292
00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:13.580
so there's,
there is quite a lot of footage,

293
00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:15.740
but not everything is a lot of audio recordings.

294
00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:18.710
It just felt like there was this opportunity to literally get inside of that

295
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:22.890
space and hopefully maybe illuminates some,
some more of that,

296
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.320
that they emotional capacity,
that emotional effect,

297
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.520
this experiment had on people.
I see.
So how did you do the casting?

298
00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:33.230
How did you cast Dr Z and all that?
I mean,
we started with the kids actually,

299
00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:35.450
so it was,
you know,
it's 25 leads,

300
00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:37.850
which was really unusual for a low budget movie.
I mean,

301
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:41.120
it's unusual for any movie,
but you know,
and,
and I,
and I saw it,

302
00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:43.790
I saw them all as leads.
I didn't want to say,
Oh,
well,

303
00:16:43.791 --> 00:16:45.870
that guy doesn't really do much,
so he's not an issue.
You know,

304
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.790
we'll just get some central casting.
I wanted it to be each person.

305
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:53.360
You could train the camera on them and the seat could become about them.
And,
um,

306
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:57.740
and we,
uh,
and you know,
so we,
it took like a law.
It was a long time.

307
00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.510
We were casting as we were financing.

308
00:16:59.511 --> 00:17:02.350
So I basically started just meeting with these guys.
You know,
I had it,

309
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.450
I had a list of people I knew I wanted to be in the movie and I started meeting

310
00:17:05.451 --> 00:17:08.030
with them,
trying to figure out their temperaments.
You know,
I didn't want to get,

311
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:12.080
young actors can be really,
really volatile and it really great way,
you know,

312
00:17:12.081 --> 00:17:14.920
they can be those guys that just want to dive in and be really methody and want

313
00:17:14.921 --> 00:17:17.210
to like only be called,
you know,
the character's name.

314
00:17:17.211 --> 00:17:20.210
And there's so much ambition there and it's a really great thing and it's really

315
00:17:20.211 --> 00:17:23.540
great thing if you're making a movie where you can give them all the attention

316
00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:26.420
and comforts and things that come along with that.
But when you've got,
you know,

317
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.120
25 of them around,
there's no time for that.
So really I was,

318
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.170
I was like vetting them.

319
00:17:30.171 --> 00:17:33.620
I guess I was doing like psychological betting on them to see how they would be.

320
00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:36.710
So you know,
the one,
the hot shot kid who comes in and sits at lunch and he goes,

321
00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:40.290
yeah,
you know,
he'd be like,
unwraps his cigarettes out of it,
back on his pocket.

322
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.760
And he's like,
no,
I studied Meisner and I did all this and this is,

323
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:44.890
these are the techniques I like to use it say like,

324
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.870
that's not the guy that's going to work.
He's incredibly talented.
But,

325
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.410
and then we started doing and we,
we got some of the guys,

326
00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.190
some of the guys in the bigger parts involved initially.

327
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.270
And then as we were making the film trying to cast the Zimbardo part,

328
00:17:57.271 --> 00:18:01.050
it's really,
it's tough.
You want someone who can evoke that feeling,

329
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:04.140
but you don't try to do mimicry,
but you want it to.
Also,

330
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.460
as much as we were recruiting the experiment,
try to match that kind of feeling.

331
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:11.310
And I've just always loved Billy Crudup.
I've always,

332
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:13.950
he's always been one of my favorites.
I think he's under utilized,

333
00:18:13.951 --> 00:18:17.940
I think is underappreciated.
And,
and he's just incredibly talented.

334
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:21.780
And unfortunately,
I just made a movie.
I had made a movie with Corey Stoll,

335
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.470
who is so weird to see him.
Oh,
he's an ant man.
And the same weekend,

336
00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:27.720
like blowing things up in a CG stuff.
But he,
uh,

337
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.990
Corey had just done a movie with Billy and had told Billy that he really liked

338
00:18:30.991 --> 00:18:34.290
working with me.
So when the script came around a Billy with my name on it,

339
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:35.610
you know,
he was interested.

340
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:38.490
But the interesting thing connects to what you just said was when I first sat

341
00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:41.670
down with Billy,
his hesitation was,
um,
he said,
well,

342
00:18:41.671 --> 00:18:46.260
I just don't understand how did they not know this was gonna Happen?
And I was,

343
00:18:46.261 --> 00:18:46.711
it was sort of,

344
00:18:46.711 --> 00:18:49.290
that was his big thing that was holding him back from maybe saying yes to the

345
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:50.950
project.
And I remember it was like,

346
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.460
it was like an 8:00 AM meeting cause he had a plane to catch and I was like

347
00:18:53.461 --> 00:18:54.294
tired.
And I was like,

348
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.670
and it like one of those weird moments where it dings and I was like,
well look,

349
00:18:56.671 --> 00:18:59.370
he didn't know it was going to happen because the Stanford prison experiment

350
00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:01.770
hadn't happened yet.
You know,
this was the thing that defined it.

351
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.220
That's where it's not an activity.
There was no,
there was no point of reference.

352
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.840
And,
and I think that was the thing that sorta got Billy on board.
And if you can,

353
00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.890
it's like,
if he's just one of those guys,
if you can work with them,

354
00:19:10.891 --> 00:19:14.850
it's like a highlight,
you know?
And I was really glad he,
he did.

355
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.860
I was really glad he did the movie.
And it was really good to all these guys.

356
00:19:16.861 --> 00:19:21.180
I mean,
as rather for Ezra Miller,
the first time I met on the film I was,
so,

357
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:21.900
I said,
you know,

358
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.480
if we don't make this movie with Ezra Miller were like making a mistake.

359
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.890
He's walked,
he walked from 1971 into 2015.
Like,
it's bizarre.
He's,

360
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:33.480
he's not of this era.
And He,
um,
and he,
and you know,

361
00:19:33.481 --> 00:19:34.950
but when we put this cast together,

362
00:19:34.951 --> 00:19:37.320
our dream was to build a cast like the outsiders,
you know,

363
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.390
one of these from dazed and confused where you look back 10 years and you know,

364
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.390
we were always say that we look back 10 years,
you're not going to leave.

365
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:45.450
All these guys were in the same movie.
And really it's been like 10 months.

366
00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:46.700
You know,
we didn't,
we didn't expect that.

367
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.420
We didn't know Ezra was going to be the flash.

368
00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:50.090
And now that you lead in the Harry Potter,

369
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.640
one of the new leads in the Harry Potter that spin a Harry Potter spinoff and a

370
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:58.110
shared a cyclops and key only has the maze runner like all these guys have.

371
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.350
These are all things that happened after we made the film.

372
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.710
And part of that is engineered.
Part of that's luck and part of that's,
yeah.

373
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.480
I don't know the part of that Mojo or something,
you know,
and um,

374
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.020
and so it was a really,

375
00:20:10.021 --> 00:20:12.660
it was a privilege and in like an embarrassment of riches to get to work with

376
00:20:12.661 --> 00:20:17.080
all of these guys.
I seen you had them read both President God.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

377
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.800
When we have,
when we have people come in and audition,
when we did the more,

378
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:24.090
not open casting calls,
but you know,
would bring actors in for the most part,

379
00:20:24.091 --> 00:20:25.470
unless I had something specific in mind.

380
00:20:25.471 --> 00:20:28.490
But most of the times we just said they'd be sent,
we wrote scenes.

381
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.980
So I would combine some of the characters and just put some of the highlights of

382
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.260
moments that they needed to see.
And we just said to them,

383
00:20:34.261 --> 00:20:36.630
you can come and read one,
you can read the other,
you can read both.

384
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:39.030
And it was an interesting thing.

385
00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:42.330
And in some cases I would cast them against the part they thought they should

386
00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:45.630
play.
Some cases they just did what they did,
they knew themselves,
you know,

387
00:20:45.631 --> 00:20:47.680
so it was a weird thing and,
and a lot of cases,

388
00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:51.280
it was really fun to try to take some of these kids who a lot of them were from

389
00:20:51.281 --> 00:20:54.880
Disney shows and Nickelodeon shows and this is sort of their first more serious

390
00:20:54.881 --> 00:20:57.970
feature and be like,
oh no,
you're going to be a guard.
You know,
you're like,
well,

391
00:20:57.971 --> 00:21:01.550
I was a Hannah Montana,
his best friend.
But that's,

392
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.960
but then that's fun for them because they don't,
you know,
or like,
you know,

393
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.750
I remember like Jim James Walc uh,

394
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:12.550
was just so who plays with the Grad students was just so happy to uh,

395
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.880
to be like an a costume and to have like facial hair on a wig.

396
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.910
Like he just wanted that cause he's always playing like the handsome boyfriend.

397
00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.920
He was just like,
it's real tight,
you know?

398
00:21:20.921 --> 00:21:23.650
It's one of these things where you're giving these guys opportunities to do

399
00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:26.920
something a little bit different and they just like chew it up.
I see.

400
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.220
Now obviously doctor Zimbardo was involved in the,
in the process.

401
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.490
Were any of the original subjects involved in the,
in the filming print?

402
00:21:33.491 --> 00:21:36.970
Not at all.
No.
It was,
it was a careful and deliberate choice for me.

403
00:21:36.971 --> 00:21:40.320
Part of it was that I felt what they would contribute to it.

404
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.460
That research had already been done right.
The eye.

405
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.560
He had done extensive followup interviews.

406
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:47.740
There's also interviews leading all the way up to just like maybe 10 years ago

407
00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:50.620
lasts that you can see online.
But I wasn't,

408
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:55.240
while I felt we were representing doctors in Bartow directly and,

409
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.480
and his,
his wife,
doctor,
you know,
Doctor Christina,

410
00:21:58.481 --> 00:22:02.920
mass lag or took the seniors of Otto directly.
I felt that everyone else,

411
00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:04.150
it would,
it would do a disservice.
I mean,

412
00:22:04.151 --> 00:22:06.720
I was trying to cast someone that looked like this person or can,

413
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.170
we weren't learning about them.
Right.

414
00:22:08.171 --> 00:22:10.630
The only people we learn about outside of the experiment as him.

415
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.960
And so for me it felt like we,
when we changed all their names,

416
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.590
not even for legal reasons,
we changed them because I didn't feel,

417
00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:20.230
I met a woman the other day,
she goes,
my brother was one of the guards,

418
00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:21.880
my brother was John Mark and I got,

419
00:22:21.881 --> 00:22:24.970
I couldn't even tell you who played him in the film because we were in order to

420
00:22:24.971 --> 00:22:27.040
reduce it down into a two hour movie,

421
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:29.920
we were combining certain things people did.
I see.
So it was,

422
00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.840
there were being defined.
These people were being,

423
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.990
characters are being defined by the actions they took inside of the experiment.

424
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:39.730
And I felt if I even connected the re the actors to the real people,

425
00:22:39.731 --> 00:22:43.240
it just would have created this cacophony of,
uh,
of,

426
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:47.110
it just felt like we weren't actually making a movie about those individuals

427
00:22:47.111 --> 00:22:49.870
were making movies about the actions they took.
And you know,
it's,
it's,

428
00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:52.960
it's a tricky decision because you don't want to make a movie then where someone

429
00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:54.180
goes and sees it and says,
well,

430
00:22:54.181 --> 00:22:56.200
it was nothing like that and I wish you would have touched base with me and I

431
00:22:56.201 --> 00:22:58.930
could have sold you this,
this,
and this.
But when there's so many,

432
00:22:58.931 --> 00:23:00.670
it would have been on a diet.
I think it would,

433
00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:01.850
I think it would have been endless pet pet.

434
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:02.650
<v 1>I understand.</v>

435
00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:06.150
The other thing is m a number of the presidents that number of the guards to

436
00:23:06.151 --> 00:23:10.180
this day said,
I was just acting and we just acting this.

437
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.460
It wasn't this situation.
In fact,
I just chose to be a prison who broke down.

438
00:23:14.461 --> 00:23:17.730
They just chose to be evil guard.
And I tell them,
I said,
wow,

439
00:23:17.731 --> 00:23:21.510
that's really great that I don't know any professional actor who can stay in

440
00:23:21.511 --> 00:23:26.040
part eight hours a day,
day after day,
day after day,
day after day.

441
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.540
So I think,
I think they were right.
They started playing a role,

442
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:34.660
especially the guy who plays John Way,
uh,
in a,
in a movie.

443
00:23:34.661 --> 00:23:36.340
It's played brilliantly.

444
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.510
He was an 18 year old college freshman at Whitman College,

445
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:44.520
interested in drama and he saw the movie cool hand Luke Resa and he just chose

446
00:23:44.521 --> 00:23:48.930
to be struggling Martin.
And it was a conscious choice on his part.
And,

447
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:53.570
but the point is,
you'll see,
once he gets into the role,
he becomes evil.

448
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:57.750
I mean,
in fact it's,
it's the definition of creative evil.
Uh,

449
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.910
and then he's,
he's stuck in that role and he's the one who says,
you know,

450
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.140
now the guards worked eight hour shifts so that they were home doing the usual

451
00:24:06.141 --> 00:24:09.710
things.
Some of them,
Adam,
he,
and he's the one that says,
you come in,

452
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:14.150
you put on your guard uniform,
you put on a silver reflecting sunglasses idea.

453
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:16.460
I got from the,
what we call on Lou,
you have to Billy club,

454
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:20.210
you step out on the yard and you're a guard.
This is what he said later.

455
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:25.120
And then he said in a recent after Abu Ghraib prison,
our prison study got trips,

456
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.280
got intimacy again,
and he was interviewed and he said,

457
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:33.830
give it a little more time.
We guards could of got where they were and he said,

458
00:24:33.831 --> 00:24:34.664
you know,

459
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:38.780
we were just getting off our jollies by being puppet tears and the prisoners

460
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:43.520
were our puppets.
This is 30 years later.
That is not acting,

461
00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.790
that is taking the mentality he created 30 years,

462
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.190
44 years ago in into the present.

463
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.580
<v 2>Well,
what does says to me is that there is power in what we call acting,
right?</v>

464
00:24:52.581 --> 00:24:54.170
This is what I talked to the auctions a lot about this.

465
00:24:54.171 --> 00:24:59.171
I was like your professional role players playing unprofessional roleplayers and

466
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.430
this experiment and so you need to stay.
Yeah,

467
00:25:01.431 --> 00:25:03.740
you need to stay the professional role player.
You know,

468
00:25:03.741 --> 00:25:06.290
that was sort of the thing and that's where it was actually a really fun and

469
00:25:06.291 --> 00:25:07.670
pleasant set.
And that,

470
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:10.120
especially when we were working with the kids because we were caught,

471
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.300
they were constantly aware of that.

472
00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:13.400
But I think I'm mostly certain it's a Vonnegut quote,

473
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.010
which is embarrassing because everybody get a tattoo.
But when we said,
you know,

474
00:25:16.011 --> 00:25:18.590
be careful what you pretend to be because you become what you pretend to be.

475
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.920
And I do think that that to me was a really interesting thing to see actors do

476
00:25:25.161 --> 00:25:28.100
or they bring,
you know,
I wasn't trying to make a movie that was super aware of,

477
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.330
it's like that medic quality,

478
00:25:29.331 --> 00:25:32.690
but there is something that it said it would be interesting for someone who is

479
00:25:32.691 --> 00:25:37.250
in the acting world or writes papers about the acting theories to write,
okay,

480
00:25:37.251 --> 00:25:38.730
what is,
you know,
where is it?

481
00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.930
Or you hear these stories of actors who get lost in parts or whatever it might

482
00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:44.390
be and it's really hard for them to return to their lives and their family
lives.

483
00:25:44.391 --> 00:25:47.840
And it's an,
I think it's a really similar extension of what was going on there,

484
00:25:47.841 --> 00:25:49.970
where it does start as fun and games and at a certain point,

485
00:25:49.971 --> 00:25:52.520
if you're really good at it,
you know,
if you access yourself,

486
00:25:52.521 --> 00:25:54.440
you lie to yourself enough.
And so,
you know,

487
00:25:54.441 --> 00:25:56.870
our goal in making the film was to not get that far,
you know,

488
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.330
to get that far when the cameras are rolling and then you shut it off.

489
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:01.970
Give me close calls.
No,
no.

490
00:26:01.971 --> 00:26:05.630
I mean we did when Chris is doing the pushups at the end,
uh,
you know,

491
00:26:05.631 --> 00:26:07.040
he was just like,
look,
let's just do it,
you know.

492
00:26:07.041 --> 00:26:08.240
So he was really doing the pushups.

493
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.800
Like Jack and Logan were really sitting on his back and um,
and he was like,

494
00:26:12.801 --> 00:26:15.860
I can give you like three takes.
You know,
fortunately he was like the strongest.

495
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.490
He was probably the strongest guy in the cast.
So I had asked him physically.

496
00:26:19.491 --> 00:26:22.160
Yeah.
But I had asked all the actors to stop working out.
You know,

497
00:26:22.161 --> 00:26:24.680
cause I didn't want them to be,
there was a few scenes we shot,

498
00:26:24.681 --> 00:26:27.290
they weren't in the film where they were had to bathe before the visitors come

499
00:26:27.291 --> 00:26:29.270
and you don't,
people in the 70s didn't ha,

500
00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.610
you know that was Matt Weiner is rural for his actors weren't,

501
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:32.361
that's what they always said.

502
00:26:32.361 --> 00:26:34.730
The actors aren't allowed to go to the gym or run mad man because it's like

503
00:26:34.731 --> 00:26:38.090
that's not how people looked at.
These actors only had two weeks notice,
you know,

504
00:26:38.091 --> 00:26:40.550
most of them.
And we were so we had no rehearsal period or anything.

505
00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:43.410
But so by the time he got to lunch we to lunch,

506
00:26:43.411 --> 00:26:47.060
it was like a skate steak kabobs or you know what's for lunch.
And Chris,

507
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.170
his arms were like,
like he couldn't do it.

508
00:26:49.171 --> 00:26:51.240
I had to like take the steak off him and you feel bad.
But,

509
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:55.500
but even then it was like,
he was like,
he was invigorated by it,
you know.

510
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:57.360
And so there was never a time where,
you know,

511
00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.620
these actors were actually having fun.
I have,

512
00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.050
I have like dozens of videos on my phone of when we were shooting the rate
stuff.

513
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.780
Nick Brown,
the really tall guy has as her against the wall,

514
00:27:04.781 --> 00:27:07.920
like the in between takes when moving the camera just to keep their energy up.

515
00:27:07.921 --> 00:27:10.650
They were just like play,
wrestle like I have like they were just having a blast,

516
00:27:10.651 --> 00:27:13.170
you know,
it was like for them and that's fun.
That's what they were in there for.

517
00:27:13.171 --> 00:27:14.004
That's what they love.

518
00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:21.550
The Evil John Wayne Guard has him do pushups and then literally it's stepping on

519
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:23.371
his back,

520
00:27:23.371 --> 00:27:27.630
pushing him down and then has to prison is sit on him while he's still doing a

521
00:27:27.631 --> 00:27:30.720
pushup.
So that CMA and act really happened in the study.

522
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.740
But it was amazing that he could even do one and two people sitting on him.

523
00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.200
And it was an interesting and speaking of the moments where it does,

524
00:27:37.201 --> 00:27:38.010
this just popped in her mind.

525
00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:42.750
You know Chris is struggling and probably legitimately starting to tear up and

526
00:27:42.751 --> 00:27:46.980
he falls and we were and the producers are on my case cause we're union project

527
00:27:46.981 --> 00:27:49.740
and we're already in grace period.
And lunch and like,
we need to go.
And I'm like,

528
00:27:49.741 --> 00:27:53.190
this guy is literally killing himself for us.
We need to not cut them off.

529
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:56.560
And Michael at the end of the take throws them back up against the wall and he's

530
00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:59.270
like,
you can't even do one lousy push up.
And it was totally made the lineup.

531
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.040
And I was like the most,
he made it up right there,
didn't even think about,

532
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.590
he doesn't remember really saying it.
And it was like,

533
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.350
that is the cruelest thing I've ever heard of.
But you know,
it was,

534
00:28:07.351 --> 00:28:09.420
it came from his character and it really wasn't to him.

535
00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:12.180
There was still that lane ends,
but we didn't get it on camera.
So they were like,

536
00:28:12.181 --> 00:28:14.670
we've got to break for lunch.
I was like,
I have to get that line.
I was like,

537
00:28:14.671 --> 00:28:19.110
there's no way I'm not going to shoot that line.
It's just,
you know,

538
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.390
they were calling for lunch.
I think people,
you know,

539
00:28:21.391 --> 00:28:24.060
the grips are like fuck fast and they're like walking out and everything like

540
00:28:24.061 --> 00:28:27.510
that.
And,
um,
and it was just,
you know,
you don't have to,

541
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.450
it's a weird thing because I like to follow the rules and a lot of,

542
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:33.990
a lot of the great filmmakers don't follow the rules,
you know.

543
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.640
But the thing I always do try to remind myself,

544
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.790
it's really hard in a movie like this where there's no much so little time.

545
00:28:38.791 --> 00:28:43.180
But you know,
you here,
I worked for Warren Beatty for awhile and he's infamous,

546
00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.020
hundreds of takes.
I've never done more than five takes this film.

547
00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.650
We never did more than two or three if there,
there was no time to,
but you know,

548
00:28:49.651 --> 00:28:51.870
one time I was like,
well,
why do you do so many takes?
And he goes,
well,

549
00:28:51.871 --> 00:28:55.080
because everything that costs money here,
like the sets,

550
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:58.140
the food that they're getting,
the accuracy or the locations,
he's like,

551
00:28:58.141 --> 00:29:00.870
the thing that costs the least amount of money is the film in the camera.

552
00:29:00.871 --> 00:29:03.000
In this case,
the hard drive in the camera,
you know,

553
00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:04.260
that's the cheapest thing there.

554
00:29:04.261 --> 00:29:07.170
So why aren't you going to always keep on running?
And,
and there's,

555
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.520
there's a modified truth to that that you can harness without doing a hundred

556
00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:14.190
takes.
How long they do the prisoner guard.

557
00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.670
Was it two weeks?
Two and a half.

558
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.920
We were there two and a half weeks in that hallway.

559
00:29:19.921 --> 00:29:22.950
And then we had like a week and a half.
A little,
yeah,

560
00:29:22.951 --> 00:29:27.090
a week and a half in another building where all the outside stuff was very cool.

561
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.960
Well,
not to,
not to interrupt the,
the Mojo here,
but,

562
00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:34.890
so we had a screening last night in,
in about 10 of us in a group went together.

563
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.110
There was a hundred of us,
10 of us in a group that I was with.

564
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.010
And I remember the movie movie ends,
the credits roll and there's just radio from

565
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.960
<v 0>all my friends and I for quite a while.</v>

566
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:47.950
And it's been a while since I've been to a movie where every one of my friends

567
00:29:47.951 --> 00:29:51.670
and I were just blown away.
Everybody two thumbs up,
rave reviews loved it.

568
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:55.040
Now the first thing that came to us,
um,

569
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.390
as we're talking through it is about half of us were like,
you know what?

570
00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:02.080
I bet you it was that intense.
I bet you they didn't take too many liberties.

571
00:30:02.081 --> 00:30:05.620
I'll bet you that's what it was like.
And half the folks were like,
I dunno man.

572
00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:06.820
There's,
there's some stuff,

573
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:09.230
some of some of the stuff that I don't know if I could have taken it.
It's,

574
00:30:09.231 --> 00:30:13.180
we're curious.
Um,
I could have taken it if I was there.
No,

575
00:30:13.181 --> 00:30:15.880
they're saying that the what,
what in the film is,
is,
is,

576
00:30:15.881 --> 00:30:19.750
was made up or exaggerated.
It's nicely.
Yeah.
I mean,
he could speak a little more,

577
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:20.710
I'll let them speak a little,

578
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.870
literally will say that first and I'll say at night hi

579
00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:27.700
<v 1>to send something mean.
So they've compressed six days into two hours.</v>

580
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:29.380
Now,
if anything,

581
00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:34.230
there were a lot of dramatic things that happened in the real study that cut

582
00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.880
deleted or they couldn't put in because of budget.

583
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:41.270
So there's nothing in the film.
Uh,
the,

584
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:45.640
none of the dramatic events in the film were made up.
They all mimicked.

585
00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:47.090
But what really happened?
Wow.

586
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.110
The last scene I think puts together the three things that happened,
uh,

587
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:56.160
with,
uh,
separated,
uh,
buy more hours.
Um,

588
00:30:56.350 --> 00:31:00.880
and so the last scene is riveting.
Overwhelming,
emotionally distressing.

589
00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.820
Um,
and I'm worried the first time I saw that I said,
you know,

590
00:31:03.821 --> 00:31:07.360
people are going to walk out of here in tears and say,
you know,
screw this.
Yeah,

591
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.220
I didn't,
I didn't pay 12 bucks to AI.
But,

592
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:16.830
but the goal is how do you transform that emotional distress to intellectual

593
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.560
self analysis?
What kind of guard would I have been?

594
00:31:20.561 --> 00:31:22.150
What kind of president if I was,

595
00:31:22.151 --> 00:31:26.140
if I was does it Mario character would not have ended it sooner.
She should,

596
00:31:26.141 --> 00:31:30.690
he should he run it for two weeks and you know,
and then if this is,

597
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.110
if this is a simulated prison,
what must,

598
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.730
what must it be like to be in a real prison?

599
00:31:36.731 --> 00:31:39.610
Rear guards have guns and power over you and,

600
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.580
and there are gangs know among the prisoners,
they're all gangs.

601
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:46.060
So our president is really more like a prisoner of war camp,
you see,

602
00:31:46.061 --> 00:31:49.300
because everybody comes in the same time.
If you go to a prison,

603
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.270
there's a prison hierarchy.
There's guys who've been there 30 years,

604
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.510
this is the really bad guys.
His gangs,
there's black,
Hispanic,

605
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:59.740
skinhead white gangs.
Uh,
and,
and again,
if you come from,
if you,

606
00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:02.530
if you're in prison and you're a young guy and you don't have a gang connection,

607
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.020
you're going to be a sissy.
The only question is how long.

608
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.250
So there's a whole dynamic,
which I know operates in system.
I studied prison,

609
00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.500
which we didn't have.
So in a funny way,

610
00:32:11.501 --> 00:32:15.170
it's like everybody starts in up in a prisoner of war camp,
so,

611
00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.990
so that nobody has a history.

612
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:22.470
And the curious thing is that everyone got trapped in the expanded moment.

613
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:28.440
We bugged the cells and is 90% of all the conversation was about the prison,

614
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.510
the food,
the guards,
uh,
escape.

615
00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.240
That means they knew nothing about each other.

616
00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.840
They knew the all college students.
They didn't say,
you know what?

617
00:32:36.841 --> 00:32:38.020
What school do you go to?

618
00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:40.940
What are you majoring in and know nothing about the future.

619
00:32:40.941 --> 00:32:43.460
What are you going to do when you get out?
Because all of them,
I got to start.

620
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:47.500
It's,
it's the end of summer school.
The all got to start in September.

621
00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.660
And I should mention only two students were Stanford students.

622
00:32:50.661 --> 00:32:51.740
One Garden when president,

623
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.130
because we did it in the summer and kids are finishing up summer school at

624
00:32:55.131 --> 00:32:58.210
Berkeley and at Stanford,
at other places in the movie.

625
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.620
They mentioned Stanford three times.
So,
uh,

626
00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.800
so some people believe that they were all separate suits.

627
00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.350
That was done in the basement of Jordan Hall at Stanford.
But,
but it,
it's,

628
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:10.300
it's universe with college students.
I see white college students most forward

629
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:13.870
<v 2>and my feeling to have the,
you know,
we obviously we stayed very true.
I mean,
I,</v>

630
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:16.770
I I,
I have sort of like three prong thing to that.

631
00:33:16.771 --> 00:33:19.410
One is the idea of saying something is based on a true story.

632
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.410
It means nothing anymore.
You know what I mean?
I thought,
I remember when I read,

633
00:33:22.411 --> 00:33:26.430
when I read the script,
it was,
uh,
there was a movie around that time,

634
00:33:26.431 --> 00:33:28.170
maybe it was last year or something,
or two years ago.

635
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.620
There was a movie with Eric Bana where he's like a cop fighting demons in New

636
00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:36.210
York.
And it was like based on the true account,
based on a true story.

637
00:33:36.211 --> 00:33:38.550
Maybe this guy says that happen,
but you know,

638
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.740
we know there are demons in New York.
And so,

639
00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.260
and it really has talked about the exorcist,
I think,
you know,

640
00:33:43.261 --> 00:33:44.370
and that's not a slam and that movie,

641
00:33:44.371 --> 00:33:48.120
but that's sort of have that idea of the learner of the fear snow when we go see

642
00:33:48.121 --> 00:33:51.180
the conjuring,
it's like in the summer of,
you know,
that kind of thing.
And,
um,

643
00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:52.290
and for me I sort of felt,

644
00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.190
but then we look at are really historical films like Lincoln brazenly make stuff

645
00:33:56.191 --> 00:33:58.860
up and vote.
It changes public voting record,
you know,
when they're,

646
00:33:58.861 --> 00:34:00.630
when they're voting on the,
uh,
you know,

647
00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.020
at the end of the film when they're voting,
it just made it up for more tension.

648
00:34:04.021 --> 00:34:06.540
So,
I mean,
that's something that we're there,
there,
you know,
and I feel,

649
00:34:06.541 --> 00:34:09.090
and that's not even a slam on that movie,
you know,
it's so,
but for me,

650
00:34:09.091 --> 00:34:12.390
I felt like when you look at that to say our film is,
you know,
I think fair,

651
00:34:12.391 --> 00:34:14.190
when you say about 90% accurate,

652
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.610
I think there's an overwhelming number when the movies we look at or consider

653
00:34:17.611 --> 00:34:21.510
historical probably live more in the 30% in many cases,

654
00:34:21.511 --> 00:34:25.020
maybe the 10% or something.
So are we set our threshold much higher.
Now,

655
00:34:25.021 --> 00:34:25.651
having said that,

656
00:34:25.651 --> 00:34:29.190
I do think people who are there in terms of like a lot of the words and the

657
00:34:29.191 --> 00:34:31.560
dialogue is coming from that.
I suspect,

658
00:34:31.561 --> 00:34:33.690
and I haven't talked to anybody who was in the experiment.

659
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:36.660
I suspect they might say something like,
well,
it really wasn't that bad.
You know,

660
00:34:36.661 --> 00:34:40.370
you watched the footage and it doesn't seem that bad,
but,
but that,

661
00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:44.100
that's where what I was doing wasn't exaggerating it.
I was saying,
okay,

662
00:34:44.101 --> 00:34:46.770
well I'm telling you to look at this by writing.
You start to question again.

663
00:34:46.771 --> 00:34:49.170
What's your job as a film maker?
Not a documentarian,

664
00:34:49.171 --> 00:34:52.980
but a filmmaker is to create an emotion.
And so I'm putting music in,

665
00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:55.690
I'm putting cuts in,
I'm putting closeups,

666
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.980
and I'm doing all these things that say slow motion.
I'm doing,
I'm,

667
00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.900
I'm doing and performance,
you know?

668
00:35:00.901 --> 00:35:03.780
So you're doing things that say we're evoking this emotion.

669
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:07.260
It's not about trying to Hollywood eyes at or create something like that.

670
00:35:07.261 --> 00:35:10.230
It's just trying to say,
this is the story we're trying to tell.
So if someone,

671
00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.020
to me,
if someone came,
maybe someone will come forward and be like,
oh my God,

672
00:35:13.021 --> 00:35:15.540
it was exactly the same and that'd be really enriching to hear,

673
00:35:15.541 --> 00:35:17.670
but at the same or maybe a horrifying,
but you know,

674
00:35:17.671 --> 00:35:19.440
but at the same time as someone came forward and wrote something,

675
00:35:19.441 --> 00:35:22.830
it was nothing like that.
And then it's Hollywood doing again.
I'd be like,
well,

676
00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:27.510
you have the right to feel that way.
But we also had the right to say,
okay,

677
00:35:27.511 --> 00:35:30.660
here's this close up and here's this performance and here's the music and all

678
00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:32.310
the things that it becomes friction.

679
00:35:32.311 --> 00:35:34.290
As soon as you put a camera on the front of something,

680
00:35:34.291 --> 00:35:38.110
that's as soon as you put a cot into something,
it becomes fiction in a way.

681
00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:40.120
And I mean that,
speaking of narrative filmmaking that does,

682
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:42.780
that's a totally different conversation with documentary filmmaker get even then

683
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:46.770
nowadays,
documentary filmmaking,
especially the trend lately has been,

684
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:50.230
they've become,
it's become very blurry,
same friction.
But that's,
now,

685
00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.360
this is a totally different,

686
00:35:51.361 --> 00:35:54.480
but I understand speaking of emotion and invoking emotion.

687
00:35:54.481 --> 00:35:59.420
So what I appreciated most about the film,
uh,
was not particularly just a,

688
00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.280
the moments where things get really tense or sometimes there's,
there's,

689
00:36:02.281 --> 00:36:06.570
there's physical force used.
For me it was when folks decide they're out,

690
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.420
when some of the prisoners decide I'm done with this.

691
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:13.800
And they start trying to find a way to scheme a way out of this.

692
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:16.470
I felt by the end of the film,

693
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.340
like I was in this theater and there were times where I wanted out of just like

694
00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:24.420
the prisoners,
right.
And,
and it was so powerful.
Not,
not from the film,

695
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.370
I felt the prisoners.
What I'm saying,
what I'm curious about is,
is um,

696
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:34.680
what was the contract,
right?
Like were they,
were they able to get out?
Um,

697
00:36:34.681 --> 00:36:38.700
was it paramount to keep them involved as long as possible?

698
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.230
And I'm saying it's a compliment.

699
00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:44.150
I think it goes to do an incredible job of making you feel like the kids who are

700
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.450
on a filmmaking set.

701
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.620
And I think they actually contract is interesting thing to talk about was that I

702
00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:52.620
started to before the movie from here,
you know,
we shot it in October,

703
00:36:52.621 --> 00:36:56.220
premiered it in January.
So it was a really fast turnaround.
And I,

704
00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.290
at the premiere,
you know,
we premiered it at Sundance and you know,

705
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:03.360
it went from 12 people haven't seen this movie to two hours later.

706
00:37:03.361 --> 00:37:07.320
1300 people have now seen this movie.
And so that's an overwhelming feeling.

707
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:11.160
And it was weird because I was working so hard through the film to not to make

708
00:37:11.161 --> 00:37:12.180
it brutal by the end,

709
00:37:12.181 --> 00:37:15.960
but not so the first hour of the film I think has moments of liberty.

710
00:37:15.961 --> 00:37:16.711
There's a lot of humor.

711
00:37:16.711 --> 00:37:20.940
I really was telling the cast and working on the script to really make sure it

712
00:37:20.941 --> 00:37:23.940
wasn't,
if it was harrowing 10 minutes in your,

713
00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:27.800
we're fucked for the next hour and 50 minutes,
I don't want one of them.
You know?

714
00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.350
And so it was,
for me it was about trying to earn that ending and,

715
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:34.370
and for it to crescendo to that as opposed to absolutely.

716
00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.990
As opposed to being one of these movies that's just trying to brutalize you.

717
00:37:36.991 --> 00:37:40.590
And so,
but because then even in the editing for instance,
it's 10 minutes,

718
00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:43.170
the big final sequence and the first cut of the film,

719
00:37:43.171 --> 00:37:45.330
it was 30 minutes and it wasn't a fat 30 minutes.

720
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:49.800
It was a lot more stuff happened.
And so,
you know,
we were trimming away to say,

721
00:37:49.801 --> 00:37:52.800
well we don't want to make a movie.
That's so,
so when it was going to premiere,

722
00:37:52.801 --> 00:37:55.440
my feeling,
what my fear was that people are gonna be like home.
You know,

723
00:37:55.441 --> 00:37:57.150
we're seeing this before,
like who really cares?

724
00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.860
And the first question was that they were like,

725
00:37:58.861 --> 00:38:01.560
did you think you made an experiment on the audience?

726
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:03.700
And I didn't understand the question.

727
00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:08.310
I probably gave a bad answer because I thought the person was criticizing me.

728
00:38:08.311 --> 00:38:10.920
But I realized what they were saying was what you just said,

729
00:38:10.921 --> 00:38:13.520
which was what we did.
And I think we are,

730
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:16.650
we earned it through the effort of not trying to push people too far.

731
00:38:16.651 --> 00:38:18.650
So what you're saying I think,
I think,

732
00:38:18.651 --> 00:38:20.790
well maybe some people will think we pushed too far,
but you know,
it's uh,

733
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:24.260
that's where it really comes down to a conversation about editing and,
um,

734
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.670
but it was weird cause I didn't anticipate their reaction.
I was,

735
00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:28.520
I was so nervous in three acts are just sort of been like,
oh,

736
00:38:28.521 --> 00:38:30.100
we're just doing this,
you know.
And it wasn't,
um,

737
00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.620
but instead it was sort of people were,

738
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:34.470
people were having that same feeling of being hard to talk and that's what I

739
00:38:34.471 --> 00:38:38.620
wanted to achieve,
but maybe had feared I had.
And just really quick to just to,

740
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.900
he also,
he also a senior editor as well as direct.

741
00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:45.570
I see you've been watching it nonstop.
I can't watch the movie anymore.
You know,

742
00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.400
I poked my head and it opened in theaters in La last Friday.

743
00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:51.850
At the future I go to,
you know,
sometimes three times a week.
And so I was like,

744
00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:54.010
I have to put it,
I've never seen any my own movies on the screen.

745
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.890
I like poked my head in there.
I was watching one scene and then I was like,

746
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.060
I shut down that you like,

747
00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.130
there was a scene where like someone leaned back in the chair and I was like,

748
00:39:00.131 --> 00:39:01.610
how come there's not a squeak?
They're like,

749
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:03.130
you can start seeing those things and then you're like,

750
00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.950
that's why you can't watch the movie.
You know?
I think it's all,

751
00:39:05.951 --> 00:39:06.910
I think I read in their interview,

752
00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:08.440
I think it was all pounds a quarter on who was like,

753
00:39:08.441 --> 00:39:11.740
who did gravity where he was like,
when I finished the film,
I watch it at the,

754
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:15.320
at the,
at the premiere with an audience and I never watched it again.
Oh,
right.

755
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.410
It's partly due to that and it's partly due to the,

756
00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.560
I need to be here and speak about the film,
hopefully like in an engaging way.

757
00:39:20.561 --> 00:39:22.840
And if I'm thinking about the three frames I should of caught between those

758
00:39:22.841 --> 00:39:24.990
shots.
You can't,
and if there's something that you want to move,

759
00:39:24.991 --> 00:39:26.950
if you want to be able to move on,
I'm not one of those people.
I don't,

760
00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:30.460
I get really confused about the filmmakers would go back and recut their movies

761
00:39:30.461 --> 00:39:32.590
years later.
I think it's,
there's something coming,
you know,
kind of,

762
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.560
I find something kind of no director's cuts out about it.
Yeah,
the director.

763
00:39:35.561 --> 00:39:37.420
Well sometimes,
right.
Just cut us.
Cause the studios,
you know,

764
00:39:37.421 --> 00:39:39.670
give you an opportunity to put your version of it.
In this case,

765
00:39:39.671 --> 00:39:42.040
this is enough of my version that I wouldn't do it.

766
00:39:42.041 --> 00:39:44.980
There's certainly some things that were contentious between me and the and the

767
00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.270
producers of financing years,

768
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.250
but nothing I can't live with at the end of the day.

769
00:39:48.251 --> 00:39:52.090
So it being a representative of the movie I wanted to make,
I think,

770
00:39:52.091 --> 00:39:55.530
well I don't want to go back.
Yes,
of course.
I'm going to look back in 10 years.

771
00:39:55.531 --> 00:39:56.680
I'll be like,
well I should have done a million things.

772
00:39:56.681 --> 00:40:00.100
I look back in 10 months now.
Last even I want to change a million things,

773
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:04.390
but it was representative of the restrictions that I was under,
physically time,

774
00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:05.253
money,

775
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:10.270
and it was a representative of who I was at 31 and all of these other things.

776
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:11.830
And you don't want to change that.

777
00:40:11.831 --> 00:40:13.420
You just want to move on and then make the next one would,

778
00:40:13.421 --> 00:40:16.390
let me learn and understand that.
And just to clarify,
when I,

779
00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:19.630
when I mentioned being in the audience and wanting to,
wanting to be like,

780
00:40:19.631 --> 00:40:21.100
you know,
wanting to get out,
right?

781
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.590
What I mean is I'm starting to plot with these prisoners.
I'm thinking,

782
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:28.270
how would I get out?
How would I go?
I leave.
No,
and I think,

783
00:40:28.271 --> 00:40:31.090
I think you guys captured it.
I think you guys captured that incredibly well.

784
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:34.390
So what was it like for these prisoners?
How do they get out if they want it to?

785
00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:38.310
<v 1>There was a magical formula that human,
somebody committee said,</v>

786
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:43.470
all they had to say is,
I quit the experiment.
If you say,
I went out,
I'm sorry,

787
00:40:43.471 --> 00:40:46.950
I don't understand that language.
And they say,
I can't take it.
I'm sorry.

788
00:40:46.951 --> 00:40:50.710
Wrong Ron Lang.
So,
so essentially,
um,

789
00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.570
implicitly they are saying I quit the experiment,

790
00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.120
but literally if they use that phrase,

791
00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:59.580
they would have been released after day one.

792
00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:04.410
The word experiments ceases to exist.
They say I want out.
Okay,

793
00:41:04.411 --> 00:41:07.860
write a letter to the parole board.
So we had a parole board.
Now in the movie,

794
00:41:07.861 --> 00:41:12.060
we only show one president every president,
every prison except one.

795
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.673
Oh Yep.

796
00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:17.670
I've applied for the Parole Board and the parole board was headed by an ex

797
00:41:17.671 --> 00:41:18.504
convict,

798
00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:23.700
brilliantly played who had just got out of prison after 17 years,

799
00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.570
who hated parole boards cause they had turned him down 16 years in a row.

800
00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:32.610
And so he plays the role and he becomes his enemy.

801
00:41:32.611 --> 00:41:34.850
And he says that he literally got sick.
He's a friend of mine,

802
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:38.750
Carlo Prescott got sick because he did this brilliant performance and

803
00:41:38.751 --> 00:41:41.120
improvisational perform,
not for the camera,

804
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:45.230
but for now again at aired,

805
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:48.800
we had secretaries,
they showed,
they showed me in the staff,

806
00:41:48.801 --> 00:41:50.180
there was not the case.

807
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:53.990
It was secretaries of different part of the building and the most dramatic thing

808
00:41:53.991 --> 00:41:58.220
that happens at the end.
Uh,
he said,
okay,
take him away,

809
00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.620
stand up.
And then we ask if we were to,

810
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:05.150
if we would have parole you,

811
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:08.180
would you be willing to forfeit all the money you have earned as a prisoner?

812
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:13.280
Everyone says yes.
The only reason they are is for 15 bucks a day.

813
00:42:13.281 --> 00:42:15.870
They just said,
I don't want your money.
What should they have done?

814
00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.820
I'm out of here.
And they take away,
they put the hands out,
the guards,

815
00:42:19.821 --> 00:42:21.650
put the handcuffs,
put the bag and take them away.

816
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:26.000
At that point they are prisoners.
It's not an experiment.
Let's see.

817
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:29.210
I want to turn it over to the audience of one more question about the three

818
00:42:29.211 --> 00:42:29.860
doctors in Bartow.

819
00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.590
Just done a coming into the film and in having done a little research on it

820
00:42:33.591 --> 00:42:38.450
beforehand,
I was really looking for the moment,
uh,
the turning point where,

821
00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:41.840
uh,
I guess,
I guess motivations get changed.

822
00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:45.530
I was looking for the moment where the guards crossed the line when,

823
00:42:45.531 --> 00:42:47.750
when people change.
And so you talk about these being smart,

824
00:42:47.751 --> 00:42:50.810
intelligent college students,
what does that change happen?
And I noticed,

825
00:42:50.811 --> 00:42:53.360
I think twice in the film there's a moment where it gets a little physical,

826
00:42:53.361 --> 00:42:54.230
it gets a little violent.

827
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:56.360
There's also a moment where somebody does try to get out.

828
00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:01.700
And it seemed in those moments that the guards and your researchers,

829
00:43:01.701 --> 00:43:04.640
everybody kind of looked to you and wanted to know what you thought would happen

830
00:43:04.641 --> 00:43:08.210
next.
And in those moments initially before you obviously canceled,

831
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.000
you called it off six days in initially you said,
let's keep going,
let's let,

832
00:43:11.001 --> 00:43:11.834
let's let it run.

833
00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:15.410
Did you feel caught up in a moment that you feel like your own motivations for

834
00:43:15.411 --> 00:43:20.330
change as well?
And there's no question.
I mean the main part of the study is um,

835
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:23.750
the most interesting part of this study for me,
the takeaway messages.

836
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.040
Everybody's kids.
Okay.
You know,
I'm uh,
I'm an old guy.
I'm 36,

837
00:43:28.041 --> 00:43:32.630
I guess there are 38 years old and I'm a seasoned researcher and I get caught up

838
00:43:32.631 --> 00:43:36.650
in the system I created.
And again,
it was by being the principal investigator,

839
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:39.140
you know,
I should have stopped it after the second kid broke down.

840
00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:42.590
We proved our point.
But because I had in my mind,

841
00:43:42.591 --> 00:43:45.420
we want to go for two weeks and a prisoner breakdown,

842
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:49.910
my job as principal vested is get a replacement.
So gallery placement,

843
00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.420
um,
and uh,
take them the student out.
So,

844
00:43:53.421 --> 00:43:56.530
so I got trapped in that role and is a scene.
Uh,

845
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:59.960
the real transformation was after visiting days,

846
00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.420
parents had to see the superintendent.

847
00:44:02.421 --> 00:44:07.130
So they came to my opposite superintendent and there's a scene where I become

848
00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:12.320
something I hate.
I become a sexist.
Okay.
Meaning a mother and father come in,

849
00:44:12.321 --> 00:44:16.340
the mother says to me,
I don't mean to make trouble sir.
Red Light,
Bang.

850
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:18.560
Nobody says that unless you've got to make.
And he says,

851
00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:22.320
I've never seen my son looking so terrible.
And I said,

852
00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.920
and then I saw at that moment I know she's going to blow the whistle.

853
00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.940
I F I immediately flip and I do what every authority does.
I said,

854
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.530
what seems to be your son's problem?
Okay,

855
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:35.670
so I'm making a dispositional when we're studying the situation for us,

856
00:44:35.671 --> 00:44:39.090
I know exactly what happened.
She said,
well,
you know,
he hasn't been sleeping.

857
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:43.650
As I said,
does he have insomnia again?
What's wrong with your kid?

858
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.670
She has no,
uh,
uh,
he told me they wake them up all hours of the night.
I said,

859
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.460
Oh yes,
of course we do.
That's the counts.

860
00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:54.000
Each guard shift has to account for the fact that prisons have not escaped.

861
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:57.590
And then she says again,
I don't mean to make trouble.
What am I going to do?
Okay.

862
00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:01.740
Who,
who's my cas?
There's the mother's going to make trouble.

863
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:03.240
And there's the father has been silent.

864
00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:06.750
Both of them have just seen their kid looking terrible.
Okay.

865
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:08.970
I turned to the father,
what do I say?

866
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:14.400
Don't you think your son is tough enough to take
at that moment?

867
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.150
She's a silly little woman.
And,
and I think we probably did did.
I said,
you know,

868
00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:22.710
guys shake.
And he said,
of course he is.
He's a real leader.

869
00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:26.640
They kept at that moment,
you know,
he says,
come on honey.
Takes her away.

870
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:31.230
You know,
I felt so terrible cause I realized what I had just done.

871
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:34.830
I had big become again a sexist guy,
you know,

872
00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:39.330
seizing the moment for what reason to save my prison because,

873
00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:43.050
and she was going to make trouble and she would have,
he broke down that night.

874
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:47.250
He,
he's eight one nine hadn't had a break down that night and she was exactly

875
00:45:47.251 --> 00:45:51.390
right.
And her husband,
the kids father sold him out.
And there was,

876
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:55.580
I remember when we were shooting that scene in the film that day,
um,
I'm sure

877
00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.580
<v 2>building downtown and there was like,</v>

878
00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:01.310
it was Saturday night and so people were started going up to the clubs that were

879
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.920
like nearby.
So there was literally like,

880
00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:06.070
like there was like drunk people like banging on the doors in the building.
I go,

881
00:46:06.071 --> 00:46:08.530
Hey,
what's going on?
Like what are you doing in there?
And,

882
00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.200
and Billy was trying to,
you know,
work up sort of the,

883
00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:13.450
that the anger you're talking about this woman and you can,

884
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:15.700
I could hear him on the mix and before he would run,
takes,

885
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:17.770
would say these things and stuff.
Like this is my experiment.

886
00:46:17.771 --> 00:46:20.440
You're not taking this away from them.
What do you think you are?

887
00:46:20.441 --> 00:46:24.190
You want me to say these things?
And there were so,
they were so great.

888
00:46:24.191 --> 00:46:27.420
It was so fascinating to hear how you,
but you run those things are you,

889
00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.390
you don't just think them,

890
00:46:28.391 --> 00:46:31.600
but you say them out loud and then you kind of get that.

891
00:46:31.601 --> 00:46:34.160
So he would sort of have that.
And nevertheless,
then there's like,
you know,

892
00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:35.890
there's like drunk people like banging on the window.

893
00:46:35.891 --> 00:46:38.010
Is that just sort of like came alive?
Yeah.

894
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:42.490
<v 1>So again,
so here,
forget about the kids.
So he is,
um,</v>

895
00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.740
me getting into the role.

896
00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:48.460
He has Carlo Prescott a season criminal,

897
00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.420
a felon who again plays the role of the,
of the,
um,
uh,

898
00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:56.050
parole board had and becomes that.
And the third character is,

899
00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:00.930
there's a scene where Catholic Catholic priest comes in and talks to the kids.
I,

900
00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:04.110
I tried to cross in the psychology of imprisonment in,

901
00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:08.860
at Stanford in July with Carlo Prescott in order for me to learn about prisons.

902
00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:13.510
And this priest heard about that and came to see me and my office hours said he

903
00:47:13.511 --> 00:47:16.960
was doing a term paper on something.
Could I give him some references?
I said,

904
00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.690
great deal.
How about you come,
I will do that.

905
00:47:19.691 --> 00:47:24.010
How about you come down to this study and interview some of the prison is and

906
00:47:24.011 --> 00:47:25.600
tell me how realistic it is.

907
00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:28.570
Cause he had been a prison chaplain in a prison in Washington.

908
00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:33.520
He comes down knowing it's an experiment and in two minutes he is the prison

909
00:47:33.521 --> 00:47:37.240
chaplain.
And what you see in the movie is exactly what happened.
He says,

910
00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:40.690
you know,
uh,
he introduced us up.
I'm probably the coffee.
What's your name,
son?

911
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:45.850
Almost every kid said the number,
I make one nine m two one six and then he says,

912
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:49.660
what are you in for?
And they said,
what do you mean what is your charge?

913
00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.300
And again,
when,
when we had the police arrest,

914
00:47:52.301 --> 00:47:57.190
the police always said one if a penal violation of penal code four 59 PC,

915
00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:01.000
I'm robbery breaking.
And they gave that.
And then he says,

916
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:05.510
what are you doing to get out?
I look at is what he means.

917
00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:09.310
I don't understand.
The words are exactly,
you're in jail,

918
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:15.460
what are you doing to get out?
And again,
he said,
you're a college student,
right?

919
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:19.510
You need a lawyer,
you're in jail.
And I'm looking at,
you know what I'm saying?

920
00:48:19.511 --> 00:48:23.200
Wow.
He's really into it.
And he says this,
each kid,
the kid.
I mean,
so

921
00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:27.980
<v 2>and it's a different era too where priests represented something a little bit.</v>

922
00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:31.280
Yeah.
There's a,
yeah,
I was seven.
I mean it's three scandal.
Yeah.
Pre,

923
00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.650
pre insets present.
Yeah.
You want to know,

924
00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:36.650
and it was an interesting thing because even we were trying to cast that park.

925
00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:40.490
A lot of the actors who came in played the nice priest.
Yeah.

926
00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:44.990
And w the one guy who came in and understood that the scene was really more

927
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:47.540
that,
that it was,
not that he was a mean priest,
but he was like,

928
00:48:47.541 --> 00:48:49.640
what are you here for?
What are you in foreign?
It's like that thing of like,
wait,

929
00:48:49.641 --> 00:48:52.420
you're this prison.
And then also then the next day,
there was a,

930
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:53.241
this isn't in the film,

931
00:48:53.241 --> 00:48:56.360
but there was a lawyer who came in who was somehow he called the lawyer,

932
00:48:56.361 --> 00:48:59.120
one of the kids in the lawyer and something happened where no

933
00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:02.000
<v 1>one of the kids said,
oh,
that's right.
One of the kids said,</v>

934
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:05.780
I have a cousin as a public defender.
He said,
well,
we should get him.
He said,

935
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.710
well,
uh,
uh,
I don't have his number here.
I call my mother.

936
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:13.110
So the kid gave the priest his mother's number,
the police call,

937
00:49:13.111 --> 00:49:16.190
the mother mother called the public defender.
And then the real thing,

938
00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:20.240
the public defender came down on Friday and that,
that's how I ended this thing.

939
00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:21.230
And at that point it was

940
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.720
<v 2>even the lawyer was using certain vernacular,
you know,
hey,</v>

941
00:49:24.721 --> 00:49:26.150
have you done your parole hearing at,

942
00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.620
or let's start preparing what you're going to do.
You know what I mean?
It was,
uh,

943
00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:30.450
there was a certain thing where that's what we're saying,

944
00:49:30.451 --> 00:49:34.110
the power of the role you give yourself even just a little bit of that.

945
00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.560
<v 1>Yeah.
Ability to be that.
Then you become,
it.</v>

946
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.100
Will we focused on the prisoners and guards.
But I'm saying,

947
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:43.940
here's the priests is a public defender.
Here's me,
here's a season at convict.

948
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:46.040
Everybody starts playing a role.

949
00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:50.690
And that's really the message and you become the role.
And in fact,
you know,

950
00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.860
in your life,
I mean,
you know,
who are you?
I,
you know,
I'm a,
I'm a teacher,

951
00:49:54.861 --> 00:49:59.520
I'm an educator.
I'm a Google code,
a coder.
I'm,
you know,
so,
and then that's,

952
00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:01.940
that's your,
that's your job.

953
00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.880
The job becomes your role and then it's your identity.
Who are you?

954
00:50:04.881 --> 00:50:08.390
That's what you say.
Um,
fascinating.
Uh,

955
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:10.760
we'd love to turn it over to you guys for Q and a as well.

956
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:15.570
We want to end with this after Q.
Absolutely.
We're going to,
okay.
Uh,

957
00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.450
my name is Daniel Steinberg.

958
00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:20.880
And in with the experience of 40 years of,

959
00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:23.470
of understanding of all this,

960
00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:28.580
it seems as if Abu Ghraib should not have been a tremendous shock to those of us

961
00:50:29.721 --> 00:50:34.490
who had followed any of this.
The question is,
is it possible when,

962
00:50:34.491 --> 00:50:39.491
is there any example of a prison in which this kind of behavior can be avoided?

963
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:45.170
In.
Do any countries have prisons where they have a completely different paradigm

964
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:49.160
that works?
Yeah,
it's so present.
You know,

965
00:50:49.161 --> 00:50:53.240
the most wonderful coincidence is that President Obama last week visited a

966
00:50:53.241 --> 00:50:56.420
prison for the first time in the history of America.

967
00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:00.650
No president in several hundred years ever visited a prison.

968
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:04.940
Meaning that whether or not you're liberal or not,
you know,

969
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:10.030
we are paying millions of dollars in taxes to maintain 2.3 million American

970
00:51:10.581 --> 00:51:13.200
citizens in prison.
Uh,
and hopefully he's going to,

971
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:16.550
he's looks like he's going to try to push some prison reform.

972
00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:22.370
Prisons are designed to punish.
They are not designed to rehabilitate that.

973
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:27.320
It's designed to educate.
Uh,
they are designed to punish.
Now when somebody,

974
00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.710
when a jury or a judge gives a prison sentence,

975
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:36.170
the only sentence is you have lost your freedom for this period of time period.

976
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.220
It doesn't say,
and therefore we're going to Umilog.

977
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:41.410
Yet you therefore going to put you in solitary confinement.
Definitely.

978
00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:44.840
We've got to punish you.
And the idea is you've got all these guys,

979
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:47.960
many of whom are uneducated,
have opportunity to educate them.

980
00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:49.880
They're going to be there two year,
three years,
five years.

981
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:51.140
You could teach them coding,

982
00:51:51.141 --> 00:51:54.980
you could teach them all kinds of stuff and you could teach them to original

983
00:51:54.981 --> 00:51:57.080
presence.
We're called penitentiaries,

984
00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:02.270
meaning you have time to think about the stuff you've done and be penitent about

985
00:52:02.271 --> 00:52:03.110
it,
you know,

986
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:07.460
but the point that it's been so transformed into simply places of punishment

987
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:11.210
where prisoners come out,
most of them broken and hate to hate the system.

988
00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:16.730
It turns out there's a prison.
It was a New York Times,
a few weeks in Norway,
uh,

989
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:21.700
which,
uh,
trains the guards and how to be compassionate,
uh,

990
00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.440
trains their prisoners and how to be,
you know,

991
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:29.530
accept their role with dignity and apparently to have like no recidivism.

992
00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:33.210
Um,
and uh,
I don't remember the name of it,
but it,

993
00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:35.840
I know there's a prison in Norway that that does what you say.

994
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:39.860
And clearly we need to just a new model.
He need a,
a model.
Okay.

995
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:44.360
The other thing we should be concerned about is the data is that within three

996
00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:45.650
years of being released,

997
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:50.420
60 to 70% of all prisoners released return.
On another crime,

998
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.940
in some cases,
even even more severe one,

999
00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:56.010
that means that's the definition of failure,
you know,
you know,

1000
00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:57.890
so you'll let somebody out in three years later,

1001
00:52:57.891 --> 00:53:01.610
they're doing the same or worse thing again.
Oh,
I'm Melissa,
I'm Smith.

1002
00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:03.500
I'm a intern actually at Google this way.

1003
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.190
And actually it's the calls you meet your,
so this is pretty fun.
Um,
as of Themis,

1004
00:53:07.191 --> 00:53:10.700
like psychology and psychology major where at George Mason and these great,
yeah,

1005
00:53:10.701 --> 00:53:11.110
of course.

1006
00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:16.030
So how do you feel about people associating you essentially only stands here,

1007
00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:17.240
Stanford prison experiment.

1008
00:53:17.241 --> 00:53:20.240
You've done lots of other research and lots of other really interesting things.

1009
00:53:20.241 --> 00:53:24.590
Like what,
no,
you're right.
I mean,

1010
00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:28.250
I mean it's,
it's,

1011
00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:32.580
it's a little demonstration we did in six days and it's,

1012
00:53:32.581 --> 00:53:36.790
in one way it's a curse.
Um,
when I,
so I never wrote a book about it,

1013
00:53:36.791 --> 00:53:40.290
but after I did the study,
um,
I wrote a few articles,

1014
00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:44.940
it became famous instantly because of,
um,
uh,

1015
00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.160
serendipitous circumstances.

1016
00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:51.630
The day after we did our study on August 21st,
1971,

1017
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:55.800
there was an alleged escape attempt of solar dad,

1018
00:53:55.801 --> 00:53:58.980
brother George Jackson from San Quentin,
and which he was killed,

1019
00:53:58.981 --> 00:54:02.490
people say murdered by the guards.
And,
but before he was,

1020
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:06.660
he released all of his buddies from solitary confinement who then killed all the

1021
00:54:06.661 --> 00:54:11.270
informants,
killed some guards and prisoners were in the news.
Three weeks later,

1022
00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:15.810
Attica prisons at attic prisoners revolted again,
took over the prison.

1023
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:20.940
First Time it took over the whole prison in sympathy to George Jackson's murder.

1024
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:25.740
Uh,
and,
and suddenly there was a Senate Judiciary Committee on crime.

1025
00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.650
And here I am knowing nothing about prisons other than my base.

1026
00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.410
And I'm in Washington DC talking about prison reform.

1027
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:34.860
I'm in San Francisco talking about juvenile justice.
Uh,
and,

1028
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.510
but I should say you'll appreciate this.
Um,

1029
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:42.160
so I'm sitting next to the Superintendent Mancuso of Attica,
uh,

1030
00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:46.770
Morgan Park of San Quentin,
the head of the guard union,
the head of prisoners,

1031
00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:50.460
a union.
I know nothing about prison.
So what do I do?
I say,

1032
00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:54.810
would you mind if I began by showing a slide show of the research we just did?

1033
00:54:56.370 --> 00:55:01.110
What that means is everybody now shares the same visual and from then on people

1034
00:55:01.111 --> 00:55:04.680
said as we saw in Zimbardo's prison guards the guard role.

1035
00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:09.260
Do you womanizers prisoners?
Not In this experiment.
He said as we saw in.

1036
00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:14.280
So suddenly I had status,
I didn't,
I didn't earn and,
and people attorney to me.

1037
00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:16.280
Well why do you think guards demonize prison?

1038
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:19.260
They talking to me rather than superintendent around these other,
uh,

1039
00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:21.330
so that was again,
so this thing I feel about,

1040
00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:25.950
so the main thing I did right after the study is I began to study the psychology

1041
00:55:25.951 --> 00:55:27.690
of shyness in adults.

1042
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:31.880
Before that psychologist only study China's the kids and they,

1043
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:36.180
so this is called developmental psychologists.
They're cutoff point is 13.

1044
00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:40.350
When did you get to be 13 then somebody.
So it was as if when you're 13,

1045
00:55:40.351 --> 00:55:42.120
you stopped being shy.
No,
nobody studied you.

1046
00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:47.570
So I studied shyness as a self imposed psychological prison where the prison in

1047
00:55:48.931 --> 00:55:53.460
you says,
here's the list of things you can do and the the garden.

1048
00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:57.780
And the guard says,
which you can.
And the prison you says,
okay,

1049
00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:01.350
I deserve the raise,
but I won't ask the boss of them.
I know the answer I wanted.

1050
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:05.790
I paid $10,
I know how to dance.
I won't ask the girl.
So,
so essentially,

1051
00:56:05.791 --> 00:56:09.900
and you ended up saying I'm worthless.
So I began to study shyness.

1052
00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:11.820
I had a shyness seminar at Stanford.

1053
00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:16.970
I started doing research on shyness and discovered that to be not shy is the

1054
00:56:18.811 --> 00:56:21.690
rare exception in the universe.

1055
00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:25.510
There's not more than five to percent of people in any country who are not shy.

1056
00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:29.920
So shine and people say,
I'm shy now.
I used to be shy,
outgrow it.
I'm shy.

1057
00:56:29.921 --> 00:56:31.660
And situation is the norm.

1058
00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:36.930
So we did research and then I started a clinic at Stanford and now it's in Palo

1059
00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:40.120
Alto University design,
exclusive retreat,
shyness.

1060
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.720
And we get 90 a hundred percent cure because we know it's,

1061
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:47.290
we know exactly what causes it.
We know how,
how to contain it,

1062
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:50.180
we'd have to treat it.
So that's what I'm most proud of because it's,

1063
00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:53.230
it's an interesting idea.
Uh,
and we did research on it.

1064
00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:57.100
And then we ended up doing a play and then I wrote two books,
uh,
shyness,

1065
00:56:57.101 --> 00:57:00.180
what it is,
what to do about it,
and the shy child that sold,
you know,

1066
00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.800
written for the general public.
Right.
So that's my legacy.

1067
00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:07.630
<v 2>Well,
I definitely feel a little,
um,
I felt like a little burdened by that.
I,</v>

1068
00:57:07.631 --> 00:57:11.290
that idea too,
knowing how much he'd done outside of this experiment.

1069
00:57:11.291 --> 00:57:13.750
And part of the thing that,
you know,
when I came aboard,
I kind of had to say was,

1070
00:57:13.751 --> 00:57:15.760
okay,
we're only making movie about these six days.

1071
00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:19.480
If you made a film called the doctor Philip Zimbardo story,

1072
00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:22.570
it would be wildly different.
Right.
This would be one portion of it.

1073
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:24.700
And you have to make that decision because you can't,

1074
00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.130
we could only afford one sentence that on a,
on a,

1075
00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:30.940
on a title card at the end of the film was really all we could do to try to

1076
00:57:30.941 --> 00:57:35.650
encapsulate that field.
Yeah.
And it was,
yeah.
And it was,

1077
00:57:35.651 --> 00:57:37.250
and it was,
uh,
you know,
it's,
it's,

1078
00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:39.700
it's just one of the challenges of making it into a movie.

1079
00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:43.810
And you can only hope that the movie leads people to the loser for a fact that

1080
00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:46.480
that then leads people to all these other things.
You can only,

1081
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:50.450
you can only hope for that or engineer it to hopefully do that,
but you can't.
Uh,

1082
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:54.670
the movie couldn't take on that responsibility being called the Stanford prison

1083
00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:55.001
experiment,

1084
00:57:55.001 --> 00:57:59.280
but it was definitely like a challenge to not include things like that.
Uh,

1085
00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:04.110
to what extent do you think the [inaudible] study experiment come used us

1086
00:58:04.111 --> 00:58:06.970
explore commentary,
excuse for evil doers,

1087
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:11.290
like people knowing that there is this situational you voided or will affect

1088
00:58:11.291 --> 00:58:12.124
their behavior.

1089
00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:16.720
<v 1>Thank you.
That's a good point.
So that's what ties to a grade.
Um,
uh,</v>

1090
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:19.340
when I'm agreeing happened in 2004,
um,

1091
00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.970
somebody made a lot of money and releasing 12 film,

1092
00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:27.710
12 images that the soldiers had taken.
So these were army ring service.

1093
00:58:27.711 --> 00:58:32.690
They were not real soldiers and that's really key.
Um,
they were army reservists,

1094
00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:37.820
uh,
uh,
uh,
military police guards in the,
in the basement and Aba Grade,

1095
00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:41.900
uh,
on the night shift tier one.
And,
um,

1096
00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:45.410
it turns out they were 12 or more than a thousand images.

1097
00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:48.410
Many of the images that were not released or much worse.

1098
00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:52.700
And what happened was I had a form of Stanford student who was working at NPR

1099
00:58:52.701 --> 00:58:55.240
and I happened to be in Washington,
called me and said,
hey doc,

1100
00:58:55.241 --> 00:58:58.760
does EDC those hit me?
I said,
no.
He said,
they're right out of the prison study.

1101
00:58:58.910 --> 00:59:03.170
God's putting bags over his head,
stripping him naked and having them simulate,

1102
00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:06.320
you know,
sexual activities,
you know,
do you want to come and talk about it?

1103
00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:09.710
So I did an interview the next day at NPR and I said,
look,
I,

1104
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:13.670
I know nothing about that situation,
but there's enough similarity.

1105
00:59:13.671 --> 00:59:18.410
It looks like the Stanford prison study on steroids because in our study went

1106
00:59:18.411 --> 00:59:20.420
for six days.
This went for three months.

1107
00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:23.830
They've used this to place over an extended period of three months.
And,

1108
00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.360
and I said,
you know,
um,

1109
00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:30.290
I want to believe American soldiers are good apples.
Cause you,
you remember the,

1110
00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:34.100
uh,
the military and the Bush administration,
these are a few rogue soldier,

1111
00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:37.420
a few bad apples.
Whenever there's a scandal,
the system protects itself.

1112
00:59:37.421 --> 00:59:40.220
I say don't blame us,
blame them.
And I said,

1113
00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:45.680
my concern is somebody put the are good apples and really bad barrels.

1114
00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:49.130
So we want to know who did that.
And those are the bad barrel makers.

1115
00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:51.860
So when we want to understand any human behavior,

1116
00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:54.890
it's not enough to make a dispositional individual analysis.

1117
00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:59.120
We have to do a situational analysis and then we have to put the situation in a

1118
00:59:59.121 --> 01:00:03.130
systemic context.
So that's the first time I use.
So bad apples,
bad app,

1119
01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.290
bed bowels,
bed barrel makers.
Uh,
and,
and that took off.

1120
01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:10.520
So then I became an expert witness for the guard who should've been in charge of

1121
01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:15.020
the night shift a chip Frederick.
And in my testimony I said,
uh,

1122
01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.150
this as the presiding judge,
you're on a chip.
Frederick is guilty as charged.

1123
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:24.530
The fact that he did this in this unique situation does not change his guilt or

1124
01:00:24.531 --> 01:00:27.110
innocence.
So you can't have,

1125
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:29.560
the situation is not excused theology.

1126
01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:34.570
But I can say with all expert confidence that he never would have done that had

1127
01:00:35.871 --> 01:00:37.430
he not been put in that situation.

1128
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:41.390
Because I studied his entire life from the time he was born to now he's an

1129
01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.410
outstanding soldier,

1130
01:00:42.411 --> 01:00:46.610
patriotic won many awards and they put him in this situation,
which is

1131
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:51.830
the most extreme situation I could imagine.
I won't go through the details with,

1132
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:54.620
you know,
he worked 12 hour shifts when he finished his shift.

1133
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.040
He slept in a prison cell in a different part of the prison because the prison

1134
01:00:58.041 --> 01:01:03.041
was under bombardment and also the abuse has happened only on the night shift.

1135
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.310
Nine of nine guards and the,
I shifted these things,
taking these pictures,

1136
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:10.940
you know,
putting prisons naked in pyramids,
etc. None on the day shift.

1137
01:01:10.941 --> 01:01:15.110
How could that be?
So that's a situational variable.
Zero of nine,
nine of nine.

1138
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.710
It turns out the head of military police,
I'm sorry,

1139
01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:21.590
the head of military intelligence goes to the head of the military police and

1140
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:26.480
Ann Arbor grave and says we're not getting any actionable intelligent.

1141
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:29.810
We're interrogating all these guys were getting nothing.
And the military,

1142
01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:34.280
the Bush administration is on our s the guys on your night shift have to take

1143
01:01:34.281 --> 01:01:37.170
the gloves off.
So you always use euphemisms.
Take the gloves off,

1144
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:39.740
they have to break the president.
So when we interrogate them,

1145
01:01:39.741 --> 01:01:43.490
they'll spill the beans.
Okay.
So essentially you're giving them total power.

1146
01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:45.370
And in three months is no,

1147
01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.500
no evidence that any senior office ever went down to the dungeon.

1148
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:52.160
So you're telling me I do what the fuck ever you want and nobody's going to

1149
01:01:52.161 --> 01:01:55.040
notice except when we interrogate them.
Hopefully they're going to,

1150
01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:58.400
they're going to give information.
And on the day shift,

1151
01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.170
senior officers were there all the time.

1152
01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:04.760
So essentially the message there is power without oversight.

1153
01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:09.040
Powers out.
Surveillance is a recipe for abuse.
It.

1154
01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:13.280
So the worst abuse at Sanford happened at night because some,
sometimes I had,

1155
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.260
I slept in my office upstairs,
so I never,

1156
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.070
I never left the situation with that for that week.
So,

1157
01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:23.610
so that's the message you give people absolute power and without oversight,

1158
01:02:23.611 --> 01:02:27.750
without limits,
without constraints,
over time that power will be abused.

1159
01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.100
And so,
so my,
my testimony reduced his sentence from 15 years to eight,

1160
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:35.580
then we're going to give him 15 years.
Uh,
and the worst they did physically,

1161
01:02:35.581 --> 01:02:39.870
he had a prison once.
But he,
but he allowed a lot of the,
uh,

1162
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.320
the Dick degrading images of the grading practices.
Um,

1163
01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.590
after you did the Stanford prison experiment,
I'm wondering,

1164
01:02:46.591 --> 01:02:49.020
did you reflect on classic works of Literature,

1165
01:02:49.021 --> 01:02:52.800
like Lord of the flies and the similarities and what did you make of that

1166
01:02:52.801 --> 01:02:56.490
intersecting?
Oh yeah.
I mean,
I taught a lot of the plaza.
I've written about it.

1167
01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:01.440
Um,
uh,
and it's just,
you know,
it's a brilliant golden state.

1168
01:03:01.441 --> 01:03:06.360
It's a really brilliant analysis of ordinary kids,
you know,
you know,

1169
01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:07.613
put,
put,

1170
01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:12.660
put in a new situation where essentially if you remember,

1171
01:03:12.661 --> 01:03:15.570
democracy takes over it.
At first,
the good kid,

1172
01:03:15.571 --> 01:03:17.250
the big kids protect the little kids.

1173
01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:21.300
And then the message is ultimately fascism rules.

1174
01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:25.850
Authoritarians take over.
All you need is one or two.
Uh,
and,

1175
01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.880
and there's a dramatic scene in the movie where,
um,

1176
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:35.220
um,
I knew it.
So,
um,
one of,

1177
01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:40.140
one of the guys strips himself naked and put and then paints himself with a

1178
01:03:40.141 --> 01:03:43.140
color and he gets the other guys to change their appearance.

1179
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.540
And at that point all hell breaks loose.

1180
01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.500
I actually did research on deindividuation following that.
Meaning,

1181
01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:54.030
what happens when you make girls feel anonymous and their job is to shock other

1182
01:03:54.031 --> 01:03:54.720
women.

1183
01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.950
I mean college students Shockey other women versus when they feel identifiable,

1184
01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.410
they gave twice as much electric shock,

1185
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:04.920
held their finger down in a shock button twice as long when they were anonymous.

1186
01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:09.810
So,
so I did that study before the prison study based on,
on Lord of the flies.

1187
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.010
You know.
So again,

1188
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:15.270
good literature taps into good psychology and what I try to do is have good

1189
01:04:15.271 --> 01:04:17.490
psychology.
It map onto good literature

1190
01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:21.440
<v 2>reference that too.
When we were shooting the film,
the last scene when,</v>

1191
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:24.200
when this is character comes in and says the experiment's over,
you know,

1192
01:04:24.201 --> 01:04:27.800
we talked a lot about their reaction that it was a really hard thing to get and

1193
01:04:27.801 --> 01:04:30.500
they get guys just did it right,
which is sort of a sense of relief.

1194
01:04:30.501 --> 01:04:31.400
But we talked a lot about that.

1195
01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:34.210
What happens at the end when they show up and they're saved,

1196
01:04:34.211 --> 01:04:37.370
they immediately resort back to like almost like an infant tile.

1197
01:04:37.371 --> 01:04:38.031
The way it's written,

1198
01:04:38.031 --> 01:04:41.090
they start like crying and wailing and they even start acting younger than their

1199
01:04:41.091 --> 01:04:45.620
age and it's this interesting thing of how quickly you can fall down this hole

1200
01:04:45.621 --> 01:04:49.850
and then how quickly our bodies get out of it too is really that in a weird way

1201
01:04:49.851 --> 01:04:54.110
that's almost as alarming is that it bothers people.
For instance,

1202
01:04:54.111 --> 01:04:55.280
at the end of the film it says they all,

1203
01:04:55.310 --> 01:04:56.900
none of them suffered to me longterm abuse.

1204
01:04:56.990 --> 01:05:00.560
People that don't want to understand the other co,
all the reviews I read,

1205
01:05:00.561 --> 01:05:03.400
they're like,
well yeah,
sure.
That's what the filmmakers want us to believe.

1206
01:05:03.401 --> 01:05:04.580
And it's a,
well no,
that's just the truth.

1207
01:05:04.581 --> 01:05:08.650
Many of them were not someone onto beads,
psychologists,
prison psychologist,

1208
01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:11.500
you know,
none of that.
None of these guys went on to be criminals or you know,

1209
01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.300
had any kind of institutionalization or anything.

1210
01:05:14.301 --> 01:05:17.770
And so it's an interesting thing and I remember talking to Director of

1211
01:05:17.771 --> 01:05:20.470
compliance,
which is a,
a subject matter,

1212
01:05:20.471 --> 01:05:23.380
which is about the fast food hoax that doctors about her has written about too.

1213
01:05:23.381 --> 01:05:27.640
And his film we had on our side the benefit of the,
this being much more famous.

1214
01:05:27.641 --> 01:05:30.820
So people were like,
oh,
people know it really happened.
But after compliance,

1215
01:05:30.821 --> 01:05:34.270
premier people were furious at him because they didn't want to believe it was

1216
01:05:34.271 --> 01:05:34.901
true.
And he was like,

1217
01:05:34.901 --> 01:05:38.230
they were mad at me because they were mad at the story in the movie.

1218
01:05:38.231 --> 01:05:39.690
But so they were mad.
They didn't put an,

1219
01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.590
except they were mad at the stories that they were mad at the movie.

1220
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:45.250
And then in turn were mad at me and you can't say,
well,
it was real.

1221
01:05:45.251 --> 01:05:47.400
You can only say so much to someone because they don't want to believe it.

1222
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:50.260
<v 1>Yeah.
Just very briefly,
I'm a,
I'm not sure how many people know.</v>

1223
01:05:50.261 --> 01:05:51.860
I think it was the compliance as they're rolling in there.

1224
01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.330
So there was this fast food hoax

1225
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.750
<v 2>that was the name of the film.
Yeah.
I don't know what the overall,
yeah.</v>

1226
01:05:57.950 --> 01:06:01.010
<v 1>Um,
in 27 different states in United States,</v>

1227
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:06.000
some guy calls a fast food restaurant,
all different kinds of mcdonalds,

1228
01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:11.420
whatever,
and says one of your employees is it says,
I'm Sergeant Johnson.

1229
01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:14.930
I'm Captain Johnson.
Uh,
we have evidence at one of your employee,

1230
01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:19.160
one of your new employees,
uh,
has,
uh,
been stealing it's contraband.

1231
01:06:19.161 --> 01:06:21.460
We think it's related to drugs.
Uh,
uh,

1232
01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.530
you could either you need to send it down to police station or you can wait and

1233
01:06:24.531 --> 01:06:26.840
we'll come and pick her up.
And they said,
which one?
Well,

1234
01:06:26.841 --> 01:06:31.310
the new one or the Brunette.
Oh,
Jenny.
Yeah,
that's the one.
It's Jenny.
He did,

1235
01:06:31.311 --> 01:06:34.410
he's making us happy.
He's in a phone booth.
And then what happens?
Then you say,

1236
01:06:34.411 --> 01:06:39.320
well,
bring it,
bring it to you security area,
uh,
and hold there for questioning.

1237
01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:43.460
And they do.
So now you have security cameras are covering this.
And then he says,

1238
01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:45.920
okay,
now why were you there?
Why didn't you begin?

1239
01:06:45.921 --> 01:06:49.070
So this is a female and put a stripper naked,
you know,
do it.

1240
01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:52.370
Do an initial search and tell it and tell us what you're doing.

1241
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:56.600
And then in some cases,
the woman says,
well,
I've got to go back to the floor.

1242
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:59.780
He said,
you know,
do you have anybody who could cover you?
You have a husband,

1243
01:06:59.781 --> 01:07:01.460
a boyfriend,
and this was,
yeah,

1244
01:07:01.461 --> 01:07:05.530
I have my fiance comes and now here's this guy with a naked woman and the,

1245
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:09.260
and the guy who's a wire,
I said saying,
okay,
now I want you to follow my orders.

1246
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:12.080
Uh,
she may have something under your breath,
so feel under her breath.

1247
01:07:12.081 --> 01:07:15.280
She may have something in her anus,
something I'd be,

1248
01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.260
so he's now this poor girl,
18 year old girl.

1249
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:22.570
He's is that we're doing the sexual stuff and then finally ends up okay.
Uh,
uh,

1250
01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:26.640
um,
we,
we still think she's guilty,
so I want to punish her.
So make,
make a,

1251
01:07:26.641 --> 01:07:30.730
have oral sex on you.
It's all caught on security camera all.

1252
01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.760
And he was finally caught,
uh,
by really good detective work.

1253
01:07:35.090 --> 01:07:39.440
But it's not one guy when,
I mean it's one guy,
but it's 27 different places.

1254
01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:43.740
And everybody sees the film,
blames the woman in the film who is the,

1255
01:07:43.741 --> 01:07:47.360
the security manager.
And she,
she just says,
you know,

1256
01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:49.190
he was really convincing.
I,
you know,

1257
01:07:49.191 --> 01:07:53.150
I'm just following orders like I do as a sick,
as you know,
a low level employee.

1258
01:07:53.151 --> 01:07:55.670
And Mcdonald's,
we follow orders.
People say do this stuff.

1259
01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.340
And nobody wanted to believe is that the same thing?
So they,

1260
01:07:58.730 --> 01:08:02.560
they were angry at the film maker.
They were angry at this woman.
No,

1261
01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:06.410
I think you gotta be angry at,
is this guy going after she got off?

1262
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:10.940
Because it was,
it was,
it was from the time he was arrested,
these things stopped.

1263
01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:13.490
But there was,
there was only circumstantial evidence.

1264
01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:15.830
The good news is the woman who was the woman is abused,

1265
01:08:15.831 --> 01:08:16.850
got a big court settlement

1266
01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:19.640
<v 0>and as an appropriate transition,
I promise that.</v>

1267
01:08:19.641 --> 01:08:21.180
And with one final question and I'll,

1268
01:08:21.181 --> 01:08:24.710
I'll ask it to you both but in a different way.
I'll let you guys decide.
So for,

1269
01:08:24.711 --> 01:08:27.350
for you,
I'll ask both of you.
Good for you.
It's the classic,

1270
01:08:27.351 --> 01:08:28.850
what do you want people to take away from the film?

1271
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.080
And what I'll address similarly,
doctors on board really quickly is sharing.

1272
01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.490
The way this came up was before we sat down,

1273
01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.200
I told Doctor Zimbardo that whenever a Kitty Genovese,

1274
01:08:37.201 --> 01:08:40.160
he comes up this trial nigger Milgram's experiment comes up.

1275
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:44.480
I am that guy in the room.
It's is no,
I wouldn't do it.
I wouldn't have done that.

1276
01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:47.690
I would've gone that far.
I wouldn't,
I would have helped the person need,

1277
01:08:47.691 --> 01:08:50.240
I would not have let the situation affect who I am.

1278
01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:54.770
I'm always that guy in the room.
And so the question there as well,
you know,

1279
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:56.750
talk about the hero training that you're doing.

1280
01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.850
It almost surprises me what you just said,

1281
01:08:58.851 --> 01:09:01.610
that you should blame the guy on the phone with exclusively.

1282
01:09:01.611 --> 01:09:06.611
Is it not also on those of us in society to stand by our morals and risk,

1283
01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:11.360
public ridicule to do what we think is the right thing?
That's my hand question.

1284
01:09:11.361 --> 01:09:11.580
Yeah,

1285
01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.780
<v 2>yeah,
yeah.
There was,
uh,
let's take away from the phone,
but honestly,</v>

1286
01:09:14.790 --> 01:09:16.800
I had one goal which was just con conversation.

1287
01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:20.940
I didn't want the movie to tell you what you should be talking about.

1288
01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:24.450
Those experiments still relevant 40 44 years later.

1289
01:09:24.451 --> 01:09:28.180
And it's relevant because every,
it's always relevant,
you know,

1290
01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.780
and so I didn't want the movie to narrow that in or say,
oh,

1291
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:32.580
look at what happened at Arbor Gray.

1292
01:09:32.581 --> 01:09:35.820
But I didn't want to contextualize it in our history because I wanted to move

1293
01:09:35.821 --> 01:09:37.710
into,
to sort of be able to exist always.

1294
01:09:37.711 --> 01:09:41.010
And so for me it's just if it leads to conversation than it's great,
you know?

1295
01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:42.180
To me that's,
that's the,

1296
01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.960
that was the number one goal or I shouldn't say fruitful conversation obviously.

1297
01:09:45.961 --> 01:09:47.940
You know what I mean?
It leads to saying I fucking hated that movie.

1298
01:09:47.941 --> 01:09:50.340
That's not a conversation you want it.
But you know,
for me it was,

1299
01:09:50.341 --> 01:09:51.180
and that's the goal of the,

1300
01:09:51.181 --> 01:09:53.710
I just don't want to ever make a movie that you forget,
you know,

1301
01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:54.623
10 minutes later.

1302
01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.670
And in this case it's hopefully leads to hopefully people look up the experiment

1303
01:09:59.671 --> 01:10:02.430
and it leads them to more understand.
Absolutely.
I think we all did.

1304
01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.780
<v 1>Yeah.
Present exp.org is a great website that we've been,</v>

1305
01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.330
I've been involved with like 20 years and we've just redone,

1306
01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:14.160
it has everything there is about the prison,
prison study,
prisons,

1307
01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.230
etc. And so what I would like,

1308
01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:21.000
but I would like to take away is the flip.

1309
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:25.500
So here I created evil.
Seek criminologist,

1310
01:10:25.501 --> 01:10:30.150
sociologist study evil from the outside in.
I mean,
interview,
interview criminals,

1311
01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:31.470
you visit prisons.

1312
01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:35.580
I wanted to create evil from the inside out that it's put good people in a bad

1313
01:10:35.581 --> 01:10:39.180
place and say,
you know who wins?
Does a good people?

1314
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:41.340
If you have a bad place filled with good people,

1315
01:10:41.341 --> 01:10:45.940
shouldn't they dominate or if the bad place,
uh,

1316
01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:50.160
is really bad and evil doesn't the place when and humanity lose.
And that,

1317
01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:54.480
unfortunately,
that's a conclusion.
And in this study in the movie,

1318
01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:00.200
there are no heroes except the woman who challenges me confronts me to say,

1319
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:02.580
what you're doing is wrong.

1320
01:11:02.730 --> 01:11:05.880
That these are not present as a not guards at boys and as suffering.

1321
01:11:05.881 --> 01:11:10.710
It's your fault.
And in,
in the real experiment,
she then says,

1322
01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:13.710
we had just moved in and it shows it,
which is true.
The beginning of the,

1323
01:11:13.711 --> 01:11:17.850
of the movie,
uh,
uh,
she says,
if this is the real you,

1324
01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.060
I don't want to continue my relationship.
We had just moved in.

1325
01:11:21.061 --> 01:11:23.490
We were planning to get married.
And so that's her role.

1326
01:11:23.491 --> 01:11:26.010
She's willing to give up a romantic relationship,

1327
01:11:26.011 --> 01:11:29.970
marital relationship for a moral principle about kid.
She doesn't even know.

1328
01:11:29.971 --> 01:11:33.360
But she's,
she saw the suffering.
And so,
so for me,

1329
01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:35.550
so that's really heroic.

1330
01:11:35.551 --> 01:11:40.551
So a hero is somebody who comes to the aide of others in need and or defends a

1331
01:11:41.321 --> 01:11:44.970
moral cause,
aware that his costs.
So altruism is heroism.
Light.

1332
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.100
You're giving money to church,
you get,
but it doesn't cost you.

1333
01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:51.930
So heroes a rare only because people in weighing the situation and say it's not

1334
01:11:51.931 --> 01:11:55.680
worth it.
So whistle blowers are proactive heroes that you see fraud,

1335
01:11:55.681 --> 01:11:58.170
you'll see corruption.
You have to collect data off,

1336
01:11:58.171 --> 01:11:59.400
you have to get people on your side.

1337
01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:04.710
Most heroes are really more impetuous,
uh,
uh,

1338
01:12:04.770 --> 01:12:07.680
react.
You react to the situation like the famous hero in New York,

1339
01:12:07.681 --> 01:12:11.370
the subway hero guy falls on attracts,
he jumps on the railroad track,

1340
01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:15.900
puts the guy between the tracks as the train goes over them for half an inch,

1341
01:12:15.901 --> 01:12:19.230
he would have been a dumb dead hero.
He would cut his head off.
He so,

1342
01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:23.700
so essentially.
So,
so when we finish this study,
I be getting,
I mean,

1343
01:12:23.701 --> 01:12:25.950
so when I started writing looser effect,

1344
01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:31.370
I realize that I know nothing about heroes because I started to lose it.

1345
01:12:31.491 --> 01:12:35.610
I sought the last chapter is how do you resist these powerful forces in all the

1346
01:12:35.611 --> 01:12:39.780
research and all the studies of evil in the real world,
in Holocaust,
in Bosnia,

1347
01:12:39.781 --> 01:12:44.050
Rwanda,
there's always a small percentage,
had five,
10 men,

1348
01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:47.790
never more than 30 of people who do it resist.
I won't go along.

1349
01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:51.150
They don't go along,
and some cases they not only don't go along,

1350
01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:53.960
they challenged the eval and I said,
you know,

1351
01:12:53.961 --> 01:12:56.670
I know I don't know anything about heroes.
I never thought about it.

1352
01:12:56.671 --> 01:12:59.670
And I should have given this woman who challenged me.

1353
01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:01.530
We've been married for 44 years.

1354
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:06.300
So I began to do research and literally library research and Harrison turns out

1355
01:13:06.301 --> 01:13:10.140
the word hero and heroine,
some does not exist in any psychology textbook.

1356
01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:15.500
It's not part of the positive psychology movement because a compassion and

1357
01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:19.920
empathy are virtues.
Heroism is a civic action.

1358
01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:22.680
So essentially IBM to say,
Hey,
wait a minute.

1359
01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:26.760
What good is compassion action if it doesn't lead to action,

1360
01:13:26.761 --> 01:13:29.220
because action is what changes the world.

1361
01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:32.340
So I started seven years ago in San Francisco,

1362
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:36.030
a nonprofit called the heroic imagination project.

1363
01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:40.140
The simple goal is to teach people,
all people,
especially young people,

1364
01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:43.770
to learn how to express the inner hero that you all have,

1365
01:13:43.771 --> 01:13:48.030
especially as kids who really had this inner hero,
not through superheroes,

1366
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:53.100
which is dramatic but the wrong direction because superheroes don't have the

1367
01:13:53.101 --> 01:13:55.740
most important thing in the world.
And every kid has is a brain.

1368
01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:59.760
They are the creation of somebody with a creative brain.
So,
so he said,

1369
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:01.260
you have something that they don't have.

1370
01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.390
And with your brain you could create anything.

1371
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:07.290
So essentially we're going to teach you how to be a wise and effective hero,

1372
01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.070
how to analyze social situations,
um,
uh,
how,

1373
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:13.150
how to take wise and effective action.

1374
01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.680
But the point is we want to inspire you to always take the right action,

1375
01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.410
stand up,
speak out in challenging situations,

1376
01:14:20.411 --> 01:14:22.900
studying in your family and your school and your community.

1377
01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:26.080
And then we have training program.
We teach people how to do this.

1378
01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:31.350
And then the other thing we do is I started education and a revolution

1379
01:14:31.631 --> 01:14:36.310
education.
We have a number of lessons about the bison effect about,

1380
01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:39.040
I know Carol Dweck was here from Stanford last week.

1381
01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:43.630
How do you transform a fixed mindset,
which you say I'm good or not good at this.

1382
01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:47.770
Uh,
to a growth mindset.
I'm good at anything.
If I put enough practice and effort,

1383
01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:52.540
how do you reverse prejudice had to change groups that have a negative
influence,

1384
01:14:52.541 --> 01:14:53.374
the positive.

1385
01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:57.460
So we call this understanding human nature and we have six of these programs.

1386
01:14:57.461 --> 01:15:01.570
We hope to have uh,
four more conservation sustainability.

1387
01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:04.750
But what's revolutionary is teachers don't teach.

1388
01:15:04.751 --> 01:15:09.751
We give them a script and all the programs organized around powerful videos

1389
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:14.020
cause kids live individual where we show a video and instead of having class

1390
01:15:14.021 --> 01:15:16.630
discussion,
the teacher has pairs,
pairs or triads.

1391
01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:20.260
And we try to have a boy and a girl together cause boys never answered in class.

1392
01:15:20.261 --> 01:15:22.100
Girls I was doing.
And,
and,

1393
01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:25.990
and so essentially you show her the video of a failure of bystander.

1394
01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:28.930
And then you say,
what were the people thinking?
Why didn't they help?

1395
01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:30.510
What would you do?
What's the difference?

1396
01:15:30.511 --> 01:15:34.150
He lucky in a situation being in that we showed them the kitty Genovese video

1397
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:36.580
and then we say,
you know,
how does anybody study this?

1398
01:15:36.581 --> 01:15:41.200
That we show them video of social psychology,
study this.
And then we say,

1399
01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:45.210
you know,
when should you help?
When should you not help?
Uh,
uh,

1400
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:47.620
and then think of a time when you helped.

1401
01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.950
Then you have a time when you didn't help.
And then we go through.
So each,

1402
01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:53.780
each of the six programs has the same eight activities.

1403
01:15:53.781 --> 01:15:56.800
So once the teacher learns to do one,
it's easy to transfer.

1404
01:15:57.310 --> 01:16:01.120
And then the key is at the end you say,
okay,
spread the word.

1405
01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:03.790
That's activity eight.
What does that mean?

1406
01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:05.830
What's the most interesting thing you learned today?

1407
01:16:05.831 --> 01:16:10.710
And the kid writes it now tell somebody and they write to tell your mother,

1408
01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:13.180
your cousin,
bus driver,
the grocery man.

1409
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:16.420
And they teach teaching in the next week is,
what did your mother say?

1410
01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:18.100
My mother was,
couldn't believe.

1411
01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:21.190
How could it be that when there's a lot of people around,
nobody helps.

1412
01:16:21.191 --> 01:16:23.620
It's better to have just one.
Now go back,

1413
01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:27.940
ask your mother if she could tell one other person.
So now this little lesson,

1414
01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:31.810
which we now Henry remote areas in Hungary,
you know,

1415
01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:35.830
some mother is telling the butcher and I'm not in the minus their notebook.

1416
01:16:36.370 --> 01:16:40.180
So in that sense,
it's really a revolution in education.
Um,

1417
01:16:40.690 --> 01:16:43.060
and the problem we have is we started here.

1418
01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:48.130
We can not get a program in any San Francisco high school because the high

1419
01:16:48.131 --> 01:16:51.100
schools,
they say,
you know,
if it's not stem,

1420
01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:54.370
if it's not preparing for the exams,
we can't work it in.

1421
01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:58.990
So our program is in all of the Hungary.
It's all over Poland.
It's in Corleone,

1422
01:16:58.991 --> 01:17:03.130
the Godfather town in Sicily.
And um,
you know,
so,

1423
01:17:03.131 --> 01:17:05.950
so right now we're trying to,
um,
uh,
uh,

1424
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:09.860
we just applied for a Google community grant because I have virtually no staff.

1425
01:17:09.861 --> 01:17:12.440
W W W we have a hero factory in my basement.

1426
01:17:12.450 --> 01:17:16.010
We're creating these little little heroes.
Uh,
so we needed staff.
We need,

1427
01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.330
we need a sophisticated help,
uh,
uh,
to move it to the next level.

1428
01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:24.800
So we have the material,
we have the desire and the inspiration.

1429
01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:29.740
Wonderful.
Well,
thank you both.
Called us on board are great to see you.
