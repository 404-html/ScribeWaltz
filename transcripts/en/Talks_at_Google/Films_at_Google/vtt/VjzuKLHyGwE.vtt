1
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.733
Everybody.

2
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.000
<v 0>I was expecting to be like a tiny room with like 20 people.
Oh Wow.</v>

3
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.790
This is a tiny room for us,
Lord.
Wow.
This is amazing.
All right.

4
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.000
Hi everyone.
Welcome to toxic Google today.

5
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:26.780
It is my pleasure to welcome Ryan Reynolds for Deadpool.
Right.

6
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.020
<v 1>Thank you.
Thank you very much.</v>

7
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.560
<v 0>Very nice to be here.
Thanks for joining us.
Yeah,</v>

8
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.600
I feel like I'm rubbing shoulders with real power.
We were at Google of it.

9
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.850
Yes.
Um,
Brian,
how excited are you for people to see this movie?
Uh,

10
00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:47.710
I'm,
I'm,
I could not be more excited.
Actually,
I'm 11 years excited.
I,
uh,

11
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.740
when I talk about it,
I always just grateful I'm wearing an adult diaper.
The,
uh,

12
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.410
this movie has been the biggest pain in the ass to get made.

13
00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:58.710
And somehow some way a,

14
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.650
the movie gods looked down on us in and made that happen through a number of

15
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:03.730
illegal transactions,

16
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:07.970
not the least of which being a ar test footage leaking onto the Internet,
uh,

17
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.860
accidentally about,
uh,
two years ago.

18
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.390
And that's what gave us the green light.

19
00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:15.910
So I'm thrilled to talk about Deadpool movie cause I didn't,

20
00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:18.320
I never thought Deadpool would actually be,
it would exist.
It's,

21
00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:21.250
it's been an 11 year thing and it's the worst relationship I've ever been in.

22
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.890
But we're happily married now and,
uh,
and,
and we're,

23
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:29.080
we're expecting congratulations.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Uh,

24
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.110
would it be fair to say the Internet helped make this movie happen do yet?
No,

25
00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:34.780
it would be,
it would be absolute fact to say that the Internet,

26
00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:39.130
the Internet is why I'm sitting here talking to you.
I'm quite literally,
it was,

27
00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:40.720
uh,
uh,
the fans,
uh,

28
00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:44.890
overwhelmed 20th century Fox studios with a hate mail.

29
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.600
Uh,
I'm,

30
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.200
I'm sure other illegal substances filled in sorts of all sorts of containers.

31
00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:52.390
They were,
they were vicious and they,
um,

32
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.830
they owe so overwhelmed Fox with feedback and positive feedback about a Deadpool

33
00:01:56.831 --> 00:02:01.750
movie that,
uh,
that,
yeah,
here we are relatively short order.
They were,

34
00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:05.140
they were basically said,
go make your movie and leave us alone because we,

35
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.450
we were sending emails,

36
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.360
we sent emails to the heads of the studio that you would never send to the head

37
00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:14.800
of a major film studio.
They were just like,
just borderline illegal.

38
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.970
Uh,
so,
um,
yeah,
the,
I think they were just happy to say,
here's the green light.

39
00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:21.850
Now please leave us alone.
And they left us alone,

40
00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:24.970
so we got to make the movie that we'd always dreamt drempt off.
So yeah.

41
00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:27.400
How relieved were you when they said,
yeah,
I'd make an r rated movie.

42
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.530
You guys embraced that?
We,
uh,
we hugged it like a cuddly Koala,

43
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.560
uh,
is not the word.
Yeah.
We a,
yes,

44
00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:38.650
we dry humped a cuddly Koala into an r rating,

45
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.020
which just weirdly legal,
uh,
we had,
uh,
we had a blast.
No,
they,

46
00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:45.820
the only way to make Deadpool is to make it,
uh,

47
00:02:45.821 --> 00:02:48.760
without any kind of a reservation.
And,
uh,

48
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.360
having a PG 13 just wouldn't really allow us to have the creative freedom we

49
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:56.290
needed to,
to sort of really bring to life in the most authentic way.
This,

50
00:02:56.291 --> 00:03:00.010
this marvel character and you know,
and he lives within x man universe.

51
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:04.900
So technically he's kind of orbiting the same areas is,

52
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:06.550
you know,
Wolverine and all these other guys.

53
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:09.010
So they're all sort of touched upon in the movie.
And,
uh,

54
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.370
we see a couple of other x men.
And I just think personally on a personal level,

55
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:15.220
it's just funny to me to see,
ah,
like this,
you know,

56
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.300
me yelling at another x band that he's a wheezing bag of Dick tips and the fact

57
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:26.310
that like,
they let me get away with that with was a refreshing,
I'll say.
Yeah.

58
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.470
Uh,
how would you convince someone's grandmother to go see this movie?
Would,

59
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.010
would that be the exact phrasing you'd use?

60
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.750
Wheezing bag addictives is a start for sure.
Um,
uh,
no,
I,

61
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:41.290
I think what's funny is,
is that a lot of,
um,
a lot of,

62
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:44.920
I've seen some older women at some of the screenings and they loved it.
I mean,

63
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:47.650
but then again,
Bendix sort of go in knowing what they're,
what they're getting.

64
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:50.650
Um,
but in terms of,
uh,
uh,
I think,
you know,

65
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:54.010
I think you just have to lift grandma up and physically take her to the theater

66
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.570
and yeah,
just tell her we're going to go see it on golden pond.
Uh,

67
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.320
part two are driving miss daisy or something like that.
And Yeah.

68
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.120
Hope it doesn't kill her.
Yeah.
Um,
what's,

69
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:11.500
what's been the most surreal experience,
either filming the movie or afterwards?

70
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.020
Oh,
the most surreal experience by far was,
was,
um,
was the day I,
uh,

71
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.460
it was the day I walked into film illusions,

72
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:21.220
there's a gentleman named Russ Schenkel who's the guy in Hollywood that makes

73
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:24.940
all the really cool,
you know,
Superhero costumes.
You know,
he's the,
he's,

74
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:27.790
he's the go into a shop and you see that,
oh,
there's Batman and Oh,
there's,

75
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:30.970
you know,
the Spiderman and there's,
you know,
but he,
uh,

76
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.320
he had spent months and months trying to get the Deadpool suit right.

77
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.650
We are sort of edict at the beginning was this has to look,

78
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.480
this has to be the most face faithful comic book to Screen Costume Adaptation.

79
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:47.830
That's been,
and it's ever been attempted.
And he met that challenge,
uh,

80
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.880
tenfold when I saw that was the most surreal moment where I saw the suit for the

81
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:56.020
first time.
And,
and I,
and I'm not exaggerating or trying to be funny,
I wept.

82
00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.880
I cried because it was this 11 year journey and I thought,
wow,
we're,

83
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:04.600
we're off to the races here.
I mean,
we really are on to something.

84
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:07.570
If we're starting the movie off on this foot,
on this footing,

85
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.660
this is going to be really special.
So that was,
that was pretty surreal.
And well,

86
00:05:10.661 --> 00:05:12.180
speaking of the suit,
uh,
it's,

87
00:05:12.181 --> 00:05:16.420
it's interesting to have a superhero who we kind of don't always actually want

88
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:21.100
to see his face.
No,
it's aesthetic reasons.
Um,
so how,

89
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.890
how did you sort of approach that performance?
I,
it looked like,

90
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:25.780
so like the eyes are animate a little bit,
which was awesome,

91
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:29.260
but you also have to combine that with your body language and then raw

92
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:33.580
physicality of,
yeah,
there's,
well,
we sorta,
uh,
in the screenwriting process,

93
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:35.820
we started developing the script six years ago,
myself,

94
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.650
Rhett Reese and Paul were and can read recent pulmonic road,
Zombie land.

95
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:42.640
And they're,
they're just like really fun,
smart,
engaging,
really funny writers.

96
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:44.420
And,
and uh,
we all sat around,

97
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.140
we sort of felt like you needed it for an origin story on Deadpool.

98
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:49.870
You need a third,
a third,
a third.
So a third looks like me.

99
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.790
And then a third looks like the scarred version of Wade who we affectionately

100
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:58.570
say looks like Shrek took a shit on his shoulders.
And then you have the,

101
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.700
the masked version of,
of,
of Deadpool.
And that is sort of the,
the,

102
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.660
the true embodiment of the character and the spirit.
So,
um,

103
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:06.890
it was always a challenge.
I mean,

104
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:09.770
the mask pushing emotions through the mask is interesting.
Like I,

105
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.720
two days before shooting,
I produced the movie.
So I was,
I,

106
00:06:12.721 --> 00:06:15.170
I got luxuries that I would never have as an actor.

107
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:17.720
I actually got to assemble a small camera crew and say,

108
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:18.830
I need to just go into a room.

109
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:21.860
I need you to fill me acting like a moron for about two days.

110
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:24.900
So I could just see how the suit behaves and how the suit moves and how it,

111
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.370
how much expression I could have through the suit.
So,
um,
I learned a ton.

112
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:31.610
I've got to do a lot of r and d with the suit and,
um,
you know,
it was,

113
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:34.520
we were shocked.
You could actually really kind of come through that.
You know,

114
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:37.220
there was a little bit of facial animation in the eyes,
which really helped us,

115
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:38.750
but by and large,
you know,

116
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:41.930
we love the scenes where you were not even animating the face.
It's just a,

117
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.550
just sort of work.
So yeah,
it was,

118
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.290
it was great to see this sort of like the physical LSA comedy parts,
and then,

119
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.760
yeah,
you have to be really big.
You know,
you have to be like a little,

120
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.450
you have to sort of take a tip from clown school a little bit when you're in

121
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:58.000
that thing.
So all my,
all my reactions of sort of huge.
So when,

122
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.730
when were you first introduced to the character of Deadpool?
I was on a set,

123
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.680
I was on the,
the movie Blade Trinity,
which,
um,
uh,
uh,
I hope,

124
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.360
I hope most of you if not seeing,
um,
but,
uh,
no,
I,
there's some,

125
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.910
there's some fun parts that movie,
but,
but it's,
it's uh,

126
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.030
it was a movie where I got to have a lot of fun.
Uh,

127
00:07:17.031 --> 00:07:19.090
I got to do the movie with my friends.
It was certainly the,

128
00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:20.540
the movie was fraught with a lot of,

129
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.230
a number of different frustrations that sometimes big movies can have.
But uh,

130
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.520
but I played a character in that movie that I guess resembles Wade Wilson and

131
00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:30.110
Deadpool and,
uh,
I,

132
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.650
I not rival executive at another studio is that I saw a little piece of blade

133
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:36.260
and you know,
you're Wade Wilson,
you're Deadpool.
And I didn't know at the time,

134
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:39.590
this is in 2004.
I didn't know who Deadpool was.
And he said,
trust me,

135
00:07:39.591 --> 00:07:41.320
they ever make a movie about Deadpool.

136
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.220
You're the only guy that can play Deadpool.

137
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.120
So he sent me over all these comics and I,
I'm not a big comic book guy,

138
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:50.680
but I've really gravitated toward Deadpool.
I fell in love with Deadpool.
Um,

139
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.700
the first,
uh,
issue,
I opened up,
I not making this up.
I was on the panel,

140
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.120
like in,
in the comic it said,
Deadpool was saying,
I,

141
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.500
somebody asked him what he looks like.
He says,

142
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:04.760
I look like a cross between Ryan Reynolds and a Sharpei.
And I was like,
Jesus,

143
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:09.470
this is fucking destiny.
I,
what the hell?
Who's fucking with me?
It's like,

144
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:10.304
you know,

145
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.760
Kirk Cameron gonna jump out of the corner with his little candid camera and I'm

146
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:18.110
going to offend him with my squares.
Um,
so I just kept,

147
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.430
I kept reading them all and I was just so in,

148
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.960
fell so in love with this character.
He was like Metta.
He breaks the fourth wall,

149
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:27.530
addresses the audience.
He knows he's in a comic book.
I mean,
you know,
in the,

150
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:31.100
in the film,
Deadpool,
Deadpool makes fun of Ryan Reynolds and I love that.

151
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:33.290
I love that he gets to do that.
It's a,
it's a,

152
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:37.320
it's a kind of a groundbreaking Shondra bending property and the fact that a

153
00:08:37.321 --> 00:08:41.370
studio let us make it,
uh,
not just let us make it bit,
let us make it.

154
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:46.010
It also has a rated r movie was just,
I mean crazy.
I couldn't believe it.

155
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.010
So it's uh,
I think,
I think Deadpool,

156
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.420
the comic characters definitely very self aware and yeah,

157
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:56.510
you guys very much embrace that and pop culture.
Yeah,

158
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.790
there's a lot attic history in culture references in it and there's like,

159
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.740
the movie has over a hundred Easter eggs too.
I mean,

160
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:05.070
it's just little things like that.
Some things that you may not see that I,

161
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:05.790
I don't know if we'll,

162
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.870
if we ever get the opportunity to shoot another Deadpool movie or another 10 if

163
00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:13.410
I have my way,
um,
I,
I'll use in those.
So I don't want to really give them away.

164
00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:15.640
But there's,
there's so many great little Easter eggs.

165
00:09:15.641 --> 00:09:18.720
It was so much fun to plan all these things in the movie of what you can tell
us.

166
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:21.760
What was one of your favorite things to film for the movie?
Um,
oh God.

167
00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:25.320
Of what are the I probably my favorite scene,
there's a scene where Deadpool,
uh,

168
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:26.760
attacks another x men.

169
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:30.300
And I just liked it that in this moment we're really embodying the moral

170
00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:31.740
flexibility of the character.
I mean,

171
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:34.320
that's one of the things that I personally love about Deadpool so much is that

172
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:38.430
he,
he ostensibly looks like a superhero,
but he's morally flexible in every way.

173
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:40.570
Like,
and that's,
that to me is just you do,

174
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.720
you get a lot of superheroes that are tough and that talk like this and the Hay.

175
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.720
But Deadpool's like he genuinely is a guy that'll just sort of help out whoever

176
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:52.320
has the,
the,
the fattest wad of cash.
And I love that about him.

177
00:09:52.321 --> 00:09:54.710
And so there's a scene where he just,
he just,
he is,

178
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.670
ego gets bruised and he just attacks this x men named the Colossus and at the

179
00:09:59.671 --> 00:10:04.200
scene,
uh,
he ends up breaking every bone in his body attacking colossus.

180
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.650
And I just love that scene because he just never shuts up the whole time.

181
00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:10.260
He just keeps us running,
editorial,
going of everything that's happening.

182
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:13.110
And it's,
that's an,
there's a lot of fun.
So every bone,

183
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.760
it was graphically to,
um,
uh,
what's,

184
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:21.150
what's one of the things that you did in the preparation process that you

185
00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:24.960
weren't sort of expecting to have it a large effect on playing the park?

186
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.900
The prep for me was easy.
I was,

187
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:31.910
it was basically being eased out of my mother's womb and then being fed enough

188
00:10:32.881 --> 00:10:37.350
to grow into adulthood and then beginning filming.
I mean,
I,
to me it was just,

189
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:42.300
it was a matter of that marriage between myself and Paul Wernick and just

190
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:43.740
finding these two writers that,

191
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.580
that's so understood everything that we were trying to do.
And um,

192
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.150
and those guys had been such a privilege to,
not only to know,
but to work with.

193
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.630
Also,

194
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.510
the thing I love about Denver was the marketing campaign is an extension of the

195
00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:56.460
film,
which is not normal.
You know,

196
00:10:56.461 --> 00:10:59.220
most times we didn't have a character that breaks the fourth wall and addresses

197
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:03.060
the audience directly.
The,
the possibilities for a film or obviously limitless,

198
00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:06.240
but so is the marketing.
So for me,
the marketing has been a lot of fun.

199
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:09.960
We've been shooting,
I think we shot over 40 viral videos.
Um,

200
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.100
maybe only 12 or 15 we've released that.
We have so many,

201
00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:15.810
I mean it's just a bare an embarrassment of riches,

202
00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:18.750
but half the time it was just me and my iPhone just,
you know,

203
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.990
shooting myself with the trailer or wherever and you know,

204
00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:25.620
while we were shooting.
So,
um,
that part's been amazing.
I think.
Yeah,

205
00:11:25.621 --> 00:11:28.200
I think you guys have done a great job of building the excitement amongst the

206
00:11:28.201 --> 00:11:29.420
fans.
Yeah,
well not,

207
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.790
I mean people knew about Deadpool a year ago and I feel like they've done a

208
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:35.400
great job of really introducing him to the uninitiated as well.

209
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:37.800
So what's been one of the greatest sort of fan experiences?

210
00:11:37.801 --> 00:11:42.490
Cause I think there's a very rapid call upon me.
God,
it was crazy.
I was,

211
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:47.130
cause last time it was at comicon was,
was I was there for green lantern and uh,

212
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.380
and that was tough.
Like,
you know,
you're so,
uh,
you know,
you sorta feel like,

213
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:52.970
you know,

214
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:57.150
I'm so close to Deadpool and I'm so intimate with it that like I haven't,

215
00:11:57.151 --> 00:12:01.540
zero objectivity.
I mean,
absolutely zero.
So walking into comicon,

216
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:04.810
everybody's laughing and smiling and Rhett Reese,
Paul Wernick and Tim Miller,

217
00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:05.530
the director and everything.

218
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.760
I was just laughing at backslapping and I just have sheet white and terrified

219
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:13.270
cause I have no idea how it was.
I'm too close to it.
So then when the,

220
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.520
when the are our presentation played,

221
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:18.500
we showed them about three or four minutes of the movie,
um,

222
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.010
and it finished and they were all on their feet.

223
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.710
And then there they started chanting one more time,

224
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:26.740
one more time and that are on the side stage.

225
00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:30.760
I looked over there and I could see the studio head who had waited 10 years

226
00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:34.840
degree,
like the movie just looking at me like with this smile on her face.
Like,

227
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.350
well there you fucking go.
You know.
Um,
and,

228
00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:42.140
and Hugh Jackman was actually standing next to her cause wolverine,
uh,

229
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.580
that they were doing wolverine presentation next and he,
he actually told them,

230
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.070
play it one more time or they're going to fucking riot.

231
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.100
So they played it one more time or our presentation and that,

232
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:56.050
that to me was like,
I was so surreal.
It was such a magical moment.
I mean,

233
00:12:56.051 --> 00:12:59.500
just for everybody,
because we didn't make the movie on,
I mean,

234
00:12:59.501 --> 00:13:03.110
I always joke like we,
our budget for Deadpool was what,
you know,

235
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.620
most superhero movies spend on just cocaine.

236
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.000
So like for us it was,
you know,
we didn't have,
you know,

237
00:13:10.001 --> 00:13:12.610
$200 million to sort of make all our dreams come true.

238
00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.120
We every single cent counted.
And Tim Miller,
our director is like,

239
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.480
he's a visual effects guru.
He owns a visual effects company.
So he made,

240
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.280
he made every dollar turn,
magically turned into 10.
I don't know how he did that.

241
00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:27.400
And um,
I'm so grateful to him for like making everything,

242
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.130
us being able to realize our vision for the movie and really kind of put

243
00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:31.330
everything that was on the page,

244
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.110
on the screen at a cost that you can't tell we compromised.
I mean,

245
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:37.030
it still feels like you're watching him,
you know,

246
00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:40.120
one of these movies with these massive budgets and,
and uh,
yeah,

247
00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:42.220
but just way less recreational drugs.

248
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.330
So cocaine fall under craft services you think?
I don't know.
You know,
it's funny,

249
00:13:46.331 --> 00:13:49.990
but like,
you know,
obviously that never happens anymore,
but,
well,
maybe it does.

250
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:54.010
Uh,
but uh,
the,
the it back in the 80s,
you could always look at,
I,
you'd always,

251
00:13:54.011 --> 00:13:55.900
they always talk about like the,
the,
the line,

252
00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:57.340
the line costs on a movie and stuff,

253
00:13:57.341 --> 00:14:02.230
and there'd always be this like miscellaneous line that was like $80,000 and

254
00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:03.100
they'd just be like,
oh no,

255
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:07.600
that was just individually wrapped Norwegian toffee and,
and you're like,
right,

256
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.550
right.
Whatever you call it.
Uh,

257
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.410
we're going to take audience questions in a moment if anyone wants to line up.

258
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:19.090
Thank God.
No,
I'm kidding.
You've been doing great.
Even doing so great.

259
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.720
You've been doing an amazing thank you.
Thank you very much.
Very much.

260
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.510
My two weeks notice and a big hand for,
and please come on.
She's amazing.

261
00:14:28.511 --> 00:14:29.344
You've been doing?

262
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.880
Um,
I think a lot of people on the Internet,

263
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:40.360
we're curious where there any onset shenanigans and if so,

264
00:14:40.361 --> 00:14:43.600
can you tell us about anyway,
I'm not a ta.

265
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.130
Like surprisingly for a movie like this,

266
00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:48.550
there weren't a ton of onset shenanigans is a lot of it was just alternate
jokes.

267
00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:51.010
I mean,
we just had so much fun with massive,
I,

268
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.800
it was just a matter of time that sort of pulled us away from each scene.

269
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:58.370
But like we would do 15 all jokes for everyone you see in the movie.

270
00:14:58.371 --> 00:15:02.600
So the home entertainment package or whatever the hell they,
I'm like so old.

271
00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:06.840
I'm like,
the laser disc package for this film is going to be exceptional.
Uh,

272
00:15:06.841 --> 00:15:09.080
know that the digital package that comes after it,

273
00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:10.400
they're going to have everything.
I mean,
all the,

274
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:15.020
the gag reel is just stupid stupid power cut.
Yeah.
You could do like a nine or,

275
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.690
I mean,
there's so many little extras that,
that,
that stuff's gonna be fun,

276
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:22.070
I think.
And do you have a,
a personally,
do you have a favorite furniture line?

277
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.420
Any favorite?
Oh

278
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.570
or Varsha is a dead Paul's personal favorite though.
They'd be yours.

279
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.300
That things just absolute bullshit.
And I think we all know it

280
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.890
for anyone who hasn't seen the movie here or there just going,

281
00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:41.090
what the fuck is he talking about?

282
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.010
Deadpool in the movie forces his blind elderly roommate to assemble Ikea

283
00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:51.011
furniture all day because he's a wonderful guy to stand up citizen.

284
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.580
Um,
so my question is,

285
00:15:55.581 --> 00:16:00.140
what's a fictional character that you wish to play but haven't?
Oh,

286
00:16:00.141 --> 00:16:04.820
that's a good question.
Not Bella from twilight

287
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.540
fictional character that,
uh,
there's a,
uh,
oh,
so boring answer.

288
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.210
There's a great,
uh,

289
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.000
prison baseball player named Lynn Blackie Schwamm from I think the 20s and

290
00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:20.210
thirties.
And he was known as the greatest prison baseball player ever.

291
00:16:20.211 --> 00:16:22.780
He was a pitcher,
but he was totally debilitated by alcoholism.
And I,

292
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.300
I've always been sort of totally fascinated by his story and,
uh,

293
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.180
so I would love to,
I would love to play Blackie Schwamm in a,
in a,

294
00:16:29.181 --> 00:16:32.660
in a movie that nobody will ever make.
Yeah.

295
00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.860
Well they said that about Deadpool and then they made that.
So you never know.

296
00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:38.270
Right,
right,
right.
In your letters,

297
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:43.390
I know how passionate you all are about Blackie Schwamm so it begins now pickins

298
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.330
out.
Um,
actually what,
what sort of other,

299
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.250
what have your other acting experiences,

300
00:16:49.251 --> 00:16:52.370
you bring your sitters a moment that I was sort of reliving your,
uh,

301
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.240
your performance and like buried.
Oh,
he's just really good at like freaking out.

302
00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.320
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Were there,
were there any moments you're like,
oh no,

303
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.490
I am good at freaking out.
It's false faces.
I'm pretty,
like I all,

304
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:06.530
I'm the first guy to say like a movie I did,
or if I to said it sucked,

305
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.390
but like I,
uh,
yeah,

306
00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.820
that's the one gift I've always had is freaking out in small spaces.

307
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:12.830
It's because probably because I'm the youngest of four boys,

308
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.840
so I was often crammed into small spaces,
both for survival and for torture.
So,

309
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:19.610
um,
but yeah,

310
00:17:19.611 --> 00:17:22.720
and the movie eye in dead poet's certainly like I'm choking to death and I'm

311
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.460
being tortured and,
and uh,
I am fine with it,

312
00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:29.960
but the problem is it blows all the blood vessels in my face.
So,
uh,
I have to,

313
00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.130
they have to end up like putting a lot of a lot of makeup on the cover up my a

314
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.460
horribly blood vessel blown face,

315
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:41.810
your horrible face on and makeup [inaudible] makeup on over top of that.
Yeah.

316
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.420
Awesome.
Yup.
Hi.
Hi.

317
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.610
What is your favorite movie other than Deadpool?

318
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:51.610
Two what is the movie that you're most of?
I am most proud of.
Yes.
Oh,

319
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.100
probably buried.
I mean it was just,

320
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:56.610
it was really difficult to do and everyone said it was impossible and I love

321
00:17:56.611 --> 00:17:59.340
that experience as we shot the whole thing in Barcelona,

322
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.920
the whole movie takes place in a coffin for those of you who don't know.

323
00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:06.540
And it's just a,
a real Hitchcock kind of a thrill ride now.
So I love that movie.

324
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.880
I still don't know why we shot it in Barcelona and we couldn't just do it in my

325
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:13.370
living room,
whatever.
I don't make the rules.
So yeah.
Yeah.

326
00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.960
Thank you're welcome.
Thank you.
Hello.

327
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.900
<v 2>Hello.
So about the last time you played dead pool,</v>

328
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:24.520
was there like an agreement that if you played that less entertaining version

329
00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:27.790
that you would get to like do a full Deadpool movie?
Actually,
yes.

330
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.180
<v 0>Peter was how true.
I remember they said,</v>

331
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.540
I've got to,
I got the script and it was during the Hollywood writer's strikes,

332
00:18:35.541 --> 00:18:38.120
there's no writers.
So it just,
it basically said Deadpool shows up,

333
00:18:38.121 --> 00:18:39.860
talks really fast,
annoys everyone around him.

334
00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.310
So for the whole first half of that movie,
I play Wade Wilson and I'm just Yada,

335
00:18:43.311 --> 00:18:44.210
Yada,
Yada the whole time.

336
00:18:44.211 --> 00:18:46.570
And I just had to make up all my dialogue because there was no,

337
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.490
no one to write it.
And I had fun.
I love doing that stuff.
So,
um,

338
00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.690
but the second half dead pool,
they,
so his fucking mouth shut let,
yeah,

339
00:18:53.691 --> 00:18:57.110
let lasers come out of his eyes and he has like weird knives that fly out of his

340
00:18:57.111 --> 00:18:58.160
hands.
And I,
uh,

341
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.510
I remember saying that's really going to anger some people that's not dead pool.

342
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.920
Um,
and they basically said,
well,
you know,
you can play him or you can,

343
00:19:06.921 --> 00:19:10.640
we can hire,
you know,
someone else to play him.
I don't,
you know,

344
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:14.480
they pick your guy and he can play.
So for me it was a little bit,
you know,

345
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:18.740
I was a little bit,
uh,
blackmailed,
I just said,
you know,
all right,
let's do it,

346
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.590
I guess,
and let's see what happens.
And then,
you know,

347
00:19:21.591 --> 00:19:24.300
it's funny as I probably shouldn't be saying this,
but the,
uh,

348
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:28.490
which is why it's awesome.
Um,
the A,
after the movie had,

349
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:29.870
was just about to come out,

350
00:19:29.871 --> 00:19:32.180
wolverine was just about to come out and we've got a call from one of the

351
00:19:32.181 --> 00:19:35.300
executives at the studios had,
where are you?
And I said,
I'm,
I'm up in Canada.

352
00:19:35.301 --> 00:19:37.460
He's like,
we need you to fly here right now.
I was like,
what's wrong?

353
00:19:37.461 --> 00:19:37.881
What's going on?

354
00:19:37.881 --> 00:19:41.090
It's like we've tested the movie and people are very upset about the Deadpool,

355
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.900
about everything we did at the dead.
But I was like,
you fucking did it.

356
00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.110
I told you.
And they said,

357
00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.400
we shot this little tag that happens at the very end after the credits were

358
00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.300
Deadpool's severed head is on the ground and I opened my eyes and my mouth is

359
00:19:53.301 --> 00:19:56.990
now open and I go and it was just so dumb.
But we did it anyway,

360
00:19:56.991 --> 00:19:59.570
I guess to sort of make people think that there might be another dead pull up to

361
00:19:59.571 --> 00:20:02.810
that adage.
It then it just rotted and died on the shelves of Fox forever.

362
00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.270
They never wanted to make a Deadpool movie after that.
So yeah.

363
00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:11.150
But we made the right one now.
So there you go.
Cool.
Thank you.

364
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:13.183
Hey there.

365
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:16.700
<v 2>Um,
so in the movie you and the taxi driver have a great relationship.
Oh yeah.</v>

366
00:20:16.701 --> 00:20:17.060
Yeah.

367
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.970
Question is why does he keep driving you around and did he get compensated for

368
00:20:19.971 --> 00:20:20.804
the movie?

369
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.330
<v 0>Um,
yes,
we paid all our actors.
It was low budget,
but they were,
uh,</v>

370
00:20:24.331 --> 00:20:27.690
they were definitely,
I know the,
in the,
in the movie dope hinder does not,

371
00:20:27.691 --> 00:20:30.720
he is not,
uh,
uh,
compensated.
Unfortunately,

372
00:20:30.721 --> 00:20:33.180
Deadpool only pays him in a crisp pie five.

373
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.170
And at one point he gives him a crisp 10 and some life advice,

374
00:20:37.171 --> 00:20:40.490
but no dope hinders that.
That name comes from my,
my friend is in,

375
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.100
in high school and I'm sorry,
elementary school.
I went to school,

376
00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.490
this guy named dope hinder and it's actually a,
we're paying tribute to him.
He,

377
00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:50.680
he,
he was killed.
He was struck by lightning,
which is so just utterly crate.

378
00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:54.880
Don't laugh.
No,
I'm cheating.
Uh,
is he,
they're all laughing about it now.

379
00:20:54.881 --> 00:20:58.920
It's fine.
Um,
no.
Uh,
and,
and that's so that's dope.
Hinders dope.

380
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.530
Hinder is a tribute to this guy on that I knew in,

381
00:21:01.531 --> 00:21:04.510
in schools are really cool guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There you go.

382
00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:09.370
There's more information than you ever wanted.
And Ryan have been some of the,

383
00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:13.330
your,
uh,
favorite actors or actresses you've worked with in your career?
Uh,

384
00:21:13.331 --> 00:21:16.930
Helen Mirin amazing.
Uh,
Sandra Bullock is like,

385
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:21.790
it's classy and fantastic as a human being can get.
Um,
uh,

386
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.360
God,
I'm thinking other actresses that I've worked with that I loved.
Um,
I don't,

387
00:21:25.361 --> 00:21:25.481
you know,

388
00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:28.510
some of you might not necessarily know trailer Howard who I did my TV show with

389
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.140
155 years ago.
She was the girl on the show on two guys,
a girl and a pizza place.

390
00:21:32.141 --> 00:21:35.980
She was an awesome,
awesome person.
Um,
but I've been lucky.

391
00:21:35.981 --> 00:21:38.830
Mary Louise Parker's one that I think is really talented and super,

392
00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:42.670
super smart and cool.
Um,
so yeah,
I know I've had a,
I've been,

393
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.040
I've been pretty lucky in that department of have had a lot of great,

394
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.960
great costars.
Yeah.
Awesome.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Denzel Washington is a wonderful actress.

395
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.750
<v 3>Well,
you ever heard of him?
Yeah.
Hi,</v>

396
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.240
thank you so much for your time.

397
00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:01.130
I think back on your career and you've done such a variety of different genres

398
00:22:01.131 --> 00:22:04.590
of movies from,
you know,
Sandra Pollock and the proposal too,

399
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:07.340
animated movies and these adaptations now,

400
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:11.870
what would you say have been the challenges of doing these different genres and

401
00:22:11.871 --> 00:22:13.850
then also the favorite parts to say,

402
00:22:13.851 --> 00:22:17.600
doing voice animation versus doing something more physical?

403
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.150
<v 0>Um,
okay.
Well,
my career was largely driven by desperation.</v>

404
00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.900
So there's different genre thing is like,
yeah,
you know,
you just,

405
00:22:24.901 --> 00:22:26.610
you find a script that you like and you're,
you know,

406
00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:29.490
you beg someone to let you make it,
uh,
the voiceover acting.

407
00:22:29.491 --> 00:22:31.080
I love voiceover acting.

408
00:22:31.081 --> 00:22:34.920
I love it because there's zero ceiling and you could do and say anything in a

409
00:22:34.921 --> 00:22:37.800
weird way.
Deadpool's there's,
there's a lot of voiceover acting in the movie too,

410
00:22:37.801 --> 00:22:38.850
but,
uh,
um,

411
00:22:38.851 --> 00:22:43.050
so doing animated films have been fun working on crudes and now Croods two has

412
00:22:43.051 --> 00:22:45.570
been incredible and turbo and I just,
I don't know.
I love it.

413
00:22:45.571 --> 00:22:46.920
And it's nice that I can,
you know,

414
00:22:46.921 --> 00:22:49.800
I have something I can show my one year old daughter.
Yeah.
For God's sake.

415
00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:54.510
Everything else is just vile,
so,
yeah.
Yeah.
That's,
yeah.

416
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.190
All right.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.

417
00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.510
So the marketing for this movie has been insane.
I wanted to know,

418
00:23:00.511 --> 00:23:01.770
did you have a hand in that?

419
00:23:01.771 --> 00:23:05.340
Did you say from the very beginning we should make a Nicholas Sparks billboards

420
00:23:05.341 --> 00:23:09.510
to promote this or did that come in towards the end?
Um,
the Nicholas Sparks,

421
00:23:09.511 --> 00:23:14.340
billboards were not,
I actually was like the last guy on board with that cause I,

422
00:23:14.341 --> 00:23:16.140
they were too good.
I was like,

423
00:23:16.141 --> 00:23:18.210
there are people who are really going to think that this is,

424
00:23:18.211 --> 00:23:22.440
say that like the sequel to the notebook,
you know.
Um,
uh,

425
00:23:22.441 --> 00:23:24.930
so I was a little,
I was a little worried about that one,
but,
uh,

426
00:23:24.931 --> 00:23:28.110
and that was such a hit and I think it was a couple of our marketing guys in

427
00:23:28.111 --> 00:23:30.600
here right now.
Uh,
there's some somewhere they could raise their hands,

428
00:23:30.601 --> 00:23:34.260
but they're chicken shits,
so they won't,
they won't do that.
Um,
they,

429
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:37.170
they are geniuses and,
and,
but it has been a,
like I said,

430
00:23:37.171 --> 00:23:40.950
it's been an extension of the film,
which is so unusual.
So we've all been,

431
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.260
we've all had our hand in every little piece of it.
Um,
it's been,
uh,
the,

432
00:23:45.261 --> 00:23:48.410
it's been so much of a harder job than the filming actually because it's just

433
00:23:48.411 --> 00:23:51.500
been full time round the clock.
Uh,
you know,

434
00:23:51.501 --> 00:23:54.620
I've never had a social media calendar that I have to adhere to,

435
00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:58.130
which has been just crazy.
You know,
just,
just trying to get stuff out.
Content.

436
00:23:58.131 --> 00:24:01.850
We shot so many videos,
so many viral videos.
Um,
some I write,

437
00:24:01.851 --> 00:24:05.870
some Fox writes some Rhett Rhett and Paul writes.
So,
uh,
it's just been an,

438
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.570
everybody's been all hands on deck,
so,
but it's been so much fun.

439
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.800
I mean everybody just loves it.
You know,

440
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.410
I think a lot of the feedback we've been getting at people sad that the movie's

441
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:14.840
coming out because the viral videos are going to stop.

442
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.610
But that's just simply not true.
We have,
we have many more.
Yeah,

443
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.730
I think we have time for one more question.
Okay.
Hi Ryan,

444
00:24:22.731 --> 00:24:24.950
this is unrelated to the movie.
I promised to see it,

445
00:24:24.951 --> 00:24:28.400
but I just wanted to ask you about,
um,
being a dad and your new baby.

446
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.090
Can we just talk to us a little about that?
Yeah.
I just found out I had a child,

447
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:38.820
so it's like a year old.
Walking and talking is no idea who I am.
Uh,

448
00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:42.200
no.
I love it.
It's the best.
Honestly,
it's,
it's been incredible.
I,
thankfully,

449
00:24:42.201 --> 00:24:46.100
I have a wife that we both sort of feel like we don't want to work at the same

450
00:24:46.101 --> 00:24:48.320
time.
So we have the luxury to be able to do that,
you know,

451
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.550
cause oftentimes our jobs or you know,
Thailand or our jobs or in Russia or,

452
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.090
you know,

453
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:56.270
so we all kind of traveled together and a and stay together and it's been,

454
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.830
it's been amazing.
You know,

455
00:24:57.831 --> 00:25:01.370
my daughter wept though when I would come in with the scar makeup on from

456
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.470
Deadpool.
That was really,
really framed well.

457
00:25:03.471 --> 00:25:08.360
Sometimes it just put it on just for fun.
So she hated that.
But no,

458
00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:10.970
she's,
it's,
it's the best.
Honestly,
it's been like the best thing.

459
00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:16.010
So every cliche is so stupidly true.
You know,
it's like giving birth is like,

460
00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.370
you know,
uh,
one of the greatest privileges.
It's so common,

461
00:25:19.371 --> 00:25:21.290
but it's like one of the most profound things that happened.

462
00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:23.260
So many people do it.
But,
um,
so,

463
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.520
but I'm always careful when I talk about it because every like,

464
00:25:25.521 --> 00:25:28.190
I know so many celebrities that talk about when they have a child,

465
00:25:28.191 --> 00:25:30.500
like they're the only fucking human being alive.

466
00:25:30.501 --> 00:25:34.070
That's ever squeezed a kid out of them.
So I'm like,
I'm a little,

467
00:25:34.071 --> 00:25:36.120
I'm always a little bit wary of that.

468
00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:41.000
I have one friend that always like my daughter is quoting checkoff and she's two

469
00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:42.670
and I was like,
your daughter's an asshole.

470
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:47.510
So yeah,
thank you.

471
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.200
Oh we,
let's not end on that.

472
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:56.230
[inaudible] you know,

473
00:25:57.611 --> 00:26:00.380
you do interviews and you were in my position.
You like just,
you,
you,

474
00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:03.560
you wake up in the middle of the night at a perfect,
right angle and you're like,

475
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.530
why am I sitting up sweating?
And you're like,
oh,
that fucking question.

476
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.560
I answered that question.
I said that thing.
Yeah.
So I know it's

477
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.590
fine.
All right,
well where,

478
00:26:15.591 --> 00:26:18.770
where do you think the character Deadpool could do the most good in the world?

479
00:26:18.771 --> 00:26:22.000
Where you currently live in?
Oh,
we're where he could do the,
Oh my God.
Well,

480
00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.560
certainly the presidential election would be someplace that I would implement

481
00:26:24.561 --> 00:26:29.320
his,
his unique,
unique skill set.
Yeah.
I know he can't.
We did run a,

482
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.480
a brief,
uh,
a Deadpool for El Presidente,

483
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.270
a campaign in the middle of our last week,
I think,

484
00:26:35.271 --> 00:26:38.360
but we pulled it the same day because he's just too immature for that.

485
00:26:38.361 --> 00:26:40.160
So I think he could do some,
do some good there.

486
00:26:40.161 --> 00:26:43.710
I'd love to see him as a pundit because he can't really focus,

487
00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.800
so it'll be fun to just see the Tangents,
you know?

488
00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:51.360
I'd love to see bill O'Reilly handle him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The pundit with a mouth.

489
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.170
Right,
exactly.
It's got to get green.
Good Deadpool,
two of the bundle with them.

490
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.930
All right.
Well,
thank you so much for joining us.
Thank you for guys,

491
00:26:57.931 --> 00:26:58.764
for having me.

492
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.060
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
