00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.471
Hello.

2
00:00:08.471 --> 00:00:13.420
My name is Natalie Villalobos and I'm so excited today to bring out a Amy

3
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.950
Schumer and Aidy Bryant.

4
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.270
They are two incredible women that I am so incredibly inspired by and empowered

5
00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:21.490
by a,
so let's go ahead and bring them on out.

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.100
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

7
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.860
<v 0>the Google plants.
Hi Guys.
Oh,
cool.</v>

8
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.770
Amuse is fine.

9
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.980
This is where the counting crows counted or,

10
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.030
thank you for having us guys.

11
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.120
Yes.
All right,
so to kick us off,
you too,

12
00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.200
you're in a new film together called I feel pretty.

13
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.660
Tell us what interested you in signing onto this project.
Money.
Money,
money,

14
00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:05.430
money,
money,
money.
Money.
Wow.

15
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.180
<v 2>Oh,
you guys hate money at Google?
I'm sorry.
Coaching,
coaching,</v>

16
00:01:10.181 --> 00:01:14.970
coaching,
coaching,
coaching.
No.

17
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:19.390
Um,
I was supposed to do this other movie where I would have gotten like a lot,

18
00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:22.000
a lot of that on me,
but it wasn't going to really work out because,

19
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.900
but this is the exact message that I've been wanting to say.
Like,
no,

20
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:28.390
I didn't want this to just be part of the movie.
I was like,

21
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.510
I really want to hammer this exact message home.

22
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.900
And so like,
you know,

23
00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:37.300
I'm kind of like a [inaudible] when it comes to like,

24
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.340
if my manager sends me a script,
I'll go like,
do you want me to do this?

25
00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:47.310
Do you want me to play a reindeer?
You know?
And,
um,
has that happened?
Like ish?

26
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.460
Yeah.
And so they were like,
hey,
we think this is worth mentioning.
It's,

27
00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:55.090
and they told me the premise and I was like,
that's awesome.
And,
uh,

28
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.220
and then I read the script.
I was like,
this is so funny.

29
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.080
She's giving you lovey eyes.
I know she wants it.

30
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.910
<v 0>Are you lower?
Like I'm low.</v>

31
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.970
Why am I so high?
We just did.
We did one this morning

32
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.760
<v 2>at either one of you.
And,
um,</v>

33
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.400
<v 0>and we got there and they kept saying to me like 80,</v>

34
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:20.810
you'll be in the middle chair.
Okay.

35
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:23.500
Just remember 80 year in the middle of the chair to the middle of,

36
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.890
of these things.
I really over explain it.
And they go like,
breathe,

37
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.370
you bend your knees to sit.
Okay.

38
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.060
And then we got out there and we sat down and mine was like a little toad

39
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.870
Stewart.
It was like I was literally on the ground,
like in a basket

40
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.090
and Amy and the moderator and we're like seated high.

41
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.100
It was very humbling and I'm proud to be lower now.

42
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.450
Yeah.
If you want,

43
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:52.280
we can switch roles at some point and you could be the moderator.

44
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.640
There's nothing that could get me to get into one of these seats again.

45
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.100
Sorry about that.
That's why I'm like kind of doing the one leg.
I know.
This is

46
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.610
<v 2>great.
I love,</v>

47
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.680
I'm so scared that I'm going to show my full Gucci said like all y'all.

48
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.700
So we'll just strategically placed the plants.
Yeah.
Yeah.

49
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.610
<v 0>So with the film,
did you have any creative control over your characters?</v>

50
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:23.200
Sounds like you,
the script was there,

51
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:28.201
you signed on and at any point did you ad Lib or change the original direction

52
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:30.280
of a character you're naughty?

53
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.010
<v 2>Um,
yeah,
I'm a producer of this movie and uh,</v>

54
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.650
it's,
it's cool.
I've gotten myself into a position where I don't have to,

55
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.500
did I don't want to.
And uh,

56
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.650
so I helped rewrite it and we were super collaborative and uh,

57
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.590
yeah.
And we lived a little bit.
Yeah.

58
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.680
Unfortunately I only had to say things I didn't want to.

59
00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.180
This was a bad experience for me and it sucks to be here.

60
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.800
I'm sorry.
And you know,
I,

61
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.800
I know we're all supposed to be like lifting up other women in this business,

62
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:10.060
but I just wanted to push her down.
So you were like,
wrote it into her contract.

63
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:14.620
Only give her bad little yeah,
yeah,
no,
I'm,
we improvised a lot

64
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.260
because we always,

65
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.710
we've like one brain like all the time will always say the same words.

66
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.840
So,
um,
so in the film,

67
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.310
<v 0>so I got,
I got a chance to sneak peek,</v>

68
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:32.410
watch it on Friday night and it was awesome.
Thank you.

69
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.880
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
It's like hold for a compliment.
You know when people are like,</v>

70
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.070
I saw the show this week and then you go,

71
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.103
<v 1>Ooh,</v>

72
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.070
<v 0>okay.
No,
I really loved it.
Um,
so one of the,</v>

73
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.890
my favorite parts was actually when your character,

74
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.890
Renee was taking some web traffic reports to her company.

75
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.460
There was a mantra she had to say,
I am brave,

76
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.180
I am blind and I got this.

77
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.090
So what body positive mantra would you give to women of the world?

78
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.600
<v 2>Okay,
well first of all,
Adrian Martinez,
who I've worked with a bunch,</v>

79
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.870
he improvised that line and uh,

80
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.150
he just kind of went nuts and he's giving me this pep talk and it made it into

81
00:05:09.151 --> 00:05:13.590
the movie.
So God bless him.
Don't be fooled by the illusion of a quality.

82
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:14.820
We've all been sold.

83
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.080
<v 1>I don't know to tell you Google.
That's why she's on a high stool.</v>

84
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.080
<v 2>That was perfect.
I mean,
we got it to work for it.
Question at all.</v>

85
00:05:30.081 --> 00:05:32.420
So they're like,
yeah,
well we weren't impressed with what she said,

86
00:05:32.421 --> 00:05:34.970
so that makes sense.
How about you?

87
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.790
<v 1>Yeah,
your mantra bitch.</v>

88
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.670
<v 2>Like,
just stay on the stool.</v>

89
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.540
<v 1>Just use the chair.</v>

90
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.030
You can grab on to Amy Jo j

91
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.980
<v 2>I'm in</v>

92
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.030
<v 0>a bad situation.
We had an interview and I'm legitimately scared.</v>

93
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.460
We had an interview this morning,
kind of over

94
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.790
<v 2>a question like that where they were like,
um,
if like,
I'm not afraid.</v>

95
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.830
So I am like,
you know,

96
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:12.920
I was looking for us to say something inspirational and an 80.
That's just like,

97
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.860
<v 0>I'm scared of birds and we're like,
no,
that's not,</v>

98
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.300
I am though.
I'm scared of deviled eggs.

99
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.053
<v 1>Yeah,
I know.</v>

100
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.360
<v 2>I'm scared of crazy bitches.</v>

101
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

102
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.390
<v 0>You,
you guys,
you guys deviled eggs burger.
So good.</v>

103
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.240
I almost just got those at lunch.
No,

104
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.990
no,
that's Facebook.

105
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.883
<v 1>It's okay.</v>

106
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.180
<v 0>Okay.
So speaking of leaning in a little bit,</v>

107
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.460
I feel like there's some sh some shamelessness in the movie.

108
00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:53.830
Like what would you say in one word,
what is that

109
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.760
<v 2>confidence that she had?
Like,
you know,
we got this backlash,</v>

110
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.680
which was really funny because first of all,
very flattering people were like,

111
00:07:01.681 --> 00:07:05.010
you're not discussing enough to be in that.
And I was like,
oh,
I'm like,

112
00:07:05.011 --> 00:07:08.100
am I supposed to what?
She said not to know Gus.
Yeah.
They were like,

113
00:07:08.101 --> 00:07:09.030
you don't have any right?

114
00:07:09.031 --> 00:07:12.840
Like we the to feel bad about yourself and it's not this a story of like a very

115
00:07:12.841 --> 00:07:15.060
homely,
awful woman who finds confidence.

116
00:07:15.061 --> 00:07:18.480
It's just somebody who struggles with self esteem,
which everyone does,
you know,

117
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.390
and she feels very invisible.
And,
um,

118
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.250
and then goes through this whole experience where she realizes like,

119
00:07:26.251 --> 00:07:30.660
where your confidence really should come from and what's actually sustainable,

120
00:07:30.661 --> 00:07:32.840
which is not your looks.
Um,

121
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.030
but so we got this like crazy backlash and uh,
and it was,
it was Kinda,

122
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.530
it was funny,
you know?
Um,
I don't remember.

123
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.450
I don't remember at all what I'm talking about.

124
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.770
<v 0>No,
I was,
I was just thinking too,
like I,</v>

125
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.220
I was also getting messages that were like,
come on,

126
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:53.150
like how could they have Amy Schumer do this role when they have a plus size

127
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:57.770
woman right there.
She could have done the role and it's like,
oh,

128
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.360
okay,
so you're saying I'm out of the norm enough that I should play the troll?

129
00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:06.920
Or like,
what,
what are we fighting about this for?
You know,
like,

130
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:11.480
I feel like it really muddles the issue that is like,
you know,

131
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:15.800
Amy and I both,
whether you like it or not,

132
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:18.830
like are not the norm in movies.
You know,

133
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:21.200
like 99% of movies,

134
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:26.080
nobody looks like me or Amy and we good.

135
00:08:26.081 --> 00:08:26.914
Yeah,

136
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.580
<v 1>no,
but
I guess</v>

137
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.350
<v 0>to me it's like,
it's almost like a snake eating its own tail where it's like,</v>

138
00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:41.100
well how,
how,
what do I have to be?

139
00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:42.750
Or what does Amy have to be too?

140
00:08:42.751 --> 00:08:46.920
Like this is a story that is about self confidence,
which truly is like,

141
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.590
it's all in here.
It's not out here.

142
00:08:49.591 --> 00:08:53.130
And that is what is all damn about.
It's all damn about.
And,

143
00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:55.980
and we have talked about this where like we both feel good in

144
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.260
<v 2>our skin and,
um,
on the stool,</v>

145
00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:03.010
<v 0>I mean,
this is this,
this is a special scenario thinking me back down to like,</v>

146
00:09:03.011 --> 00:09:06.920
I'm 13 years old.
No,
this is about them and for you,
this is your bottom.

147
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.410
<v 2>But,
um,
but we realize like you really,</v>

148
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.470
it's not about us feeling good about ourselves.

149
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:16.200
It's like we have to literally comfort other people about our bodies.

150
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:17.010
Like they're like,

151
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.850
so you just like go out and until like the store in the morning and you're just

152
00:09:21.851 --> 00:09:24.900
spin your body and you're like,
yeah,
and I'm,
I'm happy.
And they're like,

153
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.280
can you walk me through that?
And you're like,
no,
I don't think I can.
But,

154
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.960
so it's literally us like explaining to other people,
making them comfortable.
Um,

155
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.800
but you know,

156
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.330
there's nothing scarier or more upsetting to people then a woman who feels good

157
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:43.500
about herself.
Like people really hate that.
Uh,
yeah.
So,

158
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.630
so they're like,
okay,
well,
like how can I find an angle where you're unhappy?

159
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:51.490
So like I can sleep at night and you're like,
yeah,
of course.
Like I,

160
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.710
we have struggles like everyone else.

161
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.910
But then also we want to say if I were a person of color hearing this

162
00:09:56.911 --> 00:10:01.590
conversation,
I'd be like,
is it hard for you guys?
You know?
And I,

163
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.580
I hear you and I,
uh,

164
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.230
we both really want to do our part and make sure that our work is super

165
00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:11.970
inclusive and,
um,
you know,
not just for people of Color,
but trans people,

166
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:13.470
people with disabilities,
like,
you know,

167
00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:18.350
cause what we're learning is that the leaders being all white men for so long
is,

168
00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:23.100
is not actually that great for everybody.
And,
uh,
we need women.

169
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.760
Like,
if you think of it,
women aren't even on,
on many boards.
Like,

170
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:29.280
it's to get like one woman,
two women in there.
And by the way,

171
00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:31.740
you have to see the Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Maybe can,
we just don't want to him.

172
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.350
But you know,

173
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:38.640
it's because like the things I gravitate toward are,
are women.

174
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:39.271
People are getting,
you know,

175
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:43.680
so if I was at the person making the decisions and Samantha Bee did that awesome

176
00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:47.400
piece this week about how like one in 10 women has endometriosis,

177
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.360
but there's like very little research but there's like a thousand Dick Pills,

178
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:52.920
you know?
No,
I've actually,

179
00:10:52.921 --> 00:10:55.470
I've actually recently started telling people in my meetings when I'm having

180
00:10:55.471 --> 00:10:56.430
intense cramps.

181
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.250
So it's like I'm just being going to be very real with the fact that I'm just

182
00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:02.830
like in pain anymore.
No,
I know.
But if we do

183
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.130
<v 0>not got a problem deal,
oh,
that's what I'm saying.</v>

184
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.300
Yeah.
That's exactly what I said.
And I do have a problem.
Right?
Yeah.

185
00:11:13.301 --> 00:11:14.520
You do your edit.

186
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.400
So you had mentioned,
um,
we can sit with it a little bit more.

187
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.050
I'm tempted to just stay.

188
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.960
This will be like,
I can't tell you the relief I feel right now.

189
00:11:32.961 --> 00:11:35.630
And so I'll up here like an asshole.
No,
no,
no.
Look,

190
00:11:35.631 --> 00:11:40.420
I'm going to just stand in a spot where my store was.
So,

191
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:45.340
uh,
I'm going to,
I'm sorry we can all stand.

192
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:46.900
No,
no,
no,
no.

193
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:55.330
So,
uh,
so when I was 10,
um,
my mom would tell me,

194
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.590
oh,
Natalie,
don't worry,
your,
your boobs will grow in,
which I'm still waiting for.

195
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:00.701
But you know,

196
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:04.540
I used to wear a water bra and so it was like a bra for those of you that don't

197
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:07.720
know water bras abroad with two big sacks of water.

198
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.950
And it basically made me go from like a double a to a c and I'd walk around

199
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:16.120
really confidently as a sophomore.
And I was really just like moved of like,
okay,

200
00:12:16.121 --> 00:12:21.121
so I have to change how I present myself based on how my mom or how other women

201
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:22.660
perceive me.
And so I'm curious,

202
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:27.490
how have other people's perceptions shaped who you are today or

203
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.340
<v 2>perceptions of yourself?
Well,
first of all,
thank you for trusting us.
Yeah,
yeah,</v>

204
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.660
yeah.
It was honorable moment.
No,
totally.
I mean,

205
00:12:37.661 --> 00:12:42.580
I used to wear like very padded bras.
I'm like to a point where it was just like,

206
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.360
it was somebody should have just like sued me when they were hooked up with me.

207
00:12:46.361 --> 00:12:51.220
Like,
this is not at all what I entered the contract or um,

208
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:56.620
I got,
uh,
but you know that,

209
00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.250
but that company,
it's not your got to your mom and they like you,

210
00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:03.670
you know all the marketing and you got to look like this one person.

211
00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:06.400
And if you cover all the heads and the gossip magazines across the row,

212
00:13:06.401 --> 00:13:09.790
everyone has the same body and you're told like if you don't look like this one

213
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:13.720
thing,
then you're wrong.
And then you realize like,
no,
and what does,

214
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:14.350
what does it about?

215
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.100
And other than it really is about how you feel about yourself.
And we know that,

216
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.330
right?
That's easy to say.

217
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.540
But the way that you want your friends to see themselves,

218
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:25.270
like your best friends who were like,
Nah,
and you're like,
you're so pretty.

219
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.730
You know,
sometimes you can like cover their head and a picture and be like,

220
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.920
what if you saw this girl walked by?
Wouldn't you be like,

221
00:13:31.921 --> 00:13:34.470
that's a beautiful girl.
And they're like,
oh yeah.
Um,

222
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.250
but I think other than the media,
it's like,

223
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.940
I think mothers need to know,
um,

224
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.280
how much their message it goes through to their kids.
Yeah.

225
00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:47.130
Because if they're going,
I'm disgusting,
like their daughter's going to be like,

226
00:13:47.131 --> 00:13:50.970
I'm gross.
Um,
my mom did the opposite and was just like,

227
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.180
just made me think I was actually beyond say as a child.

228
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.780
And then you know,
you,
you,
you get older and like stuffed chips away,

229
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.090
your confidence and kids are mean and you kind of like,
or like,
oh,
okay.
Oh,

230
00:14:03.091 --> 00:14:04.770
I'm gross.
I'm discussing.
Okay.

231
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:09.870
And w this movie is about like trying to get back to that childlike version of

232
00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:14.700
yourself or you feel good and you're not like thinking you need a water bra.

233
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.631
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,</v>

234
00:14:15.631 --> 00:14:18.630
and I think part of the sisterhood that you were able to offer her in the movie

235
00:14:18.631 --> 00:14:20.910
was like group friendship,
right?

236
00:14:20.911 --> 00:14:23.880
And like supporting someone both through the good and the bad of their body

237
00:14:23.881 --> 00:14:26.430
image.
Right.
And that those perceptions.

238
00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:30.420
So can you tell me a little bit about how important sisterhood is as we,

239
00:14:30.421 --> 00:14:31.760
you know,
kind of look at ourselves,

240
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.780
<v 2>like tell her about her traveling pants?
Oh,</v>

241
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.670
<v 0>Amy.
No,
I mean,
honestly for me,</v>

242
00:14:41.671 --> 00:14:44.730
and this is maybe going to sound Corny,
but like for me,

243
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:50.090
my friends and my like female colleagues who have encouraged me have been my

244
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.160
only way to

245
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.740
<v 3>success,
you know,
at least for myself.</v>

246
00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:58.340
And like I was so encouraged by,
you know,

247
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:02.690
performers who I admired early on in Chicago or wherever where like I would have

248
00:15:02.691 --> 00:15:07.100
never continued going without their encouragement.
And even like,
you know,

249
00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:09.950
now I'm like navigating this whole other thing,

250
00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:14.951
which is like how do I exist as a fat woman on TV that's not a mom he character

251
00:15:20.091 --> 00:15:23.240
who's in her forties like whatever,
you know,
that is like,

252
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.840
that's where people are comfortable seeing like my body type.

253
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:30.040
But I got hired as no one,
I was 24 so those aren't,

254
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.003
<v 0>those are like,</v>

255
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.450
but so like I'm trying to find my own

256
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:41.580
<v 3>place in this system that where there hasn't really been a place for me.</v>

257
00:15:41.581 --> 00:15:42.650
And previously,

258
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.860
and I could not do it without people like Amy or my friends who are like

259
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.170
encouraging me and helping me navigate like all the fricking bolt.

260
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.340
<v 0>Which is funny because people look like us all over the country.
You know,</v>

261
00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.390
it looks like me,
but yes.
Yeah.

262
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.380
70% of American women actually have my body type.
Right.
You know,

263
00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:06.960
but they're not reflected on screen and that's just my,

264
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:12.570
and we're not skinny shaming either.
Like everybody feels if you're a woman,
like

265
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.100
not and not that men don't feel like

266
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.790
<v 2>insecure specialty this time.
You're like,
what's our place?</v>

267
00:16:18.791 --> 00:16:21.250
Like can we go to a time's up meeting?
And you're like,
oh,

268
00:16:21.251 --> 00:16:25.030
you guys all hate us now.
But it's not about,
I mean,
yes.
Like,
yes,

269
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.080
thank you.
But what's the weirdest thing you've done for beauty?

270
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.110
For most of my life,
uh,

271
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.680
like wore heels and those kinds of bras and spanx and,

272
00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.970
and still felt really mediocre.

273
00:16:41.971 --> 00:16:46.920
That's the weirdest thing I did for beauty just like my whole life every day

274
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.010
until like pretty recently.
Yeah.

275
00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:52.860
The guys in your look like the guys in the movie,
like that's my romantic leads.

276
00:16:52.861 --> 00:16:56.850
So you guys will like this.
Like you guys are definitely like the sweet,

277
00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.660
like intelligent look like,
well,
you know,
don't worry.

278
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.173
<v 1>Okay.</v>

279
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.940
<v 2>It's like a very gentle,
gentle man.
I'm trying to,</v>

280
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.240
I don't know if I have a like a

281
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.150
<v 3>weirdest thing I've done for beauty.
I don't know.
I feel,</v>

282
00:17:14.151 --> 00:17:16.700
I feel like just like buying jeans.

283
00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.210
<v 0>So I'm like,
that's a hell.
And Him and every time I do it I'm like,</v>

284
00:17:20.211 --> 00:17:24.320
what is happening?
Last question before we jump to Q.
And.
A,

285
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.980
when that voice inside yourself,
it says you can't do it.

286
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:31.530
<v 2>What do you say to that voice?
I think personally I learned along,</v>

287
00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:36.660
I learned like maybe 10 years ago,
I don't even have that voice anymore.
I'm like,

288
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.230
it's other people telling you you can't do it and you,
you just go like,

289
00:17:40.231 --> 00:17:41.370
I'm going,
I'm going to do it.

290
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.120
<v 0>Wow.
Do you know?
I mean seriously.
It's like</v>

291
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.270
<v 2>no.
And not giving energy to any of that.
Just like,
no,</v>

292
00:17:48.271 --> 00:17:49.980
I'm going to take the steps,
need to to do it.
I

293
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.570
<v 3>definitely still have that voice,
but I,</v>

294
00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.490
I also feel now,
like I,

295
00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:01.050
I've always been like very bad at like rules or like if someone tells me I have

296
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:05.300
to do something,
I'm,
I immediately in like,
I guess I'm okay doing that.

297
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.430
<v 0>Which includes this stool.
You could not have done that on it.</v>

298
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:17.980
No,
thank you.
This is so nice.
That's nice.

299
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.180
That's cool.
A man.
It's saving you.

300
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:21.743
<v 1>Wow.</v>

301
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.280
<v 0>Just kidding.
Is that funny?
We're still like,
can you open my car door?
Thank you.</v>

302
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.810
You can just hold it.
I will.
Yeah.

303
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.200
I hope they bring out three more chairs.

304
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:38.700
A little sandbox.
I think we're going to go to Q and a great first question.

305
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:40.423
<v 3>Hello ladies.</v>

306
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.420
I'm very happy you're here and I absolutely love your honest Rhonchi feminism.

307
00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:49.580
Um,
I have an eight year old daughter who got invited to her first dress up party

308
00:18:49.581 --> 00:18:51.980
where they're going to give her makeup and hair.

309
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:56.920
She has to wear a dress and get in a long pink stretch limo.
Wow.
Um,

310
00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.790
I'm a hardcore feminist.
My daughter knows this.
I look like this.
Um,

311
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.820
how do I wrap my head around that?
What advice can I give her?

312
00:19:04.821 --> 00:19:08.840
So she still knows she's her.
But Ken go cause all the other girls are going.

313
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.330
That's a great question.
Well I would assume mother's love,

314
00:19:11.331 --> 00:19:13.100
like getting advice from people without children.

315
00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:16.813
<v 1>MMM.</v>

316
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.090
<v 3>My instincts,
uh,</v>

317
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.180
as someone who's been fiercely on birth control for a long time,

318
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:27.523
<v 1>mmm.</v>

319
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.250
<v 3>If she likes that stuff then cool.
But if it's not her jam,
like</v>

320
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:41.000
bless you then like he's out.
Totally.
I mean I keep thinking like,

321
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.300
I dunno,
I feel like especially for what we do,

322
00:19:44.301 --> 00:19:48.470
we have to get dressed and cinched and paint it up all the time.

323
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:53.710
And there is like a part of it that's like guys show up 10 minutes before and

324
00:19:53.711 --> 00:19:55.300
they would ever,
but like you know,

325
00:19:55.301 --> 00:19:58.090
there's also like a part of that that's self expression that I think,

326
00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.600
at least for me back and my legs are outfits.

327
00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:04.900
Like it was fun to learn about that stuff and see how I want it to be.

328
00:20:04.901 --> 00:20:07.120
So I think there's like,
you know,
there's,

329
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.480
there's good in a little bit of all of it,
but like in moderation.
Right.

330
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.320
And like don't get the limo though.

331
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.520
<v 0>No,
but honestly,
Craig got the Limo,</v>

332
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:21.830
they got there and kind of corner room for two more.

333
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:28.130
Thank you.
Thank you.
So first of all,
you both are beautiful.
Um,

334
00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.460
80 I love your short squeeze video.

335
00:20:30.461 --> 00:20:32.890
I remember the first time I saw that I was like,
Yo,

336
00:20:32.891 --> 00:20:36.870
this girl's got to be an SNL and then you were so hold I have to tell.

337
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.000
Can I just tell you briefly that that video was something I was paid to do?

338
00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.550
What was it?
An advertisement and I,

339
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:47.620
I believe I was paid $25.
My question is,

340
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:47.980
so my

341
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.070
<v 3>younger sister is trying to be a standup comedian in Chicago.</v>

342
00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:55.000
She's actually sort of trying to,
you know,
fall on both of your footsteps.

343
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.000
She's a huge fan of both of yours.
I'm not that funny.

344
00:20:58.001 --> 00:21:01.010
So I don't really have any advice to give her.
But,
um,

345
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.340
every time she calls me on the phone,

346
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:08.560
she's giving me this whole thing about how hard it is to be a woman in comedy.

347
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:09.630
And you know,

348
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.060
I was shocked when I saw on Saturday night live to that Tiffany Haddish was I

349
00:21:13.061 --> 00:21:17.350
think the first female standup comic or black female standup comic ever to host

350
00:21:17.351 --> 00:21:20.810
the show.
And I was like 2018 with that was happening.

351
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:26.170
So what is it going to take to get comedy to a place of more gender and race

352
00:21:27.681 --> 00:21:28.514
diversity?

353
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:32.400
<v 2>You know,
just like a small question.
Oh,
well,
first of all,
for her,</v>

354
00:21:32.401 --> 00:21:36.930
like just any comedian I say just to get as much stage time as possible.

355
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:42.510
Um,
and uh,
in terms of it being harder for a woman,

356
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.410
I just think it's harder for a woman to leave the house in the morning.

357
00:21:46.411 --> 00:21:51.000
Like it's just all harder.
Yeah.
But,
um,

358
00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.390
and I think,
you know,
Saturday night live is an example of,
uh,

359
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.850
a very fun,

360
00:21:56.851 --> 00:22:01.080
great show that is run by

361
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:03.570
white men.

362
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:09.620
And so that's why we need more leaders to look all different to make sure that

363
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.750
the things like that are more diverse and there's in more equal number of sort

364
00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:16.740
of email or

365
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:23.530
<v 3>people of color,
like honestly whatever it is.</v>

366
00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.700
And that's,
and that's amazing.
I would just say,

367
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:37.830
um,
that I,
I also think like when those moments come along when like,
you know,

368
00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.830
Tiffany Haddish is hosting SNL to be like calling it out.
I mean like,
damn,

369
00:22:41.831 --> 00:22:45.460
this is the first time a black female standup has ever hosted the show.

370
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.640
Something to think about,
you know,
like the,
I feel like a,

371
00:22:48.641 --> 00:22:51.910
for a long time nobody who was like talking about it openly.

372
00:22:51.911 --> 00:22:55.870
And I think that's part of,
Oh,
I'm sorry,
I just,

373
00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.920
Oh,
I'm so sorry.
Fall Asleep.

374
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.090
Oh,
oh,
time's up.

375
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:12.640
So no,
thank you for calling that out and yes,
you know,

376
00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.380
don't be afraid to add to that a little bit.

377
00:23:14.381 --> 00:23:17.710
So it's like you have people who are on stage but also writers to write.

378
00:23:17.711 --> 00:23:20.530
We need more women writers,
people of Color who are writing.

379
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:24.880
It's like the other roles too that might not be visible,
but that are critical.

380
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:29.470
And I also think a lot of that is on some of these like,
you know,

381
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.910
comedy clubs and stand up places and,
and you know,

382
00:23:33.911 --> 00:23:37.480
like the theaters in Chicago where you learn and start to do that.

383
00:23:37.481 --> 00:23:40.510
It's like they need to be reaching out and getting these people in positions

384
00:23:40.511 --> 00:23:44.530
where they can also be seen by,
uh,
you know,
people who are coming to scout.

385
00:23:44.531 --> 00:23:47.900
So it's,
it's sort of like,
it's like everybody should we be putting in the work,

386
00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:51.470
you know?
Hi.
Um,
I'm in a comedy sketch,

387
00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:53.540
curb all Asian American women here in town.

388
00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:58.310
So I wanted to ask about your sketch writing process when you have an idea then

389
00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:01.370
how do you get it to a tight place where you know,
I got this winter.

390
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:03.603
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

391
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:04.460
<v 3>Well if you're,</v>

392
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:08.600
you had a full sketch show that like one p bodies and is this as a thing?

393
00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:11.000
Don't look at me.
Not about that.
Me.

394
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:20.030
No,
she's asking you,
you are currently in the sketch universe.
Um,
I,
Gosh,

395
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.030
tough question.
I think it's also like different for every person.

396
00:24:23.031 --> 00:24:24.050
And there's a different ways.

397
00:24:24.051 --> 00:24:29.051
For me at SNL I tried to just like really go off of like what is on my mind that

398
00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:32.630
week because we really do only start writing on Tuesday and the show is on

399
00:24:32.631 --> 00:24:33.770
Saturday.
So you know,

400
00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:37.130
the turnaround is quick and if you have something that you're kind of just like

401
00:24:37.131 --> 00:24:41.570
slowly dumping out,
it's going to be a really long,
hard week.
You know,

402
00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:44.720
like you kind of have to have something that you're like a little bit passionate

403
00:24:44.721 --> 00:24:49.670
about and feels either fun or topical or whatever that like feels important to

404
00:24:49.671 --> 00:24:51.590
you.
And then,
um,

405
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:55.310
cause the whole week is a little bit of a battle to try and keep it in the show.

406
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.820
So,
um,
you want to feel like,
oh I believe in this.

407
00:24:58.821 --> 00:25:01.190
And then as far as like getting it tight,

408
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.910
I think to me it's just like listening to audiences and being like,
wow,

409
00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:06.620
I really love this part in the middle,

410
00:25:06.621 --> 00:25:11.090
but it played to dead silence and so we're going to cut it out.

411
00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:14.510
And even though it makes our sketch from the was five minutes,

412
00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:16.640
now it's three minutes and 30 seconds.

413
00:25:16.641 --> 00:25:19.460
It's better for it cause it has more impact and it's tighter.

414
00:25:19.461 --> 00:25:22.750
So you know the audience,
lots of,
you know,
like we test,

415
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.940
you test the movie and you're like,
okay,
my favorite joke coming up.

416
00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:30.130
And the audience is just like,
and you can't be like,
no,
you're wrong.

417
00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.720
Let me just get up and really quickly explain why that's funny to you.

418
00:25:32.721 --> 00:25:37.400
Like you have to pay attention to that and an edit.
Yeah.
Cool.
Thank you.

419
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.070
What's your group called?
Granny cart.
Gangstas

420
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.053
<v 1>oh,</v>

421
00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.950
<v 3>so in the movie your character hits her head and gains all this self confidence.</v>

422
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:54.720
Given that most of us aren't going to get to hit our heads and get that self

423
00:25:54.721 --> 00:25:57.510
confidence,
is there anything that you would suggest as like,
you know,

424
00:25:57.511 --> 00:26:00.600
real world way to get that we'll see this movie?

425
00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:07.250
Yeah.
Like it just,
it takes it,

426
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.730
it's been a process.
You know,

427
00:26:08.731 --> 00:26:11.370
it's like these little false starts where like I feel good about myself maybe

428
00:26:11.371 --> 00:26:16.200
forever now.
And then,
you know,
again,
you know,
and um,

429
00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.430
that was me getting my period.

430
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:20.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

431
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.560
<v 3>And I know you guys aren't allowed to get that at Google,</v>

432
00:26:22.561 --> 00:26:26.310
but they're like little gymnast,
but,
um,

433
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.010
but I think,
uh,

434
00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.630
I think paying attention to when you feel the best and you know,

435
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.960
it's like when you're with your friends,
you're just laughing and you're,

436
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.050
you're not thinking about what you look like and that's when you're,

437
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.900
when you're not looking in the mirror,
you know,
fixating,
it's like,

438
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.110
and when you find what you really get your confidence from,

439
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.500
and then just hanging onto that and just reminding yourself like,
I'm going to,

440
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.820
I feel good right now.
I'm going to remind myself when I don't that first of all,

441
00:26:56.821 --> 00:26:57.690
I will feel good again.

442
00:26:57.691 --> 00:27:00.510
And this is just a feeling I have right now and it will be replaced by another

443
00:27:00.511 --> 00:27:05.150
feeling.
MMM.
Yeah.
Hashtag.
Yeah,

444
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:08.870
no,
I agree.
I feel like,
at least for me,

445
00:27:08.871 --> 00:27:12.350
like so often what I go back to is like,
what is my value?

446
00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:16.730
And it's not my body.
It's like my comedy,

447
00:27:16.731 --> 00:27:21.170
my writing,
my mind,
my performance,
my timing.
Like all of those things.

448
00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:22.370
And it's easy to,

449
00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:26.210
to stop hating yourself when you start like going through your list of like,

450
00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:30.020
wait,
why am I valuable to this world?
And like,
you know,

451
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.800
I don't think it's because of my thigh,
you know,

452
00:27:33.801 --> 00:27:36.530
like I never have really.

453
00:27:36.531 --> 00:27:41.460
And so even though the world is telling you like your thigh matters,
it,
kindness

454
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.980
<v 1>does it.
So once you can like start to think about that.</v>

455
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.940
<v 3>Do you guys want to see my thigh?
No.
Leave them alone.</v>

456
00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:01.500
You already did.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Uh,

457
00:28:01.501 --> 00:28:06.420
I want it to end on a quote I actually saw on Twitter.
It's wrap us up

458
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.240
<v 1>when you guys are fat</v>

459
00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:15.800
is not that at all.
Tell us the main quotes.

460
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:24.040
This is that one mine thing happening again.
Oh

461
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.610
No,
I'm above the bridge.
You're hogs.

462
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:36.630
I'm sorry.
No,
no,

463
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.960
<v 3>don't worry about it.
I was actually going to say something like,
uh,
some days,</v>

464
00:28:40.961 --> 00:28:45.961
some days you eat salads and go to the gym and some days you eat cupcakes and

465
00:28:46.331 --> 00:28:49.720
refuse to put on your pants.
And it's called balance.

466
00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.680
I like the,

467
00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:56.180
<v 1>the hogs.
Thank you so much.</v>
