1
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:05.900
Thank you so much for joining us.

2
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.200
<v 1>Well,
I think we're gonna see a little bow.
The flip,
right?
I think we are.
Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.260
And let's see our trailer when they have jobs.
My knees.

4
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.403
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

5
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.250
to surreal
that much.
I know.

6
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.610
I've seen them all my life.

7
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.693
This is my sister.

8
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.400
I don't think she's the right choice.
You don't have to trust me.

9
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.650
Yeah.
Don't miss your bride is frozen or on your hot bath.

10
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.960
Okay.
The parts of the House that are unsafe.

11
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.680
Oh,

12
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.680
Susan old is this one that comes in time and living thing.

13
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.420
As I go below this level

14
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.870
stops holding on to things.
Has anyone died in this house?
Specific deaths.

15
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.520
Violent decks.
Best interest.
Proceed with caution.

16
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.490
Keeping them alive when they shouldn't be.

17
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.160
You're here with me.
Gimme a sec.

18
00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.010
She knows everything.

19
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.230
Do we have to do this?

20
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.940
<v 2>Yes.
You have no idea what they do.</v>

21
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.683
<v 0>What do you want?</v>

22
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.683
I have to leave.

23
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.710
You have nowhere else to go.
This is your home now.

24
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.080
We are.
We are also lucky.
You know,

25
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.190
<v 1>today we'll be joined by the Castro.
Please also welcome Jessica,
Chaz,</v>

26
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.700
Tom Hiddleston and Mya was.

27
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.863
<v 0>Gotcha.</v>

28
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.013
Okay.

29
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.850
<v 1>Thank you all so much for being here.
Welcome to Google.
Uh,</v>

30
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.530
so this movie was terrifying and I spent most of it just kind of like slowly

31
00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:23.890
sinking into the jumping up every once in a while.
And so congratulations.
Um,

32
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.091
you know,
it's,

33
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:29.730
it's this kind of horrific Jane Eyre meets flowers in the attic meets the

34
00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:33.630
shining is what I felt watching it and that in terror.

35
00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:35.280
Can you talk about some of the influences from it?

36
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.730
<v 3>Well,
the,
and,
and the 18th century,
uh,</v>

37
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.270
at the end of it and that reaction towards,
uh,
the age of reason,

38
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.420
there was a counter movement of Romanticism.
I,

39
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:51.421
one of the things that west created by back then was gothic romance and now

40
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.840
Gothic Romance,
they used to call it a blessing,
terror,
you know,

41
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.300
in the Victorian drawing or a rooms.
And,
uh,
it was,
uh,

42
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.970
a very titillating makes of violence,
uh,
sexuality.

43
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.170
And it was the,
the first time that in literature,
uh,

44
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.610
somebody created a romantic sensation about the past.

45
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.840
Nothing.
Romance is about the past and about the marriage of love and death.

46
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.260
So it's sort of the Prato.
He,

47
00:04:19.261 --> 00:04:23.580
most of the have the wrong word versus the van.
I'm done in Victorian era.

48
00:04:23.581 --> 00:04:28.000
It became an incredibly popular,
uh,
it affected Jane Austin.

49
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.540
It affected Charles Dickens,
the Brontez.
I mean,

50
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:34.210
you're going to feel the repercussions of it on,
uh,

51
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.420
anything from the secret garden to withering heights to great expectations and a

52
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.220
dollar days.
I mean,
I think that in many ways that is honor still alive,

53
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.670
very,
very different.
Now.
A lot of people,
when you say Gothic Romance,

54
00:04:50.671 --> 00:04:55.671
I imagine fabrio and the cover of the paperback novel and an airport carrying I

55
00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.370
girl a full of,
uh,
you know,
very ornamental dresses,
you know,

56
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.980
but ultimately that's,
that's part of the spirit.

57
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:07.981
But this is a genre that exists somewhere within fairy fairytale on horror and

58
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:13.120
romance.
You're not going to get pure horror and you're not going to get the,

59
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:17.410
you got mail sleepless in Seattle.
You're going to get a very strange mixture,

60
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:18.610
but beautiful.
I think

61
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.500
<v 1>so.
What was it exactly that drew you to this?
You know,</v>

62
00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:26.820
I bite sized to fit your kind of filmmaking style in a freak for it too.
Yeah.

63
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.190
<v 3>I mean,
I read the first movie I saw at age four was Wuthering heights.</v>

64
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.600
And I don't know if that has anything to do,
but that,
that was the first movie,

65
00:05:36.601 --> 00:05:40.470
and I've said it in interviews more than a decade and a half ago.

66
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.350
So I'm not an especially changing it for grins on big as my mother took me to

67
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.470
the movie and I was terrified and I was mesmerized.

68
00:05:49.471 --> 00:05:54.060
It was the first time I saw him over on the big screen and I started reading,

69
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.640
you know,
the,
the,
the typical things of Jane Eyre,

70
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.120
a withering heights and so forth.
And little by little I graduated,
um,

71
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.930
I have a big collection of Gothic Romance,
uh,
and Radcliffe,

72
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.750
which view rather than,
you know,
and Radcliffe,
uh,
was the preeminent,

73
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.330
a gothic romance writer.
Uh,

74
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.450
and finally there is a novel that I recommend for anyone curious called Uncle

75
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.680
Silas,
my Joseph.
It on the for new and it has a lot of the crimson spirit there.

76
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.160
But I wanted to make a movie that was beautiful and,

77
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.680
and sort of really creepy and dark at the same time.

78
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.430
<v 1>Um,</v>

79
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.170
one thing I loved about this movie is that you have two very powerful female

80
00:06:34.171 --> 00:06:36.650
characters and yeah,
and Gothic romance doesn't always is,

81
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:39.630
sometimes it's those was with a girl and I meet the guy and there's something

82
00:06:39.631 --> 00:06:44.490
going on.
But this is too,
Yup.
Very strong willed women.
Um,
so ladies,

83
00:06:44.491 --> 00:06:47.040
could you talk about kind of your involvement in the film and what it was like

84
00:06:47.041 --> 00:06:51.830
to step into these characters?
That was great.

85
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:56.710
I mean,
I,
um,
the characters kind of evolved as we went along and,
um,

86
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.620
Gamma was super collaborative with us and um,

87
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.450
we had a lot of opportunities to discuss with him and then he really kind of

88
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:09.870
helped us tailor the characters to,
to ourselves in a way that,
or,
you know,

89
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.900
make choices that made it easier for us or,
um,
more truthful for us.

90
00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:18.260
And that's really rare in a director and really always so appreciated.

91
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:19.550
So it was great.

92
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.820
<v 4>I was really excited when I got the script,
uh,</v>

93
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.010
because I'm not used to being in movies where actresses get to talk to each

94
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:32.840
other,
but I'm always looking for that.
Um,
I,

95
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:33.111
you know,

96
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:36.350
I did that help and that was probably the best experience of my life working

97
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:39.890
with those women.
And,
um,
so it was very excited about this.

98
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.120
And then also Guillermo had talked to me about,
um,

99
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.630
Lucille and Edith being kind of two types of love.

100
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.140
And there was something about Lucille that I just found so heartbreaking and

101
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:59.360
devastating and um,
and I just want her to explore it.

102
00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:03.740
It was a,
it was a minefield of where you could go,
um,

103
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.520
psychologically and,
and how deep you could go into a character,

104
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:09.530
which for an actor that's what you want to do

105
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.830
<v 1>was,
it was wonderful sort of seeing,</v>

106
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.920
I feel like your character kind of represented this sort of innocence in

107
00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:17.170
progression and wanting to move forward with love.

108
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.580
And then your character was so steeped in tradition and the past and like they

109
00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:24.340
both were kind of fighting for your character,
Tom,

110
00:08:24.341 --> 00:08:28.150
who was sort of stuck in the middle between these two important women in his

111
00:08:28.151 --> 00:08:32.020
life.
And um,
uh,
you,

112
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.940
you guys kind of have a very interesting dynamic that progresses over the film.

113
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:41.080
Um,
what,
what to you was kind of like the point where you were like,
I,

114
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.310
I am solid in this character.
This is her decision to stake her claim,

115
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.990
um,
in Tom's character.
Um,

116
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.610
<v 4>I would constantly,
it's funny,
I see the movie now too,
and this is,</v>

117
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.730
I was talking someone in Toronto and they had just seen the film and I was like,

118
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.240
isn't Thomas Sharpe so selfish?

119
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.173
<v 5>I was like,
because you know,</v>

120
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.141
<v 4>Lucille does,</v>

121
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:08.820
she does for history in the family for every decision she makes is for her

122
00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:09.654
brother.

123
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.920
And she even tries to protect Edith in the beginning of the movie by saying

124
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:15.360
she's too young and you know,

125
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.880
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

126
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.050
I know what you mean though.
Sorry,

127
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:33.790
I'm just teasing that there is a sort of more interesting things is

128
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.150
not the charming,
I find it personally very.

129
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.000
Um,
what did I interrupt?
I'm sorry.
Oh yeah,
I suppose,
um,

130
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.080
<v 6>uh,
yeah,
but I think,</v>

131
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.370
I think in terms of what Jessica reads as Thomas,

132
00:09:52.371 --> 00:09:57.320
his selfishness is actually a sort of struggle for freedom and free will and the

133
00:09:57.321 --> 00:09:59.450
film dramatizes um,

134
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.720
a tension between the past and the future

135
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:09.200
is that Thomas Sharpe,
my character feels like he's,
he's,
he's,

136
00:10:09.201 --> 00:10:09.950
um,

137
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.950
bound up by the past and literally haunted by the secrets of the past

138
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.370
<v 5>and in love with the future learning and in love,</v>

139
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.160
in love with the future in love with Eden.

140
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:26.440
<v 6>Um,
eventually.
And that I think is a,
in so many ways,</v>

141
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:31.410
God,
that's what Crimson peak dramatize is,
is,
um,
is that,

142
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.020
is it every,
each,
all three of us are,

143
00:10:35.021 --> 00:10:36.730
our characters have a struggle to be free.

144
00:10:36.731 --> 00:10:39.640
We're all fighting for something different.
And,
um,

145
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.570
and it's about how the secrets of the past can catch up with you if you,

146
00:10:43.571 --> 00:10:46.030
if you don't confront them.
Um,

147
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:51.150
and somehow the three characters become self aware of the course of the,

148
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:52.990
of the story.
They,
they,

149
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.130
there is a kind of a battle for the truth.

150
00:10:57.131 --> 00:11:02.020
And once the truth is out in the open air,
um,
some kind of resolution can be,

151
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.620
can be found.

152
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:08.360
<v 3>But that was what Henry James,
the fine gothic romance you said is about,
and,</v>

153
00:11:08.361 --> 00:11:11.230
and it was so perfect is that it's about the,

154
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.800
the goals represent the past and is the struggle to move into the future,

155
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.690
you know,
and,
and it really is so well put,
so,
so eloquent and,
and uh,

156
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:26.440
you know,
the idea,
the idea for me in this movie is normally,
uh,
even when,

157
00:11:26.441 --> 00:11:28.250
um,
uh,
they are,

158
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.400
they are mostly directed by men and they are mostly oriented towards,

159
00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:38.480
uh,
some ideas of the past about the feminine.

160
00:11:38.481 --> 00:11:40.130
That's why I love the Brontes,
you know,

161
00:11:40.131 --> 00:11:45.050
the Broncos are so progressive for their time and they are so full of real,

162
00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:50.950
sort of almost like a hall of mirrors of neurosis and real complexity.

163
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.440
And I wanted very much to make it about who saves the heroin.

164
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.400
Now I,
I'm not spying.
You guys saw it,
right?
So I'm not spoiling anything.

165
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:07.270
Anyone is here by mistake or ones the canopies we bought now,

166
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:11.590
Debbie,
I wanted her to save herself and I want to hurt in fact,

167
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.870
to be the one that saves the hero,
the guy that was going to save her.

168
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.280
Bruce and I,
and I tried to make two different different degrees,

169
00:12:21.281 --> 00:12:23.730
the male figures quite useless in Hawaii.

170
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.720
And Thomas is almost a teenager emotionally in that he,

171
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.810
he's,
he's been loved and bullied and manipulated,

172
00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:35.710
no pun intended,

173
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:41.560
into being completely dependent on almost is the sister and the mother and the

174
00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:43.610
lover and it's everything.
Um,
he,

175
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.750
he kind of goes along and the father is dominant,

176
00:12:46.751 --> 00:12:51.751
but he's incapable of having a really mature conversation with the daughter and,

177
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.200
and,
and either to become,
become a really strong moment.

178
00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.970
I remember when we were shooting,

179
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:03.210
we would have weeks on weeks of either being scared and then I will need the

180
00:13:03.401 --> 00:13:07.060
promise.
Mia tomorrow you won't be scared.
Tomorrow you'll be strong.

181
00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:09.940
Our thank you.
But you have to map it.

182
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:15.180
<v 1>Yeah.
I think one of my favorite lines was about,
uh,
wanting to be,
um,</v>

183
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.190
Mary Shelley,
not Jane Austin and,
but she did anyway.
You know,
I'm,

184
00:13:19.191 --> 00:13:23.870
the head of the funny thing is she gets her wish.
Yup.
Very mothering widow.

185
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.790
She predicted that one.
But no,
it was,
it's this wonderful sense that she,

186
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.970
she's in this relationship because she wants to be,

187
00:13:31.971 --> 00:13:34.880
not because that's what society expects of her.
Um,

188
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.700
and I thought the scenes with your father were great because I was,
it was like,

189
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.230
oh yeah,
that's,
she doesn't care.
You know,

190
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.970
she's very modern in that sense and that she whatever,
you know,
um,

191
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.790
and that she wants to pursue her own career and,

192
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:51.000
and isn't going to be bothered by kind of what other people think.
Um,

193
00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.990
what was it like working with the,
uh,

194
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.270
your father character in it because it seemed like such a short lift.
Important.

195
00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.830
Jim was wonderful to work with it.

196
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.300
I think we actually shot all those scenes at the very end.

197
00:14:02.301 --> 00:14:07.280
So we sort of started with all the stuff in the house and all the horror and it

198
00:14:07.281 --> 00:14:10.790
progressively got more and more of a nightmare.
And then,
um,

199
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.720
we got to the end and we had the last three weeks were around like outside in

200
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.650
Toronto and it felt like a different film to,
um,

201
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.430
have some of those really lovely scenes with Jim.
And um,

202
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:27.390
and go actually back to the beginning after filming Nand.
Yeah.
Um,

203
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:32.490
let's talk about ghosts because they are awesome.
Um,

204
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.070
the,
so the ghosts in this movie as you were saying,
you know,

205
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.590
they do represent the past in the sense,

206
00:14:36.591 --> 00:14:40.620
but there's also a very physical and metaphysical representation of them.
Yeah.

207
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.060
Um,
can you talk about where you decided to use them,
uh,

208
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.540
visually as opposed to this kind of,
you know,
the specter of them and,

209
00:14:47.541 --> 00:14:52.390
and you know,
I don't know how these people lived in this house.
It's terrifying.

210
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.640
<v 3>The thing is,
uh,
there are two things that are counterpoint in Queensland.</v>

211
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.680
One of them is obviously in the normal movie that is gothic horror and all that

212
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.050
you want the,

213
00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.960
the whole audience is rooting for the billings to be killed and when they get

214
00:15:08.961 --> 00:15:11.810
killed,
you cheer.
And that's a huge release.
And I,

215
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.230
I wanted to go counter and if we did our job right,

216
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:20.430
for you to actually feel progressively more ambivalent about the villains and,

217
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:23.270
and go Jesus,
they do have a story.
They do have a bag.

218
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.310
And the same with the ghost.
The problem is,

219
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.640
the easiest way to scare someone is to give the goals and a Judaeo Christian or

220
00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:35.600
a moral value.
Now you can say is the monic and it's something that people go,

221
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.240
Ooh,
I understand each construct his own,

222
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:43.241
but it's easy to make it scary because there are demonic or you say in this

223
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:44.230
house there lived a,

224
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:49.300
a woman that murdered her five children and stat her husband 20 times in the

225
00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:53.410
eye.
Oh my God.
You know,
that's already,
there's a much more valuable,

226
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.720
the tricky line that I decided to do on Grimson is the ghost needed to be

227
00:15:58.971 --> 00:16:02.870
revealed to be wanting to help either.
So I couldn't make them evil eye.

228
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:06.020
It still needed to make them creepy,
but I couldn't get,

229
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.110
they take full advantage of the other stuff.
And,
uh,

230
00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:12.740
what we did is we said,
well,
they're all trying to warn her,

231
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.220
but conveniently the first ghost has no tongue.
No.

232
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:22.550
The second goes,
has a broken neck and it's finally the modern.
I've can talk,

233
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:27.740
you know.
And so we did it progressively and we wanted very much,
uh,

234
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.730
I decided to make them physical for the actors to have them on the set.

235
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:32.570
And you know,

236
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:37.570
I didn't want them to be acting against a tennis ball with an ex,

237
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:42.350
you know,
cause it helps much more to have it there.
You know,
it's,

238
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.440
it's just a decision,
I believe in makeup effects.

239
00:16:45.441 --> 00:16:48.770
I believe in the craftsmanship of that.
And the whole movie,

240
00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:50.600
the proposal of the movie was to,

241
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.840
for it to feel like a handmade film from the wardrobe to the ceds to the makeup.

242
00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.520
I wanted it to be,

243
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.440
for lack of a better analogy and installation a world that you could fall into.

244
00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:04.274
You know,

245
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.330
<v 1>I think the best sort of manifestation of that is the house itself,</v>

246
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:12.330
which was horrifying and beautiful at the same time where it felt very real and

247
00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:12.940
it was,

248
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.510
I'm sure for you guys it was great actually being in a tactile scenario,

249
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:21.080
you know,
not being like,
please talk to this green wall of books.
Um,

250
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.870
but uh,
for me the house actually also sort of became a character in this,

251
00:17:25.871 --> 00:17:29.050
this sort of symbolic form of your,

252
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.340
your siblings passed and what they're holding onto and it's just in the state of

253
00:17:33.341 --> 00:17:35.930
decay.
Um,
what was it like shooting there?

254
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.030
What was,
I mean,
even if you look at this,

255
00:17:40.031 --> 00:17:41.920
I haven't seen these costumes and a long time.

256
00:17:41.921 --> 00:17:44.760
They're very painful to where I'm like,

257
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.100
oh my shoulders go up as soon as I see it.
I never tried them.

258
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:53.180
<v 4>What was incredible about it is,
um,</v>

259
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:57.650
the way Guillermo and the team designed is,
is that,
uh,

260
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:01.960
Thomas and Lucille,
our of the house and so,

261
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.800
so much so that the colors kind of blend into each other.

262
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:09.801
And there was even a hallway with the spikes around that look like teeth and

263
00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:11.100
those are on my dress.

264
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.590
So there's all these subtle details and when I,

265
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.880
the first time I went to the house and they were building it,

266
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:22.350
I saw it in many stages if actually informed the character so much.

267
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:26.820
I mean she is really physically part of her past.
She,
you know,

268
00:18:26.821 --> 00:18:29.070
it's painful for her to leave.

269
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.150
<v 3>Have you seen it again?
And then I'm sorry to interrupt the flow.</v>

270
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.130
We'll continue on that.
But if you see it again,

271
00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.820
the some architectural details are in the lace.

272
00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:45.300
So I wanted Lucille to be the house very much to be linkedin if you say it again

273
00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:48.010
when she gets angry,
the house breeds,

274
00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.770
even when she's off camera on the beginning,

275
00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.710
she's looking through the keyhole and the house breeds,

276
00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.590
cause he's too near to her and she was watching.

277
00:18:56.591 --> 00:19:01.570
And every time that she was going to get this flare,
the house reads and the,

278
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.630
and,
and it's because like in the house of usher,

279
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.230
another magical tale of incest,

280
00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.980
the falling of the house and having our online polls.
The House represents the,

281
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.620
the k of the characters who sort of uh,
uh,
sort of,
uh,

282
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:20.170
an entity that contains them all.
You know,
sergeant drove in that way?

283
00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:24.910
<v 6>Well,
um,
honestly the,
the set on crimson peak was,</v>

284
00:19:24.911 --> 00:19:28.540
was the most beautiful sets I've ever seen.
Uh,
the most,

285
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.470
the most fully realized,
um,

286
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.000
architects really sound I've set I've ever worked on.
It was,
uh,

287
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.050
it was really extraordinary.
It was like,
cause often,

288
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.560
often as actors we,
if it's a,

289
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.400
if it's a smaller film that sat in the contemporary world,

290
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.400
you use real locations.
If he,
you know,
if you're shooting in a restaurant,

291
00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.890
you could find the restaurant and shoot there,
but it all feels natural.

292
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:58.250
Or if you're in a,
in a very,
um,
if you're in another,

293
00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.740
in another realm and other university,

294
00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:04.210
there necessarily is so much post production,
um,
computer graphics.

295
00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.840
Uh,
but this was,
was physically there.

296
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:12.880
And it was like stepping through a magic portal into another world.

297
00:20:12.881 --> 00:20:16.540
It was truly a,
um,
an immersive experience.

298
00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:20.800
And I think that the time we all spent on the set was about six weeks,

299
00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.130
six weeks of shooting at the beginning.
And,

300
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.470
and using different parts of the house,
you could walk up the stairs,
you know,
um,

301
00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.470
everything you see,
it was real.
And for Ross,

302
00:20:32.471 --> 00:20:37.471
I think not having to supply the detail with our imaginations and just having to

303
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:42.940
live and breathe and behave and respond to each other in the house was,
was,

304
00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.010
is that really rare privilege as an actor?

305
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.320
<v 4>Well,
it's very claustrophobic.</v>

306
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.010
<v 1>Six weeks and that house was pretty tough,
I can imagine.
Yeah,
yeah,</v>

307
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.480
Yup.
Um,

308
00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.540
I mean I think the house is such an important symbol and especially for your two

309
00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:06.220
characters who are in a very interesting kind of power dynamic.

310
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.500
Um,
you know,
they are siblings,
but it's a time,

311
00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:13.270
it's a very patriarchal time and yet the seal wears the,
not pants,
but pants.

312
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.050
She wears the petticoats I guess in the relationship.
Um,

313
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.680
but to me it was about very much kind of breaking out of tradition and breaking

314
00:21:20.681 --> 00:21:22.960
away with family,
which is doubly hard to do.

315
00:21:22.961 --> 00:21:27.430
And then some extra complications that come along with it,
their relationship.
Um,

316
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:28.001
what was,

317
00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:31.210
what was kind of that development like for those characters because it's,

318
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:31.860
you know,

319
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:36.190
your character kind of came into his own with a certain set of consequences,
uh,

320
00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:40.660
out of that.
And
I'm trying not to,

321
00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:43.780
we can't spoil anything.

322
00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:51.350
<v 6>Okay.
Yeah,
I mean,
one of the things,
it was a wonderful weekend,
uh,</v>

323
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.340
before we started,
about two weeks before we started,

324
00:21:54.341 --> 00:21:59.341
I was doing a play in London and Jessica and Guillermo came to see me and to see

325
00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:01.840
me in it,
which is lovely.

326
00:22:01.841 --> 00:22:05.170
And then the next day we spent the whole day together talking about this

327
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:08.140
relationship.
Um,
and,
uh,

328
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:12.820
we had been friends before too,
so it was a very comfortable place to start.

329
00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:14.800
And it was a,
you know,

330
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.820
really was about jumping straight into the complex intimacy between them.

331
00:22:18.821 --> 00:22:23.740
You know,
they have,
they have been codependent from a very,
very young age,

332
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:28.690
um,
uh,
grown up without parents.
Um,
you know,
from,

333
00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:33.970
from pre teenage years essentially.
And,
um,

334
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.200
and so there is,
there is a degree of,
of intimacy,
which is,

335
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:42.970
uh,
which is actually a very precious and very delicate.
Um,

336
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.180
and the difficulty comes when when of course their individual desires and

337
00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:52.330
characteristics start to separate.
And,
uh,

338
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.890
so I think actually kind of calibrating that and plotting that out it was,
um,

339
00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:00.040
was,
was fascinating.
I've,
I personally find it fascinating too,

340
00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:04.960
to really kind of find the points of difference.
Um,
and the points of similarity,

341
00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:09.490
um,
which I felt were very,
can be very true.
People,

342
00:23:09.491 --> 00:23:10.810
the people that are different from each other.

343
00:23:10.811 --> 00:23:14.170
And there's something very interesting in that.

344
00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.930
This is 1901.
Um,
and,
uh,
we'd,

345
00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:23.740
the period setting is not an a,
is an age where,

346
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.180
and this is what Edith is pushing against rightly,
um,

347
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:33.520
is a woman's power is expressed through the men closest to her.

348
00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:38.740
Um,
and I think it's amazing that that's what Guillermo is decided to put at the

349
00:23:38.741 --> 00:23:43.420
center of his film.
That it's about,
um,
it,
it really is about female strength.

350
00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:48.170
Um,
uh,
but,
but Lucille,
and maybe you could speak to this,
but Lucille is having,

351
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.520
is forced into a situation where her status is expressed through Thomas,

352
00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:56.730
but Thomas has his own ideas and his own ambitions,
um,

353
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.400
and supper and his own heart,
quite simply.
Um,

354
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:04.790
it is the very individual,
um,
heartbeat he has,

355
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:08.660
which separates them in the end.
Uh,
what'd you think?

356
00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.410
<v 4>Well,
uh,
it was speaking what you were,
you know,</v>

357
00:24:13.411 --> 00:24:17.520
along the lines where you're talking about with the patriotic article society.

358
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:22.470
These are two people that have made every decision together.
Uh,
you know,

359
00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:26.550
and then it's really interesting when you,
when the movie begins,

360
00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.370
it's you actually,
without knowing it,
when you're watching the film,

361
00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:34.020
you witness the cracks in that because for the first time,

362
00:24:34.021 --> 00:24:38.240
I think in their lives,
he's starts to make decisions without her.
Hmm.
Uh,

363
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:43.270
so you see that from the very beginning of the film and then when we get back to

364
00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:45.870
the house,

365
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:51.270
that really is where Lucille starts to f to gain her power again.

366
00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.560
Um,
so much so that even with the,

367
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:59.730
the costumes and the sets,
you know,
um,
Lucille,

368
00:24:59.731 --> 00:25:04.020
the longer she's in the house,
the bigger she gets.
Even with Clark her.
Yeah,

369
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.680
<v 1>they happened to me too.</v>

370
00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:18.190
<v 4>So with Mia with it,
she would get smaller or the,
the,</v>

371
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.390
the furniture around her would get,

372
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.920
<v 3>we made the furniture and in several sizes,</v>

373
00:25:22.921 --> 00:25:27.921
but also the Lucille has this condescending point of view about what it is to be

374
00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.630
a female in the world.
I mean,
she's,
she's,

375
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.860
she's that character with many scars and I think that I make a blind done.

376
00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:42.240
I find it very funny,
but it's very cool when you see the portrait of the mother,

377
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.850
you know,
I have no doubt of their upbringing.

378
00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:50.700
And then they talk about their father breaking her mother's leg.
I mean,

379
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.420
one of family.
Yeah.

380
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.430
But she makes a point to either that if you're pretty,

381
00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:01.140
you are delicate and I think that that's a wrong information.

382
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:02.030
Um,

383
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:06.990
and I think that that's why we use the Motif of the maths on the butterflies.

384
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:11.780
Or Lucille thinks she's a math as he's all powerful and you know,

385
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.610
dark than either of his,

386
00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:19.940
because by virtue of being of a son of this position or American or young,

387
00:26:20.641 --> 00:26:21.474
I'm pretty,

388
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:25.110
she must be a little butterfly that she is going to be able to pin to her.

389
00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:30.140
Wallen and the whole point for me was to show not butterflies can be brutal,

390
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:32.143
you know?

391
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.710
<v 1>Yeah.
I think,
uh,
even visually you did such a lovely job of having,
you know,</v>

392
00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:39.270
you stood out in the house and these wonderful yellow colors,
which are,

393
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.600
or you had us and I saw them assemble one of those Kudos to you for wearing that

394
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:50.110
because that thing looked complicated.
Um,
but it's,
it,

395
00:26:50.111 --> 00:26:50.911
it was very interesting.

396
00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:53.790
Did you feel kind of being dressed that way and being in this kind of,
did,

397
00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:58.170
did that help you kind of stepping into that part of it or they're definitely

398
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.650
super uncomfortable,
you know,
horrible.

399
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:05.140
And I've swore off to my first period film,
I'd never do another one again.

400
00:27:05.141 --> 00:27:09.510
And that hasn't happened.
But,
um,
they're great.

401
00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:11.790
They do give you like a certain kind of,

402
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:16.650
there's only really one option two in how to carry yourself and be,

403
00:27:16.651 --> 00:27:20.430
so there was a certain amount you draw from them and they're really beautiful

404
00:27:20.431 --> 00:27:25.140
and Kate who designed them is just a genius.
So I,
I,
yeah,

405
00:27:25.141 --> 00:27:27.510
I have like a love hate relationship with them for sure.

406
00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.960
You were very strong butterfly in them,
so thank you.

407
00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:35.430
I had various different wings,
different sizes,
large way.

408
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:41.310
Um,
I've got to bring up a point just because I felt like this was a parent's

409
00:27:41.311 --> 00:27:44.430
cautionary tale because there was a line in the beginning.
It was,

410
00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:46.980
it was your father character.
And he just goes like,

411
00:27:46.981 --> 00:27:49.310
I don't like him and I don't know why.
And I've just broken,

412
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.760
I scribbled down and was like,
listen to Dad,
listened to dad and then your,

413
00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:57.390
you know,
your mother's kind of warning you against stuff.
And uh,
it was,

414
00:27:57.391 --> 00:28:00.360
it was very interesting kind of having these specters of,

415
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.300
of parental history,
uh,

416
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:08.460
speak out against this male character and just go,
no,
like,
nope.

417
00:28:08.461 --> 00:28:10.290
Bad idea,
bad idea.
Um,

418
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:15.060
I wasn't sure if that was kind of guiding away from the historical role of a

419
00:28:15.061 --> 00:28:16.590
gothic romance male.

420
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.970
<v 3>What is interesting for me is that there is,
uh,</v>

421
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.210
Thomas arrives to that meeting,

422
00:28:24.211 --> 00:28:29.211
I think would all every intention to woo or the American investors,

423
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.530
her father in particular,

424
00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:36.780
and there's a very subtle moment where the feather notices that she's looking at

425
00:28:37.021 --> 00:28:38.830
him from the door.
Um,

426
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.940
he doesn't like that is this very patriarchal thing from the 19th and 20th

427
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:49.080
century where daughters basically,

428
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.680
if they didn't marry the,
they took care of the father,
you know,

429
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:57.450
and there is that sort of jealousy and he doesn't like him because of that.

430
00:28:57.451 --> 00:29:02.160
But also the beauty for Thomas is that I think he likes you this,

431
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:07.560
but little by little he falls in love with her on the beginning.
He actually,

432
00:29:07.561 --> 00:29:10.630
I think he invites her to the world's to split,

433
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:15.180
to offend the father or to go against that,
that he feels,

434
00:29:15.181 --> 00:29:18.240
but I think that it's those little things that interests me.

435
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.660
I think the father is a character.
I understand,

436
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.880
but I think that it's a character that I sympathize with in many ways,

437
00:29:26.881 --> 00:29:30.810
but he,
he,
he should,
he should have just straight out.

438
00:29:30.811 --> 00:29:35.250
Like in every melodrama,
there are things that some people don't say is your,

439
00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:39.540
he's your father,
you're her brother,
whatever.
They keep it for the whole movie.

440
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:44.110
And the father have told her straight away,
and this is why I don't like him.

441
00:29:44.111 --> 00:29:47.140
I found out this.
But he didn't trust her to be that strong.

442
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.800
And that's what it's done.
It's interesting,
I think,
uh,

443
00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:55.630
barons in the movie at the root of,
of his graces.

444
00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:00.840
And the other thing I wanted to do is most of these movies end up with the,
the,

445
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.060
the dark and brooding gentlemen actually being innocent.

446
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:07.960
And then he can be condoned.
And Meredith and this,

447
00:30:07.961 --> 00:30:11.320
I wanted them to love each other in spite of what he had done.

448
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.510
And for horror to start with the marriage not end because normally these movies

449
00:30:16.511 --> 00:30:21.040
and everybody's happy throwing rise and I say,
no,
no,
no.

450
00:30:21.041 --> 00:30:22.600
That's when things start,
actually,

451
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.320
<v 6>yeah.
This is life after that implies that marriage</v>

452
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.870
to a point,
I'm going to embarrass him or not,
but I,
uh,
the,
the,

453
00:30:33.871 --> 00:30:38.670
the Naugles talk about my tennis shoes now.
Very beautiful shoes.

454
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:42.120
Mail mailers.
Yeah.

455
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.920
I'm not going to talk about Guillermo's foot.
He,
he,
he,

456
00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.860
when I came onto the film,
he shed a number of gothic romance novels as me,

457
00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.250
chief among,
which was,
as he's already mentioned,

458
00:30:55.251 --> 00:30:58.300
the mysteries of your Dorfer by an Radcliffe's,
um,

459
00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:03.790
which is I think almost the first time a writer had,

460
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:05.290
had,

461
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:10.290
had written a story about the supernatural explained in terms of past trauma.

462
00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.670
Um,
but there was in a way,
if she,

463
00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.160
she was one of the primary inventors of the genre of Gothic Romance,
a young,

464
00:31:19.161 --> 00:31:22.530
innocent heroin at all dark stranger,
uh,

465
00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:26.410
to whom she is drawn by some sort of,
um,

466
00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.720
sexuality and charisma only to be surprised and terrified by certain secrets.

467
00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:37.940
Um,
and that seems to be like what gothic romance is all about.

468
00:31:37.941 --> 00:31:40.430
So the rebellion against parents is,

469
00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:44.120
it is a way of taking possession of your own sexuality,
I think.
Say,

470
00:31:44.121 --> 00:31:45.770
I ain't gonna,
I ain't gonna Chase this.

471
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:50.660
But then the twin aspect of gothic romance is the prospect of death is that,

472
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:55.710
is that sometimes at your sexuality can put you in a dangerous situation and af

473
00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.940
after which you will never be the same.

474
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.630
And I think that's what gamma so beautifully,
um,

475
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:08.230
kind of brings together in this film as it is a while doffing his hat to

476
00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:12.470
traditional gothic romance.
He inverts it and can bounce people's expectations.

477
00:32:12.471 --> 00:32:14.240
I think it's,
I personally think it's like,

478
00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:17.630
<v 3>so it's also important to show the heroin fucking I'm surviving.</v>

479
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:27.480
I think that the gothic romance and fairy tales have are two types,

480
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:31.280
an archaic or repressive,
a lot of the fairy tales heart.

481
00:32:31.281 --> 00:32:34.320
Be careful on the way you're a parent and,
and,

482
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:37.790
and horror functions in many ways the same way.

483
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:43.090
And it chastity from the main character or sexuality gets punished.

484
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:46.370
And we,
when we were working,

485
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.520
we said we have to make it a point,

486
00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:54.930
but she is not Buhr [inaudible] she is and she has to be in charge of the sex

487
00:32:55.071 --> 00:32:59.840
scene.
She has to be willing and it has to be,
you know,

488
00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:03.920
I gave him the is not,
is not a negative.
I mean I think,

489
00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:08.090
I think the movies and when you go against so many things against the grain,

490
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:13.220
there's a different feeling to the movies sometimes less commercially able to

491
00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:17.390
and trap you.
But I think is far more satisfying in the long run.

492
00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:21.320
<v 1>I mean it felt much more sort of realistic.
It's like we can't you</v>

493
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.390
<v 5>the human race has continued on and there's one way it did.</v>

494
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.220
If it was real,
pharmacist would sell condoms and are gone.

495
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:36.583
But no,
it was

496
00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:40.830
<v 1>really an interesting kind of embrace of sis.
Like being like,
look,
they'd,
and,</v>

497
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.260
and the,
I like that your character initiates it,
you know,

498
00:33:43.261 --> 00:33:44.430
she's very embracing of it.

499
00:33:44.431 --> 00:33:47.880
She'd knows that this is something logical that comes as the next step in their

500
00:33:47.881 --> 00:33:52.110
relationship.
And when,
you know,
it's just a Tavis is kind of reticent.
She's like,

501
00:33:52.111 --> 00:33:53.880
nope,
we're going to,
I'm going to find a way to make this happen.

502
00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.630
<v 5>Been like,
I'm going to make you some tea.
No</v>

503
00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.660
Pass.
Um,
there's a kind of

504
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:06.730
<v 1>the thing that does go hand in hand with the amount of passionate and stuff that</v>

505
00:34:06.731 --> 00:34:09.860
goes into this film and that's the violence that comes out of it.
Um,

506
00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:14.920
and it's just,
it felt very kind of the other side of that coin where it's like,

507
00:34:14.921 --> 00:34:16.210
these are our very passionate,

508
00:34:16.211 --> 00:34:20.310
caring characters who maybe don't know how to communicate.

509
00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:25.370
<v 3>I'm sure what she was raised by this horrible band.</v>

510
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.680
Yeah.
And the way they communicated was through that.
That was the thing.

511
00:34:28.681 --> 00:34:31.680
You don't understand that she has scars in her face.

512
00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:34.710
There was a scene where she used to have her back exposed on,

513
00:34:34.711 --> 00:34:39.450
she has huge scars in her bag.
She took gainings for her brother.

514
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:44.070
She says that,
and you know,
she,
she's sort of,
you know,
uh,

515
00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:47.820
I think all,
all of the mistakes that exist in the world initiate in childhood.

516
00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:52.710
If we,
if we took care of children for the first 10,

517
00:34:52.711 --> 00:34:55.380
12 years of their life,
the world would be perfect.

518
00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:58.170
But it's because that is,

519
00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:02.100
that is what destroys them as kids and they carry it the rest of their life.

520
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:07.060
<v 1>Yeah.
We're going to open it up to audience questions about it.</v>

521
00:35:07.061 --> 00:35:10.240
If anyone wants the lineup.
Uh,
one question,

522
00:35:10.241 --> 00:35:12.030
I'm really afraid to ask this from PMO,
but,
uh,

523
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:17.460
<v 5>no,
I was going to have a free to ask.
What's something that scares,</v>

524
00:35:17.461 --> 00:35:19.320
you know,
I

525
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.320
<v 3>people,
people,
I mean I'm afraid of politicians.</v>

526
00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:26.160
I'm afraid of 12 super structures.
I mean,
I think,

527
00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:29.640
I think that uh,
we live in a world where,
uh,

528
00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.280
I think that another thing that scares me,

529
00:35:32.281 --> 00:35:36.450
and this is why I made the movies because I thoroughly believe in love and I

530
00:35:36.451 --> 00:35:41.310
think that has become almost something to be afraid of.
I mean,

531
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.660
we are almost in the equivalent of modern times to Victorian Times,

532
00:35:45.661 --> 00:35:46.494
Victorian Times.

533
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:51.630
It was afraid of sexuality and they use this tales to talk about sexuality in a

534
00:35:51.991 --> 00:35:54.550
veiled way.
And I think that we,

535
00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.570
we are in a world where I feel we,
we,

536
00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:01.320
we become very reticent to talk about emotion and love.

537
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:04.610
That scares me a lot.
And I think,
uh,
because we,

538
00:36:04.611 --> 00:36:07.170
we don't want to be vulnerable and we want to,
the,

539
00:36:07.171 --> 00:36:10.680
the automatic pool is to be distant and aloof.

540
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.790
And you're instantly are smarter if you're a skeptic.

541
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.740
And I think if you're a believer,
you're instantly sounds tubular.

542
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.460
And this things to scare me quite a bit.
And,

543
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:26.430
and you can see it like when people think about why those twilight,

544
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:31.590
it's so successful,
strangely enough for whatever gothic elements Twila has,

545
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:36.420
you realize that now we're using it to articulate a love.

546
00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:41.100
That's what they couldn't,
they couldn't talk about sex in Victorian era.

547
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:46.520
And now the only way that a fantasy about a perfect love can be articulate is

548
00:36:46.891 --> 00:36:51.680
gothic.
You know,
this is strange.
The guy has to be a vegetarian by buyer

549
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.160
and never,
it's,
it speaks of the Moore's over time.

550
00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:01.340
<v 5>It feels very,
it's kind of cyclical where we're kind of reverting back in.
Um,</v>

551
00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.740
all right,
cool.
Hi,

552
00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.940
<v 7>when we were watching the trailer earlier,
I,
two thoughts go through my mind.</v>

553
00:37:06.941 --> 00:37:10.990
The first was I wonder how many times you have seen that trailer as you,

554
00:37:10.991 --> 00:37:13.750
as you were standing in the back.
Uh,
but the second question was,

555
00:37:13.751 --> 00:37:16.570
when I saw the trailer,
I thought there's gonna be a lot more about ghosts.

556
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.960
And I was curious how you decided,
what's the process of making that trailer?

557
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:21.370
How do you say what you include,
what you cut?

558
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:25.190
<v 5>Well,
actually I got up to speak this way because they put the little thing here,</v>

559
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:29.810
but uh,
it's very strange.

560
00:37:29.811 --> 00:37:32.710
But I told me that film maker,

561
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:37.130
it was involved somewhat in the marketing,
but not fully,
you know,
I,

562
00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:39.570
you have to watch,
uh,

563
00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.310
with faith on horror when they market your movie.

564
00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:47.900
Um,
it's a mixture of,
depending on how good the marketing department is,

565
00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.840
they captured the essence of the movie somehow.
Now,

566
00:37:50.841 --> 00:37:55.340
gothic romance is particularly gauging because he's not a whore.

567
00:37:55.341 --> 00:37:59.000
If you go expecting a full blown horror movie,
you're not going to get it.

568
00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:03.050
And if you're go expecting full blown Romans are not going to get it.
So I,

569
00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:08.140
I actually think Clemson is hard to communicate the full spectrum of the movie.

570
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:12.520
I think it's more a drama.
We'd go centered,
which is what Eden says.

571
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:17.240
I bought her story.
Uh,
but how will you communicate them in a,

572
00:38:17.241 --> 00:38:20.570
in a sort of purely commercial way.
So I don't know.

573
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.400
I love the trailers that they've been doing.

574
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.830
I think that represent one side of the movie.

575
00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:29.100
And inevitably there will be a sign of a movie that people have not seen.
Well,

576
00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:32.090
Dell discover in the theater,
but that's why we do these things.

577
00:38:32.091 --> 00:38:35.710
That's why if you like it,
help us send word out,

578
00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:40.720
they'll tell your friends,
you youngsters,
all those things.
Yeah,

579
00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.500
thanks.
And I've seen it in a shuttle load times

580
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:47.620
actual number counts.

581
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:53.560
<v 1>Hey,
um,
this is a question for Tom.
I'm a huge fan of everyone,
but especially Tom.</v>

582
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:58.130
Okay.
And my question was,

583
00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:01.250
it's actually really funny because I like you a lot as an actor,

584
00:39:01.251 --> 00:39:05.390
but I found your character the most despicable of the characters in the movie.

585
00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.180
And so I have this inner confidence.

586
00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:13.340
I feel like Lucio was so obviously messed up towards the end.
You could tell

587
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:18.140
your character,
you know,
you could sense a bit of good in him,

588
00:39:18.141 --> 00:39:20.000
but that almost made his actions worse.

589
00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.990
So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that and then maybe how

590
00:39:23.991 --> 00:39:25.790
you drew that out in your portrayal.

591
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.750
<v 5>Um,
okay.
Uh,</v>

592
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.160
well,
yeah.

593
00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.540
<v 6>Um,
I think I found,
um,</v>

594
00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:38.970
the reason I wanted to,

595
00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:43.110
the reason I wanted to play Thomas was when I first read it,

596
00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:48.540
I could see a character
embroiled in,

597
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.890
um,
some very dark action and material,

598
00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:57.450
um,
so guilty and so shamed and,

599
00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.740
and really struggling to free himself,
uh,

600
00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:07.340
struggling to somehow write the shit back onto an even keel.

601
00:40:07.891 --> 00:40:11.640
Someone who was actually impelled by who understood,

602
00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.610
who is beginning to understand his own shame.

603
00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:18.360
There's so much shame and the character and uh,

604
00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.210
and someone who was actually innately gifted.

605
00:40:20.211 --> 00:40:25.040
I th I think the engineering is engineering gift,
has mechanical,
um,

606
00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:30.060
the sort of inspiration and capacity is a very genuine talent.
And someone,
if he,

607
00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:31.100
if he had been,
uh,

608
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:36.720
a healthier kind of mine would have maybe gone on to be a great industrialists,

609
00:40:36.721 --> 00:40:40.110
a great engineer.
Um,
and I think,

610
00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:44.730
I truly think that Edith is a,

611
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:51.300
a light which shines on him and it takes them completely by surprise and,

612
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:56.380
and she shows him how to be good.
And,

613
00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:58.560
and then for the rest of the story,

614
00:40:58.561 --> 00:41:02.700
he's struggling to weigh his responsibility for the past and his desire for

615
00:41:02.701 --> 00:41:06.700
freedom,
a sense of responsibility to Lucio and his love for her,

616
00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.540
which is unhealthy and lots of ways,

617
00:41:09.541 --> 00:41:11.970
but he still loves her kit and it comes from damage.

618
00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:16.740
And one of the defining quotes that we was a headline for us was damaged.

619
00:41:16.741 --> 00:41:21.330
People are dangerous because they know how to survive.
And,
and,

620
00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:23.610
and in spite of what you found despicable,

621
00:41:23.611 --> 00:41:26.280
which is completely within your rights to feel

622
00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:31.920
<v 5>you're frying in the inside.
I'm sorry.
No,
it's okay.</v>

623
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:34.040
Cause actually the reason I to play it was it was

624
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.580
<v 6>someone moving from a place of shame to try to be a better man.</v>

625
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:42.530
And I do think that there is a redemption that he achieved the kind of

626
00:41:42.531 --> 00:41:47.060
redemption without spoiling anything,
it's clearly not an easy one.

627
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.110
Um,

628
00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:53.110
and there is a catharsis that he finally is able to concede a responsibility and

629
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:58.820
take and be accountable for what he's done.
But he makes a couple of very,

630
00:41:58.821 --> 00:42:02.270
very good choices towards the end.
And so I,
in a way,
I,

631
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.580
I will defend him to the death.
But then so with these fine ladies at my size,

632
00:42:07.581 --> 00:42:11.090
so that part of the job of an activist is to be,
is to,
is to,

633
00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:16.070
is to fill the shoes of somebody else from a place of compassion.
So I can only,

634
00:42:16.071 --> 00:42:18.470
I can only feel his,
um,

635
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:22.490
I can only feel and understand his pain.
And you know,
if,

636
00:42:22.491 --> 00:42:25.280
if I were to have to defend him,
I would say,
well,

637
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:27.250
he is who he is because of what happened to him.

638
00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:30.680
And Lester Guillermo said those choices were taken away from him when he was

639
00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:34.700
very young.
Um,
so it actually has this beautiful arc from,

640
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.130
from shame to freedom.

641
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:44.670
<v 8>Thank you director.</v>

642
00:42:44.671 --> 00:42:49.671
And the cast for gift giving me very terrifying and a violin movie.

643
00:42:49.831 --> 00:42:54.831
Yesterday I was a kind of shaking file four or five times and the my seat,

644
00:42:54.961 --> 00:42:58.650
when I saw some of the hands creeping and like the,

645
00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:03.150
the thing on the head ghost was pretty like scary.

646
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:08.380
Um,
so my question was that initially when the,
in the,

647
00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:13.400
even in the character of Amir's character where she tries to get her story about

648
00:43:15.031 --> 00:43:18.080
ghosts and get through and she's,
uh,

649
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.910
the reaction she gets is like,
hey,
why didn't you,
nobody wants to the release.

650
00:43:22.911 --> 00:43:26.570
He goes,
they do the really like it.
Why don't you do a love stories?

651
00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:30.750
And she's a no,
it's just a store even close to knit.
How story,
right?

652
00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:32.880
So in real life,

653
00:43:32.881 --> 00:43:37.470
like I don't really get to see that many ghost stories.
It's,

654
00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:42.190
if you look at movies,
most of them are like the characters.
Um,

655
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.410
they,
they tried to say it's more like love stories and feel good movies.

656
00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.220
This one came up so I jumped into the chance to get in.
Last one,

657
00:43:50.221 --> 00:43:54.590
I think I saw as evil dead in 80s or 90s.
So,
um,

658
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.440
<v 3>do you as a watching list?</v>

659
00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.890
<v 8>Yeah,
some came,
but then the girls for a more like shadows and they didn't,</v>

660
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:05.720
it was mostly laughing along the way.
But this one was different.

661
00:44:05.721 --> 00:44:06.554
I didn't laugh at all.

662
00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:12.880
<v 3>What you're saying actually,
that that used to happen.</v>

663
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:16.030
Like the Brontez,
all the Bronte sisters,

664
00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:20.520
all of them had the Polish under a pseudonym,
a male.
So the name,

665
00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:25.060
they kept their initials,
CV,
you know,
ab and so forth.
What they,

666
00:44:25.061 --> 00:44:28.570
they they had to,
to publish under a male pseudonym.

667
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:32.970
I'm purposely in many ways even changed our narrative a little.

668
00:44:32.971 --> 00:44:37.420
So it was less evident that they were female.
And to this day,
I mean,

669
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:42.090
I call her either for either of Warthen who was,
in my opinion,

670
00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:46.570
I was good with ghostly Dale's house,
Henry James.
But people tend to call this,

671
00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:51.220
qualify her as a Pale imitator of haylage Henry James.
It is it,

672
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.480
those were things,
mason and some facts.

673
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:58.890
And what I like is that if you watch carefully at the end and the credits she

674
00:44:58.891 --> 00:45:01.830
wrote the novel about Crimson Begun,

675
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:05.430
her first experience is based on our goals that appear to my mother.

676
00:45:05.431 --> 00:45:06.270
And when she was a kid,

677
00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:12.180
my grandmother sat on her bed the night she died and dodge her in the shoulder

678
00:45:12.871 --> 00:45:17.871
and she heard the springs and the bed creaking and he used to dominate this

679
00:45:18.181 --> 00:45:19.930
things irresponsibly when I was [inaudible].

680
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:22.420
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

681
00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:26.710
<v 8>Is that the,
how do you like judge between whether to make this kind of a movie,</v>

682
00:45:26.711 --> 00:45:29.890
which are very rare then gender,
the compared to versus like,
Hey,

683
00:45:29.891 --> 00:45:31.870
let's make a love story has like actors.

684
00:45:31.871 --> 00:45:34.870
How do you to jump in to do it or see it as a director?

685
00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:38.530
How do you like try to like bay between the movies?

686
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:40.500
<v 3>I only do weird shit.</v>

687
00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.330
<v 4>I visited the second time I've worked with Guillermo.
I did,
um,</v>

688
00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.550
Mama with him that he produced.

689
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:59.540
And I like doing his weird movies so much.

690
00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:03.800
The character of Lucille.
I,
you know,
sometimes actresses,
actors,

691
00:46:03.801 --> 00:46:08.150
everyone gets typecast and I'd never played a character like that and I just

692
00:46:08.151 --> 00:46:12.710
loved her.
So that's,
for me it was a great opportunity to play the role.

693
00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:14.290
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

694
00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:16.750
<v 6>I,
I,
I'm always drawn to,
um,</v>

695
00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.190
<v 5>complex material.
I think,
uh,</v>

696
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:24.930
I I enjoy,
um,

697
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:31.280
I enjoy characters who have a very,
uh,
kind of have

698
00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.610
<v 6>deep souls in a way.
They're complex people.</v>

699
00:46:34.611 --> 00:46:37.310
Cause I think most people are actually a very complex.

700
00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:41.330
And so if I read a piece of writing like this was,

701
00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:45.770
you can eat the sensitivity and the delicacy with which the human characters are

702
00:46:45.771 --> 00:46:47.330
written was incredibly inspiring.

703
00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:49.573
<v 5>Uh,</v>

704
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:52.310
<v 6>I tend to think the types of characters,</v>

705
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.500
some of the types of characters you see in movies,
you know,
they,
um,

706
00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.640
I'm sure we could all think of things that we just go out and that was a bit

707
00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:03.330
Finley drawn and these characters were so multidimensional there.

708
00:47:03.331 --> 00:47:06.390
Seems there seems so rich,
so real

709
00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:10.660
<v 5>in a way.
Um,
big fan of this guy.</v>

710
00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:12.610
So that's why I did it.

711
00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:17.650
Make you need to have you iman.

712
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:19.883
Thanks dude.

713
00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:28.060
<v 4>Um,
I,
