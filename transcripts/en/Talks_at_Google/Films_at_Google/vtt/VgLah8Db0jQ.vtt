00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.070
Hi everybody.
Welcome to toxic Google.

2
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.120
My name is Nadia and I'm very excited to introduce Demitri Martin.

3
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.130
So random falls the documented into the room.

4
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.610
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

5
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.190
<v 2>thanks everybody.
Thank you so much for coming today.
I appreciate it.</v>

6
00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:31.040
I'm very excited.
Everyone here is very excited.
Um,

7
00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:32.840
so we're going to do some questions and then,
uh,

8
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.540
at the end I'll let you guys know when and we'll open it up to Q and.
A.

9
00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:39.460
We can pass the mic around.
So start thinking if anyone has anything.
Um,

10
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.490
so the movie dean,
uh,
I watched it really,
really great,

11
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.090
really loved it.
Um,

12
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.830
and if I miss anything let me know.

13
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.050
<v 0>But you directed,
you wrote it,</v>

14
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.390
you produced it and you did all the sketches and you start in it?
Yes.
Okay.
Wow.

15
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.803
A lot of Hubris.

16
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.630
<v 2>Yeah.
And it all out there though.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Can you talk us through,</v>

17
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:05.450
like when you had the idea and just writing,

18
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.310
<v 0>getting all the way to filming?</v>

19
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.930
I mostly do standup comedy and I got into stand up to do stand up.

20
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:15.320
I like writing jokes and I like telling him,

21
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.610
I feel lucky that I can do it as a job.
I found a way to make money doing it.

22
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.930
But along the way,
um,
mostly in my notebooks,

23
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.680
just from writing jokes by hand,
which I still like to do,
you know,

24
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.000
type them into my phone sometimes.

25
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:34.001
But usually I carry a little notebook and just write down ideas along the way.

26
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:37.610
Doing that every day,
other ideas started to come out.

27
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.240
Sometimes there were drawings,
just a little line drawings and sometimes,

28
00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:45.050
I don't know,
like a idea for a book or a short story and movie ideas.

29
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.220
We're in there.
Most of them were like higher concept.
For whatever reason.

30
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.250
I was drawn to the idea of making movies about outer space or I dunno,

31
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.650
underwater or whatever the hell I thought I was going to do.

32
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.810
But then I did sell a couple of pitches over the years and I got money,

33
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.930
the scripts,
which was cool.
Excuse me,

34
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:08.330
I had this free club soda that you guys gave me.
Thank you.

35
00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:11.900
But I chose poorly because I'm in a burp through my conversation.

36
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.240
But I love this.
There's mixed berry thing here.

37
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.860
I'm not sponsored by them or anything.
Yeah.
So,
um,

38
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.070
after I sold those pitches,
I thought,
hey,
I'm going to get to make these,
these,

39
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.720
these concept.
He movies,

40
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:25.850
they'll get made in Hollywood and maybe I'll get to play a part in them,

41
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:29.900
but they never got made.
So it was nice to get money,
but it never went anywhere.

42
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:34.070
So after some years I decided if I'm going to have a shot at making movies,

43
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:39.071
I'll have to write them myself for myself and I'll direct them and I'll learn

44
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:43.640
how to do each of these roles so that I can have creative control and also get

45
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:46.250
the thing made.
I can make it happen.

46
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.400
And then after that I realized,
well,

47
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:52.640
I'll have to write a small idea cause I had no one's going to give me money to

48
00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:56.960
do a big movie.
So I wrote this one,
which is a very personal,

49
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.280
smaller story,
I guess you say.
Um,

50
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.130
I was lucky I got Kevin Kline to play my dad in the movie.

51
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:05.620
And that made it a real movie that helped me get the financing.

52
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:08.500
A lot of it came together when Kevin responded to the script and said he would

53
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:13.420
do it.
So,
um,
that was like a big leap in the process.

54
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.500
Like that kind of got me down the road to actually making the movie.

55
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.640
It took a while though.
It's,

56
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.100
it's weird when you make a small indie film like this one,
nobody cares.

57
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:25.960
Nobody wants a movie.
No,
he's waiting for it.

58
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.870
So you have to hustle and try to find your way through it.
Um,

59
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.860
but I did and I'm grateful now because I have a finished movie and it's actually

60
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:39.040
going to be a movie theaters,
which was,
there was no guarantee that would happen.

61
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.170
So I'm trying to focus on that and not worry about how well it will do or,

62
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.900
um,
just how nasty people will be online.
I mean,

63
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.710
I don't think that there's anything that's would provoked that,
but of course,

64
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:58.420
you know,
I think it's,
it's,
it's a colder world these days.
So,
uh,

65
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.010
making something heartfelt has a certain scariness to it,
you know,

66
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.590
they vulnerable.
Yeah,
I think it is.

67
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:08.320
It's certainly more vulnerable than I've been in my standup.

68
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.900
I like doing jokes about chairs and trees and stuff like that.

69
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:16.810
So those are safe topics usually.
And this is more about,

70
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.491
even though they'll be like,

71
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:21.320
you fucker that was a racist chair to why that just no way.

72
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.420
I knew how it was about a cherry,
I don't know,
whatever.
Um,

73
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.240
my mother was a chair,
you piece of Shit,

74
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.010
some blood.
But now,
yeah.
So this is more about grief and loss and,
and you know,

75
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:40.000
it's a personal thing.
Yeah.
How long did it take you to write the script?

76
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.450
All the way through?
I don't know.
I was trying to do the mass.

77
00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:43.720
Someone else asks me and I was like,
okay,

78
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:47.260
I think I started writing it about five years ago and then I stopped and I went

79
00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:50.260
to some other idea that I thought would be,
again,

80
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:53.350
it was a higher concept thing and that's what it was around then that I realized

81
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:57.080
I'm not going to get money for this.
So I went back to this,
this one,
um,

82
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.030
I shot it in 2014 so it is about three years old,

83
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:06.490
just from the filming to now release.

84
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.170
I sold the movie a year ago at the Tribeca film festival,

85
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.160
not the one that just happened,
but a year back.
And now finally it'll be out.

86
00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:18.250
So some time has passed in there.
It hasn't changed in the last year.

87
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:22.600
It's just been sitting there waiting to show it to people.
But the writing took,

88
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.140
I don't know if it took on and off about a year,
nine months or I dunno.

89
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.013
Something like that.

90
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.340
And what do you think you've learned about yourself in the process of making

91
00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:38.050
this film?
Well,
a few things.
Standup doesn't teach you how to work with others.

92
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.040
It really teaches you vigilance and self-reliance.

93
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.450
Um,
fear just,
you know,

94
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.810
you're in a live show situation,
any sudden movement,

95
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.010
it's a very primordial experience.
You're like,
that's a threat like this,

96
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.650
this guy's coming up.
No,
he has to pay.
Okay,
cool.
He's fine.
So you're,

97
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.850
it's a very self contained,

98
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:03.500
often solitary experience traveling on basically like a traveling salesman.

99
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:07.640
I just go to a city and do the show,
get back in the rental car,

100
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:09.440
return it the next morning at the airport,
go to the next city,

101
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.160
etc. Making a movie taught me a lot about how I work with others.

102
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.940
And um,
I found some great collaborators,
which is wonderful.

103
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.580
My DP was great,

104
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.110
my art director and loved the cast.
I,
you know,

105
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.300
I got to cast the movie so I got time to really pick people and I thought a lot

106
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:29.210
about what my day to day life would be like making the movie,

107
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:31.670
not just the end product that I wanted,
but process.

108
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.910
I'm sure many of you have encountered this and your work.

109
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.860
Just how important processes.

110
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:41.780
I just want to like what I'm doing and not chase achievements so much,

111
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:46.070
but ideally have them be maybe the byproduct of a process that I enjoy.

112
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.613
Um,

113
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.510
so I dunno what I learned specifically about myself there other than I,

114
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.570
I learned that how much I do like working with other people and having

115
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:59.180
colleagues,
which I don't usually have as a comedian.

116
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.540
I like the freedom of being a comedian,
but as I'm getting a little older,

117
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:05.630
it's nice eating lunch with other people and having you know,

118
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.870
conversations during the day rather than just walking around a city like a

119
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:11.750
drifter and listening to my iPod or whatever.

120
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.800
The other thing I learned was I got to see my nose from every angle and we it,

121
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.670
this was a difficult experience.
I mean I know what I look like,
but man,

122
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.150
it's nice to write and direct and star in your own thing.
But man,

123
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.220
you get what you asked for it.

124
00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:28.070
Cause I'm sitting there in the edit for months just like,
well yeah,
okay,

125
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.250
let's use that.
That's the best take over.
I'll get over it,
I'll get over myself.

126
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.910
The world knows what I look like.
I just wasn't quite aware of.
But now

127
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.750
it's tough doing stand up and prepping for that.

128
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.280
Is your writing routine or method just walking around and just waiting for ideas

129
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:47.720
to come?
Yeah,
I did most of my standup in New York when I started.

130
00:07:47.721 --> 00:07:50.060
I started in New York and I lived there for 14 years.

131
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.080
So most of my writing process was walking around the city,

132
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.180
hopping on the train,
going into a coffee shop,
always with a notebook,

133
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.300
drawing,
writing,
daydreaming.

134
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:07.630
I learned along the way to be less critical of my self as I was generating

135
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:13.211
material and I've developed a tolerance for how shitty a lot of this stuff I

136
00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:15.080
come up with is.

137
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.130
Whereas I think early on I was discouraged because I would write a joke and be

138
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:21.890
like,
that's stupid.
It's not original,
it's whatever.

139
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.070
And then over time I was like,
you know what?

140
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.050
I think it's important to write those down.
Don't worry about it.

141
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.790
Just generate the content and hopefully in quantity I might find quality and I

142
00:08:32.791 --> 00:08:34.940
have found that for me mostly to be the case,

143
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:37.700
I have to sift through a lot of stuff,
but when I go to make a project,

144
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.560
I looked through my notebooks.
I have a lot of,

145
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.610
I'm not from over the years and I can just look through and find,
you know,

146
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.380
I wrote that as a joke idea.
It didn't work as a standup joke,

147
00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:48.380
but that's actually might be a piece of dialogue for a character to say.

148
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.730
And this single panel drawing could actually be a character for an animated film

149
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.400
idea.
Or here's short story I hadn't thought of,

150
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:58.720
but this one joke suggests to me,
you know,
I,

151
00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.400
you look at your old stuff and I don't remember something that I wrote in a

152
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:04.410
notebook on a random day in 2005.

153
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.220
So I get to rediscover some of the old ideas.
Um,

154
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.130
so that's always been a part of the process for me.
I moved to California,

155
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:12.120
I live in a canyon,

156
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.080
we don't have sidewalks but want to go for a walk and we get hit by a car

157
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:17.730
probably.
So that's not going to help my process.

158
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:20.760
So I gotta figure out a way to walk.

159
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.630
Cause I think kinesthetically for me it actually helps me to generate ideas

160
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.960
sitting in one place and just a white room would probably not help me so much.

161
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.380
That to me leads to analysis.

162
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:39.460
Self analysis dovetails nicely into some self hatred and then you have a month

163
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.640
off to the races.
There,
so I don't,
I don't do that.
Um,

164
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.440
so I've got a treadmill desk and I have a treadmill desk and like a little shed

165
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:51.441
in my backyard and I just get on there when I'm home in the morning and I will,

166
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.240
I,
it's like I have weird vitamins I have to take,

167
00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:56.880
like I have to write a page of jokes.
If I want to do a new stand up special,

168
00:09:56.881 --> 00:09:58.380
which I'm going to do,
I have to write.

169
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.270
So just open up a word document and just put the date.
And when I,

170
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.480
and I just write jokes until I get to the bottom and then I kind of put that in

171
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:11.130
a folder and work on whatever script I'm trying to write or a comedy essay or

172
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:13.850
whatever,
do my email and all that stuff.
And it's,

173
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:18.950
it turned out to be a wonderful metaphor for Hollywood because I'm just going

174
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:21.090
nowhere.
I'm just walking

175
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.940
<v 2>literally on a treadmill just trying to write my movies that nobody's asking for</v>

176
00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:29.510
it.
That's good.
That's perfect.
Yeah.
Nice.

177
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:35.090
Going back to early days.
So I,
in my thorough research for this talk,

178
00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.520
um,
you were in law school.
Yeah.

179
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:42.550
And then full rides for law school and then on the second out of three years,

180
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.910
yeah.
You were like no Mohs,
correct.
Comedy time.
Yes.

181
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:50.660
<v 0>I went right to law school out of college and I had a scholarship,</v>

182
00:10:50.661 --> 00:10:55.010
which was nice.
So I didn't have to accrue debt.
Um,

183
00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.260
can I accrue,
is that,
am I using that word or does it accrue itself?
Whatever.
Wow.

184
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.130
I didn't have debt.
That's how

185
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:07.730
my vocabulary is shrinking as I get further into comedy.
So,

186
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.600
um,
I thought I would be a public interest lawyer.

187
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.840
And then shortly after getting into law school,

188
00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:18.500
I just realized that I don't care enough about other people.

189
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.580
I'm just a snapchat might be true,
but,

190
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.850
but it's more that I just wasn't suited for law and I'm not that thorough
person.

191
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.810
And I think I found when I was in law school would seem to require a lot of

192
00:11:29.811 --> 00:11:32.060
thoroughness.
Hmm.
Um,
I,

193
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.920
I write short jokes and I don't think that's by mistake.
I,

194
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.010
once I get a punchline or too off the topic,
I'm kind of spent,
you know,

195
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.390
so I moved to the next one.
So to do legal research and all that,

196
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.480
let alone have somebody's financial future or freedom in my hands,

197
00:11:49.731 --> 00:11:51.500
it was like I'm not suited for that.

198
00:11:51.501 --> 00:11:56.350
So like I'm the class clown growing up or was comedy the natural choice?

199
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.910
No,
I wasn't the class clown,
but I've got a friend,

200
00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.380
I think I got last with my friends.

201
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:02.770
My Dad was a really funny person so it was around someone who was funny.

202
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.090
But then in law school I became kind of the class clown and that was a bad sign

203
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:11.370
because
how are you doing?
So,

204
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.380
um,
okay.
Just doing crowd work for the people.

205
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.780
The other campuses.
A couple of people entered the room.
Yes.

206
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.850
But then in law school I think I was trying to be funny cause I was,

207
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:27.700
it was like a mismatch and I was just trying to break out of it or something.

208
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:32.710
And what was your first sound upset?
Like my first set I did,
uh,

209
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:36.160
I think about six minutes and I did 12 jokes.

210
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.530
Could bless you.
Somebody sneezed that was not,
could Jesus,

211
00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.540
it's not like a religious moment.

212
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.700
Bless you for asking that question about my past.
Yeah,

213
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.090
I did 12 jokes and about six of them worked.
It was thrilled.
Yeah,
I was,

214
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.240
I was totally psyched.
And then,
then I did,
actually,

215
00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:59.290
I had booked it so that I did stand up on a Monday night at this open mic was my

216
00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:00.610
first thing in a comedy club.

217
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.040
And the second night was the very next night Tuesday in a bar called the Ye olde

218
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:12.280
triple in,
in Manhattan.
It was on 55th street.
It was a small comedy show there.

219
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:14.080
So I did the second night right after.

220
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.850
So I figured when a bomb the first night I'll pick myself back up and I'll try

221
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:22.480
again the next night so I can just kind of get this over with and feel what it's

222
00:13:22.481 --> 00:13:25.360
like to bomb.
The first night went really well.

223
00:13:25.361 --> 00:13:28.540
So now I was excited because it was a great eye.
I,

224
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:33.790
this material works and I had more confidence and I was doing the same
materials,

225
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:35.740
so I thought,
so be good.

226
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.570
And then I went the second night and just died.
I mean,
nothing.

227
00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:44.890
I got no last with the same set.
It just bombed.
It was really tough.

228
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.460
I remember the first night I got into bed after my said I got home and I

229
00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:52.000
couldn't sleep.
I was so excited.
I was like,
I'm a comedian.
I'm like,
you know,

230
00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:53.560
I'm going to be a comedian.
This is going to happen.

231
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.350
And then the next night I couldn't sleep,
but for a different reason.

232
00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:59.380
I just like devastated.
I was like,
I don't understand.

233
00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:01.780
Like I thought those jokes were funny,
you know?

234
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:06.410
I learned quickly just how unpredictable it is and every audience is different.

235
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.120
Yeah.
It's setting time.
You're following somebody dirty.

236
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.240
There was something happened.
Someone's in a bad mood.

237
00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:16.870
There just aren't that many good laughers I like,
Oh,
I love comedy,

238
00:14:16.871 --> 00:14:21.180
but I'm not a good laugh for,
I realize it now are bad audience from you.

239
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.380
It would be just a bunch of people like me.

240
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.870
We're having a good time and they like it,

241
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:30.720
but they just smile cause he's a comedian.
You're like,
I'm dying.
You know,

242
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.450
that's how I am.
I just spoke and I'm like,
Oh yeah,
that's a good idea.

243
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.390
Like that asshole.
Like give me something smiling,
laughing.

244
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.810
So you learn a lot after,
you know,
I'm 20 years into it,

245
00:14:40.811 --> 00:14:45.270
so I've been in front of lots of different crowds now.
So it's good exposures.

246
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.910
It's helpful.
But is that the advice you would give yourself if you can?

247
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.720
If I could go back.
Yeah.
I would um,

248
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:57.350
write things down and record yourself if you want to get better,

249
00:14:57.351 --> 00:14:59.900
record yourself and listen to and,

250
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:03.890
or watch yourself as painful as it is because I think you can get better,
faster.

251
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:08.660
I think it's,
there's something very unhealthy about it.
Um,
I'm selling myself.

252
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.890
I try not to do material about myself because I just don't think people want to

253
00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:15.470
hear it.
And I,
you know,
it's just too self involved.

254
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:19.100
So that's why I think I liked doing jokes about objects and,
you know,

255
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.270
observational stuff.

256
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.300
But I'm trying to learn how to share more personal stuff at the same like I love

257
00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:27.770
Richard Pryor.
I mean Richard Pryor talks about himself,
you know,
I'm all ears.

258
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.540
It's just you've got gotta be interesting enough I guess.

259
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.420
What do you love most about doing standup?

260
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.780
I think creatively,

261
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:41.230
it's really challenging and I so far have not gotten bored of it and there's so

262
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:45.230
much freedom.
I think these days,

263
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:50.540
some of that freedom is qualified because you have to be careful about what you

264
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:54.410
say.
I'm not particularly edgy,
but um,
as Comedians,
you know,

265
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:56.240
we use audiences,
they help us.

266
00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.650
The audience guides you and they teach you if you're on the right track or not.

267
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.830
They guide you so you need an audience.

268
00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:05.990
And sometimes you might see something inappropriate or over the line,

269
00:16:05.991 --> 00:16:09.650
but you just,
it's like you're drawing or sketching with people there.

270
00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.660
It's like they're kind of the notebook in a sense.

271
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:16.730
But that's still as difficult as that is these days in our internet culture.

272
00:16:16.731 --> 00:16:19.880
I still think there's so much creative freedom there and stand up.

273
00:16:19.881 --> 00:16:24.200
It's really cool and it's,
you know,
it's a great job to have.

274
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.330
Um,
so yeah,
I still love it and you know,

275
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.350
I want to do stand up for as long as I can.
Yeah.
When you were for me,

276
00:16:30.351 --> 00:16:33.420
I think if you really believe in yourself and believe you can achieve something,

277
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.710
oftentimes you can.
And when you were first starting and you're like,

278
00:16:36.711 --> 00:16:38.830
what was your inner dialogue where like I can do this,
I'm going to,

279
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.700
I'm going to make it.
When I was first starting as Dorky as it might sound,

280
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.110
so I was,
I was broke.

281
00:16:45.111 --> 00:16:49.970
So luckily I didn't have law school debt but I had zero so I wasn't negative

282
00:16:49.971 --> 00:16:52.700
anything,
but I was pretty much at zero for money.

283
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.130
So I got temp jobs and um,
I trained to be a proofreader.

284
00:16:58.131 --> 00:17:00.920
I did that for awhile and like law firms and financial printers,

285
00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:02.420
I would just proofread documents,
you know,

286
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.330
paid a decent hourly rate and I would write jokes.

287
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.420
Proofreading worked out nicely for me because I didn't have to answer phones or

288
00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:09.171
interact with people.

289
00:17:09.171 --> 00:17:12.740
I just had to correct documents and I had a notebook next to me and I could

290
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:15.380
write down joke ideas and it's still kind of daydream while I was doing was kind

291
00:17:15.381 --> 00:17:19.580
of mindless.
Um,
I think,

292
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.720
shit,
I've forgotten the question.
So was it,
what was it,
what'd you say again?

293
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.950
What was the question was,
what did I tell myself?
Because I was like,

294
00:17:27.951 --> 00:17:29.780
wait the time travel thing.

295
00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:32.090
But I already answered that in my time traveling in my own head.

296
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.030
Now what I was going to say was doing those jobs,

297
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:40.210
I got a library card in New York Public Library card and I just,

298
00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:41.930
I had this commute.

299
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.350
I was living in the Bronx at the time and I was temping often downtown in

300
00:17:45.351 --> 00:17:46.184
Manhattan.

301
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.730
So I was riding the train for sometimes three hours a day,

302
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.300
depending on what time I went home.
It was just a long,

303
00:17:54.301 --> 00:17:57.180
the train went local for half the ride because it was way up there.

304
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.140
But the library card saved me.
I couldn't afford to buy a lot of books,

305
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:06.210
but I could take him out of the library.
So,
and this is 97.

306
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.830
I was reading like four books a week cause I was just reading for hours everyday

307
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:15.630
on the train and comedy books or just know I was reading Abraham Maslow,

308
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.840
I remember it was a big book for me is that the further reaches of human growth

309
00:18:18.841 --> 00:18:21.900
I think it's or human experience can't remember but was just about the pyramid

310
00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:26.160
of needs like self actualization theory and stuff.
I read um,

311
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.320
the transcendentalist I went back and read,

312
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.270
I remember liking that stuff in school.

313
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.110
It was like in some ways some of the first self help books.

314
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.130
And then I did read self help books too.
Mostly nonfiction.

315
00:18:38.131 --> 00:18:40.860
I wasn't really reading literature novels or anything.

316
00:18:40.861 --> 00:18:44.910
I think it was trying to pump myself up and I made a little notebook and I would

317
00:18:44.911 --> 00:18:47.670
photocopy pages that had things that I liked,

318
00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:50.850
passages that I like and I take the photocopies and cut them out and paste them

319
00:18:50.851 --> 00:18:52.590
into this little notebook that I would carry.

320
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.460
And they were really inspiring quotes and that helped me a lot.

321
00:18:56.461 --> 00:18:58.260
It's really a dorky answer but it's the truth.

322
00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:03.030
And this made me feel like I was on some sort of quest and that,

323
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.880
you know,
I did have a dream and I was going to pursue it.

324
00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:11.230
But you share that with other standup comedians with,
what's that notebook?

325
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.310
I don't think so.
I'm trying to,
yeah,

326
00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:16.410
I think there were a couple of people probably I talked about it with you.

327
00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:20.220
I became closer with but I remember one time I was at um,

328
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.530
Caroline's comedy club in Manhattan near Times Square.

329
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.020
This is a couple of years into it.

330
00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:31.680
So I was getting spots and decent clubs and I was backstage,

331
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:34.040
I had a long board at the time and used to skateboard everywhere around

332
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.580
Manhattan.
It was a big skater when I was in middle school and high school.
Yeah,

333
00:19:36.581 --> 00:19:38.760
I had the half pipe in my backyard that I built with my friends.

334
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:41.010
I love skateboarding and I was okay.

335
00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.940
I thought I was good at it but it didn't pan out for me.
That's not my calling.

336
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.620
But,
um,
but I skated a lot.
So when I got to New York I got a,

337
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.850
I got a long board cause it's more stable.

338
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:54.930
It's like easier as a kind of commuter board and I couldn't afford cabs so you

339
00:19:54.931 --> 00:19:57.960
can take the subway north and south but it's hard to go across town.

340
00:19:57.961 --> 00:20:01.230
So when I went from spot to spot I would skateboard anywhere.
So anyway,
I skated,

341
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.300
I had the skateboard that night.

342
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:07.310
I'm backstage at Caroline's and some older comics came in and it might've been

343
00:20:07.321 --> 00:20:10.080
like Mark Marin and Jim Norton.
I think Jim Norton was one of them.

344
00:20:10.081 --> 00:20:13.540
You guys might not know these,
you probably know Marin.
You might know Jim too.

345
00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.790
Jim is actually quite successful.

346
00:20:14.791 --> 00:20:16.620
But in the comedy world these guys are very successful.

347
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.970
At the time they weren't like big successes but they were ahead of me and they

348
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:22.710
were like my elders in a sense.

349
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:28.550
And there's like a real kind of tough guy vibe in New York at that time.

350
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.670
Tough crowd with Colin Quinn was based on some of that scene that was at the

351
00:20:32.671 --> 00:20:35.040
comedy cellar.
And I call it like tough guy comedy.

352
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.940
Suddenly I'm backstage and these guys come backstage and another comic and I had

353
00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:40.260
a book with me,
which was

354
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.910
something like how to read poetry and fall in love with it.

355
00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.130
I taken out of the library,

356
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:53.170
so I'm back there reading this book and I've got my skateboard and I just got

357
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.390
crucified by these guys.
You know?

358
00:20:55.770 --> 00:21:00.730
It was just so I was like not inclined to share a lot of my,

359
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.400
my personal sensitive,
my,
yeah,

360
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:05.920
my personal educational pursuits with people,

361
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.160
but for me comedy felt like art.

362
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.940
I read a fair number of books about painting because I remember thinking,

363
00:21:12.941 --> 00:21:14.980
you know,
are comedians are kind of like artists.

364
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.190
Each has his or her own style.

365
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.600
You can be part of a community but you don't usually paint with another person.

366
00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:24.370
You don't do the painting together.
It's happened,

367
00:21:24.371 --> 00:21:27.700
but most people just paint alone.
That's what skateboarding was like.

368
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:32.170
I skated with my friends.
You develop your tricks,
he's developing his tricks,

369
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.020
you skate together,
but we don't do the trick together.

370
00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:38.410
I'm on my own course and I'm developing my own repertoire.

371
00:21:38.411 --> 00:21:41.860
And that's how standup feels.
So you're together and you share this experience,

372
00:21:41.861 --> 00:21:45.160
but,
but it's ultimately your own,
so it's private.

373
00:21:45.161 --> 00:21:46.840
So that's why the reading was helpful to me.

374
00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.950
<v 2>Yeah.
And within the comedy cellar,
would the other comedians,
um,</v>

375
00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.490
where they be like,
would they give you advice?
Are the ones that you respected,

376
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:55.870
would you seek advice from them?

377
00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.300
<v 0>Yeah,
sometimes.
Um,
anything that stuck with you,</v>

378
00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:03.450
Liz Winstead I was an intern at the daily show.
Um,

379
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.170
when Craig Kilborn was the host.
So this was early on,

380
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.520
around the time I was temping,

381
00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:11.150
I got this job in the audience department of the daily show.

382
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:14.480
Liz was the head writer and cocreator or the daily show,
the original one,

383
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:19.880
excuse me.
I asked her for advice once and she said,
you know,

384
00:22:19.881 --> 00:22:22.130
you can't please everybody.
It was simple.
She was like,
you can't,

385
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.280
you'll never make everybody laugh,
so don't worry about that.

386
00:22:25.281 --> 00:22:29.940
Don't try to do that.
Just find your people.
I thought that was really helpful.
Um,

387
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.390
I'm trying to think of other things.
I don't know.

388
00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.520
I can't remember specific things,
but I do remember certain people,

389
00:22:34.521 --> 00:22:37.190
like Greg Geraldo was,
was really nice to me.

390
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.310
He had gone to law school also,

391
00:22:40.311 --> 00:22:43.240
and I think he practiced before it became convenient.
So we had that in common,

392
00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.780
just the law school experience.

393
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.970
So there were certain comedians who were very,
um,

394
00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.960
I don't know if mentoring is the word or like avuncular,
but they were nice.

395
00:22:53.961 --> 00:22:57.470
They were welcoming,
whereas many were just kinda like,
Oh,

396
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.780
who's this asshole with the backpack?
You know,
that's kind of the vibe you get.

397
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:02.080
Huh.

398
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.570
<v 2>And then if you could do,
uh,
any,</v>

399
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.080
any career that didn't involve comedy and also money doesn't matter in this

400
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.110
scenario,
what would you want to pursue?

401
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:17.550
<v 0>So I can do any career in my,
you're a trillionaire,
so Julian or,
okay.</v>

402
00:23:17.551 --> 00:23:20.880
Shit.
That's definitely fucked up.
My moral fiber.

403
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.730
Now what job do I do that doesn't get a laugh to Google?
MMM,

404
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.580
mmm.

405
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.000
I really like drawing and painting and I'm not very good at it,

406
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:37.200
but I really enjoy it.

407
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.680
So I think I'd be a trillionaire painter who base gigantic works and he just has

408
00:23:43.851 --> 00:23:45.740
his own warehouse that doesn't,

409
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.250
I wouldn't have to worry about selling them at that level.

410
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.550
Our materials would be quite expensive for the kind of stuff I'd want to be

411
00:23:52.551 --> 00:23:56.790
doing.
But um,
yeah,
but I'm a Chilean or you know what I mean?
I,

412
00:23:56.791 --> 00:24:01.250
I have my own island and it's,
it's like an art island,
you know?
And when I die,

413
00:24:01.251 --> 00:24:05.420
it's like a weird installation.
They're all paintings with my money,

414
00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:09.400
just stacks of money.
Um,

415
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.650
probably something in the visual arts I like.
Yeah,

416
00:24:12.651 --> 00:24:16.970
I like drawing and painting a lot.
Um,
again,
I'm,
you know,

417
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.190
I'm not self deprecating,
I just,
I,

418
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:23.720
I've seen the work of great painters and mine is not that work,
but I do like it.

419
00:24:23.721 --> 00:24:25.400
I really enjoy doing it.
So,

420
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.710
so that's kind of a perfect fit if I had a lot of money,

421
00:24:27.711 --> 00:24:31.250
because when I'm painting,
I feel like I have a flow experience.

422
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.290
If you guys are familiar with that term,
the book by Mohali,

423
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:42.370
anybody knows how to say his last name says that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Um,

424
00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.960
I've read that book years ago when I was first starting comedy,
um,

425
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:52.030
I thought it was a great book and that kind of was a nice companion piece to the

426
00:24:52.701 --> 00:24:57.350
Maslow stuff because it talks about peak experiences and flow experiences and

427
00:24:57.351 --> 00:24:59.510
flow being it just is coming out.
Yeah.

428
00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:03.470
The idea from what I remember was flux readings of certain characteristics.

429
00:25:03.471 --> 00:25:08.471
One of them is you have a discernible goal and you then can achieve it and on

430
00:25:10.281 --> 00:25:11.630
the way to achieving it,

431
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:16.190
you lose track of time because you're so immersed in what you're doing and

432
00:25:16.191 --> 00:25:20.780
hopefully what you're doing is also using your particular bundle of talents and

433
00:25:20.781 --> 00:25:24.860
abilities well enough that you're fully engaged.
Um,

434
00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.130
from what I remember in the book,
he talks about the difference between,

435
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.860
God bless you,
pleasure and enjoyment,

436
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.330
pleasure being like eating some cake or I dunno,

437
00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.200
having sex or something like that's,
it just feels great while it's happening.

438
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:45.350
But you're not,
you haven't necessarily grown or felt,
am I saying that right?

439
00:25:45.351 --> 00:25:45.700
Do you remember?

440
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:50.480
This is not necessarily a feeling of like growth or development at the end of
it,

441
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:55.520
whereas enjoyment had in his description,

442
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:59.060
it did have that feeling.
Mountain climbing was an example.

443
00:25:59.061 --> 00:26:01.700
I remember from the book,
if you interviewed someone who's climbing a mountain,

444
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:05.120
like as you're hanging on the side of it and their fingers are digging into the

445
00:26:05.121 --> 00:26:08.750
Rock,
you having fun,
I'd be like,
no,
I'm going to fucking die and leave me alone.

446
00:26:08.751 --> 00:26:11.630
I got to do this.
But then when they get to the next level,

447
00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:15.350
there's a feeling of enjoyment.
They're totally engaged.
It was difficult,

448
00:26:15.351 --> 00:26:17.000
but yet there's feeling of enjoyment,

449
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.750
which is different than just like kind of blogging on your couch and eating ice

450
00:26:20.751 --> 00:26:24.890
cream,
farting quietly under a blanket.
You know?
That can be fun,

451
00:26:24.891 --> 00:26:28.520
but that's not necessarily a growth extent.
Quietly,
he says,
yeah,

452
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:30.913
that's interesting.

453
00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.070
Do you feel that that you enter a state of flow when you're on stage?

454
00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.370
Occasionally if I'm in the right mood,
not always.
Yeah.

455
00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.450
Sometimes it feels like work,
but yeah,
I try to write a lot more onstage now.

456
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.920
I tried to improvise more and be more and that makes it more fun.

457
00:26:44.921 --> 00:26:49.850
Is that ever a part of your no,
I never did improv.
Yeah.
I never did that and I,

458
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.720
they never did sketch comedy or any of that stuff,

459
00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:54.870
so it was just stand up for me.
But now,
yeah,
you know,

460
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:58.590
some years into it I I feel comfortable enough to improvise and do crowd work

461
00:26:58.591 --> 00:27:01.230
and stuff.
So yeah,
it gives me a better chance at that.
But if I don't do that,

462
00:27:01.231 --> 00:27:03.810
then I kind of just,
it's just more like a presentation now.
It's just like,

463
00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.000
here are my jokes.
Right.
Cool.

464
00:27:06.001 --> 00:27:08.490
I've got one more question and then we'll pass the mic around.

465
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:12.100
So if you guys had anything,
just raise your hand and will chaga tea you.
Um,

466
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:16.620
so now that you've done dean and it was great and it's a success,

467
00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:18.020
do you want to make more?
Yeah,

468
00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:24.590
<v 2>it was great.
It's cool cause it hasn't come out yet,
but I'm with you.
I'm like,</v>

469
00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.780
I'm going to count it as a success and just like ignore whatever.

470
00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.790
How's the movie?
It's a success.
Don't worry about it.
I get it and it's done.
Okay.

471
00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:36.220
It's a movie.
Just watch it and shut up.
I do feel excited that I got to,

472
00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:36.270
you got to

473
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.990
<v 0>make one.
It was hard,
you know.
But is it another one?</v>

474
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.660
I want to make another one.
Yeah.

475
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:47.250
I outlined a movie last summer and then I realized that I,
if I,

476
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.980
even if I got the money for it,
I don't think I'm good enough yet to make it,

477
00:27:49.981 --> 00:27:52.740
cause it would take place in like another dimension and all this stuff.
I'm like,

478
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:55.830
you know what,
it's going to be too hard.
So I put it aside,

479
00:27:55.831 --> 00:27:58.340
but I have the whole thing outlined,
which is nice.
So I know what,

480
00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.780
how the story works.
And then I,

481
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.410
I started a different one after that that I thought I could make if this did

482
00:28:04.411 --> 00:28:07.220
well enough that I got a little bit more money.
Um,

483
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.130
so that's what I'm working on right now.
And the other two films,
yes.

484
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.910
But my goal is not to go starring in all my movies,

485
00:28:14.911 --> 00:28:18.510
but right now I'm still trying to figure out how I make movies and tell stories.

486
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:22.740
And I have to say there is a nice degree of control in that because I get to

487
00:28:22.741 --> 00:28:26.220
write the movie at home when I'm writing it on my computer.

488
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.430
And then as they say,
you write it three times when you write it,

489
00:28:29.431 --> 00:28:32.940
when you shoot it,
when you edit it,
and if you're acting in it,

490
00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:35.280
then you have even more freedom to change.

491
00:28:35.281 --> 00:28:39.060
So when I'm in the scenes I can feel what's happening and I get to rewrite as

492
00:28:39.061 --> 00:28:42.930
I'm doing it.
Um,
and then in the edit it's nice to have the controls,

493
00:28:42.931 --> 00:28:47.790
the director cause I can reshape it and try different things.
Yeah.
So yeah,

494
00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:48.630
I want it for now,
but,

495
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.290
but I'd love to write movies that don't involve me and that I would just get to

496
00:28:52.291 --> 00:28:53.124
direct.

497
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:57.120
One of my goals is to write a movie for a woman and to learn how to get better

498
00:28:57.121 --> 00:29:00.750
at writing parts for women because I'm not that good at it.

499
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.410
I just started and I'm a guy.
Not that you can't write women if you're a guy,

500
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:06.540
but I think there's an arrogance and thinking that you can,

501
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:10.860
I think you have to learn how to do that.
I thought you did a nice job.
Thanks.

502
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.750
I tried.
I mean it's,
it's important to me.

503
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:16.050
I think I'm getting roles for women in Hollywood,

504
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:20.850
especially funny women and older women.
I think it's important.
I think,

505
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.880
I don't think people get worse at acting as they get older once they've had some

506
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:26.580
sort of head accident or something.
But usually they get better.

507
00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:31.560
So there are a lot of great actors who were older who just want some real roles.

508
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:36.390
And needless to say,
women of all ages,
they just get short changed and they get,

509
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.210
Hey,
you beat the girl and go laughed at his jokes,
you know,

510
00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:41.940
and you'd be the ex girlfriend.
You'd be the one who's cheating.
You know?

511
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.460
It's like,
I dunno,
it just would be more satisfying.
And it's,

512
00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.200
it's not even that altruistic.

513
00:29:47.201 --> 00:29:49.660
I think you tell a better story when you give parts to

514
00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:51.743
<v 1>women and</v>

515
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.650
<v 0>people of color and everything.
But it's interesting when you're a single,</v>

516
00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:59.780
I'm not saying,
let me,
when you're a straight white male middle class like me,

517
00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.890
it's like the easiest,
smoothest road there is in this country.
You know?

518
00:30:03.891 --> 00:30:05.360
I don't have to tell you guys this,
this like,

519
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:10.830
so I feel like there is a responsibility if you've had that easier ride to

520
00:30:10.831 --> 00:30:14.670
figure out how to make things that include other people and not just be like,

521
00:30:14.671 --> 00:30:17.970
hey me.
Another story about a white guy in his friends.
You know?

522
00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.800
That's a cool challenge.
It's a challenge.
I think it is a challenge.
Yeah.

523
00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.140
Because I think it's nice to say,
Oh yes,
I want to write parts for it,

524
00:30:24.141 --> 00:30:27.900
but then you have to like learn how to do it.
Yeah,
empathy.

525
00:30:27.901 --> 00:30:30.600
I mean it's all about empathy.
It's about thinking outside of yourself,

526
00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:31.883
which is hard.

527
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:33.950
<v 1>Yeah.
Okay.</v>

528
00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:36.740
<v 0>Now that we're sad,
why don't we,
let's turn it over to the audience.</v>

529
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.520
Go back to work your ass up.
Does anyone have any questions?

530
00:30:39.521 --> 00:30:41.070
Just raise your hand or ask questions.
We come over here guys.

531
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:47.150
<v 3>So you're talking about your first two shows and how the audience completely</v>

532
00:30:47.151 --> 00:30:48.830
changed the feeling of those shows.

533
00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:53.180
If you were in San Francisco versus say Dallas versus some small town in

534
00:30:53.181 --> 00:30:54.170
somewhere.
Yeah.

535
00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.800
How do you shape your material to play to that audience versus that audience

536
00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.030
versus that audience?

537
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.780
<v 0>Couple of things.
Luckily I've,</v>

538
00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:04.910
I've been around long enough that I get my crowd in each city,

539
00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:09.620
so it does normalize it a little bit so the differences aren't as pronounced so

540
00:31:09.621 --> 00:31:11.000
I don't have to change too much.

541
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:15.620
But improvising more and paying attention more to what's happening in the room

542
00:31:15.621 --> 00:31:20.390
has helped me because I can kind of play off of what's happening in the room

543
00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:24.800
enough that it shapes the show.
Um,
I don't like getting heckled.

544
00:31:24.801 --> 00:31:28.460
The one I do that becomes part of the show and I tried to pay attention and so

545
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:33.920
even regional differences aside is the specificity of each evening and the

546
00:31:33.921 --> 00:31:35.810
people in that room shape it,

547
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:39.110
but not that much because I've written jokes and I do like writing materials.

548
00:31:39.111 --> 00:31:43.610
So I have my material I'm going to share with people.
I do in my,

549
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:47.150
in my experience,
find differences in different parts of the country for sure.

550
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:48.783
<v 1>MMM.</v>

551
00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:54.290
<v 0>But like I said,
I get kind of my people in each place.
So it's,
it's,</v>

552
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.390
it was surprising to me.

553
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:57.610
I remember for a while cause I thought it would be a lot different when I

554
00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:00.040
started really touring around.
And then I,

555
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:04.420
even in other countries it was like I ended up like in the Brooklyn of London at

556
00:32:04.421 --> 00:32:05.254
some point.

557
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.680
I felt it like it to me at least without insulting London as if they don't,

558
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.830
they didn't predate Brooklyn,
but my experience was Brooklyn.
So I'm like,
oh,

559
00:32:11.831 --> 00:32:14.590
this feels a little bit like Brooklyn.
People look the same.

560
00:32:14.591 --> 00:32:17.470
If I didn't hear anybody talk,
I could kind of swap people and be like,

561
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:22.200
you walked down union and park slope.
Like you look like that and you,

562
00:32:22.201 --> 00:32:25.070
you're going to go over Williamsburg and to Brixton over here.
Yeah.

563
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:26.103
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

564
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.130
<v 3>How's it going?
Hey.
Um,</v>

565
00:32:32.131 --> 00:32:36.200
so obviously stand up falls in the category of public speaking.
Um,

566
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:39.560
so I was wondering what type of advice would you give someone who might not

567
00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:43.070
necessarily be interested in stand up but is interested in like public speaking

568
00:32:43.071 --> 00:32:46.400
and different avenues?
Um,
in terms of like dealing with nerves,

569
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:50.450
because obviously like we've all heard the age old trick of picturing everyone

570
00:32:50.451 --> 00:32:53.300
in your underwear,
but who wants to actually do that?

571
00:32:53.301 --> 00:32:57.650
So like what other types of advice have you either heard or found useful for

572
00:32:57.651 --> 00:33:00.050
yourself?
Um,
that you can maybe pass on to us?

573
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.260
<v 0>Yeah,
this is for me an interesting question.
Let me think about this.</v>

574
00:33:03.261 --> 00:33:07.640
So like I said,
my,
I think I said my dad was a priest.
So when I was growing up,

575
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:13.180
I got to see my dad give a sermon every Sunday and he just had like an envelope

576
00:33:14.151 --> 00:33:17.300
with just like a word or two on it and then he would just speak
extemporaneously.

577
00:33:17.301 --> 00:33:19.370
So I grew up thinking that's just like something you do.

578
00:33:19.371 --> 00:33:22.880
I saw my dad do it and he kinda did 20 minutes every Sunday and we'd get laughs

579
00:33:22.881 --> 00:33:25.700
and stuff.
And it just seemed natural to me.

580
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:30.020
So I did pick a good job for me cause I,
I'm fine with public speaking.

581
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.280
I never got nervous doing it.

582
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:34.940
But I've thought about a lot about it over the years is I read about how it's

583
00:33:34.941 --> 00:33:37.730
like one of the top two fears people have.

584
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.870
It's like death or Publix,
whatever it was.
It was like,
it's up there.

585
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.190
And you know,
I,
I think about it,

586
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:50.120
I mean personally I'm not sure what the best techniques are,

587
00:33:50.121 --> 00:33:53.540
but I walk the room and see,
she was like,
this guy's not a good public speaker.

588
00:33:53.541 --> 00:33:58.250
I'm out of here.
What's good about this room and the door?
It's like a ref.

589
00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.820
It's got a gasket on it or something.
It's like a refrigerator doors.

590
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.540
She's smart.
She's going while I'm talking about us,

591
00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:10.070
I know people at Google are smart,
you know?
Oh,

592
00:34:10.071 --> 00:34:14.060
you're going to get ask a question.
I say even smarter than,
I mean,
yeah.
So,

593
00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:15.813
um,

594
00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:22.780
I have found that failing is one of the best things developmentally of all in my

595
00:34:24.051 --> 00:34:25.910
experience.
Because when I,
before I started,

596
00:34:25.911 --> 00:34:30.911
I was afraid of bombing and I did Bob and I still do occasionally and I

597
00:34:31.251 --> 00:34:36.020
certainly bombed plenty,
but then you bomb and nobody cares.

598
00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:41.780
It's,
it's amazing how much,
how little people care about you

599
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:46.580
or me.
Do you know what I mean?
It's just incredible to me.
I saw a friend,

600
00:34:46.581 --> 00:34:51.560
ones have a bad set on Letterman and I felt for him and I thought,
oh my God,

601
00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:56.690
like it didn't go well and I realized nobody cares.
Like it's like he,

602
00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:00.740
maybe he cares.
I'm sure he cares.
His girlfriend,
if you have one at the time,

603
00:35:00.741 --> 00:35:02.330
maybe his mom,
if she watched,
I don't know.

604
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.700
Like you're literally talking single digit numbers,

605
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:09.730
people who care and now I've come to a point where there's so much content that

606
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.970
for any of it to be remembered for even,
I don't know,
10 years,

607
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.930
maybe 50 years,
it has to be extremely,

608
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:25.310
exceptionally great or exceptionally horrendous.

609
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:28.670
Like I feel like you're at those little ends of the bell curve.

610
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.580
Everything else is in the middle and completely vanishes.

611
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:35.420
I'm under no illusions that what I'm saying right now.
It doesn't fucking matter.

612
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:40.580
This is gone.
So it's like,
I dunno if that would take the pressure off,

613
00:35:40.581 --> 00:35:43.580
but I do.
I don't think that's hyperbole.
I think that's just the truth.

614
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:48.440
So I dunno,
when you shrink that down out to public speaking in some room,

615
00:35:48.441 --> 00:35:51.770
it's just like,
all right,
I hope people are entertained while it's happening.

616
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:56.020
You know,
you do your best,
but just seems like it just vanishes.
God,

617
00:35:56.021 --> 00:36:00.910
I'm feeling really dark.
So what was the talk like?
I think he was a comedian.

618
00:36:00.911 --> 00:36:03.280
He seems sad to me.
Didn't he make a movie?

619
00:36:03.281 --> 00:36:05.890
You should be happy with something about the universe is pointless.

620
00:36:05.891 --> 00:36:10.891
And I guess there's No God if he just listened to his talk is certainly no god

621
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:16.080
present
entries.
Well,
it's not quite polished.

622
00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:17.910
That other thing you did.
I loved their shelf,

623
00:36:17.911 --> 00:36:21.740
your book and I hope I liked the movie too.
We don't know yet.
He said success.

624
00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:27.140
Um,
I wonder where,
where do you get the most inspiration from?

625
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.990
Is that fund,
the treadmill Palm,

626
00:36:28.991 --> 00:36:32.300
like on the low reading a shamble labels,

627
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:36.300
like in the Museum of Modern Art.
Yeah.
Um,

628
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:42.120
I went to the,
I went to the Matisse Diebenkorn thing at,
at Moma SF Moma.

629
00:36:42.121 --> 00:36:44.610
I don't know if it's,
you guys call it Mama Marissa.
That was great.
So I do,

630
00:36:44.611 --> 00:36:46.890
I love going to museums and when I go on the road,
I often,

631
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.280
the first thing I look for us to see what museum is in that city and what's

632
00:36:50.281 --> 00:36:52.260
going on there.
And that's nice.

633
00:36:52.261 --> 00:36:57.261
I find museums are great places to wander and daydream with my notebook and

634
00:36:57.961 --> 00:37:00.840
stuff.
Um,
I've learned over the years for me,

635
00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:05.190
I try to find inspiration wherever I can and I really try to play games.
Um,

636
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:09.420
nothing creepy.
It sounds creepy saying that,
but I'm saying like constraints,

637
00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:11.200
I dunno.
Like for example,
you know,

638
00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:15.420
I like palindromes I think because there's such a challenging constraint when

639
00:37:15.421 --> 00:37:18.810
you try to develop a palindrome the rule that it has to be the same forward and

640
00:37:18.811 --> 00:37:20.710
backwards by letter,
you know,

641
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.580
that kind of palindrome and that hopefully it makes sense.

642
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:27.840
Those two simple rules yields so many difficulties.

643
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:32.790
Um,
but I think it can also yield surprising results.
And you know,

644
00:37:32.791 --> 00:37:36.690
years ago I had made myself learn how to write and draw with my left hand.

645
00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.960
I don't do it very well,
but even that maybe is pointless.

646
00:37:39.961 --> 00:37:44.961
But the mindfulness that it kind of invokes just by doing something difficult

647
00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:53.580
made me feel more perceptive or present in what I was doing and those kinds of

648
00:37:53.581 --> 00:37:55.170
games,
wherever I go,

649
00:37:55.171 --> 00:37:58.500
I can kind of take them with me so that I can find inspiration in different

650
00:37:58.501 --> 00:37:59.490
places.
But sometimes,

651
00:37:59.491 --> 00:38:02.760
like I've done things where I just like bring a dictionary on the plane and just

652
00:38:02.761 --> 00:38:06.540
read the dictionary.
It's seems kind of boring or stupid,
but I,

653
00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.610
I still like paper books,
so that helps me a lot too.

654
00:38:08.611 --> 00:38:09.810
Just to have a thing I can flip through,

655
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.990
but I'll just read it and see if ideas come out of it.
They usually don't,

656
00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:15.720
but I might learn a couple words,
but sometimes something,

657
00:38:15.721 --> 00:38:18.360
or when I first started doing stand up,
if I was in,

658
00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:21.300
it's like some shitty open Mike,
you're waiting to go on.

659
00:38:21.301 --> 00:38:24.150
There's like nine people in the audience.
It's not going to go well.

660
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.120
They're tired.
You're in the basement of a bar.

661
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:30.570
It's like the lower east side at the time.
I would do this one room a lot.

662
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:33.120
And before I go on I'd be standing next to another comic and I say,
Hey,

663
00:38:33.121 --> 00:38:36.130
can you give me a word?
And they would say,
I'm saying,
just tell me a word.

664
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.820
I'd be like toaster or something.
And then I would just add it to my set list.

665
00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:40.990
And then when I was on stage,

666
00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.040
I would make myself do a joke about toasters even though I didn't have one

667
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:48.250
because the stakes were so low.
I'm bombing anyway.

668
00:38:48.251 --> 00:38:50.950
What does it fucking matter if I tell a terrible joke about toasters?

669
00:38:50.951 --> 00:38:55.270
You know what I mean?
So,
um,
yeah.
So I would do things like that and I figured,

670
00:38:55.271 --> 00:38:58.840
hey,
maybe if I do it a hundred times,
maybe two times,

671
00:38:58.841 --> 00:39:01.870
I get good jokes out of that and someone's helped me write a joke.

672
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:05.380
Helped me think of a premise I didn't think of as long as I can tolerate the

673
00:39:05.381 --> 00:39:09.070
other 98 shitty ones that I wrote.
It's like,
to me it's,

674
00:39:09.071 --> 00:39:11.800
it's the kind of game oriented.
And,
and again,

675
00:39:11.801 --> 00:39:16.090
anything that drives me back into the process and not so much towards results

676
00:39:16.091 --> 00:39:20.230
seems to stimulate my creativity a little bit more.
For me personally,

677
00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.550
<v 4>thanks so much for being here.</v>

678
00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:28.850
The last incident was actually really interesting for me because in school I was

679
00:39:28.851 --> 00:39:31.580
the girl who is known for reading the dictionary and being really into

680
00:39:31.581 --> 00:39:34.820
palindromes and trying to write with my left hand.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.

681
00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.940
So that was interesting.
But that's not what my question is about.
Um,

682
00:39:37.941 --> 00:39:42.941
so in between painting a painting or writing a standup set or I'm creating a

683
00:39:44.721 --> 00:39:45.554
movie,

684
00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:49.520
how do those different mediums express different messages that you want to tell

685
00:39:49.521 --> 00:39:50.680
her?
A story that you want to tell?

686
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.921
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

687
00:39:51.921 --> 00:39:56.090
I think this is an interesting question for me too because I think a lot about

688
00:39:56.091 --> 00:39:58.880
this and trying to,
let's say,
um,

689
00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:05.000
rotate the crops or whatever,
like trying to basically just keep my career going.

690
00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:09.380
You know what?
If I can get work doing standup,
that's great,

691
00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.200
but you can't go to every market every year,
so you've got to stop.

692
00:40:12.201 --> 00:40:15.440
So then maybe I can do something else.
Maybe the movie works.
If it doesn't,
okay,

693
00:40:15.441 --> 00:40:17.150
maybe I can get an acting part.
If that doesn't work,

694
00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:20.060
then maybe I can write a book.
And if they don't want my book,
okay,

695
00:40:20.061 --> 00:40:22.340
back to stand up,
but enough time has passed.
I failed for a year,

696
00:40:22.341 --> 00:40:25.890
let's try something else.
So it's made me think a lot about how the,

697
00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.610
the medium can inform the content.

698
00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:32.120
And I think a lot of my favorite things and whatever medium they're presented

699
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:35.990
through,
um,
probably use that medium pretty well.

700
00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:39.620
So that I've seen plays that have worked really nicely as movies,

701
00:40:39.621 --> 00:40:44.300
but it sure would have been great to see it as a play because it was written for

702
00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:49.330
the constraints of the stage and that kind of blocking and being in one place

703
00:40:49.401 --> 00:40:52.550
and in one time.
Whereas a movie that might involve,

704
00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:56.210
involve time travel or lasers and stuff might not work as well on the stage.

705
00:40:56.211 --> 00:40:58.190
Right?
Because you're not getting to take advantage of,

706
00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:00.770
of all those tools at your disposal.

707
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:04.970
And I've found that to be the case with standup,
which is presentational.

708
00:41:04.971 --> 00:41:06.830
You can tell stories and do characters on stage,

709
00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:10.490
but it's still kind of a one person presentation.
Whereas with a movie,

710
00:41:10.491 --> 00:41:13.080
I get to act with other actors and I,

711
00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:17.000
I have music that can come in and I can be tight,
I can be wide,

712
00:41:17.001 --> 00:41:18.200
I can direct your attention.

713
00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:23.200
So in each attempt at generating content for me,

714
00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:28.100
I really tried to think about the medium and how I can maximize what I'm doing

715
00:41:28.101 --> 00:41:31.670
in that medium.
So for example,
in my movie I play an illustrator.
Um,

716
00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.930
I want it to be an illustrator in the movie because I had a giant rectangle that

717
00:41:35.931 --> 00:41:39.110
I could tell a story on and I could show my drawings in ways that I wouldn't

718
00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:41.960
otherwise get to do it.
I show drawings on stage sometimes,

719
00:41:41.961 --> 00:41:45.320
like on an Easel and I've done a book of drawings and that's cool.

720
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:50.450
But to get to put them next to some,
uh,
an image of someone else doing something,

721
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:55.040
now I have a different game I can play here visually,
if that makes sense.

722
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.750
So yeah,
I think a lot about that.

723
00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.110
Or do you generate content and like different kind of ways and stuff?
Yeah.

724
00:42:00.111 --> 00:42:02.590
So maybe you find the same thing where,
um,

725
00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:07.700
I w I sometimes want to force something into one form,
but it doesn't work.

726
00:42:07.701 --> 00:42:10.190
It's just,
it kind of speaks back and says,
Nah,

727
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:13.430
this isn't going to work as a drawing,
so forget it dude.
I'm like,
okay.

728
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:16.940
But once I learned to respect it,
the process more,

729
00:42:16.941 --> 00:42:20.540
I feel like answers started to reveal themselves.

730
00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.300
They don't always work,
but you know.
Yeah.
Thanks.

731
00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:28.110
I can't believe that you do palindromes and all that stuff.
It's a,

732
00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:30.600
<v 1>yeah.
Yeah.</v>

733
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:32.860
<v 0>I might Google though,
right?
Like,
do you guys,</v>

734
00:42:32.861 --> 00:42:36.580
are you have a reputation we holds can kind of say,
yeah,

735
00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:40.150
let me stereotype you all.
Yeah.
Yeah.

736
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:42.043
<v 1>Okay.</v>

737
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:43.950
<v 4>Um,
thanks for coming today.
Uh,</v>

738
00:42:43.951 --> 00:42:47.890
I really liked what you said about you making an effort to write more women

739
00:42:47.891 --> 00:42:51.580
characters.
Uh,
I think that's awesome.
My question is,

740
00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.630
are there any recent films that you really like or movies that are coming out

741
00:42:55.631 --> 00:42:56.464
that you're excited about?

742
00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:01.520
<v 0>Yes.
Um,
I really love Brooklyn.
I don't know if you guys saw that movie.</v>

743
00:43:01.521 --> 00:43:04.010
It's a couple of years old,
but I saw a little bit later,

744
00:43:04.011 --> 00:43:06.530
but my wife and I saw that and that one really stayed with me.

745
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.250
I've been on a Hitchcock kick lately,
so these aren't recent movies,

746
00:43:10.251 --> 00:43:12.980
but I had never seen dial him for murder and that was actually a play that was

747
00:43:12.981 --> 00:43:16.820
adapted into a film.
I really liked that movie.
I like to catch a thief,

748
00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:18.110
which I hadn't seen before,

749
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:22.070
so I'm trying to educate myself going through different directors work now.

750
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:26.420
I watch city lights for the first time,
which is a Charlie Chaplin film,

751
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.700
and I thought that was great.

752
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:34.280
So my answer's going to be probably not as current as I'd like it to be.

753
00:43:34.281 --> 00:43:37.800
I don't know.
I,
I really liked superhero movies.

754
00:43:37.801 --> 00:43:39.150
I wish there were a couple of coming out,

755
00:43:39.151 --> 00:43:42.000
but I feel like there aren't any superhero movies or anything like that kind of

756
00:43:42.001 --> 00:43:42.960
stuff out there these days.

757
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.170
But if they ever make those remakes and superhero movies are probably my

758
00:43:46.171 --> 00:43:46.700
favorites.

759
00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:51.240
Just when I hate her original ideas that are smaller and like personal,

760
00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:55.410
I don't know what's coming out that I'm excited to see.

761
00:43:55.411 --> 00:44:00.260
I'm a little behind on stuff.
Um,
I'm trying to think of what else I love.

762
00:44:00.261 --> 00:44:04.070
You can count on me that that's not so recent either.
But to Kenny Lonergan film,

763
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.890
I want to see Manchester by the sea.
I heard it's really sad.

764
00:44:07.891 --> 00:44:10.590
So I'm trying to figure out when's a good time to do that.

765
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.410
Probably if I'm sad about something else,
if I'm like,
all right,

766
00:44:13.411 --> 00:44:14.101
I'm already bombing.

767
00:44:14.101 --> 00:44:18.580
Like let me just piggyback that rather than ruining a good mood.
So I'm

768
00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.110
working through some stuff here that you guys don't need to hear about it.

769
00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:28.280
<v 1>Yeah.
All right.</v>

770
00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:32.040
<v 0>I just have a quick question about like doing exactly you love for</v>

771
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.880
<v 3>work and at what point you decided that because part of the attraction of going</v>

772
00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:39.840
to law school is almost that you don't need to do what you really like for money

773
00:44:39.841 --> 00:44:44.460
and then compromise the quality of that or money.
And do you ever feel that a,

774
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:48.060
you have to tailor what you're saying to make more money and it's not really

775
00:44:48.061 --> 00:44:52.620
what you want to do or be that it affects what you find funny in the real world

776
00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:55.680
and whether or not you're able to appreciate comedy

777
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:57.690
<v 0>naturally?
Yeah.</v>

778
00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.860
I haven't found a to be the case and be to some degree.
Um,

779
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:05.160
I feel like part of my brain broke a while ago because I've been exposed to too

780
00:45:05.161 --> 00:45:08.130
much comedy and I've been trying to come up with funny things for too long,

781
00:45:08.131 --> 00:45:11.550
so it's just like blown out some sort of wiring in my head.

782
00:45:11.551 --> 00:45:13.770
So now for something to really make me laugh,

783
00:45:13.771 --> 00:45:17.820
someone probably has to get really hurt,
falling off.
It's just terrible.

784
00:45:17.821 --> 00:45:22.020
It's just kind of what happened,
you know?
Um,
but I have,

785
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:24.110
I've thought about this a lot because I,

786
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:26.760
I feel lucky that I got to take something I love doing.

787
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.820
I found a thing I love doing.
So that's a lucky thing.

788
00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:34.440
And then I got to get money for it.

789
00:45:34.441 --> 00:45:38.130
So it became a job.
But the problem is it did become a job.

790
00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:40.320
So it did adulterated a little bit,

791
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:45.630
but now my fantasy is that I somehow gets successful enough that it can become a

792
00:45:45.631 --> 00:45:50.100
hobby so that you can almost go full circle.
So that again,

793
00:45:50.101 --> 00:45:54.180
if I were trip the trillionaire painting as a hobby because I'm not going to get

794
00:45:54.181 --> 00:45:54.871
money from painting,

795
00:45:54.871 --> 00:45:59.130
so that one's kind of pure because of the limits of what I can do with it or I

796
00:45:59.131 --> 00:46:02.100
don't have the energy to pursue it,
whatever.
But comedy,

797
00:46:02.101 --> 00:46:05.580
I've made a job and I'm certainly not the most successful at it,

798
00:46:05.581 --> 00:46:06.840
but I can make a living doing it,

799
00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:11.130
but I do have to think about it as something I'm selling.
Yeah,

800
00:46:11.131 --> 00:46:16.131
it'd be cool to be super successful and then to just do standup for fun in

801
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:20.730
direct markets to go to cities that I like.
I love going to San Francisco.

802
00:46:20.731 --> 00:46:24.480
I love going to Portland.
Chicago is really fun.
I love going back to New York.

803
00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:27.720
You know,
I have my spots where I like to go and however much you guys travel,

804
00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.030
you have your list.
Yeah,
it'd be cool to go to those cities,

805
00:46:30.031 --> 00:46:33.060
do a couple of shows for fun,
go to the museum,

806
00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:37.260
go to a couple of restaurants or whatever.
But I still feel like,
yeah,
I have to,

807
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:41.430
I'm going to shoot a new special in December and I have to work on those jokes

808
00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:45.600
and pump them out and of kind of worry about it where I didn't before,

809
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:47.010
before I did comedy,
I didn't wear it.

810
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:50.130
I just would maybe be funny at this party or not or whatever.

811
00:46:50.131 --> 00:46:54.030
But now it's like I do a show,
people show up,
they got a babysitter,

812
00:46:54.031 --> 00:46:55.830
they're sitting there and I'm like,
shit,

813
00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:59.850
I didn't do this isn't good enough for them.
Fuck they paid to see me.
You know?

814
00:46:59.851 --> 00:47:00.381
So yeah,
it's,

815
00:47:00.381 --> 00:47:05.010
it's like there's a responsibility and then I'm making every answer sad at the

816
00:47:05.011 --> 00:47:07.950
end.
I don't know why.
No,
I think it's because that's how life is.

817
00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.120
<v 4>Okay.
We got one more.
It's,
I'm a little more,
no pressure.</v>

818
00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:18.890
Good.
Um,
what was it like being on set,
like of a movie?

819
00:47:18.891 --> 00:47:23.891
And then also how did you get to know like the actors do you are working with,

820
00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:28.300
but then also get to know them as characters?
And did he find

821
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:32.560
<v 0>that confusing knowing people personally,</v>

822
00:47:32.561 --> 00:47:36.940
but then if they were different in character?
Yeah.
Being on the set was,

823
00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:41.470
it was a mix of excitement,
gratefulness,

824
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.390
a dread,

825
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:48.430
and then fear became more of it because it was such a low budget movie.

826
00:47:48.431 --> 00:47:52.320
I had all these illusions about what I would be doing and how my movie was going

827
00:47:52.321 --> 00:47:54.970
to go.
And then we'd get there and they'd be like,
Oh yeah,

828
00:47:54.971 --> 00:47:57.460
we don't have a location.
Like we're not allowed inside.

829
00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:00.730
What I thought we were going to,
no,
no,
yeah,
we can't go in there.
I'm like,

830
00:48:00.731 --> 00:48:03.660
the actors are getting makeup right now.
What are we going to do?
I don't know.

831
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:05.920
Shit.
So that was like really hard.

832
00:48:05.921 --> 00:48:08.920
The practical parts of it were so hard and they kind of just compounded,

833
00:48:08.921 --> 00:48:10.120
it got so difficult.

834
00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:15.310
And then of course the fear kind of multiplied because I wrote it,
directed,

835
00:48:15.311 --> 00:48:18.490
it started,
hey,
hooray for me now I'm in trouble.
It's all my fault.

836
00:48:18.491 --> 00:48:20.470
I have nobody to blame.
I'm like,
this is going to suck.

837
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.640
I don't want this to be out there.

838
00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.340
So that that took the fun out of it pretty quickly.

839
00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:28.750
But once I kind of settled down,
it was fun to work with.

840
00:48:28.751 --> 00:48:32.070
The other actors I knew Rory Scovel,
he's in my movie,

841
00:48:32.071 --> 00:48:35.230
he's a comedian so I knew him beforehand,
but he auditioned for me,

842
00:48:35.231 --> 00:48:36.064
which was nice.

843
00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:40.360
So I could see how the lines worked and if it would be believable as the

844
00:48:40.361 --> 00:48:44.320
characters I conceived him and then all the other parts of people audition

845
00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:45.880
except for a few offer only parts.

846
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:50.260
Like Kevin Kline did not have to audition for me and I was grateful that I even

847
00:48:50.261 --> 00:48:53.120
read the script and when he read it and agree to do it,

848
00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:54.640
like made the movie happen and everything.

849
00:48:54.641 --> 00:48:57.940
So I was getting to know all of these people as we were shooting.

850
00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:59.140
It was really cool.
It was,

851
00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:03.820
it was just a privilege because you get to make the thing together,

852
00:49:03.821 --> 00:49:06.850
you get to do the scene together,
you find it together,
you know,

853
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:10.360
you're listening to each other.
And I told everybody,
Hey,

854
00:49:10.361 --> 00:49:14.500
I'm not precious about these words.
I wrote the script.
If we can do better,
let's,

855
00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.620
you know,
if you can top it,
go for it.
If you have,
you want to improvise,

856
00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:21.190
I'm totally up for that.
So I think that created a pretty good environment,

857
00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:24.200
a good,
a good working environment because,
um,

858
00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:27.970
I wanted to let people do what they were really good at.

859
00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:33.690
And that included my director of photography and my art director wardrobe.

860
00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:39.130
It's,
it's really cool to get to work on a movie because it really is so

861
00:49:39.131 --> 00:49:41.890
collaborative,
like down to every detail.

862
00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:47.950
And it's nice to be the director because you can guide how the process goes.

863
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:49.990
And so,
you know what I want,
this is what I had in mind.

864
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:53.950
But I think one of the great things about it is that you have other people to

865
00:49:53.951 --> 00:49:56.710
help you make decisions and you can find the solutions together.

866
00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:57.880
And when it works,

867
00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.990
it's just gratifying in a different way than when something you just did

868
00:50:01.991 --> 00:50:05.530
yourself works.
And then now that I'm at this stage,

869
00:50:05.531 --> 00:50:08.770
you guys haven't seen the movie.
I hope you do.
I'm glad you liked the movie.

870
00:50:08.771 --> 00:50:10.000
The people I've talked to who liked it.

871
00:50:10.001 --> 00:50:14.860
It's different because as Comedians we need validation for whatever happened in

872
00:50:14.861 --> 00:50:17.470
my life.
I didn't get beaten up by my parents or anything like that,

873
00:50:17.471 --> 00:50:19.240
but something happened to me.

874
00:50:19.241 --> 00:50:23.020
I Dunno what that I need people to like me more than the normal person.

875
00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:26.230
So it's kind of a curse,
you know,
to have to go out in front of crowds.

876
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:29.040
I mean I liked joking around and the puzzles of it,
but I think I want,
you know,

877
00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:33.440
validation we all do to some degree.
So to make a movie,
it's just,

878
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.030
especially one like this,

879
00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:39.020
it's very personal and I am just kind of opening up a lot for better or worse

880
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.090
when it does connect with another person,

881
00:50:41.091 --> 00:50:46.091
it's validating in such a specific way that honestly makes me feel a little less

882
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:47.413
alienated.

883
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:52.910
Then I sometimes do because of the way the world is going these days and

884
00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:56.630
politics and online hatred,
you know,
all that.

885
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.410
I don't have to tell you guys what we're living in right now.
So,
um,

886
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:04.070
this has been a surprising,
I don't know what you'd call it,

887
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:06.860
gift or little oasis,

888
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:10.010
just for a short little window here where I get to do screenings and people come

889
00:51:10.011 --> 00:51:11.840
up to me afterwards and say,
you know,

890
00:51:11.841 --> 00:51:14.390
I lost someone and this is really meant something to me,

891
00:51:14.391 --> 00:51:18.830
or I liked how you did that,
or,
you know,
thanks for doing something like this.

892
00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:21.860
Whatever it is,
it just feels like,
wow,
I don't know this person.

893
00:51:21.861 --> 00:51:25.430
And suddenly I'm having a very real conversation with them when most of the time

894
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:27.380
I'm not talking to strangers,
you're just not allowed.

895
00:51:27.381 --> 00:51:29.810
You can't just go off and be like,
hey,
hey,
how's it going?
Especially as a guy,

896
00:51:29.811 --> 00:51:31.370
you can't walk up to people start talking and be like,

897
00:51:31.371 --> 00:51:34.850
what the fuck away from you now?
What do you want?
You know?
So it's,
um,

898
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:38.330
it's nicer to have that kind of interaction with people.
And even this,

899
00:51:38.331 --> 00:51:39.164
I know we're,

900
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:43.310
I don't know what this room is considered a conference room or sure.

901
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:46.520
Some sort of,
I know you're controlling the world somehow

902
00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:49.610
<v 2>in this room.
I don't know what it is,
but you get to come here</v>

903
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:52.380
<v 0>and,
um,
you know,
talked to a bunch of people.
I don't know,</v>

904
00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.410
you took the time to ask me about my life and everything.
You know,

905
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:59.640
it is validating in a,
in a different way that's,
um,

906
00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:03.750
it's easy to not take,
it's easy to take that for granted,
but to say,
hey,

907
00:52:03.751 --> 00:52:03.980
you know,

908
00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:07.560
what's a nice moment where people gave me some attention and I got to share what

909
00:52:07.561 --> 00:52:11.340
I think and feel.
And about 90% of the people stayed in the room.

910
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:17.640
<v 2>That's pretty good.
Yeah,
exactly.
So I thought this was great.
A lot of fun.</v>

911
00:52:17.641 --> 00:52:20.010
I know everyone else had a lot of fun.
Um,
and let's just think,

912
00:52:20.011 --> 00:52:24.710
Dimitri Martin for coming to [inaudible].
