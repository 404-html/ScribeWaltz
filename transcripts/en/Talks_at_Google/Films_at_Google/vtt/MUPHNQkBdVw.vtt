1
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.870
We have a problem.

2
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.483
Somebody

3
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.273
pull your head off,

4
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.630
might make it here for a while.
Was it good for you

5
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.090
to be the greatest adventure?
I mean,
the stuff has been really

6
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.963
excellent.

7
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.223
Cookie.

8
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.100
You're in the middle of a war one that's been going on forever.

9
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.500
They talking about,
you asked talking would be worse.
Killings,

10
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.860
witness the biggest covered up in Houston.

11
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.440
Kicking,
get involved in these people's problems together.

12
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.360
Hell Oh my agents.

13
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.350
So that they have a fighting chance against the sub machine guns or some of the

14
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:37.900
most dangerous characters and the history of American criminality.

15
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.650
It's a bigger idea than just the concert.
We all have the same struggles.

16
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.983
Painting

17
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.780
for sure.
I don't,
I just believe

18
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.480
it's not,
you're late.

19
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.070
[inaudible]

20
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.160
<v 0>quite a real.
Uh,
thank you Brian.
Really appreciate you being here.
Uh,</v>

21
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.690
let's start from the early days,
if that's okay with you.
Sure.
So sure.

22
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.940
You grew up.
Is it,
it's good.
Uh,
you,
uh,

23
00:03:07.941 --> 00:03:12.700
you grew up just to on the other side of the hill in the valley.
Uh,
and,
uh,

24
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.990
you,
uh,
it all kind of started,
uh,
the way you put it with your grandmother,

25
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.970
a little Jewish woman named Sonia who believed in you despite,

26
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.910
you know,
you not doing well in school and you kind of struggling as a kid.
Uh,

27
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.790
can you talk about what she meant to you?

28
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.370
<v 2>Um,
what she meant?
Well,</v>

29
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:34.150
she was the single person that would support me or validate,

30
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.650
uh,
you know,
giving me human personal validation.
Um,

31
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.600
but I think she spotted such desperation in me,
um,

32
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.590
that it was attractive to her in a way because there was,

33
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.720
she would always tell me,
I'm going to be special.
You're going all the way.
Um,

34
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.740
and I'm thinking I'll go all the way where,
where am I going?
All the way to.
But,

35
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.710
um,
because she would look at these report cards,
cards and I have,

36
00:04:00.711 --> 00:04:04.390
there were always like all D's and F's.

37
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.450
And so there was really no evidence to support what she was saying,

38
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.040
you know,
like,
um,
so,

39
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.450
but it was very important to have some one person that consistently believed in

40
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:21.451
me and then isolated this one trait that she thought I could do and was doing.

41
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.800
Um,
even though it wasn't as,
as refined as it is now,
but have,

42
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.040
which was to use the power of curiosity to learn interactively with people.

43
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.023
Um,

44
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.620
and then of course I've taken it to some other level where I've have curiosity

45
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:43.020
conversations every two weeks.
I have for at least 30 years,

46
00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:47.150
actually for 30 years,
every two weeks,
uh,
faithfully.
Um,

47
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.050
and in these curiosity conversations,
it's just,
you know,

48
00:04:52.051 --> 00:04:54.640
it's science,
medicine,
politics,
religion,

49
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:56.920
technology have been a lot of people in your business,

50
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.650
some of the progenitors of things that are very important,

51
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:03.490
some of the founders of companies,
particularly yours,
in fact.
Um,

52
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.260
and so it's been really edifying and I've found ways through these curiosity

53
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:10.870
conversations to,
um,

54
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.030
to learn different perspectives.
And that's the,

55
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.400
that's something you just don't do with Ai.

56
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.180
<v 0>Yeah.
And,
uh,</v>

57
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.890
you're kind of how you got started in film seems very kind of serendipitous.

58
00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:29.340
You were hearing these guys literally having a conversation out out your window

59
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.500
about kind of an easy,
a job opening at,
uh,
at Warner brothers.

60
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.650
Um,
when you were a kid,
you weren't dead set on film.

61
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:39.240
Did you want to do something else?

62
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.540
<v 2>Um,
well I,
I was,</v>

63
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.460
I assigned myself to do something else,
but I don't know if I wanted to,

64
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.410
I was going to law school,
I was going to go,

65
00:05:48.411 --> 00:05:51.390
I went to USC and then it was going to go to USC law school,

66
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:56.180
which had upset except it too.
Um,
but I didn't really,

67
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.190
I didn't really that I passed the bar,
So I,
um,

68
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.220
I didn't think I'd pass the bar really if I broke it down,

69
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:07.880
even make it through the first year.
But I thought,
well,
this is a direction.

70
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:11.600
It's a choice.
Um,
so I'll take this choice.

71
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.340
But it was like within the first week of the summer,

72
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.000
I overheard in my apartment complex,

73
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:23.510
actually very close to here on ocean avenue.
What was it?

74
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.900
Ocean avenue was right across the street from this little elementary school,

75
00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:30.710
but ocean and,
and,
and like fifth or something.
And

76
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.530
I overheard these two guys going,
oh my God,
this was the easiest job.

77
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:40.490
It was so cushy,
cushy,
like really grabbed me.

78
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:44.160
I never heard the word cushy.
The Guy said,
yeah,
we had,

79
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.830
I had a company card.
I very,

80
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.770
I really at 40 hours a week I'd get paid,
but there really wasn't much to do.

81
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:57.070
And then I'm listening in even closer and I like pull the drapes closed in my

82
00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:02.360
little apartment and opened the window further so I could make sure that I

83
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:05.780
really was listening,
could hear what they're saying.
They said,
Oh yeah,

84
00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:09.590
I was at Warner brothers from someone named Peter Connect.
Peter Connect was,

85
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:12.200
I didn't know he was the head of Warner brothers legal department.

86
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.620
So a conversation ends and I just immediately dial,

87
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.900
you know,
I get four,
four,
one one I get ahold of,

88
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.490
I get the number of Warner brothers pictures,
ask for Peter Connect.

89
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.680
And I said,
I understand that you could be,
um,

90
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.600
you might need a law clerk this summer.
And can I please come in and,

91
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:37.130
and interview for the job?
Of course he did because I just heard it.

92
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.510
And so now all of a sudden I'm meeting with Peter Connect at three o'clock and

93
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:44.450
getting the job to work at Warner brothers like at three 15.

94
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.900
So now I had a job and it happened to be,
you know,

95
00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:52.850
it was in alignment with the path of going to law school and um,

96
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.810
and really what the job was kind of a bullshit job,
but those guys were right.

97
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.300
It was kind of a bullshit job where you just sat in a little teeny office about

98
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:06.360
like this big,
like this and it was with no windows,

99
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.450
a little desk and you'd wait,

100
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.490
do either file papers or deliver papers to somebody for Warner brothers.

101
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.860
So a couple of weeks go in,
I've,
I do have a company car,
all that stuff.

102
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.400
All those things were true and about how cushy it was.

103
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:27.680
And I have to deliver papers to,
uh,
ironically Warren Beatty.

104
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.650
Warren Beatty was huge.
You know,
this is a while ago.

105
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:35.480
He was a gigantic movie star,
like is big and movie stars you could get.
But he,

106
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:35.721
you know,

107
00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:39.560
he's also a star and he was a writer and he was a director and I think you'd

108
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.890
already done shampoo if I'm not wrong.
And um,

109
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.170
when I ain't even have to deliver these papers,

110
00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:47.270
he lives at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.

111
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.680
So I go to the Beverly Wilshire Hotel and I'm waiting at the desk and it's one

112
00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:54.890
of his assistants comes down,
says,
hey,
me like Hemi the papers kid.

113
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.190
And so I say,
I just think to say,

114
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.650
well I can't hand you the papers,
I have to hand them directly to mister Beatty.

115
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.750
And the guy goes like a version of like,
you're full of shit.

116
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.050
But um,
he says,
just hand me the papers.
I said,

117
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.640
these papers are invalid unless I hand them directly to mister Beatty.

118
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:23.310
And I said it with enough conviction and repeatedly that they said,

119
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:27.450
okay,
okay.
And so then I,
and I'm intercepted by another assistant,

120
00:09:27.451 --> 00:09:32.430
like the higher level assistant,
I say the same thing and persuade him,
he said,

121
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:34.710
okay,
just hand them to papers.
And then you leave.

122
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.290
I go up there and I'm in and I hand him the papers,

123
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.050
I generate a connection and I turned that little moment into an hour

124
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:46.710
conversation with Warren Beatty,
which was really,

125
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:51.520
really informational.
It was amazing.
And I,
I,
I,

126
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.910
I just got a lot of,
I got a lot out of it.

127
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:58.500
And also I got confidence from doing it for having him say yes.

128
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.930
How did you have that kind of healthy sense of entitlement or Chutzpah,
uh,

129
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.800
to,
to,
you know,
your 23 year old legal clerk to,

130
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.260
to be in the presence of Warren Beatty and,
and,
uh,
you know,

131
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.200
have his ear for an hour.
Um,
well

132
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.470
I,
um,
I don't,
I get that.
Well,
I got it from my group.
My grandmother helped.

133
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.790
That'll Chutzpah.
Um,
I think,

134
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.710
I think I've always been into disrupting my comfort zone and I do it

135
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:32.340
professionally now and it's,
it's really an additive.
Um,

136
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:37.290
I know that you guys had Simon Sinek,
he did a Google talk for you guys.
He does.

137
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:42.300
And he's has won two of the top five,
um,
Google,
I'm sorry,

138
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.690
ted talks in the world and one of them's on the why,

139
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.840
why you do what you do not.

140
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:54.150
So he diagnosed me cause I got to be friends with him and he said my why was and

141
00:10:56.821 --> 00:11:01.310
cause he'll ask me what was the most important moment in your childhood,

142
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.360
school,
school life experience.

143
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:07.470
And I explain it then he connects all these dots and the very end he goes,

144
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.610
I think you think your why.
And I've known him now a couple of years.
He says,
I,

145
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.880
he,
I,
I think you think your why is curiosity,

146
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.240
but that's your how your why is you hate bullies,

147
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.210
which I just learned like two weeks ago.
I mean we're,

148
00:11:23.211 --> 00:11:27.150
it's really came together for me cause I really do hate bullies.
Um,

149
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.770
and so I think that was part of it.
Like I,
I think I was just always,

150
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:36.130
whether it's a bully or just the man in general,
um,
I,

151
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:41.190
I wouldn't say I'm defiant against it.
I've just,
uh,
I'm cool with it.

152
00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:46.170
I'm cool with going up against being,
I'm very happy being the underdog.
In fact,

153
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:50.730
I'm not happy being,
you know,

154
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:55.160
beyond that actually.
And that's why I probably have made,
I've,
I've,

155
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.300
I've produced I think a hundred movies and,
uh,

156
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.610
seven or eight really important tell,
you know,

157
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.350
television shows and they're all startups.
And I think I like startups.

158
00:12:05.351 --> 00:12:06.860
I like,
um,

159
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:12.210
having an idea of building it out of zero and then case building it to the point

160
00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:14.590
that some,
that it has value.

161
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:19.450
And once I've do that to the point that it's,

162
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.390
you know,
that gas becomes a solid,

163
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:26.980
then I like to start on another one and a long answer.

164
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.280
That's a great answer.
Uh,
Warren Beatty was just the tip of the iceberg.

165
00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:34.990
You spoke to,
you know,
Lou Wasserman,
Mel Brooks.
Am I right about that?
Uh,

166
00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:37.420
and,
and it seems like you kind of understood,

167
00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:40.930
you had this fundamental understanding that your career was going to be made on

168
00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:45.360
relationships and not on kind of arise a direct rise through kind of the

169
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.300
meritocracy.
Uh,
how did you have that understanding?
So,
so young?

170
00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.820
Um,
well,
okay.
Okay.
That's cool.
Um,
well just one differentiation.

171
00:12:54.821 --> 00:12:58.450
I think that,
um,
that I,

172
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.320
I didn't think I didn't,
I mean,
look,
relationships are extremely important,

173
00:13:02.321 --> 00:13:07.321
but I think insight is more important and what I would gained out of these

174
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:12.100
conversations that I'd have with Warren Beatty or,
you know,

175
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.140
what I did is I quit going to law school.
Hope to see if we can capture this.

176
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:21.490
But I quit going to law school because I saw that this was a method that would

177
00:13:21.491 --> 00:13:26.050
be pretty awesome for me.
And I say to my boss,
Peter Connect,

178
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:31.420
I'm going just going to stay here.
But I did happen to notice way down the hall,

179
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:33.700
there was a vacant office.

180
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.670
This office was twice as big as his,

181
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.050
but he didn't care cause he'd started with Jack Warner and you know,

182
00:13:41.051 --> 00:13:44.740
like a zillion years ago.
And so he just goes,
oh,
I'll get it for you.

183
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.130
He gets me this giant office,
the size,

184
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.890
the size of this room.
But you know,

185
00:13:50.891 --> 00:13:54.070
like really it would to union secretaries there.

186
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:59.071
So now I have this amazing big office and I can use this for like the Brian

187
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.760
Grazer business even though I'm working there and still making my $5 an hour.

188
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:09.180
So once I got this big office and I extended for an additional year than every

189
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:15.160
single day,
whether I was delivering papers or not,
I was using a similar speech.

190
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.510
I'd say,
hi,
my name is Brian Grazer.
I work at Warner Brothers business affairs.

191
00:14:19.511 --> 00:14:21.670
I kind of fudge that a little bit.
Um,

192
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.790
and I know everything about your boss.

193
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:29.950
I would love to have a conversation with him the last only five minutes and I

194
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.600
absolutely do not want a job.

195
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:36.190
So I do that every single day so that every single day I could meet someone that

196
00:14:36.191 --> 00:14:40.180
was really making a difference in the entertainment business,

197
00:14:40.181 --> 00:14:42.730
could be television or movies and,

198
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.210
and so it wasn't that I counted on the relationship,

199
00:14:46.211 --> 00:14:50.910
it was more about a demystification of how this whole system worked.

200
00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.130
You like,
ultimately what I was able to learn,
even very young,

201
00:14:55.430 --> 00:15:00.290
was like how leveraged got created and used in a,

202
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:03.740
as a tool in our,
in,
you know,
in the entertainment business.

203
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:09.440
And so I,
um,
Kinda stayed doing that for about a year and a half.

204
00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:11.420
And just before I got the boot,
uh,

205
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.230
because I kept using the Warner brothers assets for me.
Um,

206
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:20.570
I got this one big meeting with like who I really wanted to meet with Lou

207
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:25.550
Wasserman.
Lew Wasserman was like the dawn of the entertainment business,

208
00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:26.440
the modern,
and Tim is,

209
00:15:26.441 --> 00:15:31.441
it was the most powerful mythic man in the entertainment business.

210
00:15:31.581 --> 00:15:32.810
He,
he,
uh,

211
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.650
was really the founder of MCA universal.

212
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:42.530
And,
and literally he was the guy that,
uh,
that everything,

213
00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.140
everything in the entertainment business revolved around Lew Wasserman.

214
00:15:45.141 --> 00:15:49.970
So I find a way to meet Lew Wasserman and I'm already to sort of try to,

215
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.213
um,

216
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.310
have a conversation with him and he sort of puts his hands up in the air and he

217
00:15:55.311 --> 00:15:59.000
says,
just wait a second.
You're not coming into my office.
And I thought,
well,

218
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:01.550
like everybody has going into his office,
but no go.

219
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:07.030
So he comes back with a legal tab and a pencil and he said,

220
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.370
take these.
So I take him and he says,

221
00:16:10.371 --> 00:16:14.840
put the pencil to the paper and it has greater value than it did,

222
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:19.820
as separate parts.
Now get outta here.
And,
which was kind of embarrassing,

223
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:24.830
but what I realized was he was saying that you,
you don't really have anything,

224
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:26.031
uh,

225
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:31.031
you might have like a gift to get into people's office and turn and create a

226
00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:34.640
conversation,
but you don't own anything.

227
00:16:34.641 --> 00:16:38.990
So I realized I better put the pencil to the paper and start writing ideas and I

228
00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:41.150
kind of industrialized,
uh,

229
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:46.390
sort of the idea of business and I every day have many ideas and send them

230
00:16:46.551 --> 00:16:50.720
registered mail to myself.
And I ended up with a box of hundreds of ideas,

231
00:16:50.721 --> 00:16:52.430
including the,

232
00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:56.630
the one called splash that was a man falling in love with a mermaid starring Tom

233
00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:00.950
Hanks and in many others.
Um,
but I realized that the,
you don't,

234
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.960
unless you can't codify or you know,
codify,
right,

235
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:09.590
original ideas and prove that they're valuable,

236
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.730
you have to make them valuable.
Um,
you don't have anything.

237
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.060
I want to talk about idea generation for a second.

238
00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:22.070
I imagine curiosity conversations probably play into different ideas and you've

239
00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:24.770
talked about how they've even turned into movies.
Um,

240
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.120
do you have any other kind of processes to kind of help spur creativity and come

241
00:17:29.121 --> 00:17:32.210
up with ideas?
Um,

242
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:36.830
do I have other ways to spur creativity?
Uh,
well,

243
00:17:36.831 --> 00:17:40.520
I read,
um,
but I don't really read,

244
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:46.040
I don't really read fiction.
I mean,
I've just,
uh,

245
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.670
the first 15 years of my being a producer,
I just did comedies.

246
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.330
Comedies are fiction,
uh,
for the most,
well,
I don't know,

247
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.260
whatever you think they're,
they're kind of a combination.

248
00:17:59.100 --> 00:17:59.933
Um,

249
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:06.180
I like to curiosity conversations because I just,
you learn,
um,

250
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.520
I know that,

251
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.520
I know that knowing your inner truth,
whatever that is,

252
00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:18.180
and really diagnosing what that is so you're not bullshitting yourself.

253
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.080
I know the inner truth of that.
Once you start to create,

254
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:27.410
understand that and it's schematic of that is a way to build ideas.

255
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.000
I mean,
the movie for the Friday Night Lights was,
was about me.

256
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:37.020
It was really just because I got cut in a very humiliating way from high school

257
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:41.610
football from coach Ogawa.
He cut me in front of like 250 kids.

258
00:18:41.611 --> 00:18:46.611
And the pain of that was so awesome.

259
00:18:47.071 --> 00:18:48.210
So I mean,

260
00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:53.211
it was so memorable to me that I was able to sort of think it through and go

261
00:18:53.371 --> 00:18:54.750
like,
well,
when,

262
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.470
when he pointed to Richard Cox over there and he said he was quarterback and he

263
00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:02.520
said to Perry,
Shell,
my,
your nose guard.
And he said to Brian Grazer,
uh,

264
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.750
your status.
And I said,
tailback.
He said,
incorrect cut.

265
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.640
I was no longer a human being that in that moment.
And I thought I was able to,

266
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:16.200
I was able to start catalog that and many other experiences,

267
00:19:16.201 --> 00:19:17.460
but that one in particular,

268
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:23.990
I realized that that lived inside this book called Friday Night Lights because

269
00:19:24.511 --> 00:19:29.280
anything you read has multiple interpretations.
Right.
So

270
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.570
<v 0>I want to skip ahead chronologically a little bit.
You're,
uh,</v>

271
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.310
you're in in the 80s,
you're working at Paramont.
Um,

272
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:41.000
and do you want to meet Ron Howard?
Um,
he had done the Andy Griffith show.

273
00:19:41.001 --> 00:19:44.900
You'd done happy days.
What about Ron Howard?
You know,

274
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.190
it almost seems like you knew you wanted to partner with them before you,

275
00:19:48.191 --> 00:19:52.760
you met him.
Um,
what about him,
you know,
made you say,
this is the guy,

276
00:19:52.761 --> 00:19:55.040
this is the guy I want to work with for the rest of my life.

277
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.370
<v 2>Um,
well I,
I didn't,
I actually didn't know,</v>

278
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.700
I just had this quote of meeting a new person every day.

279
00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.950
So I saw Ron Howard out of my office and I yelled out at it.
I'm like,

280
00:20:07.951 --> 00:20:12.390
Hey,
you know,
like the hat,
Bruh,
Bruh.
And he didn't know I was and I scared him,

281
00:20:12.391 --> 00:20:17.250
Kinda mean.
And um,
and then I called his office and I got to meet with you.

282
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:20.700
I've found a way,
you know,
cause you can get an,
if you really work at it,

283
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.790
you know,
if you're resourceful,
you can,
you can and polite.

284
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.280
You can get people to meet with you.
And,
um,

285
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.490
but then when he walked into my office,

286
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:34.170
he had this sort of aura of goodness or it's perceptible to me that he had this

287
00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.000
energetically,
he had an,
he had had goodness about him.

288
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.650
I'm sure you guys feel stuff like that.
Right?
You know,

289
00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.090
you feel like,
oh,
that person's like bad vibe.

290
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:51.000
Don't think I want to be around that or so,
um,

291
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:56.080
it's a very important metric to me how I feel energetically towards somebody

292
00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:01.120
because I can,
I can think about it.
You feel it,

293
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.140
that truth.
And then I often just think,
how will this end?

294
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:10.780
And if you extrapolate,
build that out and you feel like,

295
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.640
I think this will end bad,
then you,
you shouldn't start.
But with Ron,

296
00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:17.770
I fell like he is.
Um,

297
00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:22.570
I just think he just had this aura of goodness about him.
It was like a,

298
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.460
it was kind of a biblical for me.
Of course.
I was looking for that probably.

299
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.420
I didn't know he could actually direct.
I mean,
I had no idea he could direct.

300
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:36.940
I just liked him and thought I should support a guy that seemed good.

301
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:42.160
It seemed like it worked out.
It did work.
Done.
Um,
uh,

302
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.470
can you give us kind of a story of the making of a movie that seemed very

303
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:50.560
unlikely that it would be made kind of at the start and you know,

304
00:21:50.561 --> 00:21:54.670
you kind of willed it into,
into fruition?
Um,

305
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:55.690
I've had a lot of them.

306
00:21:55.691 --> 00:22:00.691
I mean the first one was splash because it's hundreds of rejections over the

307
00:22:01.301 --> 00:22:03.460
course of like five years.

308
00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.270
Just every person rejected it repeatedly,
you know,

309
00:22:07.271 --> 00:22:09.920
every studio or every buyer.
Um,

310
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:15.760
which caused me to well get tough,
you know,
like become

311
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:21.010
durable that way.
Um,
and I think,

312
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.610
I think I had,
what I learned was

313
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.410
splash,
even though it was a man falling over the mermaid.
It's inner theme,

314
00:22:32.411 --> 00:22:36.280
it's interior theme was about love.

315
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:41.590
And I realized in retrospect that people through the script or through my pitch

316
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:46.600
couldn't see that,
um,
or they just didn't like it.

317
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:50.530
I don't know.
But I think it's,
I think if you can pitch a theme,

318
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:52.750
if you know,
if you have a story,

319
00:22:52.751 --> 00:22:57.751
but you know the interior theme and you try to sell and you case build a sell

320
00:22:57.761 --> 00:23:01.660
your theme themes are often,
uh,
irrefutable.

321
00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:07.150
Um,
so,
uh,
but I just didn't know that then.
So I had hundreds,

322
00:23:07.151 --> 00:23:12.100
a hundred rejections.
I finally got it made.
It was brutal.
Um,

323
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:16.930
and then the movie that models this better best for me is cause I,

324
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.750
I was this movie called American gangster.

325
00:23:19.751 --> 00:23:24.520
I don't know if you ever saw that of Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington,
but it,

326
00:23:24.521 --> 00:23:27.490
um,
it,
it was many,
many,

327
00:23:27.491 --> 00:23:32.491
many years later after splash and the studio decided they were going to fire the

328
00:23:32.501 --> 00:23:37.501
director just months before we're start starting to shoot.

329
00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.360
And we already had Russell Crowe in the movie.
Everyone,
sorry,

330
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.410
a Denzel Washington in the movie didn't have Russell Crowe.
Um,
we had a director,

331
00:23:44.411 --> 00:23:46.760
we'd already spent $2 million,

332
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.390
but they just felt like this director scares them.

333
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.370
They've thought about it a lot,
scares them.
It's,

334
00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.530
it's going to be a bigger loss if they actually make the movie.

335
00:23:57.531 --> 00:24:02.531
They're rather just write down $32 million and that's really a lot of money.

336
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.230
Um,
even today it's a lot of money,
but then it was crazy.

337
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:08.480
That was like 12 years ago.
Um,

338
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.910
and that's how scared they were of,
of this guy.
And anyways,

339
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.940
I was able to immediately recontextualize it and get better actors in a much

340
00:24:19.221 --> 00:24:20.150
better director.

341
00:24:20.151 --> 00:24:25.151
So I sort of forced them after they took the right down to talk to me again

342
00:24:27.741 --> 00:24:31.160
about American gangster,
which they didn't want to do.

343
00:24:31.161 --> 00:24:32.390
They said we'll take the write down,

344
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:35.990
but don't ever say American or gangster to us ever again.

345
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:40.730
<v 0>I love the story of how you got a eight mile made.</v>

346
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.740
Can you talk about that a little bit?
How you met M and m and um,
uh,

347
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.480
slowly kind of convinced him to do it?

348
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:54.050
<v 2>Um,
well,
yeah.
Well I,
I was out sir.
Okay.</v>

349
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:59.210
Very quickly.
So,
um,
you said,
how do I get ideas?

350
00:24:59.211 --> 00:25:03.950
I mean I get ideas just by,
you know,
it sounds so simple,

351
00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:06.920
but just by trying to be as present as possible.

352
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.600
So I happened to be in a taxi cab in New York and it was like guys,

353
00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:12.890
we've been around and everything,

354
00:25:12.891 --> 00:25:17.891
but I'm listening to this faint conversation going on in the taxi cabs,

355
00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.800
you know on the radio,
local,
local radio,

356
00:25:21.801 --> 00:25:26.801
local Manhattan radio and ODB old dirty bastard is being interviewed by some

357
00:25:29.541 --> 00:25:33.200
talk show guy and he makes like in a minute stand and be barely makes any sense

358
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.870
and it's just hard to really understand it.

359
00:25:35.871 --> 00:25:40.871
But I thought what kind of a guy wants to be called old dirty bastard?

360
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.640
I mean that was his choice to be called that.

361
00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:48.350
I thought that's an interesting choice.
So I think I met her,

362
00:25:48.351 --> 00:25:53.060
go meet this ODB.
So this is like 25 or 23 years ago.

363
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.290
So I go meet ODB and like he was a trip,
you know,

364
00:25:57.291 --> 00:26:01.460
like he wouldn't let me into a studio and everything was a cost Allah cart
thing.

365
00:26:01.461 --> 00:26:04.850
If you want to go in the studio,
it's going to cost this.
If you want to do that.

366
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.510
So I just think,
wow,
this guy is so interesting.
He's funny.

367
00:26:08.511 --> 00:26:11.990
And also kind of scary at the same time.

368
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.400
So after I met ODB DB,
then I thought I'd meet this character slick Rick,

369
00:26:16.401 --> 00:26:18.170
the wears a patch on his eye,

370
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:21.500
rappers really kind of comical British dude.

371
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.740
And then I go through this series of Chuck d,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

372
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:29.240
And I'm thinking,
wow,
this is like a movement.
You know this east,

373
00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.810
you know east coast hip hop is like a movement.
It can be funny.

374
00:26:32.811 --> 00:26:36.770
It could be the voice of the inner city.
It's a lot of things.
Were you,

375
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:39.440
did you listen to a lot of like nineties hip hop at the time?

376
00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:45.090
I'm not really,
no.
I mean I know.
No,

377
00:26:45.091 --> 00:26:46.380
that isn't what got me into it.
No,

378
00:26:46.381 --> 00:26:51.030
I didn't listen to nineties hip hop before I met ODB.
Okay.
Just a funny name.

379
00:26:51.031 --> 00:26:55.290
And a guy wanted to go,
you call me ODB,
you know,
like being insistent upon it.

380
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.050
That was made me want to go see him.

381
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:02.040
I didn't know about the Wu Tang clan and,

382
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.220
and so then I know,
so I didn't know anything about it.

383
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:10.320
And then I happened to be,
because I was still doing curiosity conversations.

384
00:27:10.321 --> 00:27:12.840
I've started them,
I met with Frank Rich,

385
00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:15.660
who was the editor of the New York Times.
Very,
very she,
she guy.

386
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.210
And I start telling him about,
he was tough.

387
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.960
We're talking about something very high flute,
you know,
probably,
you know,

388
00:27:21.961 --> 00:27:24.510
Broadway musicals and stuff,
which is quite expert at.

389
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.540
And I say something about hip hop and he goes,
oh,

390
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.410
he treated it as an inferior subculture.
Like it was less than.

391
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:36.240
And I thought,
I don't think as less than,
I think this is the culture,

392
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:40.260
not a subculture,
much less an inferior subculture.

393
00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:44.310
And I kinda thought I'd build a story to prove him wrong.

394
00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:48.000
And that's where it sort of came about.
Then I found a way,

395
00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:49.240
I didn't know who should be in it.

396
00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:52.920
I've spent years trying to figure it out and I tried to get spike Lee to do it

397
00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:55.410
and he was cool but no go.

398
00:27:55.411 --> 00:28:00.150
And then I was just watching the vmax and I see the camera,

399
00:28:00.151 --> 00:28:03.060
this is like seven or eight years after the Frank Rich conversation or seven

400
00:28:03.061 --> 00:28:03.894
years,

401
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:07.890
and the camera crumbed across the audience and it just heats on m and M on his

402
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:10.950
face.
And I didn't know who he was,

403
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.590
but he had this sort of icy steel glare.

404
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.370
And then all of a sudden he started laughing or being really fluid.

405
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.800
And I thought,
wow,
what a lot of range that dude has.

406
00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:23.130
Like he could be that then that.
So then I wanted to meet him.

407
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.830
So then I met M and m and a

408
00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:32.070
dre came with them and it was just,
it was very,
um,
controlled.

409
00:28:32.071 --> 00:28:35.830
Like I tried to talk to him,
but he wouldn't look at me.
So,
uh,

410
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.870
if I'm looking at him like this,
he was there,
oh,
sorry.

411
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.080
He would just wouldn't look at me.
We were looking,
we were at each other,

412
00:28:43.081 --> 00:28:47.640
but he would look the other way out my window.
And,
and then he,

413
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:52.970
he goes after about 30 minutes and I keep trying to get him to talk.

414
00:28:52.981 --> 00:28:57.510
He goes,
I'm out.
I'm thinking can be out.

415
00:28:57.511 --> 00:29:02.340
You didn't say one thing.
Um,
and they go and now he's out.

416
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:08.130
I go,
wait a minute.
I said,
uh,
come on.

417
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.770
I mean,
you could animate,
you can say something,
you know?
And like he,

418
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.920
I think I made a mad or some,

419
00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.860
and he came back kind of pissed at me,

420
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:22.400
but then talked and then he told this whole story that kind of later became kind

421
00:29:23.641 --> 00:29:26.220
of deaf.
It became what eight mile was.

422
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:31.350
So that was it.
That was the m and m of it all.
I love that story and I love him.

423
00:29:31.351 --> 00:29:36.210
He's a really super professional.
I mean,
he's amazing gifted person.

424
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:38.670
You said something really interesting earlier,

425
00:29:38.671 --> 00:29:43.000
which is you kind of started to understand like leverage and the laws of

426
00:29:43.001 --> 00:29:43.481
leverage.

427
00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:47.140
Then you used kind of Warner brothers like initially as a platform to meet all

428
00:29:47.141 --> 00:29:50.140
these interesting people.
Can you kind of unpack that?

429
00:29:50.141 --> 00:29:52.930
Because as a producer you probably use leverage a lot.

430
00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:56.860
You're almost like an entrepreneur for movies.
Um,
yeah.

431
00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.710
Can you unpack just the,
the idea of leverage and using that?

432
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:03.920
Well,
okay,
sure.
Uh,
I think I can,

433
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.840
<v 3>um,
well</v>

434
00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:12.690
<v 2>you have to have an idea now the idea that you have,</v>

435
00:30:12.691 --> 00:30:17.010
this is so much like a startup.
The idea that you have or one that I would,

436
00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.000
one would have,

437
00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.800
doesn't have to be what you end up doing.

438
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:27.690
It can just continue to change form change,
form,
change,
form,
change form.
Um,

439
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:32.190
the two things that are relevant.
One is to know the spa,

440
00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.960
to have the spark of an idea.

441
00:30:33.961 --> 00:30:38.250
So we have something to say to somebody if you have nothing to say to somebody

442
00:30:38.251 --> 00:30:39.930
other than like,
Hey,
what are you doing?

443
00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:45.090
I always feel like you have to start with something that's like the gift of the

444
00:30:45.091 --> 00:30:49.110
conversation.
If you have nothing to say,
even as smile,

445
00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:51.630
even if you're super smart,
but nothing to say

446
00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.070
it doesn't go anywhere.
It's not going to,

447
00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:58.410
you can't build nothing into something.

448
00:30:58.411 --> 00:31:01.560
You have to build the germ of something and the something,

449
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.220
and you've said that when you reach out to people that you can't be a generic

450
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:06.540
insight into them as well.

451
00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:10.200
It has to be something kind of unique to you that you've recognized.
Yeah,

452
00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.030
I mean my,
in these conversations that I have,

453
00:31:12.031 --> 00:31:16.500
it can't be googleable if it's googleable then like just Google it,
you know,

454
00:31:16.501 --> 00:31:20.760
like you have to say,
you have to ask a question or have an insight or a gift,

455
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:24.700
a rim.
When I met Dre one of the first times I said,
uh,

456
00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:26.880
I asked him feed,

457
00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:31.830
heard the musical composition to Ernst golds,

458
00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.880
uh,
composition of exodus,

459
00:31:35.881 --> 00:31:39.630
I think it was like 1979 it was really,
really beautiful.

460
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:44.490
And I brought it up not to be a wiseguy but I brought it up because when his

461
00:31:44.491 --> 00:31:49.200
music's really clicks is on fire,
it's,
it's very melodic.

462
00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:53.310
It's beautiful.
So he's got rap,
you know,
he's,
you know what it is.

463
00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.540
So he has a unique component of that.
Some of his,

464
00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.640
some of his songs when they really work,

465
00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:03.960
they have beauty to them and are melodic and I thought he would really gain by

466
00:32:03.961 --> 00:32:04.710
hearing this.

467
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:09.300
He would dig it just like listening to Hans Zimmer or James Horn or something.

468
00:32:09.301 --> 00:32:10.320
But this was even,

469
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:15.210
this was a signature piece that really stuck with me and he appreciated it,

470
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.940
you know,
like,
cause I had something to say.
Um,

471
00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:24.510
so or just recently I was at your,
uh,
I'll say,

472
00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.210
cause I was at your Google Cecily camp,

473
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.350
but I get invited to go to that and I love it.
It's so amazing.
It's a privilege.

474
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:36.950
And last year you guys had Kevin Durant showed and was one of the speakers and I

475
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.630
just,
I don't know.
I know basketball mostly just through my kids,
you know,

476
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:48.560
cause they,
these two boys,
like they love basketball.
So they knew Kevin Duran is,

477
00:32:48.561 --> 00:32:53.540
but I sort of barely know Kevin Duran is and he,
um,

478
00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:59.360
um,
goes on this friend's boat.
Okay.
So we're now going to go,
says Lee,

479
00:32:59.361 --> 00:33:02.630
we've done the conference,
you know,
for the day.
Now we go to the boat,

480
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.330
there's a boat.
A friend of mine got a boat,
he's on the boat,

481
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:10.820
Kevin Durant's shows up and when he leaves he says,
Hey,
uh,
you know,

482
00:33:10.821 --> 00:33:14.510
I'd love to connect with you when I get,
when we get back and I'm going to,

483
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.800
I'll be coming to la.
I'm thinking,
okay,
here's my number,
but I,

484
00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:22.790
I didn't think you'd really follow up because you know,
what are the chances,

485
00:33:22.791 --> 00:33:26.540
you know,
the chances are so,
but he does follow up.
It's like weeks,

486
00:33:26.541 --> 00:33:30.460
weeks later he,
you know,
he says wanting to get together and have lunch.
He's,

487
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:35.090
I'm at the Beverly Hills Hotel,
we're playing a clippers.
Sure.
So we have lunch.

488
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:40.310
And I just say,
I'm inventing stuff to talk about nervously.

489
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:46.160
And I do say,
you know,
what I'd love to do is like,
do Friday night lights,

490
00:33:46.161 --> 00:33:49.130
but in the world of basketball.
And he goes,
Oh,
you know,

491
00:33:49.131 --> 00:33:52.630
I grew up a little that way.
And he starts talking about growing up,
uh,

492
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:57.140
growing up and playing basketball in a rec center,
this kind of,
you know,

493
00:33:57.141 --> 00:34:01.010
a very,
very,
very lower class rec center and outside of Maryland.

494
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.480
And then he described it very quickly,
which blew my mind.
He goes,
yeah,

495
00:34:05.481 --> 00:34:09.440
we'd play basketball.
And right next door we shared a wall with an old age home.

496
00:34:09.441 --> 00:34:12.760
And I thought,
well that's pretty colorful.
I mean I could see that.

497
00:34:12.761 --> 00:34:16.520
Cause I always like to know what things look like.
Always,
always,
always.

498
00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:20.040
I won't hire a director unless they even no matter of smarter.
Good.
I have to go,

499
00:34:20.041 --> 00:34:23.150
well what does it look like?
And then they describe the shot,
a shot,

500
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.780
it's a shot is whack.
Then I just don't even do it.

501
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:32.080
Like if you're doing a comedy and a director gives you a wide shot,

502
00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:35.660
you know who you're talking to,
the wrong guy.
Because comedy is a closeup medium.

503
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:41.230
So there's a lot of rules and you can not trick people but make them feel

504
00:34:41.301 --> 00:34:46.301
comfortable to tell you their true impulse because they're true impulses with

505
00:34:47.031 --> 00:34:50.990
bill.
Do you know a lot of people think,
oh,
I'll talk him into it.

506
00:34:50.991 --> 00:34:54.860
I'll negotiate my point of view upon them.
Artists.

507
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:59.980
And they might be true by engineers.
I don't know.
But um,
I don't know.

508
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:04.100
Maybe it's that,
but artists do what they say in the first few minutes,

509
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:09.440
not what the,
not what you tell them to do,
you know.
So,
um,

510
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:13.640
so I met with Kevin did this thing and now we're doing a television show.

511
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:17.750
We're doing like the Friday night lights version called swagger,

512
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:22.580
like version of fraud,
you know,
of bad in basketball.
It's very exciting.

513
00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:26.090
Oh,
that's just sort of starting from scratch also.

514
00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.140
<v 0>Do you have a,
a recent curiosity conversation?</v>

515
00:35:29.141 --> 00:35:31.690
You've been doing these for for two weeks,
uh,
or sorry,

516
00:35:31.691 --> 00:35:34.090
every two weeks rather for a long,
long time.

517
00:35:34.091 --> 00:35:38.250
Do you have a recent one that really affected you and that you really just enjoy

518
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:43.230
<v 2>it?
Um,
I have,
I have one I can't talk about very much.
I just,</v>

519
00:35:43.231 --> 00:35:47.280
I went to Saudi Arabia to do it actually last week.
That's crazy.
Um,

520
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:50.820
so,
and not a lot of people have been to Saudi.

521
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.390
I haven't been to Saudi and we think of Saudi as a certain thing.

522
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.030
The beauty of these curiosity conversations,

523
00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:00.210
I've done at least a thousand of them over the 30 years.

524
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:04.110
Every preconception that I have has been wrong.

525
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.490
I might have a hundred percent track record of being wrong every single time.

526
00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.630
So like,
cause whenever you like when you,
whatever you think it is,

527
00:36:12.631 --> 00:36:16.110
wherever you think that meeting is going to be or the Party,
oh,

528
00:36:16.111 --> 00:36:18.390
that's going to be a bomber.
It turns out to be great.

529
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.660
The person I hate is gonna vibe me.
He's not even there.

530
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:26.730
I mean everything is always wrong.
Like what?
And so Saudi was very,
um,

531
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.890
my preconceptions were very wrong.
Um,

532
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:33.810
now some of the things in Saudi that you do know are factual,
you know,

533
00:36:33.811 --> 00:36:38.520
um,
you know,
as it relates to women and decapitation and things like that,

534
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:42.870
but that's also on,
it's,
it's on a curve of changing.
Uh,

535
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.310
that was pretty,
that was super heavy going,
going there and doing that.

536
00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.910
And most people think of eye contact is just,
you know,

537
00:36:50.911 --> 00:36:53.940
normal kind of etiquette and conversation.
Uh,

538
00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:57.480
why is that so kind of important to you?
You're writing a new book about it.

539
00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:02.460
Oh yeah.
So I wrote a book,
another book.
I wrote this book right here.

540
00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:06.780
Curious mind.
A curious mind was really,

541
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:12.170
I was just going to write notes on all my conversations that I'd had over the 30

542
00:37:12.271 --> 00:37:16.650
years.
I had notes of the last 20,
but the first 10 I didn't.
And I thought,

543
00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:20.830
I better do this while I still have some motor skills,
you know?
Um,

544
00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:24.420
and then somebody said,
well,
you should just do it as a book.

545
00:37:24.421 --> 00:37:28.900
And then I thought that was an ego trip.
And then someone said,
well,
grace come,

546
00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:33.150
some people come and graze and then they go,
it's not an ego trip.

547
00:37:33.151 --> 00:37:36.530
Everyone knows you don't know anything.
You know,

548
00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:41.550
I thought it would be like one of those memoirs where you're telling people you

549
00:37:41.551 --> 00:37:45.630
know how to live your life and what it blah blah blah.
Anyway,
l basically.

550
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.650
So I did write this book and what it is is,
um,

551
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.790
is sort of two verticals.
One is,
so is the,

552
00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.170
is is that,

553
00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.200
well one is like the definition of curiosity as a force and a superpower and

554
00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:05.640
it's,
um,
it's a synthesis of many of these conversations I had.

555
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:09.780
And then that synthesis intersects with,
um,

556
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:14.880
with narrative storytelling.
Like,
you know,
one conversation I had,
I'm sure,

557
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.830
I don't know if you read this,
but anyway,
I had a woman,

558
00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:20.510
I had a conversation with a woman named Veronica [inaudible] Negray I explained,

559
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:24.180
she explained to me how she survived torture every single day of her life in

560
00:38:24.181 --> 00:38:28.230
Chile.
Um,
and then that conversation,

561
00:38:28.231 --> 00:38:33.231
what I learned was valuable when I had problems trying to figure out what a

562
00:38:34.531 --> 00:38:38.620
beautiful mind should be and from what vi which perspective it should be

563
00:38:38.621 --> 00:38:43.600
experienced,
um,
like 20 years later.
So all the conversations are just,

564
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:45.231
you know,
they,

565
00:38:45.231 --> 00:38:49.030
they serve as sort of dots and a greater constellation of dots that you have

566
00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:53.740
faith will some day connect and they do.
So,
um,
I forgot the question.

567
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:58.080
<v 0>I think you answered it.
Yeah.
Wow.
Um,</v>

568
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:03.140
well I want to get to the audience Q and a but,
um,
real quick,
uh,
you know,

569
00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:06.710
Hollywood's changing so much and a Google probably has,
you know,
a,

570
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:11.640
a part a hand and kind of changing it just in terms of content distribution.
Uh,

571
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:15.290
what do you see Hollywood kind of looking like a,
you know,
in the next 30,

572
00:39:15.291 --> 00:39:18.830
40 years,
30 or 40,

573
00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.610
or whatever time scale,
you know,
you think you could,
you could.

574
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.930
<v 2>Um,
I dunno,
probably every per,
every,</v>

575
00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.380
every artist that can create,

576
00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.430
sustain a sustainable story will be their own platform.

577
00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:36.610
There'll be consolidation of platforms,

578
00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:40.690
but probably in the future of 10 years,

579
00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:46.600
more artists will have more power over their own life.
Gotcha.

580
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:47.490
Cool.
Does that

581
00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:53.010
<v 0>my positive,
uh,
does anybody have questions from the audience?</v>

582
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:55.970
<v 4>Thanks.
I'm really appreciated everything you've said so far.</v>

583
00:39:55.971 --> 00:40:00.650
So I worked in film for 10 years and a lot of my friends are aspiring writers,

584
00:40:00.651 --> 00:40:04.820
producers,
actors.
Uh,
I always think the ones who are aspiring producers,

585
00:40:04.821 --> 00:40:08.120
it just seems like the most impossible business to get into.

586
00:40:08.121 --> 00:40:11.270
What advice would you have for aspiring producers?

587
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:16.540
<v 2>Well,
I'd probably go back to like having an idea,
having some Ip,</v>

588
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:21.530
whether it's your own self generated,
I idea,
um,

589
00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:26.230
or just any Ip.
It can be short story.
It can be in,

590
00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.580
you have to have some,
if you're going to be a producer,
producer.

591
00:40:30.581 --> 00:40:34.750
Ultimately the definition of a producer is somebody that can generate an idea

592
00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:40.410
that can see sort of the vertical line of the most nascent stage of that idea

593
00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:47.500
till its final
evolution or conclusion.

594
00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.940
So you have to be creatively responsible and fiscally responsible.

595
00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:56.970
So that starting point to its end division has to have a corresponding parts

596
00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:02.020
financially and the fight and they'll both things will change all of the time.

597
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.580
All of the butt,
and I,
as I say this,
it's so much like a startup,
isn't it?

598
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:12.490
Because you know you start off,
you're making a movie every,

599
00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:17.080
let's say the good news is you have this idea,
the studio wants to make it.

600
00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:22.240
You go through this long process of developing a dead and another for sure going

601
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:26.740
cost $50 million and then they go,
we're making it.

602
00:41:26.741 --> 00:41:30.730
You're in and you feel like,
wow,
great.
They go,
but we're making it 30 million.

603
00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:34.280
Then you have to figure that out.
You have to cut scenes out.

604
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:38.810
You have to collapse the story or you have to convince them it's 40 w you know,

605
00:41:38.811 --> 00:41:43.730
it's all,
it's a multiple of different possibilities but you have to start owning

606
00:41:43.731 --> 00:41:44.564
something.

607
00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.650
<v 5>So it seems like,
uh,</v>

608
00:41:46.651 --> 00:41:51.270
I think so many of you said like presence is kind of at the core of how you

609
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:54.810
maintain and grow your curiosity.
And a,

610
00:41:54.811 --> 00:41:59.811
I'm just curious about how you use personal technology in your life and I can

611
00:41:59.971 --> 00:42:03.270
see that going in two ways.
One is a distraction,

612
00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.680
but one is an enhancement to your curiosity and how you kind of control your

613
00:42:07.681 --> 00:42:10.350
behavior when it comes to personal technology,
how,
what you use,

614
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.870
how much time you spend in the offline world versus the online world.

615
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.420
I just love to get like what that presence,

616
00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.610
more context around what that means in your life.

617
00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:21.910
<v 2>Well,
I definitely use technology a lot and I,</v>

618
00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:26.150
um,
you know,
I always go,
I mean,

619
00:42:26.151 --> 00:42:31.060
I'm every day I'm doing some search binge because it's because it's fun for me,

620
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:36.340
but I have to start with some idea and I always found,

621
00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:41.260
I also paint and I've painted for about 20 years or so.

622
00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.950
Starting is the hardest thing touching the canvas,

623
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:49.260
whether it's an idea to become a movie or television show or,
or,

624
00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:54.010
or a painting.
For me,
Brian,
knowing myself,

625
00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:58.810
I can't execute perfection.
I don't approach things.

626
00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:04.330
Anything knowing Brian Grazer is going to execute to perfection.

627
00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:06.370
Um,

628
00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:11.370
I try to have originality as a differentiator.

629
00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:17.150
So the original idea,
um,

630
00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:22.650
is the one that I will put the highest value on and the one and,

631
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:25.930
and it's the original idea that,
that,

632
00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.700
that stress test is the one that I'm interested in the,

633
00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:35.770
to be the greatest artists where you is just not interesting to me.

634
00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:37.660
And I don't think I could succeed at it,

635
00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:42.760
but I think I can have original ideas and there's,
you know,

636
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:46.200
I like now a lot of evidence that proves that.
Um,

637
00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:49.930
but that's where I put my value is to try to,

638
00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:53.860
and then of course I will employ through collaboration,

639
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:57.880
the ability to execute it to the highest quality possible.

640
00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:02.890
But I don't start like,
uh,
uh,
like Chris Nolan who did dunk Kurt.
You know,

641
00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:07.570
I don't start going,
I know I can execute this to a level 100.

642
00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:10.510
I do sort of think kind of like,

643
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:14.110
I mean if I were to compare it to any yard decide I'm not this person cause I'm

644
00:44:14.111 --> 00:44:18.400
not as great as this person,
but like Andy Warhol just did original shit.

645
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:21.660
Like it's,
you know,
that was it.
Um,

646
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:25.660
he wasn't like Gerhard Richter,
you know,
a scientist art.

647
00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:30.520
So,
um,
that's the word how I look at it.
So I use the,

648
00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:35.610
your Google all the time to enrichen original ideas that I feel like I'm

649
00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:44.370
touching or creating or being part of its creation.
So it's,
it's,

650
00:44:44.371 --> 00:44:49.100
yeah,
it's a,
it's an informal,
it informs all of that.
Cool.
Thank you.
Sure.

651
00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.940
<v 6>Do you have a process for these curiosity?</v>

652
00:44:51.941 --> 00:44:56.440
Conversations are a standard set of questions you ask or research you do before

653
00:44:56.441 --> 00:44:57.430
going into him.
Cause it's,

654
00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.630
it's a skill and an art to kind of extract great stories from people as well.

655
00:45:01.631 --> 00:45:04.030
So how do you go into these conversations?

656
00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:05.950
<v 2>You have to get to the place,
you know,</v>

657
00:45:05.951 --> 00:45:10.660
like in the like get in flow right or in the zone where,

658
00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:12.123
where you,

659
00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:18.450
where are you're hoping for the very best date of your lifetime and through end

660
00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:23.170
by Ha.
If you think about your very best date,
you weren't,

661
00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:27.280
you weren't constructing stuff as it's going,
you're not thinking of,

662
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:32.220
um,
what are you going to say next?
You know,
it's,

663
00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:36.310
you're really in a state of flow and you're so present that everything is

664
00:45:36.311 --> 00:45:40.960
evolving on the most sincere,
in the most sincere and authentic way.

665
00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:45.970
I think being real,
just being as sincere as possible.

666
00:45:45.971 --> 00:45:49.390
You can be funny and you can goof up like I do all the time.

667
00:45:49.391 --> 00:45:53.140
But I think people feel,

668
00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:58.900
uh,
when other people are a facsimile of authenticity,
authenticity.

669
00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:04.090
I,
there's a lot of agents that I deal with.
I just feel like their bots,
you know,

670
00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:08.670
they go,
hey,
so what's going on?
They,
they come up with questions they,

671
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:09.191
they sent me.

672
00:46:09.191 --> 00:46:13.210
I learned that that was a method that would create intimacy and it just,

673
00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.780
I just don't feel like it does.
Are you smiling because it's true,
right?

674
00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.960
When you try to methodology,
methodology dies it.

675
00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.990
<v 5>If you,
for me as I spoke to you earlier,</v>

676
00:46:23.991 --> 00:46:28.991
but I've had some ideas and they're written down and they're not just ideas with

677
00:46:30.051 --> 00:46:34.250
the actual scripts are done.
What's the best way or a way

678
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:40.340
that you would recommend to getting them produced?
Take getting them done.

679
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:44.220
<v 2>Okay.
This will be horrible.
What do you think you can take it?</v>

680
00:46:44.221 --> 00:46:47.130
Just take a guess even if it's the wrong gift.

681
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.031
<v 5>Sure.
For me,</v>

682
00:46:48.031 --> 00:46:53.031
like submitting to friends in the industry that are producers themselves or

683
00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:57.690
agents,
managers,
I submit to contests and stuff like that.

684
00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.850
<v 2>Okay.
All right.
Good.
But I'd augment that.</v>

685
00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.940
People don't really want to dredge through shit,

686
00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:06.720
so I think the best way,
if you're,

687
00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:11.350
if that would be the mechanics for you,
then you should know how to say it.

688
00:47:11.351 --> 00:47:14.140
In a really sexy way in like under a minute.

689
00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.190
<v 5>Got It.
Working on the pitch,
is that what you're saying?</v>

690
00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:17.981
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

691
00:47:17.981 --> 00:47:22.981
but work on like the sexiest hookey is like words that could be 30 seconds but

692
00:47:24.671 --> 00:47:28.510
it forces the person you're talking to ask questions.
Got It.

693
00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:32.770
People love talk but they only like to talk if they think you're interesting.

694
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:38.480
Okay,
cool.
Next question.
There you go.

695
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.460
So along the lines of that advice,

696
00:47:42.461 --> 00:47:46.480
can you give the audience an example of your sexiest pitch that you've done?

697
00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:47.830
I was just going to ask that.

698
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:52.480
Basically my career began when I,

699
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:56.770
while I was the law clerk and after Lou Wasserman said,
you better have ideas.

700
00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:58.870
There was this book,

701
00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:03.850
this Leonard Maltin is 10,000 titles of movies and movies for TV.

702
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:09.170
And I realized for me everything started with a title or a word and there are

703
00:48:09.171 --> 00:48:13.860
certain words that really wake you up like revenge.
There are certain few,

704
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:17.290
look at this if you look at,
so um,

705
00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:21.970
there are certain words that that are,
that are like accelerators,
you know,

706
00:48:21.971 --> 00:48:25.750
that wake you up and they make you go,
what does that mean?
Uh,

707
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:31.000
that have danger to them.
So I go through this book,
I get these words,

708
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:35.320
they then became titles or the ignition point of what my question would be.

709
00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:40.840
Um,
I mean I a beautiful mind.
I could do any of them.

710
00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:44.290
I mean you should ask me that.
I can do any,
any of them.

711
00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:48.540
I made three movies all in a year that we're all like young cause my,

712
00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:53.420
the studio dared me to make a small budget movie.
So I made Friday Night Lights,

713
00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:56.620
the movie Friday night lights,
blue crush about the,
you know,

714
00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:01.420
it's that good girl empowerment movie about three girls at surf on the north

715
00:49:01.421 --> 00:49:04.180
shore of Oahu and then,
um,

716
00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:09.370
eight mile and they're all like,
they all began with,

717
00:49:09.371 --> 00:49:14.080
did you know they all have they ever,
I looked at it like this.
You ever,

718
00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:16.930
what looks he watched 60 minutes has been around for 30 years.

719
00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:21.190
I thought to myself,
if I had to work for one of those guys,

720
00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:24.520
like Dan Rather or whatever,
and Dan rather goes,

721
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:29.380
he only has like a minute,
I'm like a junior.
Nobody.

722
00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:31.750
I said to everybody that works for me,
including myself.

723
00:49:31.751 --> 00:49:34.900
Like I have to pretend like I'm working for Dan Rather.

724
00:49:34.901 --> 00:49:36.550
And I got like one minute to say,

725
00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:41.050
did you know that this thing is going on in central Africa and Kang the Congo

726
00:49:41.051 --> 00:49:44.920
right now that Duh Duh Duh Duh.
Like you have to talk like that.

727
00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.350
That would be how I do it.
Okay.

728
00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:51.370
<v 7>Pr Hype.
And now,</v>

729
00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:54.750
and for those kind of battling it solution meant,
do you think that yeah,

730
00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.850
a medium for storytelling that's viable or do you think it's the money?

731
00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:01.080
<v 2>Well,
I liked your question.
That's a conclusion.</v>

732
00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:06.990
I really like it cause I feel similarly to you and like,
you know,

733
00:50:06.991 --> 00:50:11.820
I've sort of been on the same,
I met the guy that created Vr,
uh,
Jared,

734
00:50:11.821 --> 00:50:16.500
something like a literally 25 years ago in northern California.

735
00:50:16.501 --> 00:50:21.330
Anyway,
do I think it's,
um,
okay,
so I've been to every one of those places.

736
00:50:21.331 --> 00:50:22.530
Magic,
leap,
all that stuff.

737
00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:26.550
I think it interrupts emotionality and,
um,

738
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:30.710
opt k optimally what movies and television,

739
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:35.770
w optimally anything that becomes cinematic should it ignite emotion.

740
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:40.140
And when it ignites emotion,

741
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.510
it becomes indelible and then all of a sudden it becomes a memory that you care

742
00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:47.840
about,
you care to tell others affects you.
I have,

743
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.900
I think VR so far to my,

744
00:50:50.901 --> 00:50:54.440
in my experience that it interrupts narrative storytelling,

745
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:56.960
which is the map to emotion.

746
00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.860
So I'd like it to work,
but I don't,

747
00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.520
I haven't seen it yet work that way.

748
00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:09.540
<v 5>So I always got the vibe that in Hollywood there were tons of aspiring actors</v>

749
00:51:09.541 --> 00:51:13.410
and actresses who are,
you know,
um,
uh,
working minimum wage jobs,

750
00:51:13.411 --> 00:51:15.210
trying to quote unquote make it.
Um,

751
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:17.460
and probably the same thing with screenwriters.

752
00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.980
I always see a bunch of them and Starbucks and so forth.

753
00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:24.510
Are there any roles in Hollywood that you feel like there's actually a shortage

754
00:51:24.511 --> 00:51:28.140
of people for like if we had more of this type of person,

755
00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.270
moreover all stuff would get created?

756
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:35.440
<v 2>Anything other than straight American?
There's less up.</v>

757
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:39.790
There's two little rough.
Um,
and it's weird.
It's a very,

758
00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:43.640
it's a very,
the movie business,
which,
you know,
uh,

759
00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:46.450
is sort of positive,
you know,
sort of posited,

760
00:51:46.451 --> 00:51:49.450
are positioned to be like really liberal.
It,
I found it,

761
00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:53.560
it's not very liberal actually.
Um,
it's very ethnocentric.

762
00:51:53.561 --> 00:51:58.240
It's very judgmental.
It's kind of it's own hypocrite in my opinion.

763
00:51:58.810 --> 00:52:03.760
Um,
it lives in its own hypocrisy in that,
um,

764
00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:08.050
you know,
there's usually only one,
you know,
like Eddie Murphy,
I'll say,

765
00:52:08.051 --> 00:52:09.040
cause I don't want to say it's me.

766
00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:12.060
Eddie Murphy said there's only thing cause I made six movies.

767
00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:17.080
Eddie Murphy says there's only room for one black funny guy or there's only room

768
00:52:17.711 --> 00:52:22.210
for one fat funny guy.
You know,
there was fatty Arbuckle,
then there's this,

769
00:52:22.211 --> 00:52:25.030
then there's John Candy,
then there's Chris Farley.
There's just,

770
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:29.650
Hollywood doesn't have a lot of STC elasticity like that.

771
00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.490
It should.
Um,

772
00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:36.700
I mean that's my new quest of what I'm going to try to do is,

773
00:52:36.701 --> 00:52:39.850
uh,
not,
you know,

774
00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:43.120
that's why I like to go to like the Middle East and it's like I go to Latin

775
00:52:43.121 --> 00:52:46.690
America,
I like to be on the ground when you're on the ground.

776
00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:50.800
It's not just people are not data.
There are,

777
00:52:50.801 --> 00:52:55.510
you get to see and feel them and then you don't treat them.
Uh,
you don't,

778
00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:59.880
you don't make the Great Wall with Matt Damon.
And I mean it just like,

779
00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.830
they just thought,
okay,
these are the requirements.

780
00:53:02.831 --> 00:53:06.660
I'll make the Great Wall Chinese.
They'll love it.
Bang.
Put in Matt Damon.

781
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:09.640
It was just like,
you can't weld things into things.

782
00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:13.120
Incidentally,
I make a lot of mistakes and movies.

783
00:53:13.121 --> 00:53:16.450
I don't make that particular mistake,
but I,
uh,
you know,
as you know,

784
00:53:16.451 --> 00:53:18.460
my movies and television are fallible too.

785
00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:21.760
I have a good movie coming out by the way that you guys are handling.

786
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:26.580
It's called the spy that dumped me.
Um,
I'm not trying to just promote stuff,

787
00:53:26.581 --> 00:53:30.510
but it's pretty hip.
It's super funny.
Girl power movie stars,

788
00:53:30.511 --> 00:53:32.700
Kate Mckennon and Mila Kunis.

789
00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:37.920
And I know you got is cool and,
uh,
shot really well,
like great action.

790
00:53:37.921 --> 00:53:42.030
But it's funny,
these chicks are really funny.
Um,
and you guys are working on it.

791
00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:45.030
So that was the sexy pets right there.
There it goes.
Oh,

792
00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.710
thank you.
Come back.
Right.
All right.
I think I got a,

793
00:53:49.711 --> 00:53:51.060
I'm sure you guys all have to go.

794
00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:54.600
Thank you for being so polite and nice and everything.
Thank you so much,

795
00:53:54.601 --> 00:53:55.410
Brian Grazer.

796
00:53:55.410 --> 00:54:00.410
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
