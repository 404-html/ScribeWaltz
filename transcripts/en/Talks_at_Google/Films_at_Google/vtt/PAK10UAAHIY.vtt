WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.740
Kevin Buck and we have the directors of the box trolls.

2
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.100
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

3
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.880
<v 1>so Tony stocky and Graham a animal.
So I,</v>

4
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:19.770
let's take a look at the trailer for boxtrolls.

5
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.483
<v 2>Oh,</v>

6
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.890
oh,

7
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.900
they've got the flowers and the trees

8
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.530
and then,

9
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.070
<v 0>yeah.
First</v>

10
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.120
<v 1>of all,
thank you for inviting us.
Um,
and then,
uh,
you know,</v>

11
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:16.460
when we first saw that trailer that they were going to release,

12
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.170
we objected immediately.
We said,

13
00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:21.920
there's no way that you can show how we build the characters before the movie

14
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:26.120
even comes out.
Don't you all them at their faces off.
But in fact,

15
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:29.150
we were totally wrong because what people have found the most interesting about

16
00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:31.240
that,
and especially in the more and more we travel on Showpad,

17
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.980
is the fact that these are handmade objects.

18
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.030
That these are tangible things that really exist in the real world.
Um,

19
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.571
and you know,

20
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:42.860
every animator and every filmmaker's quest is to put together something that

21
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.250
nobody's ever seen before.
Something that,
that,
you know,

22
00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:47.510
it used to be like when we were young,

23
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:51.380
when you saw your first CG animated dinosaur running across a field or the water

24
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.410
tentacle in the abyss,

25
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:56.180
it seemed every few years and there was something else amazing that you've seen.

26
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.450
But nowadays we have so many amazing visual images that we see that it's become

27
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:05.530
sort of passe.
So our quest on this movie,
you know,

28
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:07.870
the fact that Alan's knows book here be monsters,

29
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:11.110
had this great Victorian setting and like a had been a studio,

30
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:15.100
they'd been together for three films at this point that we could put together

31
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:16.990
something that would be a visual sort of feast,

32
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:18.910
something that nobody had ever seen before.

33
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.340
<v 3>Yeah.
Uh,
you know,</v>

34
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.360
stop motion has a tendency to feel like it's shot on a tabletop set and that's

35
00:03:25.821 --> 00:03:29.080
because it's shot on a tabletop set.
Um,

36
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.840
and so we knew with a lot of lessons learned on Coraline and paranormal and we

37
00:03:32.841 --> 00:03:36.650
were going to find ways to try to bring a bigger sense of scope scale to the

38
00:03:36.651 --> 00:03:41.030
film.
We wanted this big comedic adventure,
the boxtrolls to,
to feel different.

39
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.640
And yet preserve what was special about stop motion.

40
00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:47.240
So it really approached this film is as a hybrid.
Uh,
you know,

41
00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:50.240
at its core it is stop motion,
it's still puppets and it still sets.

42
00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:53.890
But we found all kinds of new ways in different ways to integrate our VFX

43
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.100
department to bring that world to a larger scale than I think audiences are had

44
00:03:58.101 --> 00:03:59.930
ever seen before in a stop motion movie.

45
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.070
<v 1>And it all started about 10 years ago when like I bought the rights to Alan's</v>

46
00:04:04.071 --> 00:04:05.490
knows book here,
be monsters,

47
00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:09.900
which is a fantastic Dickensian steampunk tail sort of smashed together with a

48
00:04:09.901 --> 00:04:13.110
Monty python tone,
which we loved right away.

49
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.840
<v 3>Well Robin was love was the fact that it truly is a cast of thousands in a,</v>

50
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:19.471
in the book.

51
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:24.471
And part of Alan's knows appeal in his writing is that he is every page creating

52
00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:28.020
new characters to get the old characters that are the situations.

53
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:30.840
And we knew very early on we weren't going to be able to maintain that kind of

54
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.670
pace with building puppets.

55
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.620
So we eventually gravitated to the most compelling and mentioned that Alan had

56
00:04:37.621 --> 00:04:39.980
in the Bush book,
which was the boxtrolls.
Um,

57
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.830
and it was the emotional story of these little boxes,
all characters raising,
uh,

58
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.200
this character Arthur in the book that became the heart of the story and was

59
00:04:49.201 --> 00:04:53.300
what we rallied around and it sort of became a rule.
Uh,

60
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.740
Travis describes it as ruthless economy.

61
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.480
Once we knew that that emotional story was the boxtrolls and eggs,

62
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.970
the everything else had to get thrown out and it can only creep back into the

63
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.200
movie,
fight its way back into the story.
Yeah.

64
00:05:07.201 --> 00:05:10.890
If it's supported that emotional core,
but it's a long journey.

65
00:05:10.891 --> 00:05:13.980
Figuring out stories.
I mean here be monsters was

66
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.120
bought at like at the same time as core line.

67
00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:20.760
So it's been pretty much 10 years to get to this point.

68
00:05:20.761 --> 00:05:21.780
I'm actually making the film

69
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.170
<v 1>and you know,
every animated film is storyboarded first.</v>

70
00:05:24.171 --> 00:05:26.810
That's the way we get to make the film.
Before we make the film,

71
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.310
we storyboard the whole thing out.

72
00:05:28.311 --> 00:05:32.240
We record 10 voices to figure out our performances before we actually go to the

73
00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:34.130
final actors.
And get there,
you know,

74
00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:38.870
go to Sir Ben Kingsley or Nick Frost or Simon Pegg and then get the final voices

75
00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:42.410
which we need before we commence animation,
so we spend a long time,

76
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.890
each story real is like a rewrite is like rewriting the script and you've see if

77
00:05:45.891 --> 00:05:48.650
the story works and then you present it to everybody at the studio.

78
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.300
So in this process,

79
00:05:50.301 --> 00:05:53.720
what you're always looking forward for that one sequence where you feel this is

80
00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:55.550
the movie,
this has the emotional tone,

81
00:05:55.551 --> 00:05:59.510
the action tone has that you want the final movie to have because once you have

82
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:02.630
that one sequence that really works,
we call it the tent pole sequence.

83
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.380
Then you throw everything else out and you start over building out from that one

84
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:08.360
sequence and early on in the process.

85
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.780
This sequence here was the one that was that tentpole sequence

86
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.973
<v 0>roles.</v>

87
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.430
Where'd it go?
Turn around.
Moving.

88
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.163
Okay.

89
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.600
<v 1>Yeah.
There was a lot of things that we loved about the sequence,</v>

90
00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:35.840
the relationship between the boxtrolls and the baby and stuff that just gave us

91
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.160
this little bread crumbs.
We needed to find the core of the story.

92
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.450
But the funny thing was story of course is that yeah,

93
00:09:41.451 --> 00:09:45.290
we basically threw everything out that came before the sequence.

94
00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:48.530
Everything that came after the sequence and built the whole movie from this

95
00:09:48.531 --> 00:09:52.420
sequence because this was working and within about three months we cut this

96
00:09:52.421 --> 00:09:56.600
sequence.
It's just kind of the way it goes,
but it allows you that step.

97
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.550
It pointed us in the direction down the road.

98
00:09:58.551 --> 00:10:01.800
We knew we needed to go with the movie and so yeah,
there's a great,

99
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.620
there's a famous guy,

100
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.260
Joe ramped who's ahead of story at Pixar for years and a lot of other places and

101
00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.050
he always used to teach that you have to trust the process even though it feels

102
00:10:12.051 --> 00:10:15.230
like you're not making any progress and that you've gone down another dead end

103
00:10:15.231 --> 00:10:18.770
or something like that than if you just trust in the process that you are making

104
00:10:18.771 --> 00:10:20.420
progress and you will find the story.

105
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.530
So we felt on track with the story at this point and we moved on for what we

106
00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:29.531
call the look of picture and when we immediately on reading the book we'd

107
00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:31.550
thought of a few artists we wanted to work with.

108
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.340
We started to work with a French artist named Nicola de Cressey use,

109
00:10:34.341 --> 00:10:38.780
a French graphic novelist who has an amazing ability to draw images of these

110
00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:39.920
great European cities.

111
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.830
He hasn't really great shape language that he draws in and there's this

112
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.110
beautiful line quality and the ways he draws.

113
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.440
So we worked with him for a few weeks to get some inspirational sketches.

114
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.460
He's definitely the best person in the world that drunk piles of junk,

115
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:57.290
which was a real boon for us.
He also did this image of a,

116
00:10:57.291 --> 00:11:01.550
of a chandelier made by the boxtrolls underground and it's a,
you know,

117
00:11:01.551 --> 00:11:04.640
it's from light bulbs that they've collected in the garbage and wires that

118
00:11:04.641 --> 00:11:05.430
they've found and stuff.

119
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.030
And there was something about this image that really struck home with us and

120
00:11:08.031 --> 00:11:08.864
Travis Knight,

121
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:13.070
I'm the CEO of like a where we loved the idea of this thing.

122
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.130
We loved getting to know the characters who would build something like this.

123
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.250
And we all looked forward to the people that like are actually building

124
00:11:19.251 --> 00:11:22.000
something like this with their amazing abilities.
Um,

125
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.920
so we moved forward from there and we had a guy,

126
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.090
a guy named Michelle Burton who had worked on Coraline previously at the studio

127
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.870
and he began to hone all of these ideas into what we call the look of picture

128
00:11:32.871 --> 00:11:37.010
book.
And it's a book that we hand out to all 400 people who work on the job

129
00:11:37.011 --> 00:11:40.450
eventually in the fabrication department,
in the puppet department and,

130
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.900
and all the rigging department.

131
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.830
So they know the set of rules that everything in the movie has to go by,

132
00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:48.350
whether it's a,
a torque shape that's twisting,

133
00:11:48.351 --> 00:11:51.500
a little has thick and thin lines on it has color and stuff.

134
00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:54.931
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

135
00:11:54.931 --> 00:11:57.760
And it was a real challenge for the art department to figure out ways that Wa,

136
00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.673
you know,

137
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.700
a huge part of what Michelle does so well is his line work as you can see in

138
00:12:02.701 --> 00:12:03.300
this image.

139
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:08.040
And they had to find all kinds of ways to represent that wonky realism that

140
00:12:08.041 --> 00:12:11.010
Michelle brought to everything through his line work.
And the scale of,

141
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.210
of this film was going to be a huge challenge,
but a Kurd annually,

142
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:20.390
our art director was able to find ways using shadows and shapes and color,

143
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:21.030
um,

144
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:26.030
buildings beyond just twisted light poles and chandelier is to find ways to

145
00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.980
bring that shape language that Michelle had created into the film.

146
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:30.840
<v 4>Okay.</v>

147
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.441
<v 3>This is a love that,</v>

148
00:12:31.441 --> 00:12:34.410
this is the Portland Ryan's for ea of the building and it's another chandelier.

149
00:12:34.411 --> 00:12:35.640
I clearly love chandelier.

150
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.780
This chandelier was built by Kurt in the art department on a twisted wire and

151
00:12:39.781 --> 00:12:42.300
stuff.
So that became the first object that we really loved.

152
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.290
The thought captured Michelle's drawing style in the world of the film because

153
00:12:46.291 --> 00:12:49.410
you don't get anything free and animation,
and particularly in stop motion,

154
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.760
anything that appears in front of the camera has to be built.
It has to be made.

155
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.510
We don't inherit any of the prompts from paranorman or Coraline because they're

156
00:12:57.511 --> 00:12:59.040
done in a different style.
Yeah.

157
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.080
So once the image is started to land in black and white,
um,

158
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.210
we move forward with policy and great matte painter and production designer in

159
00:13:06.211 --> 00:13:06.840
La.

160
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.860
And we definitely wanted to make a stop motion movie that wasn't too dark beyond

161
00:13:10.861 --> 00:13:14.190
just making a stop motion movie that felt bigger in terms of scale.

162
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:18.780
We also wanted to see what we can do to bring brightness color to a stop motion

163
00:13:18.781 --> 00:13:19.081
feature.

164
00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:23.370
Cause that's another aspect of it that they tend to have saturated pallets and a

165
00:13:23.371 --> 00:13:27.780
lot of stop motion movies and it's great.
It's wonderful.
It's an effective thing.

166
00:13:27.781 --> 00:13:30.750
But we really wanted to see and push the studio to try to do something a little

167
00:13:30.751 --> 00:13:31.584
more colorful.

168
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.040
And Paula saying was the perfect guy to bring that to the film he had,

169
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.280
he'd worked on Dick Tracy.
He really knew how to bring color into things.

170
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:40.700
He also did a great job of,
um,

171
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.950
color styling the Boxville cabin because the bookstore cavern itself as a

172
00:13:43.951 --> 00:13:47.130
location is almost a character in the film because at the beginning of the film,

173
00:13:47.131 --> 00:13:50.820
it's supposed to be a warm,
inviting place where the,
the hero eggs is raised.

174
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.220
But it's little by little,
it becomes a depressing,

175
00:13:53.221 --> 00:13:57.000
drab place as more and more Brock strolls are kidnapped by the men and red hats.

176
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.760
So he did a great job.
We did that predominantly through light and color.
Yeah.

177
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.520
Now it's found yourselves in a weird spot because usually when you develop a

178
00:14:05.521 --> 00:14:09.180
feature,
you kind of start with your characters and your character design first.

179
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.390
And then the world kind of begins around that.
But Michelle,

180
00:14:12.391 --> 00:14:16.950
Paul and Tom [inaudible] had done such a tremendous job and quickly figuring out

181
00:14:16.951 --> 00:14:19.530
the shape,
language and realizing the world we had the world before.

182
00:14:19.531 --> 00:14:20.850
We really had the characters nailed.

183
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:25.170
And that put Mike Smith and amazing two d animator in the interesting position

184
00:14:25.171 --> 00:14:29.760
of utilizing what he saw in Michele's world to bring characters that would fit

185
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.100
within it.
Um,

186
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:35.490
and he worked much like Michelle had done where he worked in silhouette first

187
00:14:35.491 --> 00:14:38.160
and began to then put in the details and get that again,

188
00:14:38.161 --> 00:14:42.270
that shape language to show up in the actual characters as well as the buildings

189
00:14:42.271 --> 00:14:43.440
and the,
and the world around them.

190
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.830
And we were still going through a lot of story changes at one point.
Um,

191
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.220
rather than having an allergy to cheese,
um,
snapchat had a really bad case of x,

192
00:14:51.221 --> 00:14:52.100
y a phobia.

193
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.900
<v 1>He was afraid of horses,</v>

194
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.000
but he dreamed of being the man on a horse who rides into town and is creating,

195
00:14:58.001 --> 00:15:00.410
you know,
and it's met as a hero and stuff.

196
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:04.070
So that was another sort of dead end we went through in story when we kind of

197
00:15:04.071 --> 00:15:08.000
struck upon this idea of him having this cheese allergy,
which isn't in the book,

198
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:09.810
but it's similar to something in the book.
Um,

199
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.640
we knew it would be a huge test of the department that makes the faces for our

200
00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:16.220
movie.
Um,
also in the storyboarding process,

201
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.490
we fell in love with all these ideas of what the box stores could do with their

202
00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:20.241
boxes.
Yeah.

203
00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:23.350
Initially the puppet department was really excited when this project got green

204
00:15:23.351 --> 00:15:24.680
lit because they were like,
wow,

205
00:15:24.681 --> 00:15:28.280
finally a movie where we've gotten a lot of the main characters wearing a

206
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.990
massive boxes,
we can just hide all the mechanics in there.

207
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.320
This is going to be a breeze.
Uh,

208
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:37.100
I quickly turned into a nightmare for them because as the board's evolved and as

209
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:38.000
the story evolved,

210
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.960
we just kept putting the boxtrolls into situations where we had more and more

211
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:44.000
special case things that they needed to do.

212
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.260
And they very soon realized there was no way they were going to be able to fit

213
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.830
into it and had to come up with a lot of innovative methods to,
uh,

214
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.250
to get the boxtrolls to feel and look and work for the story.
You know,

215
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.860
the boxtrolls hide in their boxes.
So the way that's done,

216
00:15:57.861 --> 00:16:01.040
because there was so much rigging inside the boxtrolls boxes,

217
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.590
their arms can actually retract into the boxes.

218
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.720
There's enough movement in the shoulders or the arms,

219
00:16:05.721 --> 00:16:07.040
so they can begin the motion in,

220
00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:10.100
but then there's shorter and shorter arms are made to click on.

221
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.580
So it looks like they retract into the box the same as the head.

222
00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:17.480
The head can begin its motion down and then there's smaller and smaller heads

223
00:16:17.481 --> 00:16:20.000
that you click on.
So they appear to disappear into their boxes,

224
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.080
which is one reason why an animation you do things fast because then you use

225
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:27.680
fewer and fewer in between frames to get where you want to go.
Quick is good.

226
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.890
Yeah.
But even before then we wanted to,
we wanted to,
there's an old,

227
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.860
there's an old test that you do in animation was you animate a flour sack,

228
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.520
just a flour sack to see if you can give it personality and you can give it

229
00:16:37.521 --> 00:16:38.660
expression and emotion.

230
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.110
You can make the flour sacks of sag or be excited and stuff.

231
00:16:42.111 --> 00:16:45.350
So we wanted that kind of bend to bill in the,
in our hard boxes too.

232
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.200
So then it became a long run of testing boxes.

233
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.910
So this is what we did for months.
We played with cardboard boxes

234
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.790
and then were also trying to find a material that would look like cardboard.

235
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.760
<v 4>Okay.</v>

236
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.490
<v 1>And not be too rigid.
Yeah.
Originally they didn't try using cardboard,</v>

237
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:05.001
but it just,

238
00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:08.960
there was no way it was going to hold up to the rigorous shooting schedule.

239
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.260
So this is an early task where we're getting the amount of movement that we

240
00:17:12.261 --> 00:17:13.070
wanted out of them.

241
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:16.670
We'd also done tests where they moved like chimpanzees or move like different

242
00:17:16.671 --> 00:17:20.150
animals,
but more and more we found that their character came through

243
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.950
much better if you kept it simple.

244
00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.140
<v 4>Okay.</v>

245
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.470
<v 1>This was the first test that made us all think,
oh,
we made it not be idiot.</v>

246
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.710
This might actually work because he was such a lovable little guy.

247
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:38.620
We also combined a few other extinct forms of animation at Laika.
Um,

248
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.300
we do a lot of two d animation,
traditional hand drawn animation in our process.

249
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.950
Yeah,
it's interesting.
I mean it's all tied into our RP process.

250
00:17:46.951 --> 00:17:50.520
The face replacement animation that we do and it utilizes

251
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.210
<v 3>right from the beginning of the model sheets of the expressions that are drawn</v>

252
00:17:54.211 --> 00:17:57.990
in two d are then handed to uh,
an excellent two d animator,

253
00:17:57.991 --> 00:18:00.970
David Vandervort in the studio who,
uh,

254
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.030
fully animates and pencil tests,
uh,

255
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.300
the complete range of each character's emotion.

256
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.900
Like try to figure out exactly how extreme all the face masses are going to move

257
00:18:09.901 --> 00:18:12.510
for each character,
happiest,
angriest,

258
00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:15.060
all the expressions they could possibly do using,

259
00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:17.700
usually hopefully finished dialogue if we have it available.

260
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.220
And that then that two d animation then becomes the guide that is handed over to

261
00:18:23.221 --> 00:18:25.740
the CGI Three d animators and Maya,

262
00:18:25.741 --> 00:18:30.390
who then begin to build the faces in the computer digitally and get all the face

263
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.500
expressions working.

264
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:37.100
And then that once that gets approved by the directors becomes the faces that

265
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.800
get printed physically out of the three d printer and then get put onto the

266
00:18:40.801 --> 00:18:41.634
puppet.

267
00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:46.920
And this is an example of the faces that are printed from the gun and we print

268
00:18:46.921 --> 00:18:49.080
these by thousands.
Yeah.
For eggs.

269
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.490
Real nuance of change of x had about 15,000 pieces created for his face,

270
00:18:53.491 --> 00:18:56.280
for the film,
which in different combinations,

271
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.820
because they're usually actually typically split between the brow and the mouth.

272
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.050
And so all those different combinations with the 15,000 pieces allowed for about

273
00:19:04.051 --> 00:19:08.790
1.4 million possible expressions,
which I think I've got about six.

274
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.690
So exit is a little ahead of me and there's a whole like Dewey decimal system of

275
00:19:12.691 --> 00:19:15.600
how we track these things of what the expression is doing.

276
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.850
Usually the faces are split along here,

277
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.370
so you have different eyebrows that can go along with different miles.

278
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.270
And there's a whole room that we call the face library where there was boxes of

279
00:19:24.271 --> 00:19:28.170
these that are basically like a pizza box and they're full of phase after phase

280
00:19:28.171 --> 00:19:31.080
after phase,
we have a little clip that shows you the process.

281
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.710
If I get this back on,

282
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.950
<v 5>mate,
cue you mate.
Yeah.</v>

283
00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:46.060
We knew from from paranorman that you know,

284
00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:49.210
we had this color printing process that worked really well,

285
00:19:49.211 --> 00:19:53.890
but it worked well to produce some naturalistic skin tones and now looking at

286
00:19:53.891 --> 00:19:58.210
these really vibrant sort of theatrical paint jobs that the directors wanted on

287
00:19:58.211 --> 00:20:00.730
box trolls.
We were sort of scratching your head saying,

288
00:20:00.731 --> 00:20:02.260
well in theory the machines can do it,

289
00:20:02.261 --> 00:20:06.040
but we don't really know if they can do it and maybe they can do at once,

290
00:20:06.041 --> 00:20:08.770
but are they going to be repeatable?
If you get a beautiful paint job,

291
00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.720
how has that paint job going to animate?

292
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:14.710
And we came up with a way to do it and it worked really well.

293
00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.800
Looking at how we were able to improve the process on Paranorman and then

294
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.370
looking at this script to boxtrolls and he's really specialty story moments.

295
00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:29.950
We needed to have something unique.
Then allergies.

296
00:20:29.951 --> 00:20:33.260
Snatcher is a perfect example of that.
Their scores.

297
00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.880
His face has so much swollen weirdness to it that having him say a line of

298
00:20:38.981 --> 00:20:39.491
dialogue,

299
00:20:39.491 --> 00:20:43.250
you get so much follow through with his cheeks and his lips shopping on the

300
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.430
torsion that it really,

301
00:20:45.431 --> 00:20:48.910
we learned very early on that there was way that we can try to recycle these

302
00:20:48.911 --> 00:20:52.830
poses.
You don't Tuck Joel,
hey,

303
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:56.800
so what we decided to do was tackle every single one of allergy snatcher shots

304
00:20:56.801 --> 00:21:01.750
as its own unique animation and then we would have to print out those faces,

305
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.400
faces.
They were so big,

306
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.810
we were only able to print 12 faces and 12 hours and how many can you usually do

307
00:21:07.811 --> 00:21:11.380
in 12 hours?
Probably 150 of like eggs as an example,

308
00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:14.320
not like them.

309
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:20.470
You have no idea that this thing that you're watching,

310
00:21:20.471 --> 00:21:24.970
this creature is not real because of the amount of nuance and subtlety and

311
00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:27.610
naturalism that we were able to put into these faces.

312
00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:29.830
They feel like they're really little creatures.

313
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:34.540
Would skin and movable muscles and volume change and will you pick them up and

314
00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:38.020
you tap on their faces?
They're just a hard plaster that isn't movable.

315
00:21:38.021 --> 00:21:41.800
But through replacement animation,
we get some really lovely and smooth animation

316
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.900
<v 1>so that,
so that's,</v>

317
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.640
that's probably the most high tech element we've added to stop motion stop

318
00:21:51.641 --> 00:21:55.060
motion is,
is a,
is a technique that is old oldest cinema itself.

319
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:58.870
I mean George Mellie is the French great French signup filmmaker was doing it at

320
00:21:58.871 --> 00:22:02.110
the turn of the century and stuff.
And then there's been a long line of,

321
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.320
of individuals throughout cinema who've continued to move it forward.

322
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.100
George Powell did replacement animation in the 30s and forties and stuff.

323
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.910
And then what Travis has done it like,

324
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.560
or his vision for like it is to try to take this group of people,

325
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:19.210
which he likes to describe as Luddites and futurists and have them share more

326
00:22:19.211 --> 00:22:22.570
than a parking lot,
having them share a whole studio.

327
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:27.010
And early on they brought this rapid prototype process to Coraline and at first

328
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.700
the faces were only printed in black and white and they had to be hand painted.

329
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.910
And then on Paranorman they were able to print them with a little bit of color

330
00:22:33.911 --> 00:22:37.780
on them.
Um,
freckles and a little bit of rouge on the cheeks and stuff.

331
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.900
And then for our film it took another great leap forward.
As you can see,

332
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:43.590
these faces are very elaborately colored.
Yeah.

333
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:46.760
It creates a kind of bizarre step in our process.

334
00:22:46.761 --> 00:22:51.480
So it definitely has directors is then there's a phase where we approved

335
00:22:51.481 --> 00:22:56.150
storyboards and the story real.
Uh,
and then when the RP folks get involved,
uh,

336
00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.310
it's an interesting thing for the animators because it sort of divvies up their

337
00:23:00.311 --> 00:23:01.780
performance,
their overall performance.

338
00:23:01.781 --> 00:23:06.781
They need to basically sit down with their assigned shot in storyboard form and

339
00:23:07.271 --> 00:23:09.550
begin to visualize the entire performance.

340
00:23:09.551 --> 00:23:14.410
But focus just on the face performance up front because productionwise those

341
00:23:14.411 --> 00:23:18.610
faces need to get signed off on and approved and then printed so that they're

342
00:23:18.611 --> 00:23:19.510
ready for the stage.

343
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:23.470
May Be anywhere from one or two weeks to two months down the line.

344
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.340
And so they need to sort of figure out their entire face performance up front,

345
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:32.800
get us to sign off on it and then find themselves two months later sitting with

346
00:23:32.801 --> 00:23:35.080
that pizza tray with the faces that they chose.

347
00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:38.590
We all toes a few months ago and make sure that the performance they had in

348
00:23:38.591 --> 00:23:41.380
their head that was going to work with that face all comes together.

349
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.730
And the way they get us to sign off on it is they send us what we call a play

350
00:23:44.731 --> 00:23:49.430
blast,
which is there Maya animation,
three d CG animation of the face shapes.

351
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.760
They send it to editorial and we cut it into the story reels on top of the

352
00:23:52.761 --> 00:23:53.600
storyboard drawings.

353
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.253
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

354
00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:02.190
<v 1>So this is the Maya animation of the faces prior to being printed out.</v>

355
00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.530
So we look at the performance on here

356
00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:10.650
and we can add in betweens or say this a little bit further and oftentimes later

357
00:24:10.651 --> 00:24:14.640
in the seed production cycle will how already have these printed faces.

358
00:24:14.641 --> 00:24:19.420
So we'll say use those faces that we used in sequence 32,
um,
where,
uh,

359
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.790
you know,
fish's face was much more angry.
Use those mouths.
And it's really a,

360
00:24:23.791 --> 00:24:25.140
it's a,
it's an amazing,
you know,

361
00:24:25.141 --> 00:24:28.590
we say it sometimes it's animation by librarians because it's amazing that

362
00:24:28.591 --> 00:24:31.740
they've made these many faces that can move in and out of so many different

363
00:24:31.741 --> 00:24:33.240
poses without there being a pop.

364
00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.960
There was a moment right there where you see face a fish's face kind of stretch

365
00:24:36.961 --> 00:24:37.800
a bit with the nose.

366
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.120
That's because the animator wanted to try to have a little rub with the puppet

367
00:24:42.121 --> 00:24:44.160
hand on the face.
Uh,

368
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.390
when he went was we're going to be out on the stage with the final uh,
puppet.

369
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:49.800
But that's like,
again,

370
00:24:49.801 --> 00:24:52.920
that's scary sort of commitment upfront because he's got to figure out guests at

371
00:24:52.921 --> 00:24:56.130
the time and he's going to use for how long that hand's going to rub that face.

372
00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.800
And we all again have to sort of commit up front to like,

373
00:24:58.801 --> 00:25:00.570
that's the faces we're going to use for this.

374
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.050
And here's the final version of it when the faces are actually all together.

375
00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:05.883
<v 0>Okay.</v>

376
00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:12.483
Eh,

377
00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.210
that's the final shot of that.

378
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.721
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

379
00:26:06.721 --> 00:26:10.380
One of the things we do in our process as well as we have breakdown meetings,

380
00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.000
which is where all the heads,

381
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:15.090
all the futurists and all the Luddites and the heads of their departments come

382
00:26:15.091 --> 00:26:19.080
together for the meeting where we break down each sequence of the film shot by

383
00:26:19.081 --> 00:26:23.910
shot.
And it's always kind of an incredible process and very energetic meetings.

384
00:26:23.911 --> 00:26:27.720
Everybody comes in there with their homework already done and it shot by shot.

385
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:31.530
Different departments are vying for why they should or shouldn't be involved in

386
00:26:31.531 --> 00:26:34.920
each piece and who's gonna do what basically.
And again,

387
00:26:34.921 --> 00:26:39.921
because this film right from the get go was going to be a hybrid and a real use

388
00:26:40.021 --> 00:26:43.680
and of the VFX department,
uh,
you know,

389
00:26:43.681 --> 00:26:46.500
the digital guys were involved heavily with the whole process.

390
00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:50.100
But at the end of the day it always came down to what delivered the style of the

391
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:50.934
film best.

392
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:55.470
And so we had a lot of surprising inventions always from our rigging and,

393
00:26:55.471 --> 00:26:59.520
and puppet departments where practical effects showed up in places where we

394
00:26:59.521 --> 00:27:01.980
didn't even anticipate.
Yeah.
For me,
I,

395
00:27:01.981 --> 00:27:05.250
I've worked in stock stop motion a little bit in my past,

396
00:27:05.251 --> 00:27:08.790
but prior to that I mostly worked on CG films and usually on a CG film,
you know,

397
00:27:08.791 --> 00:27:11.520
the issues that you're going to confront.
We need for,
we need wet for,

398
00:27:11.521 --> 00:27:14.260
we need a snow storm,
we need to develop all this stuff.
Um,

399
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.250
when I was really surprised at the culture at [inaudible] is a lot of those

400
00:27:17.251 --> 00:27:19.110
decisions are made till the 11th hour.

401
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.320
You have this break meeting and people are still discussing how are we going to

402
00:27:22.321 --> 00:27:24.480
do the water in the sewer?
And I can't,
you know,

403
00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:28.350
I know we're going into production on that shot and I could never get used to

404
00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:29.670
the fact that it weighed into this,

405
00:27:29.671 --> 00:27:31.800
this late hour for this meeting for to happen.

406
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.280
There's a shot in the movie of eggs in the sewer and he's going to go above

407
00:27:35.281 --> 00:27:35.641
ground.

408
00:27:35.641 --> 00:27:39.240
And usually in something like that you would use CG to do water because water's

409
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:42.480
very difficult to do in any kind of traditional form of animation stuff.

410
00:27:42.481 --> 00:27:46.410
But at this meeting we ended up having a totally different way of it being done.

411
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:47.303
Yeah,

412
00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.310
<v 7>there's nothing that exists before we start on one of these films.</v>

413
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:06.480
Every single thing that you see has got to be designed and built by hand.

414
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.140
You don't get anything for free and stop motion.

415
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:15.530
We've really got to plan out every single element and that goes as far as the

416
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.320
fire and the smoke and water and all the natural elements that you see on

417
00:28:21.811 --> 00:28:25.890
screen.
Tell me an art director.
It's awesome.

418
00:28:25.891 --> 00:28:29.670
I mean how often do you get to create everything?

419
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.950
I mean that's an incredible sense of power.

420
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.770
One of the things is incredibly difficult to do.

421
00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:39.660
Stop motion film is bring the environment to live in a believable way and it's

422
00:28:39.661 --> 00:28:42.630
something that was very important for us in this film to have that level of

423
00:28:42.631 --> 00:28:43.464
atmosphere.

424
00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.620
<v 8>We talk about what's water going to look like,
what's the destruction,</v>

425
00:28:48.621 --> 00:28:50.150
what's dusk going to look like,

426
00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:54.410
what are the materials that we would use to create these images and that's where

427
00:28:54.411 --> 00:28:56.770
we start your calling change night cha.

428
00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:01.730
We created this entire sewer system with flowing water and dripping water out of

429
00:29:01.731 --> 00:29:03.380
just plastic and glass.

430
00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:08.030
What we have behind me is a sheet of glass that has ripples in it and it's made

431
00:29:08.031 --> 00:29:11.180
from shower glass and that's passing from left to right.

432
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.650
And that's given us half the flow.

433
00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:17.750
And then what we've done is we've created a little nest out mirrors and wires

434
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:19.670
and good sip blue masking tape.

435
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.870
And so what we're seeing is we're seeing the effect of the ripple glass passing

436
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.870
over those wires and mirrors.

437
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:31.920
And that's given us the illusion of the highlights above ground [inaudible],

438
00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:37.170
the 24 25 different kinds of weeds that we have growing in cheese bridge are all

439
00:29:37.251 --> 00:29:40.940
specific weeds,
but yet they're sort of stylized in a way,

440
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.280
puts them into our world,

441
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.870
which I think is the important thing a new species ever seen before

442
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:51.120
<v 9>for the fire.
We did a lot of early tests on uh,
with using cheese cloth.</v>

443
00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:55.590
Our rigging department with did this amazing series of flames and this amazing

444
00:29:55.591 --> 00:29:58.740
fire and I've just using suspended upside down.

445
00:29:58.741 --> 00:30:01.770
She's cloth hit with that kind of have this orange yellowish light.

446
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.903
I looked incredible.

447
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:10.500
<v 8>The attraction to making like natural elements is harshly the challenge of</v>

448
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:13.400
taking on nature.

449
00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:18.010
You just become more appreciative of things you take for granted by delving so

450
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:19.460
much deeper into the subject.

451
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:23.781
And when you've got it,

452
00:30:23.781 --> 00:30:27.830
you just feel like you're kind of neck and neck with nature.
There's quiet,

453
00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.340
empowering feeling about it,
trying to emulate nature

454
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.180
<v 1>in the end.
It doesn't matter how you get there,</v>

455
00:30:40.181 --> 00:30:42.910
as long as you can reproduce the style of the film the best way.

456
00:30:42.911 --> 00:30:45.220
So every film is different,
you know,

457
00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:47.800
a lot of special effects houses and their goal is to have everything and look

458
00:30:47.801 --> 00:30:50.890
realistic to look real for RV effects department.

459
00:30:50.891 --> 00:30:53.560
Their problem is that every film is stylistically different.

460
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:55.090
So they need to make it look like that.

461
00:30:55.091 --> 00:30:58.540
Like we use CG extra characters in the background and they have to be

462
00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:03.070
indistinguishable from these puppets and all of their texture and form and all

463
00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:04.070
the effects has to do that.

464
00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:08.550
Probably not a frame in the film that doesn't have some sort of CG,
um,

465
00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:12.220
assistance to it.
Whether it's compositing or adding atmosphere and stuff.

466
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.220
We've got three

467
00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:13.641
<v 3>clips here.</v>

468
00:31:13.641 --> 00:31:16.970
They give you a sense of just how much did the effects department helped out in

469
00:31:16.971 --> 00:31:21.280
certain sequences.
Now the core of every sequence is always at the core of it.

470
00:31:21.281 --> 00:31:24.890
It is a stop motion feature because it is always puppets and anything that they

471
00:31:24.891 --> 00:31:27.110
touch and interact with his physical as a set

472
00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:32.260
<v 1>rig removal.
Then adding the farm background,
far distant atmosphere,</v>

473
00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.120
closer atmosphere.

474
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:37.840
Then we start to drop into CG city because they're not going to interact with

475
00:31:37.841 --> 00:31:38.830
the city.
In this shot.

476
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.430
Then is the atmosphere between the characters and the camera.

477
00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.760
There's an all CG city all rendered on style.
Now.

478
00:31:45.761 --> 00:31:48.580
We built a lot of those buildings whenever the characters had to interact with

479
00:31:48.581 --> 00:31:52.000
them,
but in this scene they had to match the look of those built buildings,

480
00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.670
adding more atmosphere and chimney smoke.

481
00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:00.180
Here's the red hats,
pursuing eggs,
fish and shoe.

482
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:05.270
Their animation element is comped in the far background with cheesecloth crowd

483
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.900
clouds that were generated by the art department and then we put in more

484
00:32:08.901 --> 00:32:13.130
atmosphere in the city.
Now this next shot,
everything that the character's touch,

485
00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:17.180
every rooftop and stuff is real,
but everything else is CG set extension

486
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:20.680
<v 4>rig removal.</v>

487
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:23.861
<v 3>This film too,</v>

488
00:32:23.861 --> 00:32:27.850
we used extensively a previous department to help for a lot of these action

489
00:32:27.851 --> 00:32:32.851
sequences to really figure out the scope of each of the shots and to maximize or

490
00:32:34.451 --> 00:32:36.790
minimize how much overbuilding would happen.

491
00:32:36.791 --> 00:32:40.010
So we knew exactly what the characters are going to interact with before we

492
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.560
<v 1>went out to the sets and how much coverage we were going to need.</v>

493
00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:48.330
And that's important to bear.
Took,
took a few months,
uh,

494
00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:51.370
the board and figure out and stuff and we thought,
oh yeah,
secret 700.

495
00:32:51.371 --> 00:32:53.860
That's how we know the mother names sequence 700.

496
00:32:53.861 --> 00:32:56.950
That's going to be the hardest to rooftop chase or sequence 2150.

497
00:32:56.951 --> 00:32:58.180
The battle at the end of the movie,

498
00:32:58.181 --> 00:33:00.910
we're snatcher destroys the market square in the giant Mecca drill.

499
00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.560
Now that'll be the hardest one.

500
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.610
And we were wrong both times cause we didn't have any idea what we were doing.

501
00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:07.390
Yeah.

502
00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:11.890
The hardest thing to do in the boxtrolls and far and away was ballroom dancing.

503
00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:17.620
Nearly killed the studio.
Yeah.
That really kind of caught us off guard and a,

504
00:33:17.621 --> 00:33:22.300
and it really did Max out every department in the building and as described

505
00:33:22.301 --> 00:33:24.160
earlier,
the breakdown meetings that we have,

506
00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:29.040
this is I was when Tony and I realized we were in a lot of trouble because
again,

507
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:33.520
those meetings,
just coffee and cookies and everybody's chatting and it's very,

508
00:33:33.521 --> 00:33:35.020
it's got a lot of energy to it.

509
00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:38.800
We walked into the room for the breakdown meeting for the dance sequence.

510
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:43.810
Dead quiet,
nobody was talking.
No one would even make eye contact with us.

511
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.870
Everyone they knew better than we knew.
Yeah.

512
00:33:46.871 --> 00:33:49.300
They all just were quietly leafing through their packets,

513
00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:54.400
looking at each other like,
we can't,
how do we do this?
Every,

514
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.140
every department?
It was a difficult thing to storyboard is a great store,

515
00:33:57.141 --> 00:34:00.290
burned on a Emmanuella Cozzi who boarded the whole sequence.

516
00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:02.600
Then Darrio Marinelli be a composer,

517
00:34:02.601 --> 00:34:06.320
had to write a brand new waltz and also make it score in different places.

518
00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:08.990
A little bit more romantic,
a little bit more action oriented.

519
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.280
And then we are hired to choreographers from the Portland ballet to come out and

520
00:34:13.281 --> 00:34:17.420
reproduce the entire dance sequence on one of our stages and we shot it there.

521
00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:20.150
Then we did a CG pre-visit of that too,

522
00:34:20.151 --> 00:34:23.570
so we could figure out the speed of the camera rotations and movement as were

523
00:34:23.571 --> 00:34:25.450
swirling amongst the dancers.
Um,

524
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:28.870
and then the animation people had to come in and figure out a way to make the

525
00:34:28.871 --> 00:34:32.750
skirts on the female characters that they could dance with because underneath

526
00:34:32.751 --> 00:34:34.880
those skirts and there are no legs and stuff,

527
00:34:34.881 --> 00:34:36.650
there's just like a slinky apparatus.

528
00:34:36.651 --> 00:34:38.990
So you make the skirt go up and down and swirl around.

529
00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:43.340
There was even a shot in the middle of the sequence where eggs hides underneath

530
00:34:43.341 --> 00:34:43.820
the skirts,

531
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:48.110
which we knew would be impossible because the skirts that we had built didn't

532
00:34:48.111 --> 00:34:51.590
seem to lift high enough to do it.
And so you had that nightmare scenario for us,

533
00:34:51.591 --> 00:34:54.230
which is a real character touching a CG element,

534
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:59.000
touching a CG element and trying to do that is really difficult.
Um,
anyways,

535
00:34:59.001 --> 00:35:03.050
we continue forward and this is Yon Mohs,

536
00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:04.693
<v 4>the animator</v>

537
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.570
<v 1>and time lapse animating eggs in Winnie's entry into the dance.</v>

538
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:15.660
So it's pretty rare that he was able to animate even with stairs and walls in

539
00:35:15.661 --> 00:35:16.120
the background.

540
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:20.160
Usually those had to be composited in because animator access to something,

541
00:35:20.161 --> 00:35:20.761
you have to worry about.

542
00:35:20.761 --> 00:35:23.970
The enemies have to be able to comfortably reach the puppets at all time.

543
00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.730
So most of the time for the sequence,

544
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:29.340
he was just born in characters on the parquet floor and we would add everything

545
00:35:29.341 --> 00:35:33.270
else in compositing and the VFX department after that,
um,
it,

546
00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.930
it was incredibly difficult for [inaudible] to do.
Um,
that was tricky.

547
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.420
All of us too because out of all the sequences in the film,

548
00:35:39.421 --> 00:35:44.340
this one was the most sort of pieced apart for the longest time in the

549
00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:47.400
production scheduling.
So we never knew how all these pieces were treating.

550
00:35:47.401 --> 00:35:49.970
Unfortunately for us gets done in the summer.
Yeah,
it gets,
uh,

551
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:52.950
it gets awful hot in the summer.
So we had to visit yon with the shirt off,

552
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.250
which more terrifying than snatcher.

553
00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:00.660
So this is the exciting life of a stop motion animator.

554
00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.620
And then when you see the sequence in the film,

555
00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.360
you'll realize that the camera is doing a lot.

556
00:36:08.361 --> 00:36:11.090
But if that's the camera in the upper right is doing elaborate camera,

557
00:36:11.091 --> 00:36:15.020
move up into the air.
And then the whole room was full of CG,

558
00:36:15.021 --> 00:36:18.650
extra dancing around these characters.
And again,
it took,

559
00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.770
it took all 18 months of our shooting schedule to produce

560
00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.040
a little less than two minutes to finish the footage in the film.

561
00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.650
And here's who can show you that sequence.
Now

562
00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.470
<v 0>they'd have to be real,
but the Muslim,
the rest of the characters,</v>

563
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.490
we have to get to your folder.
You can't just cut through

564
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:02.330
this lunch.

565
00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:09.710
This is that shot the yon was working on.
Just make a box.

566
00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.970
You might be get out of a box.

567
00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:22.923
It

568
00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:44.860
snatches him

569
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.300
book
a

570
00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.010
going on.
Yeah.

571
00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.090
<v 1>So usually when we do this,</v>

572
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:08.780
we do this talk and say dreamworks or Pixar or Disney,

573
00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:13.400
you can see all the CG animators going,
why would you even do a movie?

574
00:39:13.401 --> 00:39:15.490
Like what is the point?
You know?
And,
and,

575
00:39:15.491 --> 00:39:19.340
and for us it is because there we think there is a special quality,
you know,

576
00:39:19.341 --> 00:39:22.070
and I think,
I think Travis is idea of,

577
00:39:22.071 --> 00:39:24.860
of of updating the company as much as possible.

578
00:39:24.861 --> 00:39:29.170
Sort of dragging this technique in this art style into the future,
um,

579
00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.780
is predicated on that idea that there's something unique looking.

580
00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:37.220
And for me the idea is just it's deep down in the DNA and in your subconscious.

581
00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.730
Everybody remembers playing with dolls or playing with a model train set of

582
00:39:40.731 --> 00:39:43.400
moving something around and giving something a little bit of life.

583
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:46.250
And these objects,
the fact that when you look at them on the screen,

584
00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:50.300
they don't look like CG generated characters.
They don't look like real people.

585
00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:52.880
They look like tangible objects that you can grab.

586
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:57.080
And we've seen it over and over again in every place we go to is that people

587
00:39:57.081 --> 00:39:59.510
just can't keep their hands off our puppets.

588
00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.910
As soon as they see them they want to grab him.

589
00:40:01.911 --> 00:40:06.680
And there was was just a New York and there was about 30 young girls who came

590
00:40:06.681 --> 00:40:10.180
screaming down after the Q.
And.
A.
We just have a lot of steroid up.

591
00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.870
So,
and that's something among even stop motion animators is,

592
00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.290
is it when they bill look at your designs and they'll look at your mcats and

593
00:40:18.291 --> 00:40:20.570
stuff and they'll say,
yeah,
I like it.
I like the idea of and stuff.

594
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:23.660
But when they look at it puppet that they can't keep their hands off of that.

595
00:40:23.661 --> 00:40:26.120
They really want to start animating.
That's when you know,

596
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.070
you really have something.
So that's why we,

597
00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:32.960
we think we have this big quest for this technique and for this look.
Yeah.

598
00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:35.580
<v 3>I think for a lot of folks,
even if they're not aware of the process,</v>

599
00:40:35.581 --> 00:40:38.550
when they watch,
I like a film,
they feel that indifference.

600
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:42.840
It is something unique and find a kind of funny in this day and age where so

601
00:40:42.841 --> 00:40:47.610
many animated features are CG generated that in a weird way,

602
00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:52.560
we like her giving audiences something new by doing something so incredibly old.

603
00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:57.310
Um,
so it's Kinda,
it's a very unique place to work.
And we show the was,

604
00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:58.163
she shows up.
Yup.

605
00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.550
<v 2>Boxes on the hillside boxes,
all the same.</v>

606
00:41:34.551 --> 00:41:37.410
And there's a pain.
Agree

607
00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:44.180
DNA or look,
just the same

608
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:49.723
are

609
00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:58.953
saying.

610
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:45.523
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

611
00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:07.663
Uh,

612
00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:09.880
<v 3>Tony again.
Thank you.
That's awesome.
That's a really,</v>

613
00:44:09.881 --> 00:44:10.870
really good insight to everything.

614
00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:14.350
And so I kind of wanna talk about you guys kind of interest kind of how you got

615
00:44:14.351 --> 00:44:16.870
brought into this project.
So Tony,

616
00:44:16.871 --> 00:44:19.930
you have been around for while in the industry,

617
00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.770
I mean you work all the way back in special effects with as an effects animator

618
00:44:23.771 --> 00:44:27.130
on back to the future and hook and in racketeer and goes to James and the giant

619
00:44:27.131 --> 00:44:29.320
peach was,
can I have your first experience in stop motion?

620
00:44:29.321 --> 00:44:32.340
Is that Kinda what drew you in animation?
I,
no,
I actually,

621
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:35.380
<v 1>prior to that,
um,
I worked at,
I went to school at Calarts,</v>

622
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:38.140
California Institute of the arts from above,
you know,

623
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:42.150
in the mid eighties and after that I worked in the salt mines of animation in

624
00:44:42.151 --> 00:44:45.120
Saturday morning cartoons and Korea and Japan and Taiwan.

625
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:49.740
So I did my time and the,
and the spice minds of castle and then animation,

626
00:44:49.741 --> 00:44:53.040
working on [inaudible] adventures and Papaya in the stone age.
And stuff.

627
00:44:53.041 --> 00:44:57.840
So I was used to working on crap.
So I got really lucky.

628
00:44:57.841 --> 00:45:01.380
Later I moved to San Francisco and I worked at a place called colossal pictures,

629
00:45:01.381 --> 00:45:05.850
which was a fantastic advertising studio that did a lot of mixed media and stop

630
00:45:05.851 --> 00:45:08.130
motion.
So you've got a chance to try a lot of different styles.

631
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:12.750
Then I started working at Ilm and then working in story at PDI dreamworks and

632
00:45:12.751 --> 00:45:12.961
stuff.

633
00:45:12.961 --> 00:45:17.100
So the bay area had quite a few studios at that time and it was a great area to

634
00:45:17.101 --> 00:45:19.440
work in.
You could jump around and do a lot of different stuff.

635
00:45:19.441 --> 00:45:23.160
So I kept getting a taste of stop motion with Henry Selick on James and the

636
00:45:23.161 --> 00:45:27.210
giant peach and a colossal.
And even at that point it Ilm,

637
00:45:27.211 --> 00:45:30.810
they still did some stuff practically rocketeer was done with,
with stop motion.

638
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:32.730
So I kept getting in good taste of it,

639
00:45:32.731 --> 00:45:34.380
but I'd never got to work on a whole feature.

640
00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:38.940
So when the opportunity came up to visit friends at Leica about seven years ago,

641
00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:40.470
uh,
who were working on Coraline,

642
00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:42.510
I jumped at it and that's when I met Travis Knight.

643
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.520
And he gave me ounce knows book to read

644
00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:47.900
<v 3>and Grammar.
Yeah.
Uh,
well I,</v>

645
00:45:47.901 --> 00:45:52.370
I tend to chair it in college in Canada and spent a bit of time in Toronto and I

646
00:45:52.371 --> 00:45:55.210
got an opportunity at one point too.

647
00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.530
I was animating at that point,

648
00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:00.380
I got an opportunity to storyboard for Chuck Jones.

649
00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.900
They were making theater shorts back in the early nineties.

650
00:46:02.901 --> 00:46:04.770
And I got this amazing opportunities,

651
00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:08.660
spend a week in La and sit with Chuck Jones and another group of other story

652
00:46:08.661 --> 00:46:11.270
artists and workout all these theaters shorts.

653
00:46:11.271 --> 00:46:14.450
And I came away from that experience going,
wow,
I want to be a storyboard artist.

654
00:46:14.451 --> 00:46:15.710
That's,
that's my thing.

655
00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:20.270
And then I spent 15 years living in the bay area working as an animator and

656
00:46:20.271 --> 00:46:24.230
video games.
But during that time,
uh,

657
00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.030
I continued to do,

658
00:46:26.031 --> 00:46:29.750
I've been doing a lot of comic book stuff and I'd done my own series of comic

659
00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:32.600
stories under the name Brickell.

660
00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:36.760
And that was the thing that I guess Henry Selick saw,
uh,

661
00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.160
up in Portland when he was beginning to assemble a team for Coraline.

662
00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:45.110
And he offered this opportunity for me to come up and be a story artist on his

663
00:46:45.111 --> 00:46:50.090
team.
So I showed up there and have never looked back since I've been at like a

664
00:46:50.091 --> 00:46:54.620
storyboard and on Coraline paranorman and during a low on Paranorman I got an

665
00:46:54.621 --> 00:46:57.290
opportunity to do some storyboarding for Tony while he was developing here be

666
00:46:57.291 --> 00:47:02.120
monsters.
And that sort of morphed into me sitting in a chair beside him.

667
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:02.980
Co-Directing it.

668
00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.190
<v 1>So not,</v>

669
00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:08.390
so what was the big difference for you because you've worked on

670
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:12.260
<v 3>obviously Coraline then paranorman of seeing kind of the progression of stop</v>

671
00:47:12.261 --> 00:47:14.390
motion that you guys have obviously pioneered here.

672
00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:17.150
I'm the kind of the blend between CGI and stuff,
but being a story ours,

673
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:21.180
where have you kind of seeing the being a story artist?
For me personally,
uh,

674
00:47:21.181 --> 00:47:21.441
you know,

675
00:47:21.441 --> 00:47:26.410
I felt like on my resume it says I've worked on to stop motion features and Cole

676
00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:29.830
Haan Paradigm.
And I figured I knew what was involved with the process.
I didn't,

677
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:33.610
uh,
there was so much more going on past the point when it leaves the story

678
00:47:33.611 --> 00:47:36.280
department that I'd only presume to know.

679
00:47:36.281 --> 00:47:40.690
I always describe it as feeling like a guy who got really good at making paper

680
00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:45.070
airplanes and then suddenly finding himself at the controls of a seven 47 there

681
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:49.030
was just so many more decisions to make a,
and it's just,

682
00:47:49.031 --> 00:47:50.470
it's been an incredible,
it was,

683
00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:53.290
it's been an incredible ride the last three years making this film and I was

684
00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:57.290
very thankful to have this guy with me because the experience that you had in

685
00:47:57.291 --> 00:48:00.670
directing features before was was huge.
Cause

686
00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:03.970
<v 1>you,
you mentioned something to me earlier,
which was about kind of your eye.</v>

687
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:05.170
What stop motion is,

688
00:48:05.171 --> 00:48:10.140
it kind of brings the worst aspects of live action and give it a stop motion.

689
00:48:10.141 --> 00:48:12.880
100 Years of stop motion has figured out a way to combine all the worst

690
00:48:12.881 --> 00:48:17.050
attributes of animation and live action production and combining them all

691
00:48:17.051 --> 00:48:21.160
together in one cocktail of fear and alienation because it,

692
00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.580
it has none of the benefits.
If you work in traditional animation,

693
00:48:24.581 --> 00:48:28.180
even in CG animation,
it's a very iterative,
iterative process.

694
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:30.940
You do a rough version,
you show it to the director of your ad frames,

695
00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:33.280
you pull frames out,
you push the poses a little bit more,

696
00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:36.160
you work on your faces and a little by little you build the performance you
want.

697
00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:37.443
In live action,

698
00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:40.780
you do as many takes as you want with the actors until you get the shot that you

699
00:48:40.781 --> 00:48:44.890
want stuff and stop motion.
It's very different because in stop motion,

700
00:48:44.891 --> 00:48:47.710
once you've got your faces prepared in the storyboards and ready,

701
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:51.430
you bring the animator in and you've may have been working on this moment for

702
00:48:51.431 --> 00:48:54.880
two or three years,
but it all comes down to that animator launch.

703
00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:58.120
The moment you sit down and he explained to the animator what you want and at

704
00:48:58.121 --> 00:49:00.190
that point he gets what we call a block,

705
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:04.780
which is essentially just posing the puppet mon six frames or eight frames.

706
00:49:04.781 --> 00:49:07.750
Now usually you animate on twos or ones we animate on ones,

707
00:49:07.751 --> 00:49:10.150
which means we move the puppet every single frame.

708
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.520
And so you get a block to start off with,

709
00:49:12.521 --> 00:49:16.990
which may just be figuring out it's going to take fish four steps to make it

710
00:49:16.991 --> 00:49:19.840
across the room that he's in the shot and there may be a camera move.

711
00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.930
So the block is very rough and it doesn't have anything to do with performance.

712
00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:27.490
And then the animator gets one rehearsal where he does the shot on twos to

713
00:49:27.491 --> 00:49:29.380
figure it out and that becomes his breadcrumbs.

714
00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:34.210
And after that he does it for the final version and there's no going back.

715
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.930
Once he begins to animate the puppet from position a to position B two position.

716
00:49:37.931 --> 00:49:40.480
See he's committed to all of that movement.

717
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:44.530
You can't go back and tweak any of those poses earlier and that is just,

718
00:49:44.531 --> 00:49:46.400
it's nerve wracking era.
No one,

719
00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:49.930
nobody gets into animation to perform in front of a crew of live action.

720
00:49:49.931 --> 00:49:53.020
Guys standing over your shoulder while you spend two weeks moving a puppet

721
00:49:53.021 --> 00:49:55.220
across the screen and stuff.
Cause it,

722
00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:59.380
we described it as it's opening night yet every day for 18 months with no

723
00:49:59.381 --> 00:50:00.214
rehearsals,

724
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.090
<v 3>theater to the,</v>

725
00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:05.590
I think it's that same sort of stress of like you give them as much information

726
00:50:05.591 --> 00:50:09.310
as he can possibly do and then they get pushed out on stage and that's the

727
00:50:09.311 --> 00:50:11.640
performance you'll get forevermore.
And the film.
Yeah,

728
00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.950
<v 7>it's cool.
It's like nothing else.
And you know,</v>

729
00:50:13.951 --> 00:50:15.420
in tech maybe even though this is an American film,

730
00:50:15.421 --> 00:50:18.560
has a lot of British influences,
you know,
and just some of them,
I mean,
you know,

731
00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:21.280
everyone obviously speaks with a British accent and then you have,
you know,

732
00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:24.540
Nick Frost and Simon Pegg are huge,
you know,
UK comedians and then,

733
00:50:24.541 --> 00:50:27.110
but you have a lot of my python influences are as well.

734
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:28.060
The whole world seems almost

735
00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:30.680
<v 1>kinda like a Charles Dickens kind of story.
And you,</v>

736
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:32.150
I mean you have like the one ton weight,

737
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:34.790
which I don't know if that was a reference to money pie thrown out.

738
00:50:34.791 --> 00:50:37.670
But then you have also that scene where snatcher kind of guess has that low

739
00:50:37.671 --> 00:50:40.320
allergic reaction.
And that's from them.

740
00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:46.930
Now when we read the book,
Allen knows book,
he's English,
he's,
he's eccentric.
Um,

741
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:52.190
he's a really great,
he's really great guy and has a lot of crazy influences.

742
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:56.300
That was the tone of the book project as Python esque.

743
00:50:56.301 --> 00:50:59.840
So we discussed for a minute with let's set it in Boston,
you know,

744
00:50:59.841 --> 00:51:02.600
and that lasted about half the meeting.
Uh,
no,

745
00:51:02.601 --> 00:51:05.900
it was always going to stay that way.
So it seemed natural and luckily for us,

746
00:51:05.901 --> 00:51:07.160
Travis had no problem with that.

747
00:51:07.161 --> 00:51:10.130
There'd be very few animation studios in the country where they would agree to

748
00:51:10.131 --> 00:51:13.280
an all in English cask using Pitbull,
like Richard Iowa,

749
00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:16.610
they and stuff who aren't that well known here.
But Travis never blinked.
Um,

750
00:51:16.611 --> 00:51:20.120
you know,
he thought it was appropriate if he wouldn't have had it,
you know,
any,

751
00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:22.120
<v 3>any revenge.
I mean,</v>

752
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:25.990
Harry Norman was a film set in Salem,
Massachusetts,

753
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.420
essentially directed by two British fellow

754
00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:31.960
<v 1>and they made it
ugly and stuff.</v>

755
00:51:31.961 --> 00:51:34.270
So we made these guys and look,
as you can see,

756
00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.250
there's not a straight tooth in the thing.

757
00:51:36.251 --> 00:51:41.251
So it's our revenge on Chris and Sam and uh,

758
00:51:41.571 --> 00:51:45.160
you know,
deep rarely baker and Steve Lemm,
they kind of,
you know,
the really,

759
00:51:45.161 --> 00:51:47.890
really talented voice artists and they kind of created the whole box troll

760
00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:50.730
voices and their whole dialogue.
You know,
I do a lot of influences.

761
00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.390
They set from like cling on and Java,
you know,

762
00:51:52.391 --> 00:51:55.960
language and I kind of want to talk about,
and Tracy Morgan and wells has,

763
00:51:55.961 --> 00:51:57.880
he plays,
he is,
so

764
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:04.660
he has almost language.
Do you find it that you kind of like what,

765
00:52:04.661 --> 00:52:07.150
what was the development of that language and when you guys kind of landed on

766
00:52:07.151 --> 00:52:08.950
that,
that was another thing that grew in the whole,

767
00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.200
<v 3>it was one of the things we're early on,</v>

768
00:52:11.201 --> 00:52:15.550
we had all these great aspirations of maybe writing dictionaries of Buck's row

769
00:52:15.551 --> 00:52:19.960
language and have all the words and things be consistent and specific.
Uh,

770
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:23.950
and that's kind of what you brought to d and Steve initially and they tried it

771
00:52:23.951 --> 00:52:24.640
out.

772
00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:28.000
But once we paired it up with what we had in terms of the character designs and

773
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:31.880
where the story was that it felt wrong.
It felt too sophisticated,

774
00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:34.570
<v 1>don't like cling on and didn't feel like Kleenex box rules.</v>

775
00:52:34.571 --> 00:52:39.510
We're going through the right of ascension
just didn't seem appropriate.
Yeah.

776
00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:41.650
<v 3>Steve and d were huge,</v>

777
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:45.310
hugely helpful and finding ways to simplify that language down into something

778
00:52:45.311 --> 00:52:50.311
that was more emotive and gestural but wasn't so specific and didn't have this

779
00:52:50.531 --> 00:52:53.020
sort of consistent thing where you felt like you needed a dictionary.

780
00:52:53.021 --> 00:52:56.530
You knew through the sounds with the box tools were getting at,

781
00:52:56.531 --> 00:52:59.260
but you didn't hear like individual wards so much.

782
00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:02.320
It was much more selective and they were just incredible at improvising

783
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:05.120
<v 1>that stuff.
Yeah,
it was really unique.
It was great.
And so,</v>

784
00:53:05.121 --> 00:53:06.620
and you talked about love about this in your talk,

785
00:53:06.621 --> 00:53:10.010
but where do you kind of start to define the line of where you're going to go,

786
00:53:10.011 --> 00:53:14.480
stop motion,
where you're going to go CG,
whatever delivers the style and it's,

787
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:15.060
yeah,
rising.

788
00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.100
<v 3>I mean,
yeah,
like all through the process.</v>

789
00:53:17.101 --> 00:53:19.830
It would surprise us where we would presume going into a breakdown,

790
00:53:19.831 --> 00:53:23.370
meaning that something would be v effects digital and it would end up being

791
00:53:23.371 --> 00:53:26.190
practical and vice versa.
Yeah.
And we're not purist.

792
00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.280
<v 1>I mean there's a lot of people who come to stop motion and they want to stay</v>

793
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:32.910
practical.
You know,
they want to stick with an idea of stop motion where,

794
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:37.140
and it can be incredibly charming.
Fantastic.
Mr. Fox nightmare before Christmas.

795
00:53:37.141 --> 00:53:37.580
You know,

796
00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:41.160
a lot of those films is they're gonna make their smoke out of cotton or their

797
00:53:41.161 --> 00:53:43.620
rain out of gelatin.
And that stuff's incredibly charming.

798
00:53:43.621 --> 00:53:46.260
And if that suits the tone and the story of the film,
that's great.

799
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.630
But in our film,
which we wanted to open it up a little,

800
00:53:48.631 --> 00:53:53.420
make an action inventor inventing action,
adventure,
comedy,
um,

801
00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:56.970
we didn't want you to ever see an effect of something that charmed you out of

802
00:53:56.971 --> 00:53:58.500
the movie that threw you out of the movie.

803
00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:02.430
It's like suddenly jeopardy feels real in the world,
feels really credible.

804
00:54:02.431 --> 00:54:05.460
But then something is,
you know,
smoke is made out of cotton.

805
00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:09.120
So we wanted to treat it our stop motion footage as if it was live action

806
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.120
footage and we were adding realistic special effects,

807
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:14.760
realistic but on style forum for our movie.

808
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:19.310
<v 7>Yeah.
And you know,
you know,
you talked a lot about ballroom,
you know,</v>

809
00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.900
seeing and everything and that was,

810
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:25.050
I mean everything from the trolls cavern and the crowd shots and stuff was,

811
00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:28.470
and I was actually pretty surprised that will fall a stop motion of them jumping

812
00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.910
on top of each other in the boxes as well.

813
00:54:29.911 --> 00:54:31.380
Then kind of like gathering up to go to sleep.

814
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:35.100
And was there any talk of that to doing that CG to kind of like,

815
00:54:35.101 --> 00:54:37.030
hey did the CG back characters,
you always wanted to stop

816
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.090
<v 3>golden rule in terms of like choosing practical or via effects in a situation as</v>

817
00:54:42.091 --> 00:54:42.924
a game.

818
00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:47.910
Anything that the hero puppets interact with needs to be and should be

819
00:54:47.911 --> 00:54:51.570
practical.
So everything was always designed with that at its core.

820
00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:52.710
And then we would go from there.

821
00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:55.230
However we wanted to enhance the moment and bring,
you know,

822
00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:56.640
different effects into it.
But

823
00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:59.160
<v 1>yeah,
and it's not,
financially it's not worthwhile.</v>

824
00:54:59.161 --> 00:55:02.760
And we don't do it as there aren't computer avatars for the heroes.

825
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:06.990
We don't have a computer version of eggs or the most important eight boxtrolls.

826
00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:09.600
So you always want those guys front and center anyway.

827
00:55:09.601 --> 00:55:14.100
So even if part of the pile stacking around them later is CG,

828
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:17.670
when those guys are stacking their real puppets because we don't make copies of

829
00:55:17.671 --> 00:55:19.260
them digital.
Yeah,
I do just,

830
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.960
you don't want to make the movie twice when you make a movie like this.

831
00:55:21.961 --> 00:55:26.670
And so making a real eggs and a CGA eggs would sort of defeat the purpose and be

832
00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:28.380
twice as expensive suddenly.

833
00:55:28.381 --> 00:55:32.910
And did you find yourself pulling back on some of the VFX stuff?
Uh,
no.

834
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:35.880
No.
I mean the box for old cabin invasion.
In fact,
we,
uh,

835
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:39.180
there's a couple of animators they want to punch this out because when snatcher

836
00:55:39.181 --> 00:55:41.010
invades the tunnel there and lands,

837
00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:44.460
we animated that whole sequence before we add the effects of all the dust and

838
00:55:44.461 --> 00:55:46.440
stuff dropping in.
And we kept telling the animators,

839
00:55:46.441 --> 00:55:50.040
don't worry about animating the rocks rolling on the ground.
Don't worry about.

840
00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.730
But they would do it every time.
So,
and when we added all the CG effects,

841
00:55:53.731 --> 00:55:57.090
it covered up a lot of their most subtle bits of animation and stuff.

842
00:55:57.450 --> 00:56:00.840
But we wanted it to look super destructive really over the top.

843
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.080
<v 7>And was it helpful cause I mean obviously with all the sequences of having two</v>

844
00:56:04.081 --> 00:56:07.910
directors on this,
so being co directors as opposed to just one person.

845
00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:11.150
<v 3>Yeah,
I think when they,
when they,
you know,
during the pre production phase of it,</v>

846
00:56:11.151 --> 00:56:14.810
we're kind of joined at the hip and we are involved together on almost all the

847
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:17.810
meetings and decisions.
But once the shooting schedule begins,

848
00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:21.410
that's where the studio really benefits from the fact that there's two of us to

849
00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:25.540
be able to split between two different edit suites and we can kind of streamline

850
00:56:25.541 --> 00:56:28.720
and make it as efficient as possible to all of animation launches.

851
00:56:28.721 --> 00:56:30.790
We sort of split up on sequences where,

852
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.250
I mean it would constantly check in with each other all day long.

853
00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:38.470
<v 1>Yeah.
There's 55 stages going on.
This 27 animators working on,</v>

854
00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:40.410
they're all working on different shots.
This,
you know,

855
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:43.580
there's twice as many stages as animators cause you always want their next stage

856
00:56:43.581 --> 00:56:46.790
to be setting up when they finish.
Um,
and so then those things,

857
00:56:46.791 --> 00:56:50.900
you have to go out and meet with those animators each at least every other day

858
00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:53.710
while they're working on they're shots you have set visit,
you walked with,

859
00:56:53.711 --> 00:56:56.780
they're doing or they are completing their shots are completing the rehearsal

860
00:56:56.781 --> 00:56:58.310
and new reviewing them in editorial.

861
00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:02.780
And you never want an animator standing there waiting for director of input.

862
00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:07.670
So that's when it's really important.
Uh,
and with the story too,
you know,
it got,

863
00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:10.850
it didn't get as dark as the books.
The book is definitely a little bit darker.

864
00:57:10.851 --> 00:57:12.590
Yeah.
I've got a little bit with,
with the,
you know,

865
00:57:12.591 --> 00:57:15.740
when he's kind of discussion about the boxtrolls about how they were stealing

866
00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:20.180
her morbid fascination,
but was there any,
uh,

867
00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:23.630
any pushed by the studio by you guys even to pull back on that darkness or put

868
00:57:23.631 --> 00:57:25.910
more in?
Or was this just kind of where it started ticking and you know,

869
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:30.040
it didn't have a supernatural element like Coraline did in Paranorman.

870
00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:32.840
So we were kind of happy for that.
We definitely wanted it to brighten it up,

871
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:35.780
but we also felt from the very beginning that the property,

872
00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:39.680
the story appealed for younger kids.
So we never wanted to jeopardize that.

873
00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:43.650
We don't do focus screenings.
Travis doesn't believe in that stuff.
We,

874
00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:45.500
we have our own kids and you know,

875
00:57:45.501 --> 00:57:49.040
we make movies that we want to see and we judge them by our own kids.

876
00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:49.851
And honestly,

877
00:57:49.851 --> 00:57:53.720
I show it to my kid who's sick of seeing it and stuff to try to figure out the

878
00:57:53.721 --> 00:57:57.220
moments that might be too powerful and stuff.
But we definitely believe that,

879
00:57:57.221 --> 00:58:01.670
that,
that,
um,
because we're an independent film studio and because Travis is,

880
00:58:01.671 --> 00:58:05.270
is really has the vision for the studio that you want to find stories that are

881
00:58:05.271 --> 00:58:08.750
willing to go a little bit darker because you need those lower depths to get the

882
00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:12.800
high higher highs emotionally on the other end of the spectrum.
And honestly,

883
00:58:12.801 --> 00:58:13.011
you know,

884
00:58:13.011 --> 00:58:15.830
when you were growing up and you were watching Dumbo in Pinocchio and a lot of

885
00:58:15.831 --> 00:58:16.491
those older farms,

886
00:58:16.491 --> 00:58:20.570
they were willing to sort of go to some of those darker places and a lot of

887
00:58:20.571 --> 00:58:25.190
other studios are,
are attached to big corporations and they can't take the risk.

888
00:58:25.191 --> 00:58:28.550
They need to sort of stay in a sort of a middle ground there because their films

889
00:58:28.551 --> 00:58:32.240
are so expensive to make and there's so much part of the merchandising stuff

890
00:58:32.241 --> 00:58:36.350
that they can't risk alienating any possible facet of the public.

891
00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:41.680
We don't have those constraints.
Gotcha.
So,
uh,
you know,

892
00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:45.670
<v 7>with you guys having this big success and you guys signed with focus for three</v>

893
00:58:45.671 --> 00:58:47.410
more movies and other not announced yet,

894
00:58:47.411 --> 00:58:49.570
but where do you kind of see this going and kind of pushing,

895
00:58:49.571 --> 00:58:51.790
cause obviously the ballroom sequence was a huge learning experience where you

896
00:58:51.791 --> 00:58:54.820
guys,
would you guys ever tackle something like that again?
I was just like,
no,

897
00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:55.713
we got it.

898
00:58:55.720 --> 00:59:00.720
I actually have a couple apps I'd like to pitch and see if I [inaudible].

899
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.590
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

900
00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:07.300
I know it's hard to predict because one of the things I've found really amazing

901
00:59:07.301 --> 00:59:10.960
about working at like as each project has been very specific and Ben its own

902
00:59:10.961 --> 00:59:15.340
thing,
certain things get learned and we evolve and the departments keep refining

903
00:59:15.341 --> 00:59:18.640
things,
but,
and then each project brings a whole new set of problems,

904
00:59:18.641 --> 00:59:22.010
a whole new set of challenges.
A couple of ago everybody

905
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.140
<v 1>at the studio would jump when we call it now,</v>

906
00:59:24.141 --> 00:59:27.980
they completely ignores me and walked down the hallway the other day I was

907
00:59:27.981 --> 00:59:30.290
talking to Brad Schiff,
our animation supervisor,
and he was like,

908
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:33.290
the faces on your movie are nothing compared to what they're doing.

909
00:59:33.291 --> 00:59:36.740
They have five minutes now of the next film done and they've already started

910
00:59:36.741 --> 00:59:40.130
doing stuff,
you know,
continued to push the rapid prototype process and stuff.

911
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:43.940
That's kind of what's fun about the place too because it gets boring for people

912
00:59:43.941 --> 00:59:45.380
in the head of department to repeat stuff.

913
00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:49.130
So they actually liked the challenges and stuff in the next film has a lot of

914
00:59:49.131 --> 00:59:49.964
challenges.

915
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.260
<v 7>Yes,
lower.
Excited to see it.
A Q and a for you guys.</v>

916
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:55.910
So we got the first question.

917
00:59:55.990 --> 01:00:00.590
Do you feel that animators who come from like a traditional or CG background get

918
01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:05.530
better become better animators because they have to plan so much and uh,

919
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:07.490
basically do their final shot?
Just once.

920
01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:11.130
<v 1>I mean it's funny how many I had to stop motion animators.</v>

921
01:00:11.131 --> 01:00:13.270
You meet who that's predominantly what they do.
Um,

922
01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:16.290
there's quite a few of the stop motion people I know quite a few start munching

923
01:00:16.291 --> 01:00:18.990
enemies who stop motion is what they've always done and they've also,

924
01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.580
they animate on the computer too.

925
01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:25.020
I don't need so many animators and make the to transition the other way and

926
01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:28.350
choose to go into stop motion later.
Partially for the reason that I described.

927
01:00:28.351 --> 01:00:32.280
It's like all animation is hard and hard enough and then they look at what stop

928
01:00:32.281 --> 01:00:34.950
motion animators do and they go,
oh,
I don't want to go anywhere near that.

929
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:37.800
But there are a lot of,
seems like quite a few statements.

930
01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.840
Anatomies started out wanting to be two d animators,

931
01:00:39.841 --> 01:00:43.050
but they couldn't draw or they didn't like all the drawing or they hated the

932
01:00:43.051 --> 01:00:46.170
fact that in drawing you have to worry about stuff like volumes changing and

933
01:00:46.171 --> 01:00:49.680
staying on model and stuff here and in CG.

934
01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.770
In some ways you're freed up if you don't have great drafting skills,

935
01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.940
if you don't like wearing about staying on model,

936
01:00:54.941 --> 01:00:56.940
staying on the character design and stuff.

937
01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:59.940
Here you're purely dealing with performance and timing,

938
01:00:59.941 --> 01:01:02.910
which is something that certain animated,
that's what they love,
the best.

939
01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.490
Others love drawing but,
but are you worried about,

940
01:01:05.491 --> 01:01:07.440
is the performance that's going on here and stuff.

941
01:01:07.441 --> 01:01:10.810
So that's why I think some CG animators in stop motion animators,

942
01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:14.580
the world has been opened up to people who want to be animators but don't draw.

943
01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:19.170
Um,
so I don't know how they get used to it except they've never known anything

944
01:01:19.171 --> 01:01:22.850
else.
There are places where they do stop motion animation,
where there,

945
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:26.520
there was no rehearsals.
Um,
some TV stop motion and stuff like that.

946
01:01:26.521 --> 01:01:29.160
Or people who've worked on Gumby and some of that oldest stop motion.

947
01:01:29.161 --> 01:01:33.870
So in some ways as hard as what we do is it's actually luxurious compared to

948
01:01:33.871 --> 01:01:35.250
other jobs that they've been on.

949
01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.550
It's just that Travis has a very specific sort of,
um,

950
01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.850
rigorous idea of the quality of the animation that they want.

951
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:45.450
So it is working at the highest level and I think that's probably the most

952
01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:48.390
intimidating thing.
Yeah,
definitely.
I think the fact that,
yeah,

953
01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:52.540
Travis is one of the lead animators and one of the best in the studio that a,

954
01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:55.920
that department certainly feels the pressure to take,
keep their,

955
01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:57.060
keep their a game up.

956
01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:03.650
<v 7>Okay.
So,
uh,
my question is actually about the,
the uh,
statement you made about,</v>

957
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:08.540
uh,
using practical characters for anything that was going to touch another

958
01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:13.310
character.
Is that a,
is that a about appearance or about performance?

959
01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:18.510
<v 1>It,
it's,
it's about difficulty.
It's just very hard to do.
Like had we had to do,</v>

960
01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.930
you know,
our plan initially on the chart where eggs is hiding under the skirt,

961
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:25.530
was to put a ring around the real puppets that were there that he was going to

962
01:02:25.531 --> 01:02:26.101
interact with.

963
01:02:26.101 --> 01:02:29.970
So they would dance into place and then eggs would grab the ring and lift it up

964
01:02:29.971 --> 01:02:33.750
and we would use that ring as a guide to put in a CG skirt and stuff.

965
01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:37.320
And that would just be very difficult and time consuming to do,
not impossible,

966
01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:39.780
but just very hard to do.
So that's,

967
01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:43.290
that's mainly in situations like that we'd like to just try to avoid it because

968
01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:45.150
it's a lot,
it means a lot of,
you know,

969
01:02:45.151 --> 01:02:48.120
rodeoing out hand painting frames and stuff like that.

970
01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:51.180
So the way the process has developed that were more efficient to keep it all

971
01:02:51.181 --> 01:02:54.660
practical and a lot of ways and there's this consistency to the appearance that

972
01:02:54.661 --> 01:02:57.990
you don't have to worry that you're going to get into some weird realm or the

973
01:02:57.991 --> 01:03:00.750
two things bumped together looking right.
And yeah,
like Tony said,

974
01:03:00.751 --> 01:03:05.751
it just sounds like more performance or a single animator or clump of a team of

975
01:03:05.941 --> 01:03:09.660
animators can worry about these two characters doing it.
Right.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.

976
01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:12.350
Those are the two different worlds.
They have to be composited in it.
Yeah.

977
01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:15.970
It goes back to sort of try,
you know,
making the movie twice instead of,

978
01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:19.530
because you have the two worlds is one is always enhancing the other and stuff.

979
01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:20.423
I mean there's some,

980
01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:24.390
there's a couple of wide shots in there that are predominantly CG and then they

981
01:03:24.391 --> 01:03:25.490
would just,
um,

982
01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:29.190
you can do camera tricks and stuff to give you that wide views of the city and

983
01:03:29.191 --> 01:03:33.290
stuff,
but that becomes problematic when you're doing stereo,
um,
into the,
uh,

984
01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:36.960
three d stuff is those little cheats don't work as well in three d and stuff.

985
01:03:36.961 --> 01:03:40.980
So there's always an answer to every problem,
but I don't know any of them.

986
01:03:40.981 --> 01:03:42.120
I just sit in the room and wait,

987
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:44.570
let those guys at the other end of the table hash it out.

988
01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:47.523
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

989
01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.450
<v 10>I was curious.
You've referred to cost a couple times and uh,</v>

990
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:54.730
he said would double the cost to do both CG and

991
01:03:56.410 --> 01:03:58.150
practical versions of the characters.

992
01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.800
How does the cost actually compare overall versus doing this?

993
01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.860
I actually tried to stay out of that as much as possible,

994
01:04:05.861 --> 01:04:09.050
but I do know that all three of like his films cost less

995
01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:13.660
<v 1>to make than it takes to make one big Pixar film or one big dreamworks films,</v>

996
01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:18.160
you know in their films are upwards of $200 million in cost to make and stuff.

997
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:21.430
So these are significantly less even giving,
you know,

998
01:04:21.431 --> 01:04:25.150
we have about 400 people at the peak that work on the films and that 18 month

999
01:04:25.151 --> 01:04:26.590
project,
you know,
cycle.

1000
01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:30.250
When we start storyboarding and maybe five years ago or six years ago we started

1001
01:04:30.251 --> 01:04:31.240
really working on the story.

1002
01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.270
We have a very small crew and then the crew just gets bigger and bigger and

1003
01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:35.021
bigger to,

1004
01:04:35.021 --> 01:04:39.130
you hit that 18 months of production and then people start to drop off cause the

1005
01:04:39.131 --> 01:04:43.330
puppets are all made and the sets are all made and stuff.
So that that crew is,

1006
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:44.590
is big.
It sounds like a lot,

1007
01:04:44.591 --> 01:04:49.360
but it's still not as significant as a big CG feature film.
We only have 25,

1008
01:04:49.361 --> 01:04:52.360
27 animators,
Pixar,
dreamworks,
some of those places,

1009
01:04:52.361 --> 01:04:56.740
they'll have 65 70 animators work on one of their films by the end of it and

1010
01:04:56.741 --> 01:05:00.580
there just aren't 60 or 75 really good stop motion animators in the world.

1011
01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:04.040
Even if you wanted to have throw that many bodies at the problem,
you,

1012
01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:05.170
you couldn't find them.

1013
01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:08.090
<v 4>No,</v>

1014
01:05:08.090 --> 01:05:09.550
<v 1>no.
Last thing I want to talk about it,
it just,</v>

1015
01:05:09.551 --> 01:05:12.090
was there any moment in the film that was just a,

1016
01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:15.400
your kind of favorite moment or your most proud moment that you guys able to

1017
01:05:15.401 --> 01:05:18.870
accomplish other than the ballroom scene was pronounced?
For me personally.
Yeah.

1018
01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.440
Snatchers end,
uh,

1019
01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:25.390
out of all the screenings we've attended and then I always make sure to sneak

1020
01:05:25.391 --> 01:05:28.780
into the theater to,
to be with the audience when that moment happens.

1021
01:05:28.781 --> 01:05:30.490
Cause for me,
storytelling.
Why is that?

1022
01:05:30.491 --> 01:05:33.760
It's definitely the most gratifying moment in the film for me.

1023
01:05:33.761 --> 01:05:35.940
When I first started on it,
I loved the story.
You know,

1024
01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.020
my son was born about the time I started reading it.

1025
01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:41.530
So he immediately felt like the boxtrolls would like these loss boys.

1026
01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:45.000
And it's the story of a lost boy.
And I started,
uh,

1027
01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:47.290
commuting from la up to Portland.

1028
01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:50.680
So I had a lost boy at home that I wasn't seeing.
So for me,
that,

1029
01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:51.580
that really appealed to me.

1030
01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:54.280
There's a little sequence in the film where eggs and Winnie are sitting on the

1031
01:05:54.281 --> 01:05:56.590
edge of the cavern and they're talking about what a father is.

1032
01:05:57.010 --> 01:06:00.220
And for a long time I kept quick keeping that in there.

1033
01:06:00.221 --> 01:06:03.100
And Travis like that film because I like that moment.

1034
01:06:03.101 --> 01:06:05.410
And Graham liked it because they both have young sons too.

1035
01:06:05.411 --> 01:06:07.270
And they know when you work in animation,
you are,

1036
01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:11.560
the definition of an animator is an absentee father.
Uh,
so you know,

1037
01:06:11.561 --> 01:06:12.640
that element was importantly,

1038
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:15.700
but the story didn't need that moment for a lot of it's time.

1039
01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:18.160
And I always felt like that needs to be in the film.

1040
01:06:18.161 --> 01:06:19.840
That's at the core of the film.
It's really important.

1041
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:22.840
But I had a hard time justifying it a lot of times to the story department.

1042
01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.660
They were like,
what is this big conversation when he's having,

1043
01:06:25.661 --> 01:06:27.490
when she's talking about a father doesn't seem to fit in there.

1044
01:06:27.491 --> 01:06:31.030
And eventually the film got to a place where that scene made sense.

1045
01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:34.450
So that was a scene where there was a lot of other scenes that I fight just as

1046
01:06:34.451 --> 01:06:38.350
hard for that died miserably.
But that one survived.
And for me,

1047
01:06:38.351 --> 01:06:40.630
that was one of those rare moments where the movie,

1048
01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:44.230
the story gets to breathe a little bit.
Yeah.
And it slows down.
And just,
you know,

1049
01:06:44.231 --> 01:06:47.590
for me,
it's the core of,
of sort of the emotional core of the film

1050
01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:49.890
<v 7>and it's,
it's phenomenal.</v>

1051
01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:54.920
So let's think a Tony and Graham [inaudible] boxtrolls will be available

1052
01:06:58.501 --> 01:07:01.670
digitally,
I think by the end of the month and then on,
uh,
uh,

1053
01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:04.010
disc soon after that.
So anyway.
Yeah.

1054
01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.820
So we look forward to you guys next film when that was announced and,
uh,

1055
01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:10.290
the guys all for joining [inaudible]

1056
01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:26.490
<v 6>yeah.</v>
