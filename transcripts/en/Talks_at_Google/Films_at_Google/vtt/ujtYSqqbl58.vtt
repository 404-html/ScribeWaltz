00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.470
Hi everyone.
Welcome to talks at Google today.

2
00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:12.630
It is my pleasure to welcome mark Duplass.

3
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.713
<v 1>Hello class</v>

4
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.580
<v 0>and was everyone today.
Um,</v>

5
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.310
thanks for coming out to hear me pontificate for a little bit.

6
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.030
I try to be as useful as I can when I come and do this stuff.

7
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:32.990
So we're going to do like questions and answers and all that stuff afterwards.

8
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.990
Um,
but um,
I also like to pontificate a little bit so I'm going to do it,

9
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:40.880
but a little bit of that.
Um,
I was,
uh,

10
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.650
driving around the other day and there's a new show called geniuses that they

11
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:47.130
are promoting.
Um,

12
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.630
and I think it's meant for us to watch and be inspired by these grandiose

13
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:58.781
individuals who by sheer luck of the way they were born are just God damn

14
00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:03.560
incredible and do inspiring things.
And,
um,

15
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.110
it really annoys me,
um,

16
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.360
because they're really good at things and they're born that way.
Um,

17
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.990
and I find them and accessible and I find them particularly uninspiring cause it

18
00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.960
makes me just go,
well,

19
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:22.070
I'm not ever going to be able to do that.
I'm not Einstein,

20
00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:26.270
so forget it.
I'm just going to smoke some weed and play some video games.

21
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.860
Um,
and other than I was,
I was thinking about that.
I was like,
I,

22
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.370
I do know some people,
I do know some artists who,
you know,

23
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:37.850
like the Coen brothers wake up and they have a movie fully realized in their

24
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:41.570
head are right it,
they execute it,
they give it to audiences,

25
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:43.820
those audiences and moat and it's perfect.

26
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:48.821
And there are people who are in the startup realm or their tech geniuses or

27
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:52.250
whatever,
and they see a gap in society and they say,

28
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.540
I not only know how to conceptualize what will fill that gap,

29
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.710
I am confident and eloquent enough to enact that and have an IPO and just whoop

30
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.720
ass all over the place.
Um,

31
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.830
and it just occurs to me that most people I know are not like that.

32
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.040
And I am particularly not like that.
So if you happen to be like that,

33
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.160
feel free to get up and leave.
I have nothing useful to say to you today,

34
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.350
but if you are like me legitimately and you wake up in the morning with half

35
00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:23.990
formed ideas that could be interesting,

36
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:28.991
but you don't really know how to make them good yet or how to get them there and

37
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:36.551
you have inspiration but it feels foggy and you feel not as confident as some

38
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:39.800
others who have come before you.

39
00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:44.801
And you generally look in the mirror like I do and you see a good solid B minus,

40
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.060
you know,
like relatively good looking,
fairly well-spoken,

41
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.560
going to make my way in the world,
then I,
I think I can be very useful to you.

42
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:56.060
And that's what I'm going to try to do.

43
00:02:56.061 --> 00:03:01.061
I've spent the last 40 years of my life trying to maximize my B minus into

44
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:06.301
something that more closely approximates a B plus and on a good day and a minus.

45
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.410
Um,
and the way I've done this is through a bunch of different things.
But,
um,

46
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.200
you know,
as I was thinking about what I was going to talk to you guys about,

47
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:17.290
a thought about a lot of these old adages that were taught to me and that were

48
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:19.300
extremely helpful to me in my life and,

49
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.080
and the first big one was the learn the rules before you break them.

50
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.060
And I always love the sound of that.

51
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:33.061
And that one proved to be pretty useless for me to be honest with you,

52
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:35.380
because I wanted to be a filmmaker.

53
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.100
I wanted to go out and turn into Robert Rodriguez and Richard Linklater are

54
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.530
Steven Soderbergh and sell my big movie at Sundance.
And so I said,
great,

55
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.090
I'm going to learn the rules for I break them.

56
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.730
It'd be a good student and to go to film school,

57
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.310
we don't learn how to properly cast a movie.

58
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.050
I'm going to buy the budgeting and scheduling software so that I'm very official

59
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.950
and I learned my rules and I'm going to make sure I staff up each position

60
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:03.160
correctly on sec is how can you make a good movie if you don't have everything

61
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:04.240
staffed correctly?

62
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.220
And I started an editing business as a backup plan just in case I didn't make
it.

63
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.390
I made some money.

64
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.620
My brother and I then got hired to do this big corporate documentary that was in

65
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:19.150
the middle of this sort of tech boom in Austin in the late nineties and we made

66
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:22.300
a bunch of money.
We made $65,000 is our salary.
So he said,

67
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.830
American dream is here.

68
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.860
We're going to go make our movie because we learned the rules.

69
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.160
So we set out to make a movie called Vince del Rio.
Uh,

70
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.970
we set a budget of $65,000 shot over four weeks,

71
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.190
and we did it all right.
Budgeting software,
scheduling software.

72
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.680
We never went over our 12 hour days.

73
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.200
We were the good little boys who followed all the rules.

74
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:48.850
Our crew loved us because we seem confident and we never wavered even though we

75
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:50.050
were wavering inside.

76
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.180
And we finished the movie and we edit it together and I put it in a test

77
00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:57.580
screening in a room pretty much this size.

78
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.090
And we all knew it was terrible and unsalvageable and we buried the movie and

79
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:10.291
sunk into the great Duplass brothers depression of the mid two thousands for a

80
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.280
couple of years,
um,

81
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.450
where I would see profiles on the Coen brothers and these geniuses and hate
them,

82
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.420
uh,
and feel very far from them.

83
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.820
And then one day I looked at my brother,

84
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:25.000
and this is just the nature of our rhythm and our collaboration.
I said,

85
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.870
we're getting off the couch.
We're gonna make a movie today.
And he said,
well,

86
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:32.410
we don't have a crew,
or like a camera or the,

87
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.120
the budgeting software,
the scheduling software.
And I was like,
I don't care.

88
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.140
We're going to like figure something out.
And he was like,
well,
I'm down.

89
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:43.390
What's it about?
And then of course I was like,
well,
I don't know.

90
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:46.570
You got to figure that out.
I'm going to seven 11 to get a mini DV tape.

91
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.200
We're going to use mom and dad's video camera and see what happens.

92
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:53.920
So I ran a seven 11,
bought the mini DV tapes,
$3 came home.
Jay said,

93
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:54.760
I have an idea.

94
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.880
I had this horrifying experience where I trying to perfect the personal greeting

95
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:03.140
of my answering machine and it took me about 35 takes and I had a nervous

96
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:07.760
breakdown in the process and I was like,
that's great.
Funny,
true.

97
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.050
Feels like us close to home.
Don't say anymore.
We're not going to budget it,

98
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:14.930
schedule it.
Right.
We're not doing anything.
I'm going out the door.

99
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.190
You hold the camera like when you were 11 and when I was seven,

100
00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:21.650
all I was worth doing was being able to be in it.

101
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:24.230
So I'll just be in it and you film me and let's go.

102
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.880
And we filmed for 20 minutes in the kitchen and I improvise this story about it.

103
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.090
And Jay was Kinda on his feet with our camera,

104
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:36.200
with a dead Pixel in the center and no onboard microphone whatsoever.

105
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.630
And I definitely didn't feel like a movie,
uh,

106
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.640
but it felt special to us and we cut it down to eight minutes.

107
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.700
And that ended up being our first movie that got into Sundance and it won all

108
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:50.960
the major short film awards that year.

109
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.440
And it changed everything for us because I think what we realized is we had

110
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:59.900
gotten so caught up in the proper,

111
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:04.850
an acumen of what constitutes a good professional movie that we had lost

112
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:08.060
complete touch with the cave men inside of ourselves.

113
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.840
And in particular the ignorant caveman who picked up the bones.

114
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:14.150
And the do I would how you would do this.

115
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.760
And we have found is that,
uh,

116
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.620
if you learn the rules too early,
uh,

117
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:26.030
and to I guess steadfastly,
um,

118
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.940
you will not be stupid enough to break them.

119
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.110
And it's very important when you're an artist to be dumb enough to have the

120
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:35.870
courage to go break those rules.
So for me,

121
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.710
learn the rules before you break them has really turned in to break the rules

122
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.530
before you learn them.
And that's a very important one for me.

123
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.070
A second big thing we always talk about is,
um,

124
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.170
in the filmmaking world and a lot in the music world,
and I guess in,
you know,

125
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.550
probably in the startup world too,

126
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:57.551
there's a lot of this never compromise your vision type stuff that people talk

127
00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:02.330
about.
Um,
which I understand the beating heart of that and I get that.

128
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:06.620
But when Jay and I made our,
our second movie,

129
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:10.340
which was a $15,000 feature film,
um,

130
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:15.140
that was our way of making our movie our way,
not compromising our vision,

131
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.160
doing it the way we wanted to do it with a loan from our parents.
Um,

132
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.570
it turned out pretty good.
We were happy with it.
We edit it together,

133
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:27.830
we've watched it ourselves and we said,
okay,
let's fingers crossed this time,

134
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:31.970
put it in front of that group again and hope this one works.
And we did.

135
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.130
And about 40 to 50 people in the room all said,
this movie's pretty good.

136
00:08:37.131 --> 00:08:40.580
It's working pretty well.
The first 20 minutes are a little rough.

137
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.690
I'm having a hard time like getting into the character as this and likability

138
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.320
issues as some pacing issues.

139
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.120
And we really felt like sticking to our guns as we were,
like,

140
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.130
this is our vision,
bro.

141
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:57.000
And we're all tours and we don't compromise our vision.

142
00:08:57.001 --> 00:09:01.050
We like the first act of our movie,
uh,
and slowly but surely,

143
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:04.380
because we have very good friends,
they beat us down and they told us,

144
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.280
you can stick to your vision and being on tour and nobody's going to watch your

145
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:10.080
movie and nobody's going to like it.

146
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.880
And it started to creep in to us,
right?

147
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.580
We aren't the Coen brothers.

148
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.730
We aren't the geniuses who can see our movie Monday morning at 9:00 AM and exact

149
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:27.570
it perfectly.
But that doesn't mean we don't have something to offer.

150
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.870
That doesn't mean we can't make a relevant piece of art somehow.

151
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.490
So we gathered a separate meeting with those 40 people,
had them help us,

152
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.780
talk us through it.
We eventually rewrote the movie,
uh,

153
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:43.500
the first 15 pages of the movie.
We reshot them,
edited it,

154
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.460
put it back in,

155
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.690
gather together a new group of people and it killed.

156
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.300
And that was our second movie that went to Sundance.

157
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.800
And we sold it there and really started the kind of,
uh,

158
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.170
I would say the major portion of our career out of that.

159
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.670
And the lesson we learned was,
was really simple.
It was not,

160
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.470
don't ever compromise your vision.

161
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:09.471
It was quite simply always be willing to compromise your vision because you

162
00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:13.560
don't know everything and that's okay.

163
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.830
Every film I make would be better than the last one.

164
00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:18.750
If it was an empirical process of knowledge,

165
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.140
you need a little bit of luck and you need a lot of help.
In my opinion,

166
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.250
if you're a B minus,

167
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:28.320
and now I have this wonderful group of collaborators starting with the unit of

168
00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:31.710
myself and my brother,
we can always lean on each other and help each other out.

169
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:36.000
Expands a little bit beyond that to a group of filmmakers that work with us,

170
00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:38.820
our editors,
our producers.
That's a group of like 10 of us.

171
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.520
And then every single thing I make,

172
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:46.230
I put it up for a room like this in front of the smartest people I know,

173
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.850
filmmakers,
whomever I can get and just ask them to be as brutally honest as I,

174
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.840
as they can be.

175
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:57.230
And they give me their feedback and I'm able to take my B minus and muscle that

176
00:10:57.841 --> 00:11:02.640
thing through the brilliant collaborater of minds of my peers into something

177
00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:06.540
that every now and then it gets to like a 90 or even a 95.

178
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.990
And I struggled with that for awhile and it was hard on me and I thought,

179
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.860
it's just a bummer that I can't do this on my own cause I'm not in a tour,

180
00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:16.200
I guess,
but I don't believe that anymore.
Um,

181
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.860
there are a couple of people who know how to do that,
but I'm not them.
And,
and,

182
00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:24.570
uh,
you know,
through a little bit,
Aka a lot of therapy.
I'm,
uh,

183
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:30.210
I'm getting used to it.
Um,
third adage I always heard,
um,

184
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.750
was this,
this old saying,

185
00:11:33.751 --> 00:11:38.160
the cavalry isn't coming,
which is meant to exemplify for you.

186
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.860
You are either in the battlefield and losing and looking for a bailout or as

187
00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:48.150
often as the case for outlier artists,
inventors,
whatnot.

188
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.680
You haven't even gotten to the battlefield yet and you are looking for someone

189
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:53.141
to come,

190
00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:58.141
pluck you and save you and mentor you and assure you to success.

191
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.010
But the truth is the cavalry isn't coming.
Now,

192
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:06.610
this is one that I have actually found to be mostly true.

193
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
I'm starting with our $3 short film that we made in our kitchen.

194
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.650
We went to Sundance,

195
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.680
we got agents there and our agents called us to a meeting and they said,

196
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.580
congratulations,
you worked so hard to get to this point.
We got you.

197
00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:27.040
Now the cavalry has here.

198
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:31.120
We're going to take your next script and package it in the studio system with

199
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:35.560
some mid level TV stars and we're going to get you $1 million to go make your

200
00:12:35.561 --> 00:12:38.680
movie.
And we said,
awesome.
That sounds so exciting.

201
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.480
We waited for six months a year.

202
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:49.480
Nothing happened.
Cavalry didn't come,
but we know how to make cheap movies.

203
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:50.171
So he said,
okay,

204
00:12:50.171 --> 00:12:55.171
why don't we write like a movie that we can make for like $50,000 and here we

205
00:12:56.711 --> 00:13:00.670
invented our available school materials of filmmaking,
which we call,

206
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:04.360
which is right for what you have at your disposal.
Um,
you know,

207
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.900
and at that time we wrote the puffy chair.
It was,
I have an apartment,

208
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.220
I have a van,
my girlfriend,
Katie's apartment,
small town where she grew up,

209
00:13:12.221 --> 00:13:14.440
where people will be nice to us and let us shoot for free.

210
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.200
And we were able to make that movie for $15,000.

211
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.280
Our next movie bag had was we'll rent two cabins in the woods,

212
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.301
we'll shoot.

213
00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:26.530
And one of them will stay in both of them over the course of three weeks.

214
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.990
And with a cast and crew at 1215 people,

215
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:33.250
we can make a $50,000 movie that probably won't lose money and keep moving

216
00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:36.790
forward while we continue to wait for the cavalry to come through our agents.

217
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.630
We went to Sundance with that movie and the movie sold for half a million

218
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.530
dollars.
And we said,
Oh shit,
okay,
wait a second.

219
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:50.010
Because now we might be making close to the kinds of money we would have made if

220
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:56.521
we had made that million dollar movie in the studio system doing it our own way

221
00:13:56.741 --> 00:13:59.230
and,
and financing it.
Granted,

222
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:03.970
we were not genius startup mentalities who are thinking ownership is the key

223
00:14:03.971 --> 00:14:08.050
because society is headed towards vertical integration and we were just like,

224
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.610
nobody will do anything for us.

225
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.940
So we're going to take profits for profit share and make a movie.
Um,

226
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:17.260
and that came in thinking again that that ignorance and slight idiocy was good

227
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:21.790
for us.
Um,
so after bag had sold,
our agents called us in and they said,

228
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.360
congratulations guys,
you've worked so hard up to this point,

229
00:14:25.361 --> 00:14:28.450
but now we got you with two sales out of Sundance.

230
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.860
We are sure to go out and get you a studio movie and get it made.
And we said,

231
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:37.750
great.
So we waited for a little while and it didn't happen.

232
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.810
And then we had some friends who worked at a,

233
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.830
I worked at Fox searchlight and they had said they wanted to make a movie with

234
00:14:44.831 --> 00:14:46.450
us.
And we said,
okay,
well we'll think about it.

235
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:51.780
And actually they did come around and they gave us a $7 million to make a

236
00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:56.300
relationship movie with John C.
Reilly,
Jonah hill and Marissa Tomi called Cyrus.

237
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.240
And we were like,
well this is the dream.

238
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.740
This is everything we've been waiting for.

239
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:06.430
And it almost killed us because they didn't actually pay us very well.

240
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.410
They tortured us quite a bit throughout the film making process in terms of what

241
00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:17.120
they needed to make it a marketable product.
Uh,
and by the time we were done,

242
00:15:17.121 --> 00:15:19.490
we made the movie we wanted to make,
which was great,

243
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.990
but we realized if we do this three or four more times,

244
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:27.860
we will be burned out and retired by the time we hit 40.
Um,

245
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.490
interestingly enough,
while this was happening,

246
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.110
we had started to turn into producers randomly.

247
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.850
The way it started was our friends would come to us and say,

248
00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:45.800
you guys sold some Sundance movies.
Do you have any money?
And we were like,
sure,

249
00:15:45.801 --> 00:15:47.900
you know,
here's $5,000 to go make your movie.

250
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.170
We never saw that as becoming producers,
but that's what we were doing.

251
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.560
We were giving them money,
helping them with their cuts,
advising them,

252
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.890
and those movies started selling well and making money.

253
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.720
And after we made Cyrus,
our agents came to us and said,

254
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.430
congratulations guys,
you've worked so hard.

255
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.860
We're going to go get you a mega studio deal.

256
00:16:09.861 --> 00:16:12.860
And overall the all to make the kinds of movies you want to make.

257
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:16.460
And it was the dream.
It really was.

258
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:19.190
And we started thinking about what that could mean to us.

259
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.360
And then we got really nauseous and sick to our stomachs because we had been

260
00:16:23.361 --> 00:16:27.590
waiting our whole lives for the cavalry to come get us.

261
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.800
And finally the cavalry was here and we were looking at in the face and we

262
00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:39.020
realized we don't need the cavalry.

263
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:44.080
And I think we don't want the cavalry because after building little movies,

264
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:49.580
$3 short films,
$15,000 features $50,000 feature,

265
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.600
we realized not only were we able to make them in the collaborative process that

266
00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:54.470
we wanted to make them,

267
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:58.080
we were actually making them in a financially sustainable way and a startup

268
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.690
model.
And it was better than working for the cavalry.

269
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.990
And we had this great realization of,
Oh my God,

270
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.170
maybe you don't need the cavalry if you are the cavalry.

271
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.800
And since that day we have kind of stayed away from taking anybody else's money.

272
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:19.340
And I've continually just rolled over the profits from everything we make

273
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:21.500
further into the making of our movies.

274
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.220
And it's been the best thing that's happened to us.
And,

275
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:30.610
and we try to give this advice to people not in a way that says we knew exactly

276
00:17:31.491 --> 00:17:33.290
what we were doing from the beginning.

277
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:37.160
We really stumbled into it because we had no other option and the people that I

278
00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:39.740
meet and that I talked to feel that way.

279
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:44.770
They feel like I have all this magic inside of me and I have no connections and

280
00:17:45.411 --> 00:17:49.010
I don't know how to get this out and I don't have the skill sets.

281
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.633
Um,

282
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:56.150
and our general advice is just keep making this stuff on your own and eventually

283
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.490
it will snowball into a machine that is,

284
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.520
that is unstoppable for you and you will find yourself as strange as it sounds.

285
00:18:05.131 --> 00:18:10.131
And it's strange as it feels to me to this day to stand up here and a blazer and

286
00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:17.391
speak to you as if I am in some sort of position of authority or knowledge that

287
00:18:19.201 --> 00:18:22.470
is useful and you will,

288
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.530
and people will look at you and write articles about you.

289
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.740
And the best part is they're going to say you're a genius and you will know deep

290
00:18:31.771 --> 00:18:35.910
inside that you are just a B minus in genius clothing.

291
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:41.460
But you were smart enough to figure out how to make it work for you and your

292
00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:45.150
victory and your success will be that much sweeter for it.

293
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.330
So thank you for listening.
That's my pontification

294
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.340
<v 2>portion.
I'd love to go back to something you said about half formed ideas.</v>

295
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.010
How do you decide which ones you want to sort of evolved into?

296
00:18:55.011 --> 00:18:58.490
A fully formed idea is like how far down that pathway do you go before you go?

297
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.650
Hmm.
We should probably focus on something else.

298
00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.540
<v 0>Yeah,
it's an interesting thing.
I mean,
uh,
my brother and I who,
you know,</v>

299
00:19:04.541 --> 00:19:09.010
obviously our relationship is incredibly complex and a deep collaboration.
Um,

300
00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.730
and it's a wonderful and terrible thing.
Um,

301
00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:15.010
we talk a lot about what we are able to do with building blocks with each other

302
00:19:15.011 --> 00:19:18.460
because we do share the same creative brain most of the time.

303
00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:22.060
But every now and then you get an idea that is hard to explain,

304
00:19:22.061 --> 00:19:25.900
but it's a feeling based thing.
Uh,
and you cannot verbalize it well.

305
00:19:25.901 --> 00:19:27.700
And if you don't verbalize it correctly,

306
00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.970
you will watch the eyes of the person you're pitching it to and they won't be

307
00:19:30.971 --> 00:19:33.220
excited and it'll start to kill your own magic.

308
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:37.840
So what I try to do in the early stages before I can get it together in my

309
00:19:37.841 --> 00:19:41.560
mouth,
I try to hold it in the dream scape stage.

310
00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:46.240
And it's a very important incubating stage for creative ideas in my opinion.
Um,

311
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.370
and I've,
uh,

312
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.130
I've lost a lot of them cause I took them out before they were ready to be

313
00:19:51.131 --> 00:19:53.270
birthed.
Um,
and,

314
00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.530
and then once you've kind of got it down to a place where you're like,

315
00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:02.230
I know what this is and I can verbalize it,
then I really,

316
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:06.010
then I go to Jay and all my trusted collaborators and we start hammering it and

317
00:20:06.011 --> 00:20:07.060
trying to build the thing up.

318
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.480
And if you find yourself truly exhausted after about two hours of talking about,

319
00:20:13.631 --> 00:20:17.140
it usually means you're trying too hard to make something live that can't live.

320
00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.480
In my experience.
The ones that are ready to go,

321
00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.880
they start to come very quickly and they will be rough hewn,

322
00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:30.070
but they will,
they will make themselves known a little bit more quickly.

323
00:20:30.071 --> 00:20:34.480
So the,
the long and the short of it for me is,
you know,

324
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.200
that whole Bill Joel thing,
I never want to work that hard.
Like if you,

325
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:42.130
if you are sweating a lot,
um,

326
00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.790
there's such a thing as too much elbow grease and you kind of let it go.

327
00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.700
And for me,
they always up going back into the pool,

328
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.670
getting caught up in the chlorine and they come back to me a couple of years

329
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:52.550
later and something else.
So

330
00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.150
<v 2>I suppose it's the same sort of mentality is like there's only so much you can</v>

331
00:20:56.151 --> 00:20:58.870
Polish a Turd.
Not that they're turning out,
but like at a certain point in coma,

332
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.830
it just hurts.
Not at all.
Um,
yes,
I,
I,
yes,
I agree.

333
00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.990
How do you personally define success?

334
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.630
<v 0>Ooh,
that's a,
that's a hard question.
I mean,
uh,
it's,</v>

335
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:16.460
it's hard to define.
For me it's,
it's an ever changing thing.

336
00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.340
My brother and I talk about,
uh,

337
00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.350
recalibrating the mountains that we like to climb.

338
00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.910
And I think that when I was younger,

339
00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.350
the idea that I might one day get a feature film into Sundance and sit in that

340
00:21:27.351 --> 00:21:29.810
audience.
And watch it play,

341
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:34.220
no matter what happened was as far as I could dream of going.

342
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:38.340
That happened when I was 28 and happened way earlier than I thought it was going

343
00:21:38.341 --> 00:21:38.841
to happen.

344
00:21:38.841 --> 00:21:41.570
And I cried in the movie theater when it happened and it was beautiful.

345
00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:46.020
And the next day I was super depressed a because,
uh,

346
00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:50.050
I had killed my God,
that was my God I was chasing and B,

347
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:54.230
it didn't make me happy and I started to realize,
Oh shit,

348
00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.270
if you get to the top of the mountain,
you've been climbing,

349
00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.140
it's not definitely going to make you happy.
I'm still,

350
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.970
that's just an intellectual concept.

351
00:22:01.971 --> 00:22:04.940
So I still keep making new mountain's for myself and Oh if I get there,

352
00:22:04.941 --> 00:22:05.900
it's going to be really awesome.

353
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:09.440
I want to get there and it's given me a really awesome,
you know,
and uh,

354
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:13.530
this is totally a midlife crisis.
He stuff cause I just turned 40.
Um,

355
00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.140
but now it's,

356
00:22:15.141 --> 00:22:20.141
it's definitely the sort of realization that there's really nothing else I'm

357
00:22:21.621 --> 00:22:26.621
going to do career wise that's going to make like a big splash for me,

358
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:27.920
you know?
Um,

359
00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.980
I have enough money to eat and put my kids through school and own a home.

360
00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.910
That's it.
I'm good.
And I have the creative freedom to make the projects I want.

361
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.200
That's it.
I'm good.

362
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:41.240
So now it's really all about collaborating with my favorite people on the planet

363
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:46.070
and trying to make the process of making stuff as important as the product,

364
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:51.200
which when I was in my twenties I was really willing to destroy myself in the

365
00:22:51.201 --> 00:22:54.530
process and hurt badly to get a good product.

366
00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:59.740
Now I'm trying to like get some joy in the process too so I can live long.

367
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.600
<v 2>And in terms of,</v>

368
00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.390
because you do have your hands in so many different pies and then projects,
um,

369
00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:09.120
how,
how do you like manage your time with that?
Because it sounds like,
you know,

370
00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.790
you're focusing on the things you really want to,

371
00:23:10.791 --> 00:23:14.870
but at the same time you're also producing an exec producing and writing and

372
00:23:14.871 --> 00:23:16.130
then starting at other people think,

373
00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:20.900
<v 0>yeah,
it's a,
it's a couple of things.
Um,
you know,
I don't have a social life.</v>

374
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:25.790
I've given that up.
I have my marriage,
I have my kids,
I have my work life,

375
00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.670
and then I read books.
That's really all that I do.
Um,

376
00:23:28.671 --> 00:23:31.280
I don't even really watch movies anymore.
Um,

377
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.950
and so that's something that keeps things efficient.

378
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:37.250
I don't believe in working 12 hour crazy days.
Um,

379
00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:40.310
sometimes you have to do that when you're on set according to union rules and

380
00:23:40.311 --> 00:23:44.450
such.
But I really believe in the eight hour day,
I like working nine to five.

381
00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.460
I like being,
uh,

382
00:23:46.461 --> 00:23:50.600
for dinner with my kids and like playing board games with my kids.

383
00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:54.500
It's like that is I think very important to refuel you for your creativity,

384
00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:59.220
but also lead a well balanced life.
Um,
so the other answer is I'm,

385
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.390
I'm pretty ruthlessly efficient with my time.
You know,

386
00:24:02.391 --> 00:24:07.010
I don't get on conference calls,
um,
if I don't have to be there.

387
00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:11.570
I'm very good at delegating authority because it comes from a place of the

388
00:24:11.571 --> 00:24:15.710
inherent belief that I just don't know best that I only know best collectively

389
00:24:15.711 --> 00:24:17.150
with my people to back me up.

390
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:22.160
So I'm totally willing to pass things off unless I know for sure I'm the perfect

391
00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:25.880
person to do it.
If I don't know that,
pass it off,
give it to somebody else.

392
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:27.860
That's just as good of a chance that they'll do better with it.

393
00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.530
I really believe now,
you know,

394
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.730
I made a movie called Blue Jay that I should have directed according to

395
00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:38.930
everybody.
Cause I wrote it,
I started it,
I produced it.
Why not just direct it?

396
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:40.100
Right.
Well my thing was like,

397
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:43.850
well then don't have to sit in the edit room for three more months after it's

398
00:24:43.851 --> 00:24:46.600
done.
I'd have to location scout and be there upfront.

399
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.400
Why don't know a hire like a 30 year olds,

400
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.470
less experienced but super inspired and hungry kid to do it.
Who,

401
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:59.090
what he lacks in experience.
He will beat me out and dedication and time spent.

402
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:04.280
So it's,
it's things like that that kind of helped me be a,
be a human being.

403
00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.870
Um,
and then,
you know,
the last thing is,
um,

404
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:13.100
I don't take any meetings.
General meetings are a huge thing in this town,

405
00:25:13.101 --> 00:25:17.180
in this crazy industry.
And I know they happen in other industry too.
Man.

406
00:25:17.181 --> 00:25:17.691
Let's meet up.

407
00:25:17.691 --> 00:25:19.970
Let's see if it was like a way we can like collaborate on something together.

408
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.450
45 minutes to drive there.
Five minutes waiting in the office.

409
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.140
25 minutes of bullshit talk.
Yeah,
we're going to work together forever.

410
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.350
Another 30 minutes driving home,
two hours gone.

411
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:35.770
And you could have written 10 great pages of a script in those two hours that

412
00:25:35.871 --> 00:25:36.531
you talked about it.

413
00:25:36.531 --> 00:25:40.670
So I don't take any general meetings and something I've really had to do.

414
00:25:40.671 --> 00:25:43.350
It's like kind of broke my heart.
But like I,

415
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:46.580
I really like being a mentor in this industry as much as I can.

416
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:51.080
But now I've gotten to the place where I get like probably 10 emails a day from

417
00:25:51.081 --> 00:25:54.050
young filmmakers saying,
can I take you out for lunch?

418
00:25:54.051 --> 00:25:57.350
Can I take you to coffee and pick your brain?
And,

419
00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:01.550
and I used to love to do that,
but I just can't do that and stay productive.

420
00:26:01.551 --> 00:26:06.500
So now what I say,
which is so hard,
I just say,
you know,

421
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:10.760
I,
I could lie to you and say,
yeah,
maybe we'll do it in six months.

422
00:26:10.761 --> 00:26:13.130
But the truth is if in six months I do get time,

423
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:17.180
I'm going to use that time for my kids or to maybe exercise or something.

424
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.810
So I'm never going to be able to meet with you and I don't want you to waste

425
00:26:20.811 --> 00:26:24.170
your time trying to get me to meet with you and save you.

426
00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.370
Here's what you should do.
Ask me your five most important questions right now.

427
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.720
I'll answer them on email.

428
00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:33.590
Here's a speech that I gave at south by southwest and it gives you specific

429
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:37.310
details of how to make a movie.
And that's kind of why I do talks like this.

430
00:26:37.311 --> 00:26:41.480
I can centralize it and then go with God and,
and good luck.

431
00:26:41.481 --> 00:26:45.530
So it's a little bit of just like,
you know,
dialing in and like,
I mean,

432
00:26:45.531 --> 00:26:46.201
I joked before,

433
00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:51.000
but I have a fantastic relationship with my therapist that thank God my

434
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:56.180
director's guild insurance pays for and I meet with her twice a week and we like

435
00:26:56.611 --> 00:27:00.960
hard core architecture,
my life.
It's not like feelings and stuff in there.

436
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.180
I bring her like my three main issues.
I'm like,

437
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:07.260
I've got a time management issue here.
One of my staff members is not great here.

438
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.520
I want to do these two things.

439
00:27:08.521 --> 00:27:10.770
I've got to figure out which one because I know I can only do one.

440
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.490
And she's way smarter than me and more emotionally evolved and she works it out

441
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:18.210
with me.
And that's uh,
that's been a huge help to me.

442
00:27:18.211 --> 00:27:22.110
So if you got health insurance,
fine,
like a super smart,

443
00:27:22.111 --> 00:27:25.160
organized therapists and they will rock your fucking world's yeah,

444
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:30.120
<v 2>sure.
Tangible advice.
Yeah.
Oh No,
it's real dude.</v>

445
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:36.030
<v 0>And then every now and then you think you're going there to get organized advice</v>

446
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:39.220
and you just ended up crying about something else and the,
and they're,

447
00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.010
they're right there for you.
So that's great.

448
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.240
<v 2>That's,
it's an excellent resource.
Yeah.
It's all about utilizing what resources.</v>

449
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.300
Um,
uh,

450
00:27:47.301 --> 00:27:50.240
I'd love to talk more about sort of developing community because you already

451
00:27:50.241 --> 00:27:53.030
have this built in like default committee.
You,
your brother,

452
00:27:53.031 --> 00:27:57.900
like that's from the start,
you know,
settled with a collaborator.
Um,

453
00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:00.260
but sort of growing that community over the years,
like,

454
00:28:00.261 --> 00:28:02.600
do you find yourself working with mostly the same?
I,

455
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.900
I've seen you work with a lot of the same people over the years,
but what does,

456
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.340
what does it sort of,
when,

457
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.860
what does it like when you bring somebody new into that collaborative?
Yeah.

458
00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:14.510
<v 0>Yes.
There's a couple of things about the collaborations that I truly believe in.</v>

459
00:28:14.511 --> 00:28:15.970
Obviously I have my brother and,

460
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.000
and the wonderful and terrible nature of everything that we are together.
Um,
and,

461
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.040
and then there is w uh,

462
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.330
the thing that Jay and I call having affairs on each other,
you know,
which is,

463
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:31.640
it's really important for j to be able to go beyond transparent and be whoever

464
00:28:31.641 --> 00:28:36.470
he wants to be in front of them and not have me standing right behind him who

465
00:28:36.471 --> 00:28:37.850
knows everything about him.

466
00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:41.780
Silently judging him for being a little bit different for who he is today.

467
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:46.010
He gets to be the free spirited j of whatever the fuck he wants to be in that

468
00:28:46.011 --> 00:28:46.640
moment.

469
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.550
And he gets to collaborate with someone in a new way who appreciates him in a

470
00:28:49.551 --> 00:28:51.950
new way and it rejuvenates him.
Likewise,

471
00:28:51.951 --> 00:28:56.420
I get to go off either as an actor or maybe as a producer like I did with with

472
00:28:56.421 --> 00:29:00.110
Blue Jay,
with Sarah Paulson and develop these new emotional relationships.

473
00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.290
So I think it's very healthy.
They're little retreats that,

474
00:29:03.291 --> 00:29:07.340
that keep you going if you have a main collaborative marriage.
Um,

475
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.080
likewise,
um,

476
00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.400
when we are hiring new collaborators or new people to work with,

477
00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.630
I found this out on accident,
but I really believe in it now.
Um,

478
00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:22.550
I hire strictly on thought process and personality style.

479
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:26.060
Um,
skillset is not even anything I consider.
In fact,

480
00:29:26.061 --> 00:29:31.061
I find hiring an experienced producer can be a negative because the first thing

481
00:29:31.071 --> 00:29:34.160
they do is I've got my budgeting software,
am I scheduling software?

482
00:29:34.161 --> 00:29:36.050
And we're just like,
whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
You know,

483
00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:40.880
hiring the most brilliant inspired and nice loving,

484
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.350
evolved people that I can,
you can teach them all the other stuff in a week.

485
00:29:44.351 --> 00:29:49.210
You can't teach any of that other stuff.
So it's not really anything new.
But,
um,

486
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:53.420
I find that often in the film business,
people really hire for credits.
Um,

487
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:56.380
and I don't believe in that.
And it,
most importantly,

488
00:29:56.381 --> 00:30:00.190
I like to work with people who are young and excited and are willing to give me

489
00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:03.790
their best and are willing to take their errors because of their lack of

490
00:30:03.791 --> 00:30:07.810
experience because it made up for in dedication and enthusiasm.

491
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:10.420
So many times you're on a film shoot,

492
00:30:10.421 --> 00:30:14.320
put together a million dollar movie and they're like,
dude,
I think I can get,

493
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:19.300
um,
you know,
Bradford young to be RDP for this.
And I'm like,

494
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.960
if you get Bradford young by chance to work at one 50th of his rate,

495
00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:28.390
he's going to be so goddamn miserable on this movie and he's going to want

496
00:30:28.391 --> 00:30:31.120
everything to go his way because he's working at a reduced rate.

497
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.060
Don't do that to yourself higher.

498
00:30:34.061 --> 00:30:38.580
The 26 year old kid who shot up beautiful short and is ready for his step up and

499
00:30:38.581 --> 00:30:39.820
we'll give you the world for it.

500
00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.620
<v 2>How do,
how do you sort of source these people,
not sorts of,
I'm,</v>

501
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.950
I assume some come to you summer through your network,

502
00:30:44.951 --> 00:30:48.940
but like how do you discover or be put in touch with like this sort of,

503
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.280
<v 0>yeah,
I mean a lot,
some of it is like,</v>

504
00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:54.370
I have a relationship with Sundance and I'm like,
hey guys,

505
00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:58.590
send me the to 10 really incredible short films that you saw this year.
You know,

506
00:30:58.591 --> 00:31:02.440
and,
and uh,
same thing with documentary film makers.
Um,

507
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.960
some of it is,
you know,

508
00:31:04.961 --> 00:31:07.780
we really believe in kind of promoting from within.

509
00:31:07.781 --> 00:31:11.750
So some people start with us as assistance and they grow up and our companies

510
00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.270
kind of weird.
There's not a lot of people there.

511
00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:18.271
So technically my assistant who's like scheduling me is also the lead producer

512
00:31:18.941 --> 00:31:20.560
of creep to like,
you know,

513
00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:25.810
everybody's doing lots of different things.
Um,
but,

514
00:31:25.811 --> 00:31:29.050
uh,
I don't know.
I don't have a good answer for how we find them.

515
00:31:29.051 --> 00:31:32.680
It's definitely not like,
we definitely don't do interviews or anything.

516
00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:33.990
<v 2>Yeah,
for sure.
But just like,
what are,</v>

517
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.940
I guess if there were like stand out moments of like,
Hey,

518
00:31:35.941 --> 00:31:38.700
this is actually how we got like the producer of creepy.
Yeah.

519
00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.750
We met up at Sundance is a perfect

520
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.980
<v 0>Alix layman who directed Bluejay for me was one of the shooters on the league</v>

521
00:31:44.981 --> 00:31:49.810
that I was on for years and it was the land of sarcastic Dick Jokes.

522
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:53.410
And Alex and I would end up talking about like documentaries by the craft

523
00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:57.670
service table by ourselves and found that we had a little thing there and,

524
00:31:57.671 --> 00:31:58.690
and you know,
I was like,
oh,

525
00:31:58.691 --> 00:32:02.980
I need a director who can shoot really well and who's really smart and sensitive

526
00:32:02.981 --> 00:32:05.350
and,
and who I'm close with and you know,

527
00:32:05.351 --> 00:32:09.610
has just had a feeling about him and took a chance.
You know,
I really like,

528
00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:14.050
I really like taking chances on young people for all the reasons we've talked

529
00:32:14.051 --> 00:32:14.720
about.

530
00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.630
<v 2>Um,
going back to blue Jay or continuing with Blue Jay Dee,</v>

531
00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:21.120
do you find it challenging to be in roles that you've written or is it almost

532
00:32:21.121 --> 00:32:23.700
easier because it's obviously there's a natural connection?

533
00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:29.340
<v 0>I personally feel like I am at my best as a performer when it's something that I</v>

534
00:32:29.741 --> 00:32:31.990
have written for a number of reasons.
One,

535
00:32:31.991 --> 00:32:35.740
I feel empowered to trash the dialogue without feeling bad about what I'm doing

536
00:32:35.741 --> 00:32:37.840
to the writer so I can improvise in the moment.

537
00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.360
Obviously I have a deeper of the character because I've been living with it for

538
00:32:41.361 --> 00:32:45.920
a long time.
Um,
and all false modesty aside and everything.

539
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.400
I'm never,
I'm not the kind of actor like,
you know,

540
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:53.020
for me like Oscar Isaac or,
or you know,

541
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:57.620
Sarah Paulson who you look at them and you see the ocean in their eyes and they

542
00:32:57.621 --> 00:33:01.790
don't have to say anything and they just emote and they are just unbelievably

543
00:33:01.791 --> 00:33:06.410
magnetic.
You know,
I really believe I'm more of the B minus version of that.

544
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:10.490
But what makes me really good and relevant is I know how to control a narrative

545
00:33:10.491 --> 00:33:13.700
from inside of a scene.
I know how to make the person across from me look really,

546
00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:17.120
really good and serve them up the things that are going to make them score in

547
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:21.680
the moment.
So I'm kind of,
when I'm puppeteering a little bit,

548
00:33:21.681 --> 00:33:24.680
kind of producing,
directing,
writing,
acting from inside the scene,

549
00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:29.150
which is how I came up doing stuff because it was just me and Jay,
you know,
um,

550
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.990
that,
that is a skill set that I have just randomly,
I think,

551
00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:35.270
I think I've really perfected that thing.

552
00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:39.520
<v 2>I'm talking about sort of digital distribution.
Yeah.</v>

553
00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:42.540
It's like the hot term paper.
I feel like it has enabled you and men,

554
00:33:42.541 --> 00:33:45.640
it's like a ton of other people that yeah.
Can you doing these projects that,

555
00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.730
you know,
it's,
it's,
you're able to instill more of yourself in it.
Yeah.
Um,

556
00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:52.620
sort of you guys embrace that from the start I feel like.

557
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:56.010
<v 0>Yeah.
And it wasn't,
again,
you know,
it wasn't a top down philosophy.</v>

558
00:33:56.011 --> 00:33:57.900
I didn't understand this business when I started.

559
00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:02.940
I was a musician first before I was a filmmaker and I was so bummed that I was

560
00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.020
10 years too late to the digital reservoir,
a revolution in music.
You know,

561
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:09.990
you could make a really great computer at home,
sorry,

562
00:34:09.991 --> 00:34:14.670
you could make a really great record on your computer at home in like 1995.

563
00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:15.450
Um,

564
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:19.890
and I was starting to make records and like 2002 and the market was flooded and

565
00:34:19.891 --> 00:34:22.530
nobody cared about what I had to say and stuff I was making was okay.

566
00:34:22.531 --> 00:34:25.310
And I would just,
I didn't get there.
Um,

567
00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:30.180
in 2005 when I started really turning my attention towards filmmaking,

568
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.610
that's when the technology hit.

569
00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:37.940
So I literally was that lucky asshole who was in the perfect place at the

570
00:34:38.221 --> 00:34:41.640
perfect time.
I really believe like my first movie,
the Puffy Chair,

571
00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:45.060
it's a good movie.
It's got a big heart.
It's got some smarts in it.

572
00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:47.730
I believe if I submit that movie to Sundance today,

573
00:34:47.731 --> 00:34:50.580
it does not get in in 2005.

574
00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:55.470
There weren't that many of us and I was there and I was luckily able to ride

575
00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:59.940
that wave and the technology is now getting not only cheaper and cheaper to make

576
00:34:59.941 --> 00:35:00.774
stuff,

577
00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:05.220
but obviously with things like Netflix and iTunes.

578
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:10.110
Um,
I realized what a perfect platform that is for the kind of art I make.

579
00:35:10.111 --> 00:35:14.070
And not to keep beating a dead horse here,
but um,

580
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:16.680
when you watch a movie on Netflix,

581
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.650
I think you essentially perceive it as watching it for free because either you

582
00:35:19.651 --> 00:35:23.490
are paying for your service up front and it's hidden in the back of your mind

583
00:35:23.491 --> 00:35:24.690
through your auto bill,
a credit card,

584
00:35:24.691 --> 00:35:26.580
or you're stealing your dad's password like I am.

585
00:35:26.581 --> 00:35:29.370
Which is so weird that I still do that.
I haven't,
oh,

586
00:35:29.371 --> 00:35:32.940
I have an overall deal at Netflix and an overall deal at HBO.

587
00:35:32.941 --> 00:35:34.470
And I'm using my dad's password

588
00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:39.210
<v 2>both places.
So you're,
you're like played huge.
It's a bunch of your stuff.</v>

589
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.150
Does he like,
oh,
he's on the count and that they account again,
it works out good

590
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:43.720
<v 0>cause he doesn't know what good stuff to put on.</v>

591
00:35:43.721 --> 00:35:46.450
So he gets my curation for free and he pays the big bucks for it.

592
00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:51.750
<v 2>Um,
it's really embarrassing.
Um,
it's economic</v>

593
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.640
<v 0>and economic.
Yeah.
Um,
and uh,
so yeah.</v>

594
00:35:55.641 --> 00:36:00.350
So for me,
I think it's really crucial to a movie.

595
00:36:00.351 --> 00:36:02.360
I keep using blue Jay,
but it's the last one I made.

596
00:36:02.361 --> 00:36:05.450
It's a small black and white relationship movie with me and Sarah Paulson.

597
00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.970
It's a curiosity factor movie in my opinion.

598
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.310
If I'm objective looking at Blue Jay and I hadn't made it,

599
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:13.400
I'm not paying $15 to see that in the movie theater.
Some people will,

600
00:36:13.401 --> 00:36:16.550
the rabid fans,
but probably not.
Uh,

601
00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.430
more people will pay six 99 to rent it on iTunes,

602
00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:24.580
but everybody will watch it on Netflix and we release it globally and quietly,

603
00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:31.480
millions and millions of people have watched blue Jay to a comparative box

604
00:36:32.421 --> 00:36:36.020
office number over $100 million of my viewers.

605
00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.660
Now I don't see that money because they're free clicks.

606
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:42.350
But I wouldn't have gotten a 20th of those viewers if I didn't have Netflix

607
00:36:42.351 --> 00:36:45.380
because they are not going to come and pay in the movie theater.
And you know,

608
00:36:45.381 --> 00:36:49.610
sometimes I feel like that's a little bit of a defeatist bottom feeder ideology.

609
00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:54.350
But most of the time I feel like thank God I have a place where all these people

610
00:36:54.351 --> 00:36:57.410
will come see my movies.
Who am I to be picky as an independent filmmaker?

611
00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.010
You know?

612
00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:03.010
So I to your first question and extremely grateful for the digital platforms

613
00:37:03.891 --> 00:37:07.820
that are allowing people to watch movies for free and take little risks on them.

614
00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:11.960
And what I try to do is say,
you click on my movie,

615
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.600
I want to be the one that takes you all the way through it because ideally I

616
00:37:14.601 --> 00:37:16.100
made you a really,
really good movie.

617
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.320
<v 2>Would you say when it comes to things like working with Hbo,
um,</v>

618
00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.930
whether it's a little more,
well I don't know,
is there,

619
00:37:22.931 --> 00:37:24.970
is there more sort of high touch?

620
00:37:24.971 --> 00:37:27.760
Like are they more involved in it or are they just like,
hey,
go forth and do,

621
00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:28.770
do your thing.

622
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:32.730
<v 0>Everything is tricky.
Uh,
with all of my deals,
most of the deals I,</v>

623
00:37:32.731 --> 00:37:36.030
that I try to make,
and I'll try not to get too like Samantha about this,

624
00:37:36.031 --> 00:37:40.050
but most of the deals I try to make our,
our,
our deals that say,
listen,

625
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:43.950
I'm making this for a fraction of the price of your other things that you make.

626
00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:47.010
So just kind of let us do our thing.
And uh,

627
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.280
if you fall in love with it through all your promotional dollars at it and it's

628
00:37:50.281 --> 00:37:51.114
going to be great.

629
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.750
And if you happen to just kind of like it and just let it sit on your service

630
00:37:54.751 --> 00:37:56.850
and people will find it long term,
I'm okay with that.
You know?

631
00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:59.220
I don't try to beat the shit out of my networks on that front.
Yeah,

632
00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:00.800
<v 2>no,
it just in terms of like what,
what's,</v>

633
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.290
what would you say is the most absurd thing that they've sort of glommed on to

634
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:06.180
and that you were most surprised then?

635
00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.930
<v 0>I mean,
HBO honestly is Pretty Great.
You know,</v>

636
00:38:08.931 --> 00:38:10.850
like we were bummed when they cancelled togetherness,

637
00:38:10.851 --> 00:38:15.110
but I understand that the landscape is changing and they have different

638
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:18.500
objectives that they need to achieve.

639
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:23.360
Netflix is a place where it's a fifth store.
Everything's there.

640
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:26.480
You got to go sift through it.
Hbo needs to be a place that says,

641
00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:30.410
I'm curating for you so that everything you click is good and that's why they're

642
00:38:30.411 --> 00:38:33.140
trying to get people to pay a little bit extra for that price so they have to be

643
00:38:33.141 --> 00:38:34.700
careful and they spend a little more money.

644
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:40.200
I haven't gotten those like crazy studio notes for a long time.

645
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.100
My first studio movie,

646
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:46.120
I was shocked at the stuff that they wanted me to do.

647
00:38:46.121 --> 00:38:51.121
I was telling the story of a depressed 40 year old man and who lived in a shitty

648
00:38:52.001 --> 00:38:55.390
apartment because he had no money and they looked at the dailies and they were

649
00:38:55.391 --> 00:39:00.280
like,
it's just so down and Brown.
And I was like,
yeah,

650
00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.160
cause he's depressed and he doesn't have any money.

651
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:07.120
And then they asked me if I'd be willing to put some colorful throw pillows and

652
00:39:07.121 --> 00:39:12.121
the scene and reshoot the scene after I've just earned John Riley's trusts,

653
00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:16.870
the first movie star I've ever worked for and I'm 29 years old.
Um,

654
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.440
they want me to go tell him we have to re shoot the scene because even though

655
00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:23.950
his performance was impeccable,
we'd like to have some throw pillows in there.

656
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.300
And I'm a very amenable person.
I've been to therapy,
I know how to validate,

657
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:29.770
I know how to communicate well.

658
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.260
And I did all of that stuff leading up to that point.

659
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:37.950
And they perceive that as weakness and they started trampling all over us.

660
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.710
But when they asked me for the throw pillows,

661
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:46.780
they pulled up a fucking van outside of set after a 12 hour shoot day and made

662
00:39:46.781 --> 00:39:50.410
us sit in the van and asked us for throw pillows and I lost my shit.

663
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.750
And I started screaming.

664
00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:57.700
And from that minute to them in the studio world,
that meant,

665
00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.260
oh,
he has vision,

666
00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.960
<v 2>good to know.
And they started leaving me alone</v>

667
00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.390
<v 0>and I really,
it almost killed me.
And I was like,</v>

668
00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.980
I cannot function inside of a world where in order to be taken seriously and

669
00:40:10.981 --> 00:40:14.460
taken out my word,
I have to be a raging dickhead

670
00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:19.040
<v 2>about throw pillows about brokers.
Yeah.
And I won't,
I won't do it.</v>

671
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:23.260
That's probably a good thing.
Generally speaking.
Yeah.
Uh,

672
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:24.950
we'll take audience questions in a minute,

673
00:40:24.951 --> 00:40:26.870
but I just want to ask a few quick questions.
Of course,

674
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:29.660
because of these evolved clearly been super quick.
Um,
uh,
what,

675
00:40:29.661 --> 00:40:33.320
so what inspires you?
Like where do you draw your inspiration from?
Like,
um,

676
00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:37.260
<v 0>question,
I don't seek it.
You know,
I don't go and say like,
oh,</v>

677
00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:41.960
I need this because I need to feel inspired.
Uh,
I really like reading books.
Um,

678
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:46.100
and I,
uh,
like exercising a lot.

679
00:40:46.101 --> 00:40:49.820
That helps me kind of get into a dream space.
And music is a big thing for me,

680
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.860
but mostly,
um,

681
00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:56.000
I kind of am an extremely nostalgic person for whatever reason.

682
00:40:56.001 --> 00:40:59.330
That's just the way that I am.
Um,
and,
and the war,

683
00:40:59.331 --> 00:41:04.331
I lean into that and my sense of weird longing in the world,

684
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:08.180
uh,
for things that were or aren't or could be.

685
00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:13.540
And if I do that in a way that has a sense of humor about itself and pokes fun

686
00:41:13.821 --> 00:41:18.770
at,
um,
that seems to be my special sauce or whatever you want to call,

687
00:41:18.771 --> 00:41:21.640
it seems to be the thing that people connect to.
Um,
and,

688
00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.490
and resonates and it's where I'm really comfortable.
So,
um,

689
00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:29.000
I tend to kind of live in that space for whatever reason.

690
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:33.680
<v 2>What's one of the things that you struggle with that you maybe in the beginning</v>

691
00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:36.260
of your career not to still be struggling with now?

692
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:39.680
<v 0>Well,
that's a really good question.
Um,</v>

693
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:44.960
I think I thought it was going to get,
um,

694
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:49.580
progressively easier to make good pieces of art.
Um,

695
00:41:49.581 --> 00:41:53.360
I thought I was going to get a lot more skilled at the process and that would

696
00:41:53.361 --> 00:41:58.361
directly translate to better products more quickly and with less tension and

697
00:41:58.761 --> 00:42:01.410
struggle.
And that has not been the case.
Um,

698
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:04.490
I find that every time I show up to make something,

699
00:42:04.491 --> 00:42:07.340
I feel confused and I feel lost.

700
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:12.500
And I have good tricks that I've learned throughout the way,
but,
but it's,
um,

701
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.970
the elusiveness of trying to make an inspired an original piece of art remains

702
00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.630
enormous for me.
Um,

703
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:21.530
and it makes sense because you said if it was a learning process,

704
00:42:21.531 --> 00:42:25.100
everything you made would get better than the last,
but you got to get lucky.

705
00:42:25.101 --> 00:42:28.000
You gotta be in the right place.
And that weird,
um,

706
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:33.130
phantom alchemy of what makes something good is just as far from my reach as it

707
00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:35.540
was when I started

708
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.521
<v 2>living or dead.</v>

709
00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:40.160
Who is someone you'd love to collaborate with that you haven't already?

710
00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:45.510
<v 0>Um,
and that's a really great question.
Um,</v>

711
00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.900
I mean,
the first instinct I had was I love my people.

712
00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:57.010
Like I'm not looking for anybody else.
I've got trust and I've got,

713
00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:00.190
um,
like,
you know,
it sounds stupid,

714
00:43:00.191 --> 00:43:04.330
but like I can laugh and cry with all the people I work with and that takes a

715
00:43:04.331 --> 00:43:09.310
little time to like build that up,
you know?
Um,
so yeah,
I'm not really,

716
00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:11.950
I'm not really craving anything.
I'm kind of good where I'm at.

717
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:15.420
<v 2>I think that's probably a good thing.
Yeah.
Um,
you've,</v>

718
00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.820
you've given us some great advice today,

719
00:43:16.821 --> 00:43:19.160
so what's one of the best pieces of advice that you've been given?

720
00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:21.123
<v 0>Mm,</v>

721
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:28.030
Jay and I talked about this a lot and we realize that we never had a mentor.

722
00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.730
Um,
and I think part of it is because we've been very insular with our energy.

723
00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:35.270
Part of it is we tried to do a career where there was no one around us who had

724
00:43:35.271 --> 00:43:37.230
done this career to help us.
Um,

725
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:41.240
but we've never ever had anybody come to us and say,

726
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:44.750
let me give you a hand with this,
or you should try this.
And,

727
00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.400
and I think it's been great for us.
It was really a struggle.
Um,

728
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:54.560
but it,
it,
it made us ultimately extremely resourceful.

729
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.860
Um,
and whenever I overcome an obstacle,

730
00:43:57.861 --> 00:44:02.861
now I don't really look around for something to kind of a calendar,

731
00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:05.150
show me what to do.

732
00:44:05.151 --> 00:44:10.151
I just kind of grab the nearest people around me and my group of collaborators

733
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:13.670
and call a meeting and then we just attack it.
Um,

734
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:17.660
and it was hard,
you know,
like spend a lot of time,

735
00:44:17.661 --> 00:44:20.750
like super anxious and depressed through my twenties and all that stuff.

736
00:44:20.751 --> 00:44:24.740
It's scared I wasn't gonna be able to make anything decent.
Um,
but,
um,

737
00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:26.450
I guess I'm glad for it now.

738
00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.340
<v 2>Cool.
Yeah.
Anyone wants to ask a question?
Mark?</v>

739
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.273
Hello?

740
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:37.470
<v 4>I am super interested in sibling development teams and I'm curious,</v>

741
00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:42.730
looking back if there's any rhyme or reason to why you and your brother teamed

742
00:44:42.731 --> 00:44:47.110
up basically as a father of four siblings,
it's manipulate them in any way.

743
00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:50.150
<v 0>Yes,
a great,
great question.
Um,</v>

744
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.390
I'll try to be my parents right now and tell you what they did to us and if

745
00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:58.850
there's anything useful.
Um,
I don't have a ton of nuggets here.
Um,

746
00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:04.140
one thing is that,
um,
we were,
uh,
thoroughly,

747
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:07.950
uh,
left to our own devices and we had a very uncurated childhood.

748
00:45:07.951 --> 00:45:12.210
We were thrown together and we had to figure out how to do things ourselves.
Uh,

749
00:45:12.211 --> 00:45:15.450
so it was never here's a piano and go ahead and learn it.

750
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.600
We had to beg them to buy us a $12 Casio so that we could learn it.

751
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:24.430
Um,
and for whatever reason it fostered us and in,
in a,

752
00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:29.430
in a voracious tenacity with each other,
uh,
because we feel,
we felt like,

753
00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:32.130
you know,
I mean,
they look,
our parents are great and they loved this,

754
00:45:32.131 --> 00:45:35.520
but Jay was my tribe in terms of,
you know,
what I needed.

755
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.120
So with a distinct lack of leadership at the top,

756
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:42.720
we were like super tight together.
Um,

757
00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:46.830
they did not intervene and our fights and they let us work it out.
Um,

758
00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.570
they were able to do that because Jay,

759
00:45:48.571 --> 00:45:51.570
my older brother is just super sweet and didn't beat the shit out of me.

760
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:55.830
So the conflicts were never physically dangerous.
They were always emotional.
Um,

761
00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.950
and so they just let us do our thing.
Um,

762
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:04.350
and the only thing that I think they didn't curate but happened,
which was good,

763
00:46:04.351 --> 00:46:06.600
is that every now and then when we were fighting,

764
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:11.190
they would punish us just one level,
two unjustly.

765
00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:12.240
Um,

766
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:17.240
and that would make us go to our rooms and join forces against the greater evil

767
00:46:17.551 --> 00:46:20.490
of them and get rid of all the conflict between us.

768
00:46:20.491 --> 00:46:22.710
And I think that might've been one of the more effective ones.

769
00:46:22.711 --> 00:46:26.610
So there's a little something going on,
Hammer them times too,

770
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.420
and be willing to sacrifice yourself in that and it might make them join against

771
00:46:30.421 --> 00:46:33.200
you because now you're the depth,
common threat.
Okay.
Thank you.

772
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:37.043
<v 5>Hi.
Uh,</v>

773
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:41.220
I wanted to know what kind of budgets off to the software you're using.

774
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.380
<v 0>Yes,
it's a very good question.
I'm not going to tell you,
you know,</v>

775
00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:48.900
<v 5>um,
I think the $3 short stories are really,</v>

776
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:52.770
or the story about the $3 short is a really inspiring,

777
00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:57.090
and I wanted to know what if I told you you had today,
this afternoon free,

778
00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:58.680
what would you make?

779
00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:03.910
<v 0>Um,
I'm doing,
I do have this afternoon free.
Uh,
so here's what's coming up.</v>

780
00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.660
I'm going to leave here,
I'm going to drive home as soon as I can.
Um,

781
00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:11.290
I'm going to have dinner with my kids at five o'clock and I want to try to

782
00:47:11.291 --> 00:47:16.060
exercise at four 30.
So that means between about two 15 and four 30,

783
00:47:16.061 --> 00:47:19.980
I have some time about an hour that I got to watch cuts for room one oh four on

784
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:24.490
my new show,
but I'll get about an hour to like do something with.

785
00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.353
Um,

786
00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:30.420
and what I'm doing right now is I am writing a novel and I don't know what it's

787
00:47:32.261 --> 00:47:33.540
about.
Um,

788
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:38.880
but I'm writing in 300 word chunks and there's an old guy named Norman and he's

789
00:47:40.151 --> 00:47:42.470
talking through me right now and,

790
00:47:42.471 --> 00:47:47.471
and I specifically have a completely unstructured and out to sea so that I feel

791
00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:50.800
kind of 13 or 14.
Again,

792
00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:54.130
just picking up a guitar for the first time and I don't know what I'm doing.

793
00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:57.610
Does that intense learning curve when you first learn something that's so

794
00:47:57.611 --> 00:48:01.600
exciting?
It makes you feel young.
And then we get good at our craft and we,

795
00:48:01.601 --> 00:48:05.290
and we get steadfast and you lose a little bit of that child like excitement.

796
00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:09.580
So for me it's very important to like constantly pick up new things and like get

797
00:48:09.581 --> 00:48:13.450
that sense of fumbling through it.
And I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

798
00:48:13.451 --> 00:48:16.670
And so fiction writing is that for me right now.
Cool.
Thanks.
Yeah.

799
00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:22.600
And budget software is a Microsoft word document,
gas colon,

800
00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.620
$500.

801
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:29.250
The Home Depot lights $350 up front return within 30 days,

802
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:32.200
$350 back.

803
00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:37.630
<v 5>Um,
hi,
big fan.
By the way,
as a writer performer,</v>

804
00:48:37.631 --> 00:48:42.631
I started to find myself in a pitch rooms around town and uh,

805
00:48:43.151 --> 00:48:46.450
I've noticed that every time I try and talk about wanting to do something that's

806
00:48:46.451 --> 00:48:51.360
relationship based,
like this is John or blue Jay or puffy chair.
Um,

807
00:48:51.361 --> 00:48:55.390
they go,
that's awesome.
So what's your hook?
And it makes it really tough.

808
00:48:55.391 --> 00:48:58.120
I think when you sit there and you can make things up and smile,

809
00:48:58.121 --> 00:48:59.230
but when you leave,

810
00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:03.100
you end up in a place where it's like just how do you make something like that?

811
00:49:03.101 --> 00:49:06.490
How do you get these people to be,
and I guess the answer might be you don't,

812
00:49:06.491 --> 00:49:08.310
but how do you kind of get these people to hear that?

813
00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.410
<v 0>Yeah,
the the the,
the tough answer is you don't,</v>

814
00:49:11.411 --> 00:49:16.411
but the hopeful answer is the more successful and the more stuff you have made,

815
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:19.960
the less you need a hook.
So basically at this point,

816
00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.430
Paul Thomas Anderson can walk into a room and be like,
the movie's called spoon.

817
00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:27.760
And they say,
what's it about?
And he says,
don't worry about it.
And they say,
okay,

818
00:49:27.761 --> 00:49:32.170
here's your money.
I'm not there.
But I can walk in and say,

819
00:49:32.171 --> 00:49:35.130
I'm going to make a movie called spoon.
It's about me and Sarah Paulson.

820
00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.480
It's black and white and it's relationship oriented.
I don't know.

821
00:49:37.481 --> 00:49:41.170
It's not going to smash,
but you're going to get my brand to collaborate with.

822
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:44.100
You're going to get a really well reviewed movie to make you look cool.

823
00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:48.010
Next to your Adam Sandler movie that makes you kind of not look that cool.
Um,

824
00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.230
and so like overpaying me a little bit for this,

825
00:49:50.231 --> 00:49:52.810
I'll make sure it's good and you don't have to bother with me and I get to do

826
00:49:52.811 --> 00:49:53.440
that there.

827
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.380
Unfortunately you're stuck here right now where they're asking you for your
hook.

828
00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:00.100
So what you need to do is make the hook list thing that you want to make on your

829
00:50:00.101 --> 00:50:04.060
own a couple of times so that it's film festival.

830
00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:07.510
Now it's a a Sundance film festival and now you've sold one,

831
00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.410
sold it whenever you gave it to a company who distributed for free on Itunes,

832
00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:15.400
but you got it out there and then you have that sample and then you have that

833
00:50:15.401 --> 00:50:18.740
thing that says,
well,
so what?
What's your hook?
And you say,
no,
no,
no.

834
00:50:18.741 --> 00:50:21.430
It specifically,
it's actually not about a hook.

835
00:50:21.431 --> 00:50:24.770
The Hook would distract from just like the actual meat of the hamburger.

836
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:27.040
What I'm trying to do here,
we don't want to put all this lettuce over it,

837
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.920
watch this,
and I'll show you how it works.
And then you got a little more power.

838
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:32.383
Awesome.
Thank you.

839
00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:37.480
<v 7>Hello.
I'm a really big fan of your work and how it balances the,</v>

840
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:42.200
the drama aspects with,
uh,
you know,
uh,
sort of a lighthearted tone.
Thank you.

841
00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:47.000
Um,
but I was wondering,
uh,
you talked a lot about anxiety and depression.

842
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.960
Um,

843
00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:52.640
do you find that that actually helps inspire you when trying to create these

844
00:50:52.641 --> 00:50:53.840
dramatic situation?

845
00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:58.130
<v 0>Um,
I mean,
it's a part of me and it's been a part of me my whole life.
Um,</v>

846
00:50:58.131 --> 00:50:59.750
and I don't really make a secret out of it.

847
00:50:59.751 --> 00:51:04.751
I take medication now to help curb that so I can be a functional dad,

848
00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:09.620
husband,
head of companies,
all that stuff.
Um,

849
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:13.940
but I don't take so much so that I'm a Zombie.
So it's there and I feel it.
Um,

850
00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:19.330
and you know what I would say is what it's less about the anxiety and the

851
00:51:19.671 --> 00:51:23.120
depression itself that has helped me to get there.

852
00:51:23.121 --> 00:51:27.350
In terms of that old argument of,
do you need to be sad to make,
uh,
a great stuff?

853
00:51:27.351 --> 00:51:30.830
I don't believe that.
Um,
do you need to be in pain to make great stuff?

854
00:51:30.831 --> 00:51:31.664
I don't believe that.

855
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:36.170
But what has come out of that is my ability to accept it within myself,

856
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:39.290
go to therapy,
figure it out,
get a handle on it,

857
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.980
and then be able to laugh at the sides of it that are kind of funny and

858
00:51:42.981 --> 00:51:47.690
interesting that has what's been made for me,
at least my art unique.
You know,

859
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:52.190
like some people are able to make great art out of other things that's just like

860
00:51:52.191 --> 00:51:56.840
unilaterally serious or unilaterally hilarious.
My particular brand is that.

861
00:51:56.841 --> 00:52:00.890
And so,
you know,
I can't speak to exactly what's going on with you,

862
00:52:00.891 --> 00:52:04.110
but what I'm hearing from you is like,
um,

863
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.850
how is that going to be either a hindrance or a help to the kind of stuff I want

864
00:52:07.851 --> 00:52:08.151
to be.

865
00:52:08.151 --> 00:52:12.740
And what I always say to that is the last conversation you had with someone you

866
00:52:12.741 --> 00:52:13.700
are close with,

867
00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:19.300
whether it was a loved one or a sibling or a friend or one of your parents and

868
00:52:20.091 --> 00:52:24.440
you were one of you is either crying and admitting something or giggling

869
00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:26.330
uncontrollably about something.
That was,

870
00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:30.620
it felt extremely personal and specific and that only the two of you can

871
00:52:30.621 --> 00:52:35.360
understand it and that felt kind of insider [inaudible] that's the stuff that

872
00:52:35.361 --> 00:52:36.740
you uniquely have to offer.

873
00:52:36.741 --> 00:52:40.520
And it took me a long time to figure that out cause I was just like,

874
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:44.420
well that's not film worth it cause that's just a part of my B minus boring

875
00:52:44.421 --> 00:52:49.250
middleclass life.
But if you can see the big humanity and that stuff,

876
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:52.340
you are the only person who can tell that kind of story.

877
00:52:52.341 --> 00:52:57.320
So I kind of direct people to look towards that little space.
Oh thank you.
Yeah.

878
00:52:58.760 --> 00:52:59.470
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

879
00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:02.830
<v 0>Hi.
Um,
what's the book you're reading now and what's your favorite book?</v>

880
00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:04.613
<v 6>Ooh,</v>

881
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:09.180
<v 0>that's really tough.
Okay.
The book,
uh,
I'm reading now is Neil Gaiman's,</v>

882
00:53:09.181 --> 00:53:10.260
American gods.

883
00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:14.700
I have for the first time kind of really dug into,

884
00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:16.920
I guess speculative fiction and science fiction.

885
00:53:16.921 --> 00:53:18.200
I've always been like a relationship,

886
00:53:18.201 --> 00:53:22.440
you person and I kind of burned through a lot of those books and now I'm like,

887
00:53:22.441 --> 00:53:27.441
there's this whole world that I explore that you know of,

888
00:53:28.051 --> 00:53:29.370
of the science fiction world.

889
00:53:29.371 --> 00:53:32.670
I haven't even seen like the godfather of science fiction yet,
you know,

890
00:53:32.671 --> 00:53:37.470
so I'm just getting into it and being brought into it by people who are sending

891
00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:41.250
me read lefthanded darkness.
He read,
you know,
and I'm like,
it's so exciting.

892
00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:45.660
So that's cool for me.
And I'm really interested in telling stories that,
um,

893
00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:49.950
you know,
can do ideally the very personal,

894
00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:51.510
uh,

895
00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:55.650
emotional relationship thing that I do and then maybe bring that into the sort

896
00:53:55.651 --> 00:53:59.190
of speculative and Saifai world.
This would be cool.
Um,

897
00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:03.810
I have two favorite books I have to differentiate them.
One is,

898
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:08.370
um,
favorite reading experience,
which is not my favorite book,

899
00:54:08.371 --> 00:54:10.530
but the most a book has ever affected me.

900
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:15.360
And it was when I was 18 and I read a prayer for Owen meany by John Irving.
And,

901
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:18.990
and I think I read that book now and I'd probably like see the machinations,

902
00:54:18.991 --> 00:54:20.070
and it might be a little cheesy,

903
00:54:20.071 --> 00:54:24.330
but like when you're 18 and about to face the world and the way that that felt

904
00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:28.500
similarly as super embarrassing,
but the grow,

905
00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:32.070
the ultimate movie experience I've ever had is when I was 19.

906
00:54:32.071 --> 00:54:36.120
And watch titanic for the same reason.
And I don't love the movie now,

907
00:54:36.121 --> 00:54:40.050
but I just had an experience.
And then I guess,
you know,
I took me,

908
00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.030
took me four tries to do it,

909
00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.000
but I got through infinite jest last year and that has just,

910
00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:49.080
that just really knocked me out.
And that for those who have read it or not,

911
00:54:49.081 --> 00:54:53.850
there's a character in there named Don Gately and how he has presented and the

912
00:54:53.851 --> 00:54:58.800
level of empathy and love and specialists in him.
It was just like beyond for me.

913
00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:00.790
Thanks.
Yeah.

914
00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:09.190
<v 8>Hi.
Um,
I,
I was thinking about what you were saying earlier,</v>

915
00:55:09.191 --> 00:55:12.490
how,
you know,
initially you,
you work with your brother,
right?

916
00:55:12.491 --> 00:55:16.480
You had a builtin team to start with and now you're at the point where you can

917
00:55:16.481 --> 00:55:20.440
select for people you work with based on personality and based on,
you know,

918
00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:23.470
who you're comfortable delegating things too.
And I'm curious,

919
00:55:23.471 --> 00:55:25.690
when you were just starting out,
um,

920
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:30.990
how did you end up falling in or choosing the people you worked with and what

921
00:55:31.181 --> 00:55:34.610
might you have done differently when you're starting to pick people to either

922
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:35.950
work with or give you feedback?

923
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.900
<v 0>That's a really great question.
Um,
and,
uh,
when I was first starting out,</v>

924
00:55:39.901 --> 00:55:43.130
I was under the impression that I needed to grab people with the biggest credits

925
00:55:43.131 --> 00:55:47.340
and the most experience possible cause I was clamoring for a mentor and someone

926
00:55:47.341 --> 00:55:49.260
to lift me up,

927
00:55:49.261 --> 00:55:52.500
which is I think what I get a lot of when people email me and I meet them at a

928
00:55:52.501 --> 00:55:53.880
festival and they say,
Oh my God,
you know,

929
00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:56.790
will you read my script and will you produce for me?
You know,

930
00:55:56.791 --> 00:56:01.190
and I really wanted that person to come help and save me.
And,

931
00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:06.360
and what I didn't get for a long time is that that's not their job.

932
00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:11.280
Um,
I needed to figure out who I was,
um,
and make my own way.
Um,

933
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:14.940
and I ended up doing that just because I was forced to hundred and having the

934
00:56:14.941 --> 00:56:19.690
other options.
But if I could go back to myself now,
I would say really embraces,

935
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:23.500
don't see this as a,
um,
well this is your only option.
So just do it.

936
00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:28.090
And don't try to get your script to Richard Linklater who doesn't give a shit

937
00:56:28.091 --> 00:56:30.880
about what you have to say right now cause he's busy with his own stuff.

938
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:36.180
Find the people at your level who would be honored and excited to be with you.

939
00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:40.450
Um,
and who you click with.
Again,
from a personality standpoint,

940
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:45.130
from a smarts level,
from an emotional standpoint,
um,
and look,

941
00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:49.330
look on the ground near you.
Um,
or even,
you know,

942
00:56:49.331 --> 00:56:52.660
someone who doesn't even have as much experience as you and,

943
00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:57.010
and reach below and,
and,
and bring them with you.
Um,

944
00:56:57.070 --> 00:57:01.180
and I want,
I kind of figured that out once we started working with,

945
00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:05.890
I would say,
who is our main third collaborator?
J Doobie.
Just weird.

946
00:57:05.891 --> 00:57:09.550
Everybody thinks it's a fake name we've made up cause it sounds like Jay's name.

947
00:57:09.551 --> 00:57:14.440
And also both of his names stand for marijuana.
Um,
and I'm just like,

948
00:57:14.441 --> 00:57:16.530
we wouldn't make up a fake name called Jay Doobie.

949
00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:18.160
That's like a high school thing.
Um,

950
00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:23.350
but he's our editor and he produces with us and um,
you know,

951
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:24.550
he was,

952
00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:28.660
he's a couple years older than us and he was like a business student who didn't

953
00:57:28.661 --> 00:57:30.880
know anything about movies and wanting to get into film.
And,

954
00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:34.600
and when he first was around us and like interning around us,
I was like,

955
00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:38.740
honestly,
like,
how's this guy going to help me?
You know?
And it was just wrong.

956
00:57:38.741 --> 00:57:41.890
Like he was just brilliant,
sensitive,
smart and amazing.

957
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:44.410
And if I could go back,
I'd be like,

958
00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:49.150
stop stalking Richard Linklater.
J Doobie is right there.
He,

959
00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:53.080
he wants to be with you guys.
He's brilliant.
He loves you.
He's,
you know,

960
00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:55.960
he's ready to give you everything.
So just dive into that

961
00:57:56.490 --> 00:58:00.410
<v 8>new experience when,
when you mentioned this click,
right?
Yeah.
Um,</v>

962
00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:02.160
does a social click or you know,

963
00:58:02.161 --> 00:58:06.000
a casual acquaintance translate into a professional click or do you need to work

964
00:58:06.001 --> 00:58:08.340
with them?
Professional setting to see if that's something that will work?

965
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:09.570
<v 0>Um,
I have,</v>

966
00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:13.170
I have taken some gambles and I have lost on some of those to be honest with
you.

967
00:58:13.171 --> 00:58:15.240
With some of my collaborators,
like,
Oh man,

968
00:58:15.241 --> 00:58:17.790
we like hang out with we're friends and it's so good and it's working.

969
00:58:17.791 --> 00:58:21.270
And then we get into a work setting and I'm like,
this isn't quite worked out.

970
00:58:21.271 --> 00:58:23.220
Like I thought it would,
you know.
Um,

971
00:58:23.221 --> 00:58:27.020
so I honestly haven't thought as deep about it as,
as you have,
you know,
um,

972
00:58:27.021 --> 00:58:29.370
I don't really know where you're at in your career,

973
00:58:29.371 --> 00:58:32.340
but when I was first starting out,
I almost had,

974
00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:36.450
didn't have as much of that element to be that choosy really.
It was just like,

975
00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:40.350
who's dedicated to me and loves me and on the ninth hour is really going to

976
00:58:40.351 --> 00:58:41.970
stick with me and you know,

977
00:58:41.971 --> 00:58:44.360
who's smart and someone who wants to grow in this field with me.

978
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:48.990
And that was enough.
Um,
but more often than not,

979
00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:52.650
when I have a good feeling about someone,
you know,
and I meet them,

980
00:58:52.651 --> 00:58:55.380
whether it's just socially and I think we could work together and make good

981
00:58:55.381 --> 00:59:00.090
stuff together,
I'd say nine times out of 10 I'm right about it.
Okay.
Thanks.
Yeah.

982
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:04.890
If that helps.
Cool.
Thank you so much.
Thank you guys for coming.

983
00:59:04.891 --> 00:59:05.460
Appreciate it.
