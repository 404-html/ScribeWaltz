00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.270
Countdowns,
intimidated.
Welcome.

2
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.640
Please join me in welcoming our panelists today.
Um,

3
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.230
first right here to my right,
we have meaning leader.
She's the director,

4
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.330
has had a long successful directorial career spanning decades with numerous TV

5
00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:27.470
shows,
which I think you've heard of.
The leftovers vanish.
John Doe,

6
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.590
he are among them in several film credits,
um,

7
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.270
including the peacemaker and one of my personal favorites,
deep impact.
Um,

8
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.920
then we have Justin throw,
um,

9
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.140
he plays Mel Wulf who was then the head of the ACL.
Ooh.
Um,

10
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.220
Justin's known for his work with David Lynch on Mulholland drive and in inland

11
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:50.210
empire and most recently seen as Kevin Garvey [inaudible] Garvey,
excuse me,

12
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.620
in Hbo is the leftovers.

13
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.950
Tom and the girl on the train and Dr. James Monterrey on Netflix is the maniac.

14
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.830
Um,
and then,
um,
we have Daniel woman,

15
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.730
he is the film screenwriter and the real life nephew to justice Ginsburg.

16
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.630
What a happy accident of birth.
Um,
so I think,
uh,

17
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.630
to start off with,
I love to ask you me,

18
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.740
how did you get involved with this project?

19
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.780
<v 2>Well,
um,
I was given the script.
Finally,
manager,
my agent,</v>

20
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.650
John 11,
Robert Court and,
uh,

21
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.330
our producer and Johnathan king,
also our producer,
president,

22
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.370
participant sent me the script and I immediately read it and felt that I had to

23
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:42.660
do it.
Yeah.
I just felt like I really understood her having,

24
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.580
uh,
you know,
lived through a very,
in a very deep,

25
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.100
in a different generation and a different industry,
you know,

26
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:55.080
live through a lot of discrimination and inequality and,

27
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.610
you know,
just had to fight the fight in,
in my,

28
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.890
in my profession,
in my world.

29
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.510
And I felt a commonality with Ruth being,
um,

30
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.480
a woman who is a mother,
is Jewish,

31
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.740
who's been in a long standing marriage and know what that takes.

32
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:18.390
And I,
you know,
breaking the glass ceilings in our,
in our own ways,

33
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.760
uh,
for generations to come.

34
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.880
And I just felt this is a story about a living icon,

35
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:30.200
someone who I have,
who did so much for,

36
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.420
for our country and changed the world as well for all of us.

37
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.960
And I just felt very lucky to have been able to direct this film.

38
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.970
Wonderful.

39
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.700
<v 0>Well,
we,
I,
I got to see it earlier this weekend.
Um,</v>

40
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.430
I think we got lucky to get to watch it and it was,
it's fantastic.

41
00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:53.030
So you should all definitely check it out.
Um,
it'll be in theaters and Christmas.

42
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.060
Um,
so,
uh,
for Daniel,

43
00:02:56.061 --> 00:03:00.580
how did the first nephew to justice Ginsburg,
um,

44
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.230
pretty exciting.
What were those first?
That's a first.
Um,

45
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.290
and uh,
you know,
I think growing up,
did you realize the impact that,
um,

46
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.440
justice Ginsburg was having sort of in,
in the world and our country's laws,
um,

47
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.600
both as an attorney miss from court justice?

48
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:18.940
Was that part of sort of the dialog in your home or?

49
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.940
<v 3>Well,
mostly I just found it confusing,
um,
because I,</v>

50
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.790
I was born after all the events of this film and so people would say,
oh,

51
00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:28.550
that's your aunt.
She changed the world.

52
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.170
I'm looking at cross like the Thanksgiving table,
and she's just very quietly,

53
00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:34.950
very slowly eating her Turkey dinner.

54
00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:39.690
And I'm going her really,
because I had,
you know,
I had a vision in my head.

55
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.840
I think I got us of what a feminist from the 70s was,

56
00:03:42.841 --> 00:03:44.910
right as Gloria Steinem standing in front of a crowd,

57
00:03:44.911 --> 00:03:49.410
bringing everyone to their feet.
And here's my quiet and um,
you know,

58
00:03:49.411 --> 00:03:52.590
who changed the world.
And part of what I came to appreciate,

59
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:57.360
understand from running the movie is that my voice is very loud.
Um,
is that,
uh,

60
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.660
is that,
you know,
sustainable change takes a Gloria Steinem to,
to,

61
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.250
to shift the culture and it takes a Ruth Bader Ginsburg to change the laws and

62
00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:06.084
the institutions.

63
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.740
<v 0>Um,
you were,
you were quoted saying,
I'm,</v>

64
00:04:09.741 --> 00:04:12.560
one of the great joys of writing the movie was that it felt like I got to really

65
00:04:12.561 --> 00:04:14.000
know where for the first time.

66
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.970
So what were some of the surprising things you discovered as you,

67
00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:19.720
as you wrote the screenplay or as you sort of dug in and,
and,

68
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:20.870
and put this together?

69
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.380
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean,
she's my amperage.
He's 50 years older than I am right now.</v>

70
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.230
There's that,
Marty was 13 years older than my mom.

71
00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:26.940
My older brother is 10 years older than I am.
So I like,

72
00:04:26.941 --> 00:04:31.860
I grew up with her grandkids.
Um,
and so,
you know,
for me,
like I said,

73
00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:35.010
she's,
she's,
she's a very private person.
And so to get that to,

74
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.700
it's not that there was like,
oh,
what this one thing that was so surprising,

75
00:04:38.701 --> 00:04:39.780
it's just,
I mean,
if you think about your,

76
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.700
I assume everyone's relationship with your aunt and uncle,

77
00:04:41.701 --> 00:04:44.490
it's like you don't really sit for hours and talk about like,

78
00:04:44.491 --> 00:04:48.600
what did you and your husband fight about and how did you make up and what did

79
00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:50.070
you,
you know,
and,
and,

80
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.120
and you certainly probably never had to write a sex scene between them.
Um,

81
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.660
uh,
I,
you know,
so and so.

82
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.843
Oh yeah,
guys,

83
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.940
we had a screening the other night in DC and the moderator asked Ruth,
uh,

84
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.150
how she felt about the sex scene.
And she goes,
Marty would have loved it.

85
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.970
I just,
nothing to do with the guy answered your question.
But the really funny,

86
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.720
um,
that is the,
um,
you know,

87
00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:22.980
so it was just a matter of asking the hard questions,
you know,
for my wife and I,

88
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.550
you know,
when we got married,
we very consciously said to each other,

89
00:05:26.551 --> 00:05:29.370
what's been like them?
Let's be Ruth and Marty.
Um,

90
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:32.370
so I was like on this stealth mission to figure out how did they build this

91
00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:35.750
marriage where they were,
not only did they both have incredible careers,
um,

92
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.660
which I think is something we're getting better at these days.
Um,

93
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.490
but they were also equal partners at home or they,
they,
you know,

94
00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:45.870
Marty did all the cooking because Ruth was a god awful cook.
Um,
and,
uh,

95
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.780
but they shared the load of like getting food on the table and taking care of

96
00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:51.490
the kids and getting the kids to school every day and all that.
Um,

97
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.830
and statistically we still suck at that.
Um,
and so understanding how they,

98
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.190
how they pulled that off as such,
such confidence

99
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.660
<v 2>and love and mutual support was,
uh,
was,
was the goal of writing the movie.
Yeah.</v>

100
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.990
Speaking of that scene in the bedroom scene,
why,

101
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.050
why was it important to include that in the movie and why portray this aspect of

102
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:10.500
her life specifically?
Well,

103
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.520
because everybody has made love since the beginning of time and everyone's human

104
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.330
and everyone makes love.

105
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:24.830
And it was really important to show her as a real authentic woman.

106
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.290
And it was really interesting though,

107
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.620
not shooting the scene with army and Felicity,

108
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.070
it was cutting the scene that was,
you know,

109
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.500
made me have to think,
cause not,
you know,
I had,
you guys haven't seen the film,

110
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:44.380
but it's very tame.
It's not even really a love scene.
It's,
I mean it's,
it's,

111
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.710
it's very tame.
And I had it far more risky.
Kay.
You know,

112
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:52.350
I had her sitting on him and I mean it was,
it was it,

113
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.760
they got into it a little and then I was in the end of the room going,
oh no,

114
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.630
I dunno.
I Dunno if RBG well like this

115
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.800
and you do,
her nephew wouldn't have,
he was like,

116
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.310
and it was really interesting.

117
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.820
So it was deeper and more contemporary than it is in the film.

118
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.930
And then I just said,
no,
let's make this really simple and,

119
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.100
and put the point of the story is,
I'm at,

120
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.160
we're at dinner after we showed it to her with this team version and her

121
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:30.500
biographer,
her official biographer,
what?
Oh my God,

122
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.580
the sex scene was like,
and she goes,
oh,

123
00:07:34.581 --> 00:07:39.500
it's just so much.
And I said,
well,
I was like,
I said,
really?

124
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:43.850
I said,
you should have seen it before.
And then she said to her,
well,

125
00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:44.930
what do you think Ruth?

126
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.700
And every all eyes go to RBG and she goes,

127
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.320
I'm fine with it.
It was really funny.
Anyway,

128
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.180
um,
for,
for Justin,

129
00:07:56.181 --> 00:07:59.270
so I know you and Mimi have worked together before on the leftovers,

130
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.800
but how did you get involved with this project?

131
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:03.090
Does it through your relation with Mimi or through,
um,

132
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.100
a different sort of avenue in it?
Wa

133
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.050
<v 4>Yeah,
I mean,
yes,
maybe you sent me the script and said,
you know,</v>

134
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.270
there's this part that I'd love for you to play and Blah,
blah.
So I said,

135
00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:11.740
of course.
I mean,
I read it and then

136
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:18.150
<v 2>eventually,
yeah,
he didn't really,
he just read my parts
eventually.</v>

137
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.130
And it sounded cool.
You write in your person on your right.
Um,
and uh,
you know,

138
00:08:23.131 --> 00:08:24.750
a lot of the characters that you've,

139
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.690
you've taken on have been sort of eccentric characters in different ways,

140
00:08:27.691 --> 00:08:31.760
but fictional characters.
What was it like playing someone who,
um,

141
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.650
obviously is a real life person?
Um,
and um,

142
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:39.360
how did you sort of prepare for the role and,
and um,
get to know Mel as a,

143
00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:40.194
as a person?

144
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.640
<v 4>Give him is an eccentric character.
I mean,
he was at an odd,
I mean duck kind of,</v>

145
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.310
we didn't have any source material on him really.

146
00:08:47.311 --> 00:08:51.300
There was no publicity and army.
We're able to look at photos and videos and,

147
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.670
you know,
hear audio recordings.
We didn't have any of that.

148
00:08:53.671 --> 00:08:58.530
We sort of knew what his trajectory was in his career.
Just,
you know,

149
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.200
there was some newspaper clippings of newspaper clippings.

150
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.610
There was the internet about him.

151
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.123
<v 2>MMM.</v>

152
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.270
<v 4>Um,
uh,
so we,
I had got to play around a little bit more,</v>

153
00:09:08.271 --> 00:09:11.590
but he was kind of a controversial figure at the ACLU.
Uh,
and I,

154
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.381
you haven't seen the film,

155
00:09:12.381 --> 00:09:17.120
but he was bit of a misogynist even though he was very progressive and forward

156
00:09:17.121 --> 00:09:18.470
leaning and,
and um,

157
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.010
taking on a lot of very important issues as it relates to sort of constitutional

158
00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:24.770
stuff,
the first amendment and some civil rights issues.

159
00:09:24.771 --> 00:09:27.140
But feminism wasn't really on his radar,

160
00:09:27.141 --> 00:09:29.900
at least advancing it through the ACLU and also didn't have,

161
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.550
I didn't have to do any sort of mimicry,
you know,

162
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.410
to cause we couldn't find the guy frankly.

163
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.670
<v 2>Right.
Um,
Dustin steals every scene in the movie,</v>

164
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.760
the ones he's in
almost not showing up,

165
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.790
I guess for,
for,
um,
uh,
Daniel.
Mimi,
how,

166
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.830
how true to life was the relationship that you portrayed between Ruth and Marty

167
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.160
and there's so much of it that are these sort of quiet moments of,

168
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.570
of their domestic life,

169
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:01.680
but then also them sort of pioneering together within the legal profession.

170
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:06.150
And how much of that was really true exactly to it.
It's based on a true story,

171
00:10:06.151 --> 00:10:09.510
but,
um,
well I would say that,
you know,
um,

172
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.160
the justice was very,

173
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.010
he worked very closely with Daniel and he can speak to that,

174
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.930
that everything she was a stickler on the law and it was,

175
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:21.120
you know,
not being a family member,

176
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.200
but just being a director in wanting to portray a,
uh,

177
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:30.380
a marriage that is longstanding and,

178
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.400
and a real equal partner ship.
I really understood that.
And I really,
you know,

179
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:40.020
when you hire incredible actors,
no matter how incredible you are,

180
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.170
they are,
you never know if it's really going to work.

181
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.560
You never know if the chemistry is going to really hit.
And it did.

182
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.730
And a lot of the relationship is I believe,

183
00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:52.880
really truly authentic in,

184
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.920
in the feelings of love and equal partnership.

185
00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.900
And it was important to get the stuff in between the lines,
the looks,

186
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:05.550
the fields.
Um,
but the lines are pretty good too,
right?
Yeah,
they're okay.

187
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.750
A lot of polishing.
Yeah.

188
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.960
And Martin did bring her the case and it was really important to all of us and

189
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:20.400
especially RBG to,
to tell the story the way it happened.

190
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:26.720
And,
and why,
why did you specifically choose this period of her life?
Um,

191
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.740
to focus on and for the film for the screenplay,
um,

192
00:11:29.741 --> 00:11:33.960
because she's obviously had an enormous impactful career across decades,

193
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.740
which was the point she made when I raised it with her.
Actually,
no,
I,
I know,

194
00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:41.970
I heard the story of this case the first time.
Uh,
it was at my uncle's funeral.

195
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.940
A friend of his got up and gave you a g didn't just 2010.

196
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.470
And he mentioned the only case that Ruth and Marty ever argued together and it

197
00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:49.951
was like,
wow,

198
00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:53.920
it's the two of them fighting in court for exactly what figured out how to live

199
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:54.010
at

200
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.320
<v 3>home,
real equality.
Um,</v>

201
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.220
and it was the first case she ever argued and it was the first case to convince

202
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:03.820
the federal court that women should be considered people under the US

203
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.000
Constitution despite the fact that they argued it by representing a man.
Um,

204
00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:09.310
so there was so much about the story that I just thought was fascinating.

205
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:12.370
I thought this would make a great movie.
And then I thought,

206
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.280
what kind of Asshole am I?
Am sitting here at my uncle's funeral,

207
00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:19.150
mining his life for material that's not like a thing you can do.
Um,

208
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.160
and so I was like,
okay,
clearly I can't write this.

209
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:24.130
And I sat on it for over a year.
Um,

210
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.740
but then finally I just couldn't stop thinking about it.

211
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.910
And so I called Ruth and I said,
I'd like your permission,
I'd love your help.

212
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.640
And she raised the exact same point.
Did I argued other cases?
I agree.

213
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.170
Bigger cases in cases in front of the Supreme Court.
But once I said,
yeah,

214
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:41.020
but this is the one that's about you and Marty,
this is a movie about a marriage,

215
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.260
then she,
well,
I was gonna say she got excited about what she actually said was,

216
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.050
well,
if that's how you want to spend your time.

217
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.310
<v 0>So
fair enough.</v>

218
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.200
<v 3>That's what they're again for,
for great enthusiasm.</v>

219
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.060
<v 0>Um,</v>

220
00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:00.530
one of my favorite scenes in the movie was the moot court scene in the home

221
00:13:00.531 --> 00:13:01.820
beforehand.
Um,

222
00:13:01.821 --> 00:13:05.180
I thought it was a really great way to incorporate Murray n to the film as well.

223
00:13:05.181 --> 00:13:07.040
And um,
uh,
and you know,

224
00:13:07.041 --> 00:13:10.520
it hurt her sort of impact as a pioneer in this space is I'm too,

225
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.830
was this something that really happened?
The moot court seemed,

226
00:13:12.831 --> 00:13:16.520
was this space anything or is this completely brought in to sort of show the

227
00:13:16.521 --> 00:13:17.354
dynamic in the

228
00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.950
<v 3>no,
at first I actually,
it was a w I agree.
It's my favorite.</v>

229
00:13:21.951 --> 00:13:24.130
It's my favorite scene in the movie.
Um,
but it,

230
00:13:24.131 --> 00:13:27.770
it came initially just out of like need as a writer because what was happening

231
00:13:27.771 --> 00:13:29.210
in the first draft was,
you know,

232
00:13:29.211 --> 00:13:31.980
like you know that you're getting up to the end towards the third act,

233
00:13:31.981 --> 00:13:33.680
the end of the movie,
you're building it for the climax in court.

234
00:13:33.681 --> 00:13:34.730
We'll see you in court.

235
00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:37.040
And then she goes marching into core and then the whole movie has to stop to

236
00:13:37.041 --> 00:13:40.280
explain how federal court works.
And it was just killing me on the page.

237
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.500
I was like,
yeah,
exactly.

238
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.830
And so what I finally figured out was,
oh,

239
00:13:45.831 --> 00:13:48.560
if I could put in a moot court 20 minutes earlier,

240
00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:52.940
I can teach the audience how this is all going to work so that by the time we

241
00:13:52.941 --> 00:13:56.720
get to the end,
I don't have to stop to explain it all.
Um,

242
00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.050
and so it's like w initially it was just like a structural thing to teach the

243
00:14:00.051 --> 00:14:03.800
audience how to keep score during the final scene.
And it's like,
and like,

244
00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:04.551
it's like an Invictus,

245
00:14:04.551 --> 00:14:07.610
that movie about rugby where like they have to stop and explain how rugby works

246
00:14:07.611 --> 00:14:10.010
to the American audience before they,
um,
yeah.

247
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.860
And so that's where it originally came from.
And then out of that,

248
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.650
it just kept all of these more because there's so many characters there,

249
00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:19.510
a male wolf's there,
you know,
being,
being a jerk,
um,

250
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.340
in the most charming way possible.
Um,
you know,
and,

251
00:14:22.341 --> 00:14:24.480
and Ruth and Marty are there and there's,
it's a,
it's a,

252
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.360
I don't want to spoil the movie,
but it's a huge turning point in the,
in the,

253
00:14:27.361 --> 00:14:30.110
in the film for the older,
she gets on the Supreme Court.

254
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:36.830
And so it's,
uh,
it's,
it becomes this,
this,

255
00:14:36.831 --> 00:14:38.660
this sort of crucial moment because all of the May,

256
00:14:38.661 --> 00:14:42.950
all the main characters sort of reach a big turning point in their relationships

257
00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.610
moving forward into,
in the film.
But it was made up.
Yeah.

258
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:51.280
But it was really important to the justice to,
um,

259
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.280
have Pauli Murray

260
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.030
<v 2>in the film and Gerald Gunther,
her teacher,
and Pauli Murray,</v>

261
00:14:56.031 --> 00:15:00.410
you could do a movie just on her alone.
And,
um,

262
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:05.860
so in that way it was paying tribute and honor to what they had achieved and

263
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.490
done in the civil rights movement.

264
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.840
<v 3>I think there's something to Bruce credit that you shouldn't give me very many</v>

265
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:13.850
like big notes about how she wanted the movie to work.

266
00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:16.910
But the one that she gave me was,
well,
the two that you gave me a word,

267
00:15:16.911 --> 00:15:19.910
Marty get Marty.
Right.
And,
um,
and she said,

268
00:15:19.911 --> 00:15:24.050
I just don't want people to think that I invented this area of the law as if it

269
00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:26.000
never occurred to anyone before me,

270
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.280
that women should be considered people under the 14th amendment.
Um,
and,

271
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.900
and she said,
I built my career on the shoulders of women who came before me,

272
00:15:32.901 --> 00:15:35.990
like Dorothy Kenyon and like Pauli Murray and people should know that.

273
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.520
And I'm like,
what am I supposed to do with that note?

274
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.620
And so as you see in the film,

275
00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:43.970
Paulie Paulie's in that scene in Dorothy Kenyon plays a big role played by Kathy

276
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:44.803
Bates is incredible.

277
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.280
<v 2>Okay.</v>

278
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.090
<v 0>So I,
one of the things I noticed a lot was the film portrays,
um,</v>

279
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.510
this really special relationship between mothers and daughters.
Um,

280
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.560
so there's a lot of of Ruth with her daughter,
um,
with,
with Jane and,

281
00:15:56.561 --> 00:16:00.490
but then there's also glances of Ruth at her though her mother's picture and

282
00:16:00.491 --> 00:16:03.220
sort of the thought,
the,
the sentiments from other had shared with her.

283
00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:07.000
And as you were developing some of the dialogs that go on between Jan and Ruth

284
00:16:07.001 --> 00:16:09.790
in the film or though some insights that,
um,

285
00:16:09.791 --> 00:16:11.800
justice Ginsburg had had shared with you or,

286
00:16:11.801 --> 00:16:14.230
or that potentially Jane had as you thought about them?

287
00:16:14.231 --> 00:16:17.590
Or are they sort of just crafted from sort of a lot of them?

288
00:16:17.591 --> 00:16:18.700
I could actually imagine myself,

289
00:16:18.701 --> 00:16:21.820
my myself and my mother sort of having some of those conversations at home.

290
00:16:21.821 --> 00:16:24.110
But um,
for the development side of it,

291
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:28.570
<v 3>uh,
no,
I mean the start of the dialogue was,
was real dialogue.
Um,
you know,</v>

292
00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:32.060
it was taken based on research.
I remember at one point I said to my mom,

293
00:16:32.061 --> 00:16:34.310
I was like,
oh,
hey,
I'm having trouble figuring out how to write Jane.
She goes,
oh,

294
00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:36.890
that's easy,
just right Clara,
who's Jane's daughter?
And I was like,
oh,

295
00:16:36.891 --> 00:16:41.450
I know how to do that because they like a family of really strongly opinionated

296
00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:46.130
women,
uh,
who do not hold back.
Um,
uh,
which is what we love about them.

297
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.680
Uh,
most of the time.
And
I,

298
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.250
I will say that right after we saw this vehicle we had,

299
00:16:54.251 --> 00:16:57.470
and we had a screening for the family and we went out for dinner and Clara goes,

300
00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.830
mom,
is that what you were like when you were a teenager?

301
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.040
And Jane tried to hedge and she's like,
hesitated for a second route,

302
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:07.370
just button it goes,
yes.
Yeah,
I think,

303
00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:11.510
I think you know that that dynamic of,

304
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.010
of being a fighter and,
and,
and,
and how you learn it from your parents,

305
00:17:18.011 --> 00:17:18.900
but also you,
you,

306
00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.940
you can't like admit that to yourself that you got it from your parents.

307
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.810
<v 0>I can invite anyone to come up to the mix.
I'll continue to ask some questions,</v>

308
00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:28.510
but if you can make your way up there,
if you have any questions,

309
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.440
<v 2>how is justice Ginsburg doing these days with her ribs?
She's fantastic.</v>

310
00:17:33.441 --> 00:17:34.520
She has other ribs.

311
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.710
<v 3>She's already back at work and back in the gym,
so.</v>

312
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.400
<v 2>Great,
great.
Good to hear.
Uh,
and second,</v>

313
00:17:41.401 --> 00:17:45.180
with this nature of Hollywood coming out with sequels is her life,
I mean,

314
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.830
so grand and so epic,
are we going to see a sequel on the of sex too?

315
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.020
Well,
I'm not writing it.
That's very interesting.
I mean,

316
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.490
I think the other film would be her relationship with,
uh,

317
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.140
Justice Scalia and I think that would be,

318
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.070
that'd be the one that Med [inaudible] story to tell.
Yes.

319
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:09.210
I got to go right there.
Thank you.
Thank you.

320
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.540
Thank you.
That was a good answer.
That's cool.
Yeah.

321
00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.490
<v 5>Hi.
Um,
I wanted to ask about just kind of the ongoing conversation socially and</v>

322
00:18:21.491 --> 00:18:23.170
politically.
Um,
and I'm sort of,

323
00:18:23.171 --> 00:18:26.800
the creative process took quite a few years and over those period of years the

324
00:18:26.801 --> 00:18:31.680
conversation has really kind of grown as far as,
um,

325
00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:34.900
the women's rights with me too and whatnot.

326
00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:39.390
How did kind of the social escalation of all of these,
uh,

327
00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:44.020
issues either inform or way on your creative process?

328
00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.710
<v 2>Is that me or you or anyone who wants to weigh in?</v>

329
00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.460
<v 4>It was interesting when we were shooting it because you know,
all the,
uh,</v>

330
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.530
you know,
Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey,

331
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.520
all those things were breaking literally around.

332
00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.830
So we were all sort of showing up on sets going like I've used red that would

333
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:00.611
this,
that you have it.

334
00:19:00.611 --> 00:19:03.210
It just felt like there was this avalanche of things happening.
It didn't really,

335
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.410
at least for me,
it didn't really affect what we were doing as far as,
um,

336
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.450
cause the,
we already had our story in place,
you know,

337
00:19:09.451 --> 00:19:13.530
we weren't really changing anything on the fly because some asshole,
you know,

338
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.850
got into trouble,
you know.
Um,
so we just sort of kept doing what we were doing.

339
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.060
I mean,
if anything,
it's sort of added to the,
uh,
you know,

340
00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:25.470
we weren't timing this movie with these movements,
you know.
Um,

341
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.330
but,
uh,
of course,
you know,

342
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.610
telling more stories about her life feels more relevant,
uh,

343
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:35.370
in this time where we feel like we're taking enormous steps backwards,
you know,

344
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.930
or at least the last couple of years

345
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.350
<v 3>I feel like it changes the experience as a viewer.</v>

346
00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:40.863
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

347
00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.390
<v 3>Because when I wrote,
when I started this movie in 2011,</v>

348
00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:45.120
I started saying to people,

349
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.540
I'm going to write a movie that Ruth Bader Ginsburg and there,
and be like,
well,

350
00:19:47.541 --> 00:19:49.760
the biggest problem is nobody knows who Ruth Bader Ginsburg is.

351
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.140
And then it's like,
now as you said that she's like this,

352
00:19:52.141 --> 00:19:54.980
she's become this pop icon.
Um,
and,

353
00:19:54.981 --> 00:19:58.100
and that all happened after the movie was written.
Um,

354
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.010
and so it's sort of my experience.
Like,
I thought I was writing to him,

355
00:20:01.011 --> 00:20:02.840
he's going to introduce the world to Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

356
00:20:02.841 --> 00:20:05.090
And then it becomes like a tea,
if you like.

357
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.550
For me now with the movie feels like it's about,
and a lot of ways is,

358
00:20:07.551 --> 00:20:10.910
is it's still about how Ruth,
um,
change the country,

359
00:20:10.911 --> 00:20:12.600
but it's about how she changed the country.

360
00:20:12.601 --> 00:20:15.620
And today we're looking at it in 2018 it becomes about how she changed the

361
00:20:15.621 --> 00:20:19.820
country by convincing people who disagreed with her to agree with her rather

362
00:20:19.821 --> 00:20:22.040
than trying to destroy the people who disagreed with her.

363
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.440
And that feels like now for me as a viewer,

364
00:20:24.441 --> 00:20:27.590
that feels like the poignant lesson of the movie is like there was a time when

365
00:20:27.591 --> 00:20:29.800
we didn't try to destroy each other.
Um,

366
00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:34.040
and maybe we can get back to that if we are willing to like learn what Ruth has

367
00:20:34.041 --> 00:20:34.874
to teach us.

368
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.340
<v 2>Um,
as you were doing some of the researcher,</v>

369
00:20:38.341 --> 00:20:41.730
as you were putting together the film,
was there anything that you learned about,

370
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.200
um,
justice Ginsberg that you,

371
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.570
during the making that you wanted to include in the film,

372
00:20:45.571 --> 00:20:49.630
but either she see it vetoed or didn't want or that you just couldn't fit in,
um,

373
00:20:49.631 --> 00:20:51.610
to the storyline?
Well,
I should say for the record,

374
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:54.760
there was never a time that she ever said,
oh,

375
00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:56.770
I don't want that in the movie there was a,
I mean,

376
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.680
the only reason she would do that as if the law is wrong or the way the law was

377
00:20:59.681 --> 00:21:03.910
practice was wrong.
Um,
but she never once gave a note based on Ego,

378
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.000
which is I think really kind of incredible because she went through,

379
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:09.580
I sent her the script the first time and she's like,
Oh,
Daniel,

380
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.830
I'm in the middle of reading the affordable care act.

381
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.080
Can you call me back in 20 minutes?
And I'm like,
okay,

382
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:22.890
20 minutes while she was in about 40 minutes that I call her back.

383
00:21:23.681 --> 00:21:25.900
And she's like,
okay,
page one.

384
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.800
And then she goes through it like a contract and she'll be like literally,

385
00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:33.310
I mean like the opening line of the scream fight is like a pair of heels amongst

386
00:21:33.311 --> 00:21:34.480
a sea of loafers.
And she's like,

387
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.450
here on page one you have me wearing a pair of heels.

388
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:41.710
But in those days I used to walk to Harvard and so I never would have worn heels

389
00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:46.390
and those and I was like,
this is how this is going to go all in.
You know,

390
00:21:46.391 --> 00:21:50.050
like we're going.
Um,
and so and then I then I have to argue it with it,
right?

391
00:21:50.051 --> 00:21:52.930
Cause that's what you want to do is get into a debate with Ruth Bader Ginsburg

392
00:21:52.931 --> 00:21:57.730
or you can win that the yields are in the mood.
I was like,
it's orientation,

393
00:21:57.731 --> 00:22:01.370
it's a special.
Um,
and so,
but uh,

394
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.610
and then we get to like scenes where she,

395
00:22:03.611 --> 00:22:06.490
where she fumbles and I'm going on and know what you're going to do.

396
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.680
This is if we have to go 10 minutes on the heels,

397
00:22:08.681 --> 00:22:10.690
what are we going to do when we get to that?
And she's like,

398
00:22:10.691 --> 00:22:13.670
and skip the next five pages.
And I'm like,
really?
And she said,
yeah.

399
00:22:13.671 --> 00:22:15.460
And I was like,
well,
because you kind of just fumble over here,

400
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.560
I don't know why I decided to negotiate against myself,

401
00:22:17.561 --> 00:22:20.260
but you're going to fall over.
And she goes and she goes,
oh yeah,

402
00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:24.910
it has to be that way.
It's more dramatic.
And you're like,
oh,
okay.
That's nice.
Um,

403
00:22:24.911 --> 00:22:26.260
so you have the heels in the beginning.

404
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.130
One of the things I thought was really poignant but also really interesting in

405
00:22:30.131 --> 00:22:34.510
watching the film is how many moments,
um,

406
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.030
and maybe it's,
maybe it's based on sort of like,
you mentioned this,

407
00:22:37.031 --> 00:22:40.330
this last year of sort of the political discourse and the conversation that's

408
00:22:40.331 --> 00:22:41.650
been heightened.
Um,

409
00:22:41.651 --> 00:22:46.120
but all of the moments where she's the only woman in either literally in the

410
00:22:46.121 --> 00:22:47.140
room or even in,

411
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:52.030
in the conversation from the opening scene to obviously that the dean's remarks

412
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.380
and Harvard,
um,
the elevator rides up to the interviews.
I mean,

413
00:22:56.381 --> 00:23:01.000
just moment after moment throughout the film.
Um,
I assume that was intentional,

414
00:23:01.001 --> 00:23:05.920
very intentional spotted.
Um,
and it works really well.
There were nine women.

415
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:11.220
I would only put maybe one or two in the same frame because in a sea of men they

416
00:23:13.181 --> 00:23:17.740
would be just little dots on a map.
Right.
Um,

417
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:22.480
the,
uh,
the dinner party that is hosted was that,

418
00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.160
um,
uh,

419
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:28.520
something pulled was the dinner party hosted by the dean of Harvard for the,

420
00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:30.190
the ladies as he called them,

421
00:23:30.191 --> 00:23:34.950
who had been accepted that year and quote taking the spots from men.
Um,

422
00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.740
was that,
is that sort of verbatim as how it went?
It is exactly.

423
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:42.160
I've been accused of being heavy handed and writing that same because you'd be

424
00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:44.050
like,
clearly that couldn't have happened.
I'm like,
no,

425
00:23:44.051 --> 00:23:45.680
that's exactly how that went down.

426
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.010
The only thing different from how it happened was we put it at a dining room

427
00:23:52.221 --> 00:23:56.090
table and from what I can gather,
what we can gather,

428
00:23:56.091 --> 00:23:59.840
it was in a room where they were so small table,

429
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.130
but it felt more,

430
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:06.760
the visual felt stronger to put it on a table because she dropped the ashtray in

431
00:24:08.811 --> 00:24:10.340
real,
in reality.

432
00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.880
And it just felt better to drop it off a dining room table where people are

433
00:24:13.881 --> 00:24:16.250
smoking while you're eating,
which

434
00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:22.640
is very 50s
please.
Oh,
thank you.

435
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:23.503
Yes,
please.

436
00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.880
I'd love to hear a bit about the casting process on finding the perfect person

437
00:24:28.881 --> 00:24:32.720
to portray phone with me against mark.
Well,

438
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:37.750
so we had a list of women who could play RBG and I kept focusing on Felicity

439
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:39.560
Jones.

440
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.560
I kept looking at the young RBG pictures and Felicity and I felt there was a

441
00:24:45.561 --> 00:24:50.561
striking resemblance and Felicity has a really deep,

442
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.830
deep in her life from what I've seen in her work.

443
00:24:54.831 --> 00:24:59.540
And I felt that she could,
it was just instinct.
You have instinct,

444
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:03.350
you have to go on your instincts when you're casting because you never really

445
00:25:03.351 --> 00:25:05.780
know.
Sometimes you like,

446
00:25:05.781 --> 00:25:10.781
I knew Justin actually could just inhabit this guy and we don't often see Justin

447
00:25:12.051 --> 00:25:15.290
be this person.
In fact,
I've never seen you be this person.

448
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:19.130
So I didn't know he could actually do it,
but I,
I knew he could,

449
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.280
if you know what I mean.
I had not seen it before,

450
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.590
but I knew he was the right guy.
And beautifully,

451
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:32.670
beautifully performed,
but you know,
finding the,
you know,

452
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.660
Felicity Jones was a,
it was a big key.

453
00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:40.900
And we sent her the script on a Thursday to in London and then she replied on

454
00:25:41.871 --> 00:25:45.620
Monday with a yes,
which is very rare in our business and you know,

455
00:25:45.621 --> 00:25:50.621
it takes months for someone to read and someone to agree to something.

456
00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.270
And she immediately agreed to it.

457
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.990
And then there was Armie hammer who I,

458
00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:00.990
I've never seen do this kind of role either,
but I had a,

459
00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:06.290
a real desire and hunch that he did that he had it in him because I always

460
00:26:06.291 --> 00:26:11.060
thought he was charming and,
and he,
he never really played a guy like this.

461
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.720
Um,
and he's the only one I wanted.

462
00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:19.100
It was like I was at the agency and they had you go through this process where

463
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:23.570
the agent show you,
that's horrible to say this in front of an actor.

464
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:26.023
I know what happened.

465
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:34.460
They give you all these pictures and resumes and you have your own list anyway,

466
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:39.320
and you go through them and,
and no,
no,
no.
Yes.

467
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.330
It's horrible too.
But I,

468
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:50.480
I just knew that army couldn't have at this character and bring his unique charm

469
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:54.540
and wit to it.
And I also love the height difference.

470
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.753
And I thought that that was,

471
00:26:56.810 --> 00:27:01.680
which isn't accurate because Marty was tall and Ruth is a little tiny,

472
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:06.860
beautiful woman and I really loved the idea of this kind of frame,

473
00:27:07.051 --> 00:27:10.110
which is really hard to do.
Um,

474
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.590
which goes to picking the format of how you shoot something.

475
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.240
So this was shot in one eight,
five and two.
Three five is a bunch of short,

476
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:24.290
shorter frame and stretched out and was such a tall person and touch a shorter

477
00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:25.764
person.

478
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.540
You want to have a ratio that's like this and also to fit the supreme court in a

479
00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:35.300
shot.
And how far to back to you put your camera to get this wide shot?
Well,

480
00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.390
in format one,
eight five you can do it.
I,
I don't know if that's interesting.

481
00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:41.750
Thank you.
Thank you.

482
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.430
<v 4>And I,
I just wanted to add,
because I've known Ruth A.</v>

483
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:45.720
Martin Ginsburg for a very long time,

484
00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:48.420
that they're portrayals of my aunt and uncle are uncanny.

485
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.770
It's really kind of freaky.

486
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:55.270
<v 0>A final question for you all.
So,
um,
the film portrays Ruth as this,
uh,
as,</v>

487
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:58.740
as herself obviously and as a working mother who can kind of do it all.

488
00:27:58.741 --> 00:28:00.360
She's top of her class at Harvard.

489
00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:04.380
She's attending her courses and her husband's courses.
Um,

490
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:08.550
she's caring for her husband during his illness.
Um,
she's raising two children.

491
00:28:08.551 --> 00:28:13.050
She's working a full time job as a professor and in her spare time she sets in

492
00:28:13.051 --> 00:28:15.870
motion to changes that are really reshaping,
you know,

493
00:28:15.871 --> 00:28:18.160
women's rights and human rights.
Um,

494
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.450
what is the message that you're hoping that particularly any viewers,

495
00:28:21.451 --> 00:28:24.960
but particularly women and girls are taking away from this film?
Um,

496
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:25.853
after they watch it?

497
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:27.420
<v 2>Well,</v>

498
00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:32.420
I hope that women and particularly young women take away that they can do

499
00:28:33.991 --> 00:28:37.020
anything.
Women can do anything and um,

500
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:40.500
that you use your voice to,

501
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.110
to make this world a better place.

502
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.090
<v 4>I was going to say,
one of the things that I liked so much about,</v>

503
00:28:47.091 --> 00:28:48.040
I don't know what,
you know,

504
00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:53.050
I hope people take away obviously a sort of a renewed or first time or whatever

505
00:28:53.271 --> 00:28:57.470
interest in her life and,
and uh,
and obviously all the things she went on to do.

506
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.300
One of the things I really liked about this,

507
00:28:59.301 --> 00:29:03.270
just as a woman in a film as a lead in the film,
is that,
you know,

508
00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:07.160
oftentimes mothers and or professionals are portrayed as sort of like,
you know,

509
00:29:07.161 --> 00:29:10.550
I'm a working mom,
but I can't get work right.
You know,
or like,

510
00:29:10.551 --> 00:29:14.980
but I can't get mothering.
Mothering is,
oh,
well there's just always like,
uh,

511
00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:18.890
given a take,
you know,
it's like,
career is great,
but,
you know,

512
00:29:18.891 --> 00:29:22.640
at home it's a mess and,
you know,
we're,
we're homes great and works in math.

513
00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.580
And Ruth really didn't really have,
you know,

514
00:29:25.581 --> 00:29:30.050
she just really did everything really well and just by dent of extremely hard

515
00:29:30.051 --> 00:29:33.260
work.
Um,
so I just,
it was,

516
00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:36.160
I haven't really seen that represented so beautifully,
you know,
uh,

517
00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:41.060
in a film before.
So people take away her work ethic and also the fact that she,

518
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.050
<v 2>she's not,
she hasn't just done an enormous amount.</v>

519
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:47.740
These are not things that can be undone.
The things she's done.
You know,

520
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:52.220
when you create a strong case law,
you know,
that's not a,
uh,

521
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:55.130
a plant.
You can just unplug it and you know,
throw away,
you know,

522
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.150
it's there for good,
you know.
And she did make it a lot of very,

523
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:02.540
extremely permanent changes in our country.
Yeah.
May I just add one thing to say?

524
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:06.670
Of course I just wanted to add that.
No,
she didn't do it alone.
You know,

525
00:30:06.671 --> 00:30:08.200
she did it.
That was my thing.

526
00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:14.290
I leave that out,
you know,
interrupted and steal your thing.

527
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:20.330
Are you saying
I'm not doing that?
Go forward.

528
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:25.450
Don't slip on that.
Uh,
you know,
that they had an equal partnership.

529
00:30:25.451 --> 00:30:29.860
That was a real metaphor for the film in that,
yeah.
You,
you know,

530
00:30:29.861 --> 00:30:33.520
that love and family are,
you know,

531
00:30:33.521 --> 00:30:38.521
are the most important thing and in life is connectivity and how you share your

532
00:30:40.151 --> 00:30:42.630
life and the choices you make,
um,

533
00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:47.560
and choosing the people you love and that love you.
Very important.

534
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:50.600
<v 3>Yeah.
As I say,
because that kind of respect,</v>

535
00:30:50.601 --> 00:30:54.140
this agree with the formulation of the question.
It's not that Ruth,

536
00:30:54.141 --> 00:30:54.951
that all those things,

537
00:30:54.951 --> 00:30:59.390
Ruth and Marty did all those things and I can tell you as a guy from experience

538
00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:03.020
the bar to be considered a supportive father and I sort of husband and good

539
00:31:03.021 --> 00:31:05.510
father is like incredibly low.

540
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.700
Like I like take my kids to school everyday and people are like,

541
00:31:07.701 --> 00:31:10.000
you're the best father in the world.
Meanwhile,

542
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:13.340
my wife's curing cancer and has made to feel guilty that she's not like baking

543
00:31:13.341 --> 00:31:17.630
for bake sales.
Um,
and so,
you know,
I just feel like,

544
00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.110
I hope that that's a walk away from the film is that,
you know,

545
00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.980
my wife and I were so benefited from having Ruth and Marty's are role models for

546
00:31:24.981 --> 00:31:26.940
what a marriage can be.
Um,

547
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.170
part of the reason for writing this is I realized I was in this privileged

548
00:31:30.171 --> 00:31:34.700
position to share that with other people.
So if nothing else,
the movie is a,

549
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.470
is a great date.
Movie phone is a barometer.
So that,

550
00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.370
like if you walk into the theater and the guys like that guy couldn't exist,

551
00:31:40.371 --> 00:31:41.204
like,
just run.

552
00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:49.270
<v 2>Okay.
Right.
And why is what it is a beautiful love story.
And then also,
you know,</v>

553
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:54.420
adding on the sort of a monumentous changes that she with others,
um,

554
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:58.570
helps to put for our country's laws.
It's pretty incredible.
So,
yeah.
Thank you.

555
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.060
Thank you all for coming here today.
