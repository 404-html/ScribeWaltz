1
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.220
And,
uh,
today we have a Aardman animations,
amazing creative team.

2
00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:12.170
We have nick park who's a director of a,

3
00:00:12.171 --> 00:00:14.990
the new film early man and Merlin crossing handle.

4
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.940
[inaudible] so thanks so much for coming here guys.

5
00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:23.910
This is phenomenal.
You guys brought some of your characters puppets,
um,

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.501
which is so cool,

7
00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:27.530
especially seeing the one that's cut in half so we can see all the innards of it

8
00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:32.270
and everything.
Um,
so,
uh,
I want to start with you,
nick.

9
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.100
Um,
and creator of Wallace and gromit,
which is amazing.

10
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.240
We Love Wallace and gromit everyone knows what was and I'm so I kind of want to

11
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.770
go back to,
um,

12
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.450
kind of the start of this story of where this came from,
how it came to

13
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.060
<v 2>yeah.
Early on.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
sure.
Well,
Gosh,</v>

14
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.320
a lot of these things start with just do those other page.
Um,

15
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.190
and uh,
I remember help me five or six,
seven years ago,
um,

16
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.960
you know,
doing the typical kind of caveman with a club,

17
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.260
hitting a rock and then suddenly started thinking about the whole potential for

18
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.630
caveman and the women in vet inventing sport.

19
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.220
And particular because of the tribal nature of soccer in the UK,

20
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.320
it just seemed to have a lot of legs,
you know,

21
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:26.410
that it's a developed to run literally with the idea.
And what,

22
00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:31.411
what if you had a bunch of lunkhead idiotic but lovable caveman who had to learn

23
00:01:33.141 --> 00:01:37.400
the discipline of a sport.
We're no longer able to use their weapons and fists,

24
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.380
um,
and had to fight for what they need need by playing your game.

25
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.190
And that was how it kind of,
how the whole idea is off.

26
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.450
<v 0>It's,
it's a really,
really fun film.
It's really funny and I love it.</v>

27
00:01:49.451 --> 00:01:53.440
You guys are still keeping stop motion alive and still doing them.

28
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:55.770
And I love just the process of how it all comes together.
It's,

29
00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.760
it's amazingly painstaking to do and for Merlin.

30
00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:04.420
And will you guys,
um,
how can I talk about your guys' career,

31
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.880
the studio when you guys came to the studio and then what brought you into this

32
00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:07.714
part?
I think,

33
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.490
<v 3>Oh,
I've worked at for about 22 years.</v>

34
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.810
I've stopped it as an animator and then slipped into directing and have worked

35
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:19.260
with alongside nick for most of that.
And uh,

36
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.190
it's really wonderful to be able to help me bring his vision to,

37
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.810
to an audience up on the screen.

38
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.440
<v 0>Say we actually worked with Merlin and uh,</v>

39
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.420
nick and ironman to create a Google doodle back in 2009.
So,
um,

40
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.050
which is really cool stuff.
You guys should check it out.

41
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.890
google.com/doodles I don't need to check all the archive.
Nice little plug there.

42
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.183
Um,

43
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.450
<v 3>yeah.
And um,
similarly to Merlin,
I've worked with nick.</v>

44
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.370
I have a few feature films and I actually wrote him a letter at about the age of

45
00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:51.220
14 to say,
how do I become an animator?

46
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.240
He wrote back and gave me some advice and then a very kindly Aardman supporting

47
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.250
me through college can be lots of tips and develop from that.

48
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.130
<v 0>And what drew you guys to stop motion specifically?</v>

49
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.651
<v 3>For me,</v>

50
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:12.880
it's just the tactile nature of it and the fact that you can create everything.

51
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.840
Um,

52
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.840
it's a very instant thing when you start the animators on this film.

53
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.420
Create very little actual footage in a week.

54
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.910
But when you first start doing an animation,
it's quite quick.

55
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:28.840
You can take a ball of clay and make it move and come to life and see the

56
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.590
results straight away.
Yeah.
For me,
I was already studying animation,

57
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.240
learning and TD.
I haven't,
yeah,
I can draw,
but it's,
I have to work at it.

58
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.500
And sculpting is just a much more natural medium for me,
so I can express myself,

59
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.040
uh,
much more fluently in sculpting.
Yeah.

60
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.660
<v 0>And how about you?
I read that you,</v>

61
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.420
so you were students and that's when urban kinds of,
hey,

62
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:53.520
come on and we'll fund your project.

63
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.800
And then ended up actually being Wallace and gromit.
Is that right?

64
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.370
<v 2>That's right.
Wallace and gromit was a,
a film school.</v>

65
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.040
I was at film school and it was my graduation film and I was taking years over

66
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:05.270
it and I ran out of time and money.
It feels skill.

67
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.190
And I got to know Peter Lloyd and David Sproxton who have had already started

68
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.050
apartment a few years before that.

69
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.700
And they were the only people I knew of who did stop.
You know,
clay animation.

70
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.710
So,
uh,
uh,
a neighbor,
they were expanding and looking for animators.

71
00:04:21.711 --> 00:04:24.300
And I think I was the only one they knew really at the time.

72
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.850
So they kept calling me up and I wonder,
I had this vision,

73
00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:33.310
I had to finish my film.
I'm an altar,
you know,
director.
Uh,
uh,

74
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.670
and eventually they said,
why don't we help you finish the film?
Um,

75
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.420
and if you come to work for us part time in,
that was in 1985 so I did.

76
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.880
And they did.
They did help me.

77
00:04:43.881 --> 00:04:47.480
They gave me a corner of the studio and it took me another four years to finish

78
00:04:47.481 --> 00:04:50.300
the film.
Yeah.

79
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.860
<v 0>Well guess so how long does early Matt,</v>

80
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.420
how long early mantic you said about six years from idea?
Yeah.

81
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.090
<v 2>From idea.
Yeah.</v>

82
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.690
The idea when writing stage is probably the longest stretch really.

83
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.210
The last 18 months was the actual shooting.

84
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.850
The actual animation was 18 months to two years.
But before that,
you know,

85
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.330
the storyboarding,
the set design,
character,
design building,

86
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.440
um,
and the writing before that is a couple of years at least.

87
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.703
<v 0>Right,
right.</v>

88
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.570
And can you guys talk about a little bit about your like inspirations for,

89
00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:21.860
you know,
with stop motion,
you know,

90
00:05:21.861 --> 00:05:24.920
you have Willis O'brien who did like King Kong and,
and money Joe Young,

91
00:05:24.921 --> 00:05:28.940
and then you have ray Harryhausen obviously is most well known for Jason The

92
00:05:28.941 --> 00:05:31.970
argonauts.
And so when you,
um,

93
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.970
did you ever get to meet Harry Housing and work with them at all?

94
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.980
<v 3>Yeah,
I wouldn't to Ray Harryhausen nice seven,</v>

95
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.830
which was an extraordinary opportunity and experience for me.

96
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.290
He was automation direct turn.
I animated full him and um,
we did it all.

97
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.110
The project we working on,
we,
we did in the way he worked.
Um,

98
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.890
when he first pioneered a lot of the techniques.
It was a real eyeopener for me.

99
00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:58.130
And I,
uh,
I

100
00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.653
<v 4>just in the,</v>

101
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.090
it was on a five week project and just that short amount of time working with a

102
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:09.540
master like that,
but my,
you know,
I was like a spot and the sheep,

103
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.300
they're just constantly,
I'm not pestering him,

104
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:18.350
but just trying to absorb some of,
some of that knowledge that,
that he had

105
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.760
created and pioneered pretty much everything that we do.

106
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:27.170
We don't really do anything different to what rated,
but just,
um,

107
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.630
not so much for visual effects.
More for entertainment.

108
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.840
<v 0>Yeah.
And did you meet</v>

109
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.660
<v 2>yeah,
a few times.
Yeah.
Did you will,
he came around,</v>

110
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.430
didn't of the wearer,

111
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.460
but he came for a tour of the studio and he chatted to run a special day.

112
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.120
And the film is very much,
uh,
the opening sequence of this movie.

113
00:06:49.121 --> 00:06:51.960
It's very much a tribute to Ray Harryhausen.
Yeah,

114
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.360
there's two dinosaurs we named one of them ray and one of them Harry,

115
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.200
<v 0>as well as the state to the crazy cousin re um,
uh,
I guess the,
the,</v>

116
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.030
<v 2>the big change was going from film to digital stills.</v>

117
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.390
So we shoot everything on high end digital stills,
cameras,

118
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.380
just individual frames,
which uh,
uh,
instantly quicker.
Um,

119
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.140
so everything we shoot on the studio floor goes up to edit and we can review it

120
00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:21.320
there and then,
um,

121
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.900
and next constantly working on the animatic and that the edit.
So,

122
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.980
<v 4>um,
it's much more immediate now.</v>

123
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.430
We used to have to send the film off to London.
We were in Bristol,
there's not,

124
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.860
there wasn't a lab in Bristol,
so you'd have to send it overnight.

125
00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.670
And it wasn't till the next day that you'd all gather around in the theater to

126
00:07:38.671 --> 00:07:43.671
see your dailies and so probably saved six months off the shoot.

127
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.100
<v 0>Right,
right there.
Right.
And then if something was wrong back in the day,</v>

128
00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:50.500
like where you looked at your dailies where like,
oh,
this is not working,

129
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.490
would you just have to go back and reshoot that or would you just search for

130
00:07:53.491 --> 00:07:53.620
them?

131
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.700
<v 2>Frames?
Yeah,
yeah.
Digital,</v>

132
00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.790
digital kind of offers a big safety net,
really that if something goes wrong,

133
00:08:00.791 --> 00:08:05.230
you know,
a tree falls over or whatever in the middle of a three day shot.
Right.

134
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.810
You don't have to start again,
you can paste it back up again in post.
Well,

135
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:10.270
there's this

136
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.640
<v 0>amazing,
um,</v>

137
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.680
coliseums scene and the arena where they're playing a football in there and I

138
00:08:16.841 --> 00:08:20.200
really want to talk about it.
It's kind of mind blowing to me.

139
00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:22.870
I'm like that all that could be stop motion or there has to be some digital

140
00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:24.550
enhancements like the crowds and stuff.

141
00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:28.450
But can you talk about kind of the breakdown of how you did the world of saying,

142
00:08:28.451 --> 00:08:31.780
okay,
this is going to be puppet and this is going to be,
yeah.

143
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.930
<v 2>Well all the old principal character animation throughout the movie is,</v>

144
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.380
is all stopped frame,
you know,
with clay faces.

145
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.830
But sometimes the football picture for example,

146
00:08:43.831 --> 00:08:47.670
it's like 30 feet long and you just couldn't reach characters at the other.

147
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.770
Oh yeah.
It was such a long walk around the set to me.
We went,

148
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.890
we went to digital at the back.

149
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.550
Anything in the background or massive crowd scenes when digital.

150
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.370
<v 4>Yeah.
And the whole stadium is computer generated.</v>

151
00:09:00.371 --> 00:09:04.600
So it's just 35,000 seat stadium.
We can't make that many puppets.
Right.

152
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.870
So,
um,
we used a lot of VR for previous,

153
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.830
so will and I had a system where we could actually go into the stadium at the

154
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:18.480
puppet scale and fine and we calibrate the Vr to whichever lens set we were

155
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:19.200
using.

156
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.850
We could compose a shot and match it up to the stop motion frame on the set or

157
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:24.421
vice versa,

158
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:27.900
find a frame on the stop motion set and just reference it because obviously if

159
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:30.150
we're shooting on a blue screen or green screen,

160
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.230
we have no idea what the rest of the composition looks like.
So having,

161
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.180
using that technology was really,

162
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:40.890
really useful for us so we could sort of collide the old and the new,

163
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.000
um,
and make sure that it was going to be working in harmony.
And that was,

164
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.710
that was a really valuable tool to us.

165
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.670
But so that whole stadium is CG.

166
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.943
<v 3>Um,</v>

167
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.810
yeah it expands the world of stop motion cause obviously the puppets are a

168
00:09:56.811 --> 00:09:59.360
certain size and the sets have to be built around them.

169
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.330
And although we did as much as we could in camera and using false perspective

170
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:06.140
and old traditional techniques,
there is that,
um,

171
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:11.160
that epic feel that you get from the stadium pitch made of grass and all of the

172
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.230
fence around the edge.
We had a physical,
uh,
field football field.

173
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:19.460
It's just everything beyond that,
everything beyond that was so interesting.

174
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.010
Especially for you guys as like animation directors when you're working with

175
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.060
these characters and stuff.

176
00:10:23.061 --> 00:10:27.350
Is there anything that maybe surprise you about that was very difficult?

177
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.640
This go around from previous films in terms of it just difficult working with

178
00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:36.380
the characters or the hair or the puppets?
All of those,

179
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.480
because you can correct me if I'm wrong,

180
00:10:41.481 --> 00:10:45.740
but I think nick was really keen to go to quite a tactile,

181
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.970
very clay,
you know,
he wants to see the fingerprints and there's lots of uh,

182
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.560
and hair in this film,
which didn't exist on Wallace and gromit.
It was sculpted.

183
00:10:55.100 --> 00:11:00.100
So the first challenge was finding materials that would let us really keep those

184
00:11:01.191 --> 00:11:04.520
nice textures and the animators that she physically moving.

185
00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:08.320
We see the for oiling around,
but that's all part of Caveman.

186
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:09.391
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

187
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:14.391
It's like we all realize how you could do wonderful ham and fair in CG and even

188
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.840
even many stock fame animators would shy away from the firm and looked in horror

189
00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:24.390
when we presented the puffers.
But that's,
yeah,
like,
like say that so,

190
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.650
so it's a lovely quality that reminds you of the old King Kong and you know when

191
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:32.480
you get a little flick of the hair or it'll boil in the,
in the fair.

192
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.170
And that's all part of it.

193
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.350
<v 3>It's always interesting is when there's something that seems so simple to an</v>

194
00:11:37.351 --> 00:11:39.570
audience,
but it's actually very,
very difficult.

195
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:42.800
Was there anything like that in the film?
They taste a simple shop.

196
00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:47.400
It's actually deceptively difficult to do.
The big set pieces,
you know,

197
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:50.250
they're big set pieces and New York have a big run up to them.

198
00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:53.980
You'll do a lot of testing and preparation.
It's actually the closeups,
the

199
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.000
<v 4>when the shots have to act and they have to communicate a thought or a feeling</v>

200
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:03.740
in the animators are actors and they have to make the audience understand what

201
00:12:05.261 --> 00:12:09.940
that character is at that moment.
And those are the ones that are the hardest.

202
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.300
They really are.
You know,
the big set pieces are big and flashy.

203
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:16.900
They're complicated and difficult,
but actually there's a lot of distraction.

204
00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.270
You can get away with a surprising amount of shots.

205
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.760
It's the intimate moments which are the hardest to do.

206
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.690
<v 2>And then can you talk about a little bit about finding this talent to be able to</v>

207
00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:26.081
do this?

208
00:12:26.081 --> 00:12:30.550
Cause it's a very limited number of people in this world can do this type of

209
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:32.410
animation.
Yes,
definitely.

210
00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:37.360
I mean we had a wonderful team of 35 or 40 animators,
uh,

211
00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:41.860
all very hem chosen,
um,
mainly guy.
You guys wasn't it?
And they were,

212
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.470
there were those,
uh,
doing what Merlin saying,

213
00:12:45.471 --> 00:12:48.920
you're conveying a thinking character that's actually,

214
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:53.320
it's not just moving puppets and it's actually making them feel like they're

215
00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:55.890
alive and breathing.
Um,

216
00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:00.910
and there are probably a handful who are really excellent and,
uh,
and then,
uh,

217
00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:05.330
another level who were pretty good,
you know,
and so we went on,

218
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.600
but obviously there were many shots that need really great acting.
And,
um,

219
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:15.130
so it was always a dilemma as to who to put on which,
which shot.
Right.

220
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.410
Which were the most important,
which took priority.

221
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.600
And were there any like tricks or kind of cheats that you were able to do

222
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:26.950
certain characters in terms of we can't get the hair to flow correctly,
right?

223
00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:28.630
With the character or the capes?

224
00:13:28.631 --> 00:13:31.510
Was it like always going to CG or they're like fun little tricks that you guys

225
00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:34.060
can share in terms of specifically working with stop motion?

226
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:34.800
<v 3>Uh,</v>

227
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.840
the model team spent a long time actually before the shoot started and we always

228
00:13:38.841 --> 00:13:43.400
do tests with the first version of each character.
Um,

229
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:48.410
but it was probably them using all the knowledge that they've built up from all

230
00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:52.640
the previous films each time taking something to the next film.
Um,

231
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.440
they're using pretty much everything on each character is made to be movable.

232
00:13:57.441 --> 00:13:59.510
So Doug's hair,
for example,

233
00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:04.690
has individual wired strands so that each hair can be moved in my new details,

234
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.730
<v 4>guests,
the hair and the phone was tricky.
There was one captain,</v>

235
00:14:08.731 --> 00:14:13.040
the captain of the bronze team is a very vain fellow.

236
00:14:13.041 --> 00:14:15.660
He's always combing his hair and there's a couple of shots where he kind of

237
00:14:15.661 --> 00:14:19.350
doesn't kind of,
uh,
like a shampoo commercial kind of

238
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:25.080
to get that,
to animate it.
Normally his hair's kind of all neat and tidy,

239
00:14:25.081 --> 00:14:28.470
but you get that flood,
well how are we going to do this?

240
00:14:28.471 --> 00:14:31.380
And actually the best way to do it is to get here and put wax in it and that

241
00:14:31.381 --> 00:14:36.360
just animate it and don't try and be clever.
I just use the real thing and,

242
00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:41.150
and the animators were kind of
not sure,
but that she wants to,

243
00:14:41.151 --> 00:14:45.870
I had to go to it and sort of worked out the limitations of where it could go

244
00:14:45.871 --> 00:14:49.890
and what they can do with it.
Then actually it sort of exceeded expectations.

245
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.090
And that's one of the great things where you just need to have a go at it.

246
00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.990
Quite often it'll work rather than trying to overthink the problem.

247
00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.110
What was something that you took from your previous owners?
We did touch on that,

248
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.300
the degree periods forms as you're able to use on this,
like,
oh,

249
00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:06.070
why you use this trick or I'll use this idea or,
well,
the main thing is,
is the,

250
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.070
there's the sculpting nature.
Um,
we've,
we've done a couple of,

251
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.620
we did a film with a rapid prototype,

252
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.280
kind of three d printed faces for dialogue.

253
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.650
And then this,
we really went back to using full clay.

254
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.180
We've got a mouth set here and so the,

255
00:15:24.181 --> 00:15:28.370
the basic speech is done with clay.
So it's

256
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.090
in one sentence.
We were pushing the level of performance animation,
but we would,

257
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.370
we were,
I don't want to call it a step back,

258
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:42.371
but we were going back to a trusted technique which we were all very comfortable

259
00:15:43.731 --> 00:15:47.900
with,
which was using pure modeling clay for the,
all of the expressions,

260
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.230
expressions and expressive performances from the characters.

261
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.210
<v 3>Wow.
That's crazy.
Um,
yeah.</v>

262
00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:59.700
Also I suppose the technique or rather the style is,

263
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:02.910
is,
uh,
specific to Nick's work.

264
00:16:02.911 --> 00:16:07.911
So we've had different directors on different films and pirates was Lord and um,

265
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.160
and we've had Richard Star Zach on Sean,

266
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.160
and each of them have a slightly different thing that they look for in the

267
00:16:14.161 --> 00:16:17.520
performance and the movement.
So we had to work with the,

268
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:22.140
all the animators that had worked with nick before inherently learning his

269
00:16:22.141 --> 00:16:25.740
actual sort of slightly bolder,
more graphic style,

270
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.110
and then training up some new animators in,

271
00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:35.040
in that way of specific bold the entity.

272
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.100
Is that difficult for you guys in terms of keeping characters on model as you go

273
00:16:38.101 --> 00:16:43.050
through a different form?
It's probably the biggest part of our job actually.

274
00:16:43.051 --> 00:16:43.490
Yeah.

275
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.810
<v 2>And that's partly the reason for these mouth,
isn't it?
For these clay mask,</v>

276
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.640
I don't know if you can see them at all.

277
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.140
It's a technique we started using.
Thirdly,

278
00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:58.070
they use something similar on nightmare before Christmas with replacement heads.

279
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:03.160
And we under a close shave back in 97 we use,
we did some mailings,

280
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.330
just been through the,
the idea.
But we,
yeah,

281
00:17:05.331 --> 00:17:09.350
we unplug to say the animator sculpting the whole mouth again.

282
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.290
Um,
we have these ready made males Jara pluggable,

283
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:21.820
but they're all still made of clay as you were saying that so that you can still

284
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:22.580
squeeze them.

285
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.970
And so it doesn't film to mechanical is still half the organic field,

286
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.920
but that keeps to style consistent

287
00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.610
<v 3>all hand sculpted by the assistant animators.
So each,</v>

288
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:38.040
each Doug puppet,
we'll have a set of mounts and each new food.
Yeah,

289
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.540
<v 4>we made thousand.
What we the royal we right.
Thousands of mouth,</v>

290
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.670
uh,
over the course of the movie.

291
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.470
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
And another thing,
the way here we adopt to technology,</v>

292
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.550
uh,
all the way through different films and probably more so on this than ever.

293
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:57.200
Um,
but there's,
there's one way in which the digital side,

294
00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:01.830
it just helps us go faster really with the stop frame is that in the old days

295
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.390
there's a lot of running around in this film and jumping in,
uh,

296
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.520
in the old days we would have today for character left the ground,

297
00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:13.130
we would have to get w fishing line or thin wire and it will take the animator

298
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:17.300
age is to position and then find out the why.
It's catching the light,
you know,

299
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.770
and,
and,
and so with this,

300
00:18:19.771 --> 00:18:23.800
we just have like a dirty great big rig behind the character ans,

301
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:28.470
and the animated doesn't have to be worry about it being seen because we just

302
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.620
painting around after afterwards.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's nuts.

303
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.000
So that speeds up the whole person for sure.
Um,
questions.

304
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:42.110
<v 0>When you are working with CG animation,
do you</v>

305
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.440
like,
it looks too polished?
Like how do you,

306
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.140
how difficult is it to take like the perfect in between the interpretation of

307
00:18:49.141 --> 00:18:53.520
the computer and then have take it back a bit to look more like the creative

308
00:18:53.521 --> 00:18:57.270
vision of,
of stop motion?
It's very difficult.

309
00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:03.470
<v 4>Well that we've worked very hard on,
we did all our CG animation in house,</v>

310
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.840
so our head of animation,
Lloyd Price,

311
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:10.870
he supervised the CG and we automate most of our movies on double frames,

312
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.780
taking two frames at a time.

313
00:19:14.781 --> 00:19:19.781
So 12 frames a second and a computer animation prefers single friends or you

314
00:19:21.021 --> 00:19:24.350
know,
blurring,
you know,
it's a much slicker.
Um,
and just,

315
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:29.470
just making sure that the CG felt appropriate and embedded says that it wasn't

316
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:31.693
sort of a,

317
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.930
like they were invaders from another planet in your movie.

318
00:19:35.931 --> 00:19:40.010
It had to feel like it was the same team playing together and,

319
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.420
and that that was just a period of testing.
And once we understood what it was,

320
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:48.350
then it's a very easy thing to then apply then to the rest of the performance of

321
00:19:48.351 --> 00:19:49.220
the digital levels

322
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.620
<v 2>we have,
we have to work in quite an economic way as well with all evil,</v>

323
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.230
with the foreground,
with,
sorry,
with the background,
any,

324
00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.540
any of the figures that were,

325
00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.680
cause we couldn't really afford the rendering time and the uh,

326
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.200
the quality that most CG films would have.

327
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:09.180
So we had to keep an ECG had to be out of focus or in the distance.

328
00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.720
<v 0>It's like I was not going to,
I love that stuff.
That's great.
Um,</v>

329
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.300
can you talk a little bit about to disappear Lord and David's Brockton

330
00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:23.350
approximate in terms of what their involvement is with the film and,
and um,
yeah.

331
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.880
Are they giving any story ideas or guidance?

332
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:27.931
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,</v>

333
00:20:27.931 --> 00:20:32.670
they are a very much a part of the whole process from the very beginning.

334
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.230
You know,
when we start pitching ideas and ideas that get green lit and,

335
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:40.740
and uh,
uh,
and then they're very handy,
you know,

336
00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:45.120
coming in on the edit and giving advice and uh,
uh,

337
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.760
right to the end,
right through and on script as well.
Yeah,
lots of script,

338
00:20:48.761 --> 00:20:50.290
10 days.
Yeah.
I see.

339
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:53.880
You're very involved with obvious as well from some of the clubs we saw was
your,

340
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.160
your,
uh,
shooting reference footage and you're,

341
00:20:57.161 --> 00:20:58.970
you're in there and you're kind of giving the idea what you,

342
00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.310
why are you also working with,

343
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.690
obviously you guys pop in there as well as sometimes.
Um,

344
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.890
do you work obviously with individual animators as well and be like,
Hey,

345
00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:09.190
give me your take on it as well,
or is it,
um,
what's the,

346
00:21:09.191 --> 00:21:10.240
what's the balance do you find there?

347
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:16.110
Because I was directing this one alone because most feature films tend to be two

348
00:21:16.271 --> 00:21:19.920
handers and we've got that,
we picked that up from,
from when we,

349
00:21:19.921 --> 00:21:22.620
with dreamworks and the Disney model.
Uh,

350
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.640
because there's such a vast amount of work to do and to oversee every detail

351
00:21:28.031 --> 00:21:30.220
and,
and uh,
so you have to have a,

352
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:35.580
in this way you have to organize and you know,
had a very strong team in Welland,

353
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.380
Merlin at the top.
Uh,

354
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:42.370
so we would talk endlessly about the scene and the essence of what the spirit of

355
00:21:42.371 --> 00:21:46.620
every shot is about and what every shot has to accomplish.
Uh,

356
00:21:46.621 --> 00:21:51.580
and we would get down on the floor in front of a video camera and acts swale and

357
00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:55.960
these guys with more relay this to the animators and look after teams of

358
00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:59.720
animators occasionally I would as well.
Yeah.

359
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.690
That was mainly your job wasn't,
yeah,
but you were,
um,

360
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.580
<v 3>through,
through the whole process and all the effort,</v>

361
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:11.230
a lot of the effort goes into the preps.
So all the art department meetings,

362
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:16.240
the design of the props and the puppets,
everything at that point is overseen.

363
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.170
And then up to the point where the animator starts the shop,

364
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.850
that's where we sort of fill in that gap gadget.

365
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.560
And the animators do bring all of them,
bring things to each shop.

366
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.050
They're all individuals and they're all actors and they all got ideas.

367
00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:32.020
So I'm definitely,
they dug,

368
00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:36.370
the character evolves as more animators join and bring their own sort of flavor

369
00:22:36.371 --> 00:22:36.930
to them.

370
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.420
<v 2>Right?
So the storyboard a reference,
like here's the guidance for you.</v>

371
00:22:39.421 --> 00:22:43.080
We need to get from point a to point B,
but within those,
you know,
yeah,

372
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.023
<v 4>yeah.</v>

373
00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:47.810
Make sure that whatever was coming to the shop was going to make the shot better

374
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.260
and,
and still be following the vision for the movie.

375
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.250
And the major difference with stop motion is that you only get the one go really

376
00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:57.850
because you start the beginning,
you finished the anticline,

377
00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.770
go back and adjust in the middle.
Right?

378
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:05.800
So the pressure is on everyone to get to get it.

379
00:23:06.231 --> 00:23:10.850
Right.
Right.
And so,
um,
we really welcome ideas from everyone and every,

380
00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:14.870
every department of the movie.
But there comes a point where you have to just go,

381
00:23:14.871 --> 00:23:18.070
okay,
well let's look at this,
this,
this and this and that.
It's good.
And make it,

382
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:23.030
make the decisions to,
to go ahead and,
um,
yeah.
And,
and,

383
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.830
and because we can have that level of a little bit of flexibility and

384
00:23:27.831 --> 00:23:30.920
spontaneity,
it means that it allows,
you know,

385
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.720
if nick needs to adjust something from a story point of view or the art

386
00:23:35.721 --> 00:23:38.480
department need to change something,
then we can accommodate that.

387
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.280
But once it's in,
then that's,

388
00:23:40.281 --> 00:23:43.460
so that's a continuity reference that has to be fallen for the rest of the film.

389
00:23:43.461 --> 00:23:45.800
So you also have to kind of keep all of those in your head.

390
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.873
<v 3>Right.</v>

391
00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:48.850
<v 5>I watched a budget,</v>

392
00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.810
special features from you guys on DVD when I was a kid and I remember the,
uh,

393
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:55.800
the biggest thing that I've heard from any,
um,

394
00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.170
but are you doing stop motion animation?
Is that it's a dying art.
And,
um,

395
00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:04.500
I wanted to ask you specifically to comment on the industry.
I know to,

396
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.760
to mind it's you guys,
and I think Laika,
I don't know if they're still around,
um,

397
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:14.650
but,
uh,
you know,
where do you guys see the future of the industry?
You know,

398
00:24:14.651 --> 00:24:18.730
how connected are you guys?
And,
um,
and,
and,
uh,

399
00:24:18.731 --> 00:24:22.570
is it going to continue or they're going to be new people coming on to
hopefully,

400
00:24:22.571 --> 00:24:24.190
uh,
uh,
keep it,

401
00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.470
<v 3>keep it alive going forward.
It's not the up.</v>

402
00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:32.430
<v 2>Yeah.
I remember,
uh,
you know,
20 or 30 years ago with the rise of CG,</v>

403
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.410
uh,
how we used to look at each other and thinking how,
how long do we have left?

404
00:24:37.411 --> 00:24:39.600
And,
uh,
and,
and we're still here,

405
00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.670
but it's amazing how much it's hasn't,
you know,

406
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:49.300
how it is still flowering as an industry.
Um,
you know,
that there was like a,

407
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.250
uh,
you know,
films that Tim Burton is coming up with and um,

408
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:58.200
whereas Anderson was Anderson's just about to release another stop frame film

409
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.150
<v 3>last year.
It's actually really hard to get animators.</v>

410
00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.360
It was more and stop motion.
How many was it?
It was four,
four [inaudible],

411
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:11.110
which has never happened ever.
It was quite amazing.

412
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.160
We normally sorts of,
from the previous films,

413
00:25:15.161 --> 00:25:19.060
it seems like Tim Burton and up and do them exactly the same time.

414
00:25:19.061 --> 00:25:20.710
And then there's a gap of several years.

415
00:25:20.711 --> 00:25:24.700
But actually it's sort of picked up a bit of pace.
So it's quite a good time.

416
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.590
Some of our team or come over and work at liker and,
and um,

417
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.900
then where's movie and then come to us.
And so it's,
it's a really nice,

418
00:25:31.901 --> 00:25:33.640
it's a small world.

419
00:25:33.641 --> 00:25:37.340
It's a relatively small corner of the animation world cruise.

420
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:42.550
Many crew members do kind of work on production.
So that's really healthy.

421
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:47.230
Yeah,
that's crazy that there's four in production.
That's nuts.

422
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.793
<v 2>I guess it's,</v>

423
00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:53.340
it can survive as long as we're all telling good stories and compelling stories

424
00:25:53.341 --> 00:25:54.570
with compelling characters

425
00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:00.190
<v 4>to follow on that there is a huge part of the process that's simply writing.</v>

426
00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:01.120
Right.

427
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:06.120
And I guess I'm curious how attached you are to the difficulty of going from the

428
00:26:06.581 --> 00:26:08.560
rating to the final product.

429
00:26:08.561 --> 00:26:13.330
So if it were possible to go from your lab team and you know,

430
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:18.250
magically produce a visual results that had all of the charm that you could ever

431
00:26:18.251 --> 00:26:20.110
want,
would you be sad?

432
00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.360
<v 2>I've had all of that.</v>

433
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:25.710
<v 4>Yeah.
Like if the lab,</v>

434
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:31.050
you could train up an AI model to sort of like look at all the films you've ever

435
00:26:31.051 --> 00:26:34.420
done and then say,
oh,
I get it.
And apply that to

436
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.780
pass the test.
If you,
if you looked at it and said,
oh my God,
that's beautiful.

437
00:26:39.781 --> 00:26:43.930
I wouldn't change a thing.
Wouldn't you be sad?
Are

438
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.940
<v 6>you were framing,
if you guys,
what are we working on?</v>

439
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.930
<v 3>The writing is the story and how much of it is the process of the process</v>

440
00:26:51.931 --> 00:26:54.600
basically vanished.
Could you be sad?

441
00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.930
<v 2>No,
no.
I mean the writing is such a,</v>

442
00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:02.860
before any animations doesn't think that writing is just so key to coming up

443
00:27:02.861 --> 00:27:07.861
with the idea and the structuring of the idea and the art chemo cause that's

444
00:27:08.561 --> 00:27:13.450
where the,
the real,
uh,
you know,
bedrock is created for everything.

445
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.380
Um,
you know,
the,
the,
the arc of the story,

446
00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:19.420
each character with their own arc.

447
00:27:19.421 --> 00:27:23.980
And I was in a room with Mark Burton and another writers came in at different

448
00:27:23.981 --> 00:27:27.850
times.
Uh,
just look staring at cards on a wall.

449
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.110
You know,

450
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:34.110
so much of that goes on before anything's built anythings without that,

451
00:27:34.601 --> 00:27:38.890
there's nothing to,
to make,
you know.
Um,
so,
uh,
yeah,

452
00:27:38.891 --> 00:27:42.430
it's a very key and then,
then we find that even the writing on the page,

453
00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.660
then we start storyboarding and that becomes a very different animal because it,

454
00:27:46.661 --> 00:27:48.550
how to interpret what's on it's,
you know,

455
00:27:48.551 --> 00:27:53.551
it's easy to say they saw the hat on the page and then you have to execute each

456
00:27:55.121 --> 00:27:57.140
bit as a scene.
And uh,

457
00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.120
it's all about the timing of each scene and what the scene's about.

458
00:28:01.121 --> 00:28:05.380
And then suddenly you find actually one scene knocks out in another scene and

459
00:28:05.381 --> 00:28:10.060
contradict something else.
And then we start to plan the anime,
you know,

460
00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:15.360
set up what we think was a really strong sort of blueprint in storyboard a

461
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:19.240
suddenly become slightly another reality when you're setting up the camera on

462
00:28:19.241 --> 00:28:23.560
the floor and things change again a little.
So it's a very fluid,
you know,

463
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:27.970
I think all of us started from a point where we just enjoyed the making or doing

464
00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:33.610
when we were sort of on a very innocent level before it gets kind of big and

465
00:28:33.611 --> 00:28:34.444
serious.

466
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:36.970
<v 3>Gotcha.
You just kind of</v>

467
00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.760
<v 6>making we had,
I think that's,</v>

468
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:45.840
I think I'm probably wouldn't miss filmmaking.
Yeah.

469
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.133
And last person,

470
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.450
<v 3>thank you for being here and uh,
thank you for bringing such joy into the world.</v>

471
00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.530
Oh,
thank you.
Um,
I guess related to that previous question,

472
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:04.160
are there happy accidents that occur that would only happen and be part of the

473
00:29:04.621 --> 00:29:08.430
process if it,
because you were working with a physical medium,

474
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:09.953
you should be cleaned out.

475
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.180
<v 6>Yeah.
Yeah.
The Ra.
Well,
yeah,</v>

476
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.320
<v 3>because it's um,
because it's stopped frame or stop motion animation.</v>

477
00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:28.330
No two shots will ever be the same and each animator we'll do something

478
00:29:28.331 --> 00:29:29.590
different to everyone else.

479
00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:34.650
So almost every shop contains a unique sort of piece of performance,

480
00:29:35.981 --> 00:29:36.814
I suppose.

481
00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:41.080
And sometimes things go wrong in the shot and sometimes the characters can't do,

482
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.190
they were meant to do

483
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:47.470
<v 2>and we have to adapt and change it,
which is just unique to this medium,
I think.</v>

484
00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:52.950
Um,
but also that expression that comes from grommets,
brows and,

485
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:57.850
and these characters browse,
it's very,
very unique to this style.

486
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.770
They can go one or two ways.

487
00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.610
Either it's unexpected and it's a disaster or as unexpected,
and you think,

488
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:05.230
oh my goodness,
that's amazing.

489
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:10.000
That never would have happened if we sort of asked for it.
Um,
and so you can,

490
00:30:10.001 --> 00:30:13.420
you kind of have to roll with the punches like that.
Yeah.

491
00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.490
I'm trying to think of an example,

492
00:30:15.491 --> 00:30:20.230
but there have been happy times as well when the story,
cause we,
you know,

493
00:30:20.231 --> 00:30:22.580
we make the whole film and storyboards for,
than,

494
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.990
and see how the whole shape of it's working and the,

495
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.180
but then when you get the unlimited sex,

496
00:30:27.181 --> 00:30:30.070
you're not saying you can be really surprised at things,

497
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:34.690
take on a different meaning.
And sometimes it allows you to,
hell,

498
00:30:34.691 --> 00:30:36.250
maybe we don't need this shot next to it.

499
00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:40.120
It's just funny on its own or so things happen like that all the time.

500
00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.670
Great.
Thanks so much,
guys,
for being here.

501
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.673
<v 6>Uh,</v>

502
00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:48.740
[inaudible].
