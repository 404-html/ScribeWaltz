1
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.580
Alright.
Hello everyone.
One a day at Google.

2
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.440
My name is Eileen Naughton.

3
00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:19.760
I lead people I'm ratios and we are so happy.

4
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:24.470
It's just so heartwarming to be here today of all days on international women's

5
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:29.471
Day and to be able to welcome a panel of incredible talent from the new Disney

6
00:00:29.931 --> 00:00:34.550
film,
a wrinkle in time,
which opens tomorrow,
March 9th worldwide.

7
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.610
So we are here to celebrate a number of strong,

8
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:42.611
courageous women who are helping steer us all to a more equitable future.

9
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.740
Now we're about to me are extraordinary panel,

10
00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:48.770
but first let me introduce it in the room with us today.

11
00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:51.230
40 Young Women From Girls Inc

12
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.050
nonprofit organization that encourages all girls to be strong,

13
00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:04.100
smart,
and bold through direct service and advocacy.
Welcome girls.

14
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.950
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

15
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.690
<v 0>These girls were invited by Google's made with code program,</v>

16
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:15.691
a movement that Google is proud to support a movement to equip women with the

17
00:01:17.741 --> 00:01:22.420
skills they need to embark on any career path they choose,

18
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.160
including careers in science,
technology,
engineering,
and math.

19
00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:32.161
And given that Madeline linguals novel of wrinkle in time is often cited as

20
00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:36.640
inspiration for women who have taken careers in science.

21
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.150
We hope today brings similar inspiration.
Okay.

22
00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:43.300
We're going to introduce the cast.

23
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.410
So I'd first like to welcome the wise and wonderful Oprah Winfrey.

24
00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.283
<v 2>Oh,</v>

25
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.290
<v 3>Bruh.
Bruh.</v>

26
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.790
You have some fans.

27
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.053
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

28
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.853
<v 3>Water.</v>

29
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.690
<v 0>Oh,

30
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:19.190
And by us I mean humankind.
Oprah is a media icon,

31
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:22.490
an Oscar nominated actress,
producer,
philanthropist.

32
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.520
She's also one of my favorite things about to Oprah.

33
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.050
So you're the founder of the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South

34
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.500
Africa,

35
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.520

<v 0>it's educational and leadership opportunities for academically gifted girls from</v>

37
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.390
a disadvantaged backgrounds.
Thank you for that.
Bit Supportive Girls Inc too.

38
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.900
<v 2>Oh,</v>

39
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.900
<v 0>is a fairy godmother as she plays Mrs which and a wrinkle in time.</v>

40
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:51.340
Welcome Oprah.

41
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.890
<v 3>Ava,
Ava duvernay</v>

42
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.040
<v 0>filmmaker,
producer and screen writer who directed a wrinkle in time.</v>

43
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.250
<v 3>And the 2014 2014 Oscar nominated</v>

44
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.450
<v 0>the film Selma,</v>

45
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.710
which chronicles Dr. Martin Luther King's journal Juniors leadership in the

46
00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:18.240
struggle for voting rights.

47
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.890
Eva has the rare distinction of being an academy award and Golden Globe

48
00:03:22.891 --> 00:03:26.580
nominated director of both documentary and feature films.
Welcome Ava.

49
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.370
<v 3>Next we have storm rain.
Storm is here.</v>

50
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.740
Start again.

51
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.410
Start again.

52
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.650
<v 0>Day when she was three years old,
she's 14 right now.</v>

53
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:46.750
So she's growing up right before her eyes.

54
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:50.890
Storm plays the lead role of make Murray in a wrinkle in time

55
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.660
<v 3>and among other roles,
storms</v>

56
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.280
<v 0>appeared in the Academy Award winning film 12 years a slave.</v>

57
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.740
And we have Google but burrata,

58
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.150
an English actress known for many roles in British TV and film including

59
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.430
recurring role and the doctor who TV series

60
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.110
<v 3>and pluming and beauty and the beast.</v>

61
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.480
[inaudible] more than half the rose that Google has appeared in,

62
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:17.464
were directed by

63
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.560
<v 0>women,
which is in itself quite notable.</v>

64
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:25.090
And then wrinkled time she plays Meg's mother.
Wonderful.
Wonderful.

65
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:28.810
Makes mother.
So why don't we sit down ladies and start?
Uh,

66
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.400
I was able to see a wrinkle in time this week and it's a magical visually and

67
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:38.401
chanting movie about a young girl who travels across a time space dimension to

68
00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:44.110
save her father,
a physicist from dark forces in the universe.

69
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.330
Now,
what really struck me in the movie,

70
00:04:46.331 --> 00:04:51.100
it was how central women are to the entire storyline make.

71
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:53.620
Marie is not a damsel in distress.

72
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.980
She has a young woman on a mission to find her father,

73
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.360
and she was aided in her quest by kind boys and men and by mystical,

74
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.240
magical,
powerful women.
So congratulations ladies on a great achievement.

75
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.460
<v 3>Ava.
No,
I understand that</v>

76
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.300
<v 0>you weren't expecting and might have been surprised to receive a call from</v>

77
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:20.301
Disney to direct this film and you hadn't read Madeline angles a novel before,

78
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.370
uh,
being offered this project.

79
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.210
What was it about the script and the project that really appealed to you?

80
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.130
Thank you all for being here.

81
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.310
<v 3>I want to say about,</v>

82
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.960
<v 4>um,
um,
the women in the book,
uh,</v>

83
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.390
and in our film is that,
uh,
Google and Botha.

84
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.040
Raul does not play just her mother.
She's an astrophysics astrophysicist.

85
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:46.330
She's doctor Kate Marie,

86
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.030
which is really important because we want to make sure that,

87
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:52.810
that we know that girls can participate in stem,
that's important than medicine,

88
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:55.630
education,
math,
science,
all that good stuff.

89
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.970
So we want to make sure we point that out.
Um,

90
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.290
don't ask her to do any math problems,
so you're on this page,
but,

91
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.190
but she does them in the movie.
Um,
but yeah,

92
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:08.000
it was really cool to get a call from Disney because sometimes in Hollywood,

93
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.120
Hollywood likes you to ask for permission.

94
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.750
Just like a lot of people in life want girls and women to ask for permission to

95
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:19.600
do things.
Um,
they want us to,
uh,
sometimes,
um,

96
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.410
uh,
uh,
pitch ourselves and,
and,
and,

97
00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:27.860
and sometimes to prove that you're worth doing something.

98
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.680
And so we find that a lot of places in life,
but now,

99
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:34.310
and then you get a beautiful experience when people welcome you in and they love

100
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.670
you just the way you are.
And that's what happened to me at Disney.

101
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:40.190
They called me and they said,
we love your work.

102
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.970
We love your voice and we want you to just come in and be who you are.

103
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.250
And those are the kinds of experiences you want to embrace.

104
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.340
Those are the kinds of people you want to align yourself with.
And that's a,

105
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:51.890
those are the kinds of people that we were able to make a wrinkle in time with

106
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:54.080
our Disney as a remarkable story.

107
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:58.670
You did not pick up a camera to direct until you were 33.
No,
that's old.

108
00:06:58.671 --> 00:06:59.504
We'll all the kids.

109
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.180
<v 0>No,
that's old.
That's very young.
Actually.</v>

110
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.310
<v 4>Older four,
um,
four directors.
Cause most directors start 20,</v>

111
00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:12.160
21,
uh,
in their early twenties.
So,
so to start in your,
in your thirties,

112
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.840
um,
it's,
it's a,
it's a,
it's unusual.

113
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.520
So what advice would you give women and particularly young girls about following

114
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:22.670
their dreams,
their tropisms and having courage?

115
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.290
It's really just what you're doing now does not have to be what you always do.

116
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.970
Who you are right now is not who you are always going to be and just know that

117
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:35.990
there are steps to take.
There are other paths to follow to explore,

118
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.560
but don't feel stuck in one place.
Embrace where you are now.

119
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:40.610
Learn what you can from it,

120
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:44.120
but also stay open to the fact that there are other things that you can do.

121
00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:48.560
A lot of people talk about me and my journey in terms of race and gender,

122
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.610
but part of my story is also age because in the industry that I'm in,

123
00:07:52.611 --> 00:07:56.870
I got to start quite late and it's just proof that nothing is impossible.

124
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.420
Nothing is impossible,
ladies and gentlemen.
Okay.
Oprah,
the character you play,

125
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:06.500
Mrs,
which is the wisest woman in the universe.

126
00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:11.280
And as Ava said in casting you,
she picked the wisest woman in Rio.

127
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.183
<v 2>Wow.</v>

128
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:21.090
<v 0>When you see them,
when you see the movie,
it's fantastic.
Gorgol and their times.</v>

129
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.020
We'll get to you in a moment.

130
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.943
<v 2>Yay.</v>

131
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:38.091
<v 0>Hello.</v>

132
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:42.950
Ms. Watson just came from the United Nations where she was representing women

133
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:46.430
are for International Women's Day,
so thank you Reese for being here.

134
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.430
We were just in the middle of talking about the remarkable character,
Mrs,

135
00:08:54.431 --> 00:08:56.010
which,
uh,
that Oprah

136
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.860
<v 5>plays and this larger than life figure who,
uh,</v>

137
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.560
guides meg through the universe and it gives her courage.

138
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.240
Tell me what it is about this role that appeal to you.

139
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.990
<v 6>Well,
I have to say,
well first of all,</v>

140
00:09:11.991 --> 00:09:16.340
let me just say that one of the reasons this role happened to me is because I am

141
00:09:16.341 --> 00:09:17.960
a friend of Ava.
Do An,

142
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:23.110
I do not use that term lightly because over the years I have chosen my friend

143
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.400
carefully.
And um,
I have had,
uh,

144
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.990
a best friend,
Gail,

145
00:09:29.991 --> 00:09:34.130
who's been my best friend since we were 21 and 22.

146
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.920
I actively sought another friend

147
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.350
because Gail is busy a lot.
And uh,

148
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.030
I actively sought in another friend.

149
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:50.031
So someone had shown me a DVD of Eva's work for another movie called the middle

150
00:09:50.901 --> 00:09:55.400
of nowhere.
And when I,
I liked the movie and then I went and looked up,

151
00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.090
googled her,
I googled her,
hello,
go,
go.
I go though.

152
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.630
<v 3>And there</v>

153
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.210
<v 6>I saw this,
this,
the,
the,
the,</v>

154
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.710
this essence of someone who I wanted to be my friend.
First of all,

155
00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:16.240
she was a girl with glasses.
She looked like me and I thought,
Gee,

156
00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:17.080
I want to be a friend.

157
00:10:17.081 --> 00:10:21.970
So I actively sought to create an event so that she could come to my house.

158
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.920
And then so she went,
so,
so,
so that she would be my friend.
So,

159
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.930
uh,
that worked.
And then I,
as a friend,

160
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.100
I,
I w when you have a friend that you love and you care about,

161
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.040
you want to do everything you can to support your friends.

162
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.570
That's the kind of friend you want.

163
00:10:40.571 --> 00:10:45.571
You want a friend that wants for you as much as you want something,

164
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.800
they want it even more.

165
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:53.050
So I wanted to support my friend in doing this film.
So I said,

166
00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:54.730
I'm gonna come to New Zealand,
girl,

167
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.780
I'm a watch you work and say,
action.
I just want to,

168
00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.730
I just want to be there when you tell all those people action and cut.

169
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.480
And so she said,
oh.
And I kept saying it.
I'm coming to New Zealand girl,

170
00:11:07.481 --> 00:11:10.660
I'm coming to New Zealand.
And she said,
if you're really going to do that,

171
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.510
would you uh,

172
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.810
consider reading this part?
And I said,

173
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.680
yeah girl,
I'll do that.
So that's how,

174
00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:24.100
that's actually how it happened because I was seeking her as a friend.

175
00:11:24.101 --> 00:11:28.450
I saw something in her essence that has turned out to be even more profound.

176
00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:33.540
So then I read this role and it's like everything I could imagine for myself.

177
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.880
So I had a wonderful mother friend,
teacher,

178
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.610
Mentor named Maya Angelo.
Do you know who that is?

179
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.950
So I read her book when I was about your age and then I ended up being her,

180
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:51.840
becoming her daughter,
like,
and so she was my spiritual guide,

181
00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:55.210
mentor teacher.
And I model this character Mrs,

182
00:11:55.211 --> 00:12:00.211
which from Maya Angelou and from the wizard of Oz Glinda,

183
00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:04.870
the good witch.
So when Glenda,
the good witch says you've always had the power,

184
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:06.470
I think that's one of the greatest teaching.

185
00:12:06.471 --> 00:12:10.330
So to be able to have Maya Angelou and Glinda the good witch,

186
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.180
and then a bit of my own self in there.

187
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.150
Because in the very beginning when she,
when Mrs,

188
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:21.151
which first shows up at the beginning of the film and she says to May egg,

189
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.970
all you have to do is find the right frequency and have faith and who you are.

190
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.930
That is my true philosophy for how you live your life.

191
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.800
And if I had any advice to give to you all today,
that is it.

192
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.510
It starts at the beginning of the movie.

193
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:44.100
All you have to do is find the right frequency because everybody has their own

194
00:12:45.071 --> 00:12:50.050
frequency.
That is just yours.
And when you can ride that frequency,

195
00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:55.051
find the flow that is for you and have faith in that unimaginable things become

196
00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:57.004
possible for you.

197
00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.070
So that's why I love the movie for that message and for my friend

198
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.670
<v 5>Ava.
Beautiful message.
And it's a beautiful lesson for us here today.</v>

199
00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:08.230
And I think Reese,
welcome.
You have found your fright frequency lately.

200
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.760
It's remarkable.
You all know Reese Witherspoon,
actress,
director,

201
00:13:12.761 --> 00:13:17.500
entrepreneur,
she has her own production company.

202
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.500
Hello Sunshine,
which really is your frequency,

203
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.350
but you've also be,

204
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:28.090
become really actively involved in a number of women's advocacy organizations.

205
00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:29.950
And for that we thank you.
Um,

206
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.880
I understand you read this book when you were a young girl and how did you feel

207
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:38.881
that Eva's film enhances the story and makes it more relevant to the world that

208
00:13:39.731 --> 00:13:42.430
we're living today and experiencing today?

209
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.760
<v 7>Well,
the book was written quite awhile ago.
I think ava did an extraordinary job.</v>

210
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.460
I read this book when I was 12 and I loved it.

211
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.970
And I think primarily because I love science fiction and I hadn't read a lot of

212
00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:56.220
books that had a girl at the center of it.

213
00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.090
So I thought I was Meg Murray and I was going to travel through the universe and

214
00:14:00.091 --> 00:14:03.900
do amazing things.
And um,
and I loved all of that.

215
00:14:03.901 --> 00:14:07.920
And then I read every book in the series.
So I was just completely obsessed.
And,

216
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:11.220
um,
so when ava caused me to be in and out,
I was so excited.

217
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:16.430
I didn't know who I would play either because the is are all like billions and

218
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:22.980
billions of years old.
My son said,
we're just wants you to play at all lady.

219
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:29.460
But she of course,
at this beautiful vision of making them timeless,

220
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:30.061
you know,

221
00:14:30.061 --> 00:14:34.950
and Celeste steel and intergalactic and that they had this,

222
00:14:34.951 --> 00:14:38.850
um,
and they have these qualities that are,
uh,
the,

223
00:14:38.851 --> 00:14:42.990
the qualities that you'd want to have three incredible women guide you through

224
00:14:42.991 --> 00:14:47.820
the universe wisdom,
a sense of fun and a sense of past.

225
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.030
And,
um,
I just think it was beautiful the way she imagined it.

226
00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:56.560
<v 5>And do you have one of the most beautiful transformations from a somewhat human</v>

227
00:14:56.561 --> 00:15:01.561
form into this mystical flying creature that was one of the most exciting scenes

228
00:15:02.291 --> 00:15:03.610
in the movie.

229
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.760
Can we talk a little bit about the special effects and the challenge in creating

230
00:15:09.281 --> 00:15:13.370
a movie like that so heavily relies on technology really to,

231
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.130
to produce these effects?

232
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.850
<v 4>Yeah,
no,
I,
I think,
um,
you know,
it was a beautiful team,
uh,
that,</v>

233
00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:21.150
that worked on the film and that special effects with me,

234
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.400
our visual effects supervisor,
rich McBride,

235
00:15:23.401 --> 00:15:27.000
also great woman over at Disney who heads up special fix their Mimi,

236
00:15:27.001 --> 00:15:28.560
steal another woman.

237
00:15:28.561 --> 00:15:32.280
Tamra cancel a lot of women on our special effects are and our visual effects

238
00:15:32.281 --> 00:15:32.850
team.

239
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:36.210
But I think the actress that was most impacted by the visual effects with storm

240
00:15:36.211 --> 00:15:40.530
Reid,
because I'm storm Reid as meg Murray gets to fly.

241
00:15:40.531 --> 00:15:42.510
And that's one of the reasons why I wanted to make this movie,

242
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.750
to see a girl fly hot planets,
uh,

243
00:15:45.751 --> 00:15:48.690
save the world from the darkness and do all these amazing things.
So,

244
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.870
but storm actually,
you know,
put her in a harness,

245
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.140
hiked her up in the air and she had to fly through the air was,
it was,

246
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.560
it looked like it was fun.
It was fine.
Yeah.

247
00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:59.840
<v 5>And it was believable.
You did it.</v>

248
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:00.450
<v 7>Thank you.</v>

249
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:05.450
You could bleed some challenges and it was a learning curve with the stunts and

250
00:16:05.551 --> 00:16:09.510
the special effects and green screen all working together.
Um,

251
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:10.980
and it was a challenge,

252
00:16:10.981 --> 00:16:14.560
but Miss Ava was right there in my corner and helping me and showing me
previous,

253
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.690
which is basically the animation of a what's going to be in the film.

254
00:16:18.691 --> 00:16:22.740
So she helped a lot and it was still hard because you have to kind of,

255
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:27.390
you have to imagine the unimaginable,
which is really hard.
But it came together.

256
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.380
<v 4>So there was one scene,
don't rat me out.</v>

257
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.100
She did a really good job and you'll see it in the movie.

258
00:16:35.101 --> 00:16:39.960
But there was one scene where I said,
okay,
storm
here in this place,

259
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.560
you're standing here in a field,
a tree is going to pop up,

260
00:16:43.561 --> 00:16:47.430
fully grown from the crown.
And she's like,
okay.
And I said,

261
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:51.180
so can you imagine that?
But she's an actress,
so she's a magic.
She,

262
00:16:51.181 --> 00:16:52.950
she goes through her feelings.

263
00:16:52.951 --> 00:16:56.700
So she's never experienced a tree popping up from the ground believe.

264
00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.270
So she was like,
ah,
so it's going to just pop up like,

265
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.210
like pop up from the ground or on top of the ground.

266
00:17:03.211 --> 00:17:08.211
I said no from the ground storm from the ground up type approach to it.

267
00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:14.270
Um,
but,
um,
but those are the kinds of fantastic spaces that she found herself in.

268
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.760
And when she was 13 year old years old,
she did it.
So when you watch the movie,

269
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.280
imagine this 13 year old actress,

270
00:17:20.281 --> 00:17:23.470
brilliant girl doing all of these amazing things.
Um,

271
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.640
she's a real warrior of our movie.
True.
I love it.

272
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:27.583
<v 2>Store</v>

273
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.860
Megan's a beloved character

274
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.900
<v 5>to and a brave and determined girl,</v>

275
00:17:35.901 --> 00:17:38.090
a physics wiz.
Uh,

276
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:42.500
you've mentioned that you really saw yourself in that character.

277
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.870
What was it about meg?

278
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.800
<v 7>Yes.
Um,
well when I was reading a wrinkle in time in the sixth grade,</v>

279
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:54.360
um,
I,
I didn't see myself as being meg because she wasn't written that way.

280
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.610
And I'm a very visual person.

281
00:17:56.611 --> 00:17:59.720
So if I'm reading something and something is written a way,

282
00:17:59.721 --> 00:18:03.240
then that's how it is and I could love it.
And I did.
Um,

283
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.180
but once I got the script and Miss Eva sent it over to me,

284
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:11.330
I felt like it just all clicked and it made sense and it made sense for a girl

285
00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:14.880
at the center of the universe to be African American,

286
00:18:14.881 --> 00:18:18.420
to represent African American girls.
And just girls in general.

287
00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:21.853
<v 3>Yes.</v>

288
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.670
<v 7>Just represent girls in general.
And then going into meg,
I feel like meg,</v>

289
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.480
everybody can find a little piece of meg in,
in themselves.

290
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:35.400
And I feel like meg is very determined and strong willed and I feel like I'm the

291
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:35.911
same way.

292
00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:40.911
So I feel like personally we kind of are on the same level and I felt like as

293
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:45.180
girls and as just teenagers growing up in this kind of dark world,

294
00:18:45.181 --> 00:18:49.140
we're just trying to grow up and find ourselves and surround ourselves by good

295
00:18:49.141 --> 00:18:53.820
people.
And sometimes we have challenges and mistakes and faults on top of that.

296
00:18:53.821 --> 00:18:56.750
So that's what we're all going through the storm.
We love it.

297
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.830
I think it's important to know too that uh,
eva fought to get this.

298
00:19:01.831 --> 00:19:05.930
Meg,
she fought to get storm.
Would you tell that story?
Oh,

299
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.350
<v 4>where is channeling?
Well,</v>

300
00:19:11.351 --> 00:19:13.990
there were a lot of girls all over the world who auditioned to be meg.

301
00:19:13.991 --> 00:19:17.250
And you're looking for that special girl who,
um,
who,

302
00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.220
who encompasses everything that this beautiful character,
uh,
has,
has,

303
00:19:21.221 --> 00:19:25.990
has symbolized for so many decades since the book was published in 1963.

304
00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.250
And so,
uh,

305
00:19:27.251 --> 00:19:31.080
you looking for the one girl and so out of the hundreds of girls that we saw a

306
00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.270
storm,
Reid was the one who was meant to be meg.

307
00:19:34.271 --> 00:19:38.950
And I think it really speaks to um,
uh,
everyone has their place.

308
00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:44.250
Everyone has somewhere or someplace that they're meant to be someone in the

309
00:19:44.411 --> 00:19:48.070
world that you are meant to be connected with in your family.

310
00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:52.750
Some something that you're supposed to be in your classroom or in your life if

311
00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:57.730
you're an adult.
And um,
and you once,
once you align with that place,
it just,

312
00:19:57.731 --> 00:20:01.000
it just clicks.
And that's what happens.
Storm was in the,

313
00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.940
not just in the right place at the right time,
her whole life.

314
00:20:03.941 --> 00:20:08.941
She was moving towards being in that audition room and being ready to be meg.

315
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:14.020
All of the little steps that brought her to be in the place,
in the time,

316
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.700
in this space to fulfill and be something important to someone else.

317
00:20:18.701 --> 00:20:19.534
And that was me.

318
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:23.410
And so whether you're an actress and it's your time to be in a movie,

319
00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.700
which is a rare thing,

320
00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:29.200
or whether it's your opportunity to be someone important to someone in your
life,

321
00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:29.711
uh,

322
00:20:29.711 --> 00:20:34.711
you have to cultivate yourself each and every day so that when the opportunity

323
00:20:34.931 --> 00:20:39.910
comes to really stand up and step up and be someone important to someone that

324
00:20:39.911 --> 00:20:41.890
you're ready to do that.
And storm did that.

325
00:20:41.891 --> 00:20:44.410
So when it was tired time and I met her,

326
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:48.130
she was ready to be someone important to me to be someone

327
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.080
<v 6>who carries this whole movie.
So I really just,
just,
um,
I think her journey,</v>

328
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.790
uh,
can speak to anyone in terms of prepare every day in your life to be a great

329
00:20:57.791 --> 00:21:01.960
person so that when the moment of greatness arises,
you're ready for it.
Yeah.

330
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:07.440
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

331
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:12.280
<v 5>you play Doctor Kate Marie makes mother and a scientist and an equal partner,</v>

332
00:21:12.281 --> 00:21:16.870
tier wild scientist,
physicist,
husband.
What did that feel like?

333
00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:19.780
And it rumor is that you got to hang out at NASA.
Is that true?

334
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:23.700
<v 8>Uh,
yeah.
Well it was a real honor for me.
I think,
you know,</v>

335
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:28.050
getting to work with ava who I admired for such a long time,

336
00:21:28.051 --> 00:21:29.850
getting to play a scientist as you said,
you know,

337
00:21:29.851 --> 00:21:34.020
in the book she's often described as Mrs. Murray and the idea that we have

338
00:21:34.021 --> 00:21:38.190
doctor Kate that she's not just defined by her marriage,
that she,
you know,

339
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.600
is an equal partner to um,
Dr. Alex Murray played by Chris Pine.

340
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:43.860
And um,

341
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:48.300
for me it was really fascinating to kind of cling on to this idea that he's been

342
00:21:48.301 --> 00:21:49.890
away for four years.
You know,

343
00:21:49.891 --> 00:21:54.240
what this marriage and this family is based on is obviously love,

344
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:59.130
but also this intellectual meeting of minds that she's really found her partner

345
00:21:59.131 --> 00:22:03.450
in life who is,
you know,
we sort of talked about them like this sort of power,

346
00:22:03.451 --> 00:22:04.950
couple of science,
you know,

347
00:22:04.951 --> 00:22:08.670
that they would do these ted talks that they were sort of like this,
this,

348
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.650
I don't know,
that,
that their connection was,

349
00:22:10.651 --> 00:22:14.190
was intellectual and not just love and family.

350
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:18.420
And that's what really kept her going and kept her trying to figure out where he

351
00:22:18.421 --> 00:22:21.150
was,
you know,
in that long time.
So yes,

352
00:22:21.151 --> 00:22:25.140
we did get to go and visit JPL in Pasadena,
which was fascinating.

353
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.460
Getting to meet real,
have you beams.
I go,
yes,

354
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.890
I'm getting to meet real scientists,

355
00:22:31.891 --> 00:22:35.970
people who are really planning missions to Mars.
It was,
it was so interesting.

356
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:41.240
And we also met this wonderful as doctor a Dr. Stephen Alexander who wrote this

357
00:22:42.001 --> 00:22:45.270
book called the Jazz of physics.
Um,
and you know,

358
00:22:45.271 --> 00:22:49.350
he sort of correlated the link between the work of John Coltrane,

359
00:22:49.351 --> 00:22:53.180
the saxophonist and um,
science and physics.
And,

360
00:22:53.181 --> 00:22:57.810
and I mean it was mind blowing to me and I can't pretend that I have retained

361
00:22:57.811 --> 00:23:02.310
all of it.
I'll give you a pop quiz.
But it was great.

362
00:23:02.311 --> 00:23:05.490
And the fact that ava sort of had him as the consultant on the movie to be able

363
00:23:05.491 --> 00:23:07.890
to sort of introduce us to that,
that world of science

364
00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.190
<v 5>prior experience for you all.
And for us all,
you know,</v>

365
00:23:11.191 --> 00:23:15.120
Time magazine notes and it's a review of the movie that the book and the movie

366
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.950
is about what it means to be a source of light in a world in which darkness

367
00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:22.320
seems only to proliferate.
Oprah,

368
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:27.570
you have a beautiful line in the movie about darkness being stronger than like,

369
00:23:27.571 --> 00:23:30.570
can you talk to us a little bit about that because several of you have already

370
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.370
mentioned darkness in the world.
And this was such an inspiring,

371
00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:39.490
<v 6>what I think is incredible is that when Madeline lingual wrote it in 1962,</v>

372
00:23:39.491 --> 00:23:43.320
she was talking about the Cold War and all of the,
um,

373
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:48.560
experiences of that day and um,

374
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:53.300
civil rights movement and everything that was,
was,
uh,
on,
on,
on,

375
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:54.860
you know,
people were facing.

376
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.210
And what I know is that you're never going to run out of darkness as you're not

377
00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:02.240
going to run out of light because this is the planet earth.

378
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.480
And we are the planet of Yin and Yang of darkness and light of opposites.

379
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.490
And so the darkness,

380
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:13.970
which Mrs which says is spreading so fast these days,

381
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.230
the only thing faster than light is the darkness.

382
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:23.500
And so you need warriors of the light to help banish the darkness.

383
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:25.730
If you think about it,

384
00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:30.380
if we turn all the lights off in this room and you were only holding a small

385
00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:31.214
candle,

386
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.060
that candle would light up the darkness and would help to banish the darkness.

387
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:39.380
It only takes a little bit of your light to banish the darkness.

388
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.890
It takes a lot of darkness to over come the light,

389
00:24:42.891 --> 00:24:44.960
but just a little flicker from you.

390
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.440
And so wherever there is confusion,

391
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:53.510
wherever there's jealousy as mrs which talks about and is able to show everyone

392
00:24:53.511 --> 00:24:57.470
in the movie what that darkness looks like,
where it shows up in your life,

393
00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:02.670
just just a little bit of your light helps to dissipate and destroy that.

394
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:08.320
So I think it's about these times and all times are about you reaching for the

395
00:25:08.661 --> 00:25:10.100
light inside yourself.

396
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:15.280
And that's the real work of your life is to figure out who you are and how do

397
00:25:16.371 --> 00:25:20.810
you become more of who you are,

398
00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.550
not what your friends are,

399
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.790
not even what your mother and your father and everybody wants you to be.

400
00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:29.300
But this journey,
particularly at this stage in your development,

401
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:34.510
is about who am I and how do I become more of that and how do I bring more of my

402
00:25:36.141 --> 00:25:40.070
light first to yourself?
Because you've got to give it to yourself first.

403
00:25:40.071 --> 00:25:42.770
You can't give to yourself what you don't have,

404
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.180
so you fill yourself up.
And I used to be so afraid of people saying,
oh,

405
00:25:47.181 --> 00:25:51.950
she's so full of herself.
She's so full of herself and now I work on,

406
00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.300
you've heard that before.

407
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:55.660
<v 3>Okay,</v>

408
00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.540
<v 6>forget those people.
Those,
those,
those people are not your friends.</v>

409
00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:03.780
What you want to work on is filling yourself up with as much light,

410
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.730
as much kindness,
as much goodness,

411
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:10.750
as much preparation because that's what luck is.
Being prepared.

412
00:26:10.751 --> 00:26:12.640
So when the moment of opportunity shows up,

413
00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.790
a lot of people will look at storm and say,
oh,
she's so lucky.

414
00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.870
She's lucky because she was prepared.
Luck is just preparation,

415
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:23.650
meeting that moment of opportunity.
If she wasn't prepared,
she wouldn't be here.

416
00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:28.120
So your job is to fill yourself with as much light.

417
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.390
Light comes from all that is good.
All that is grace,

418
00:26:31.391 --> 00:26:36.391
all that is kindness and then offer that to the world that will be your gift to

419
00:26:37.031 --> 00:26:39.190
the world.
So that's why I love this movie.

420
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:44.090
<v 3>Yes,
I saw
it says all</v>

421
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.500
<v 4>hope and thank you all for [inaudible]</v>

422
00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:50.570
<v 0>being warriors for the light and for goodness.
And now I think we have,</v>

423
00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.670
since we are live streaming on youtube,

424
00:26:52.671 --> 00:26:56.810
we have a few questions for all of you from our global audience.

425
00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.280
So we're going to go to them,

426
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:04.300
<v 9>hey e and explaining it then it was the Muslim [inaudible] and we see later</v>

427
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:08.683
Milo.

428
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:13.720
[inaudible] e [inaudible].

429
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.350
<v 4>Yes.
Well thank you.
Great crushes.</v>

430
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:22.820
Quiet question from Spain of the soundtrack of the movie is beautiful.
Um,

431
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.400
one of the first,
the first artists that,
um,

432
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.620
I put on the soundtrack was storm reads,

433
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:32.480
favorite artists just because I wanted to make her happy,
but also because,
um,

434
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:37.330
because she's a great artist.
Her name is Kelani
but she's on that,

435
00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.070
she's on the bees.
And then one of my favorite artists,

436
00:27:40.071 --> 00:27:43.520
cause I want to make myself happy to Shaw day is

437
00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:49.850
so incredible.
Uh,

Chloe and Halle are on the album,

438
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:54.380
Demi Lavato and DJ Khaled or on the album.
Um,
so it's a really,

439
00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:56.930
really great mix of voices and they kind of,

440
00:27:56.931 --> 00:28:00.980
you put the music with the images and it just uplifts you as you watch the film.

441
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:06.200
<v 0>Wonderful.
Beautiful.
We have a question next from France.
Oh,

442
00:28:06.201 --> 00:28:09.590
Jewel Brazil.
Oh,

443
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:11.260
<v 10>It is you.
You're the</v>

444
00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:19.170
[inaudible].

445
00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.950
Beautiful.
She's implant

446
00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:32.910
Nathan [inaudible] essays.

447
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:37.370
These was contagious

448
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.823
<v 0>bay shore.</v>

449
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:45.290
<v 8>Yeah.
I mean for me,
probably growing up confidence I was,</v>

450
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:46.590
I was relatively confident.

451
00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:49.410
I was an only child so I didn't have many people to play with and stuff like

452
00:28:49.411 --> 00:28:52.380
that.
So for me,
actually acting gave me confidence.

453
00:28:52.381 --> 00:28:56.280
I think being able to find something that I loved.
I loved dancing.

454
00:28:56.281 --> 00:29:00.840
Initially when I was about four or five,
I went to dance class and I just loved,

455
00:29:00.841 --> 00:29:03.330
I feeling free expressing myself with my buddy.

456
00:29:03.331 --> 00:29:07.590
It sort of helped me get rid of my inhibitions and it was so much fun.

457
00:29:07.591 --> 00:29:12.510
I think there's so much play to be had in,
in acting.
So I think it's,
um,
yeah,

458
00:29:12.511 --> 00:29:15.750
finding what you love and,
and just just sticking with that.

459
00:29:15.751 --> 00:29:20.160
And I obviously was lucky enough to make my hobby my job,
but um,
but yeah,

460
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:22.020
it gave me a lot of competence,
acting and dancing.

461
00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.710
<v 0>Beautiful.
Well,
we could talk for another hour,</v>

462
00:29:25.711 --> 00:29:30.570

463
00:29:30.571 --> 00:29:35.250
movie there tomorrow.
I want to thank all of our guests for being here.

464
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:39.770
