Hello everyone.
Welcome to toxic Google.

2
00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:07.610
I'm Kevin Belk and today we welcome the cast and creative team behind Disney's

3
00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:08.450
Zootopia.

4
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.060
<v 0>So first I'd like to welcome Byron Howard,
director</v>

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.360
<v 2>and director of rich more producer Clark Spencer,</v>

6
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.140
<v 0>Jennifer Goodwin,
Katie Lowe's,
Tommy Chong,</v>

7
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.010
and made Torrance our voice.
How are you guys?

8
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.080
<v 2>Welcome guys.
It's a cavalcade of stars.</v>

9
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.650
Welcome to [inaudible].
Thank you.

10
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.500
<v 1>And so thank you guys so much for being here today.
Uh,</v>

11
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.900
obviously we're talking about Disney's latest animated films,
Utopia.

12
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.110
And so Byron and rich,
you guys directed the film.

13
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:52.830
Can you just talk about us about what the story was and,
and the genesis of this

14
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.570
<v 2>shower?
Did it all start it all begin?
Well,
okay.</v>

15
00:00:55.571 --> 00:00:59.950
So five years ago after I finished directing tangled with Nathan Greno,

16
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.530
um,
John asked what I wanted to do next.

17
00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:05.200
And what do you do when you pitch to John Lasseter is he doesn't want you to

18
00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:06.400
just pitch one idea.

19
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.010
You want to get an idea of what your interests are and what you're passionate

20
00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:12.880
about.
So Nathan I think pitched six different ideas.

21
00:01:12.881 --> 00:01:16.000
And one thing that all those six ideas had in common was this idea of

22
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:18.880
anthropomorphic animals,
which are animals that walk up,

23
00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:21.130
right and wear clothes and you cell phones.

24
00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:25.360
And he got so excited about the idea that he literally hugged me and picked me

25
00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:29.670
up off the ground and lifted me into the air.
Like Baby Simba.
He's very strong,

26
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.810
strong man,
a mighty man.

27
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.950
So we knew we had something that John was interested in and cause he grew up on

28
00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:36.601
wind in the willows,

29
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:40.180
which is a film from the forties or 50s and I grew up on Robin Hood and I think

30
00:01:40.181 --> 00:01:44.020
rich,
your first room on the jungle book talk a book.
That's right.
That's right.

31
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:47.200
So we knew we had this great Disney legacy to build on,

32
00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:48.970
but we didn't want him to do something completely new.

33
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:52.600
So we did a year of research including going to Africa.
No kidding.

34
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.190
They sent us to Africa with 15 of our leadership to do research and nearly get

35
00:01:57.191 --> 00:02:01.510
eaten.
Our cinematographer.
Oh Katie.
Shit.
It got,
you have have to go to Africa.

36
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.080
Yeah.
Above these are guys,
but smells.
Yeah.

37
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.540
Our cinematographer got bitten by multiple animals,

38
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.980
including like a zebra and an ostrich.
And it's a cheeto talent by a cheetah.

39
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.230
Yeah.
Well we care about your entertainment.

40
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.290
That's why our lives all the lines to bring you comedy and hearts.

41
00:02:19.481 --> 00:02:20.314
That's right.

42
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.411
<v 1>And so rich,</v>

43
00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:23.180
when did you come onto the project because you were probably on wreck it,

44
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:24.014
Ralph when this started?

45
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.620
<v 2>Um,
yeah,
I was,
wow.
That was five years ago and I was a man.</v>

46
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.880
I'm a member of the story trust at the studio,
uh,
which is,

47
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.640
uh,
all our colleagues,
the directors,

48
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.560
a writers and heads of story.
And uh,
we help each other with the,

49
00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:45.320
with our films.
Um,
we're there to support,
uh,
the other director,
uh,

50
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.610
the other directors.
And uh,

51
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.480
I had been kind of following this one and there's some that you follow more

52
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:53.410
intimately than,
than others.
And,

53
00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:56.190
and I had been following this one from the beginning.
Early part.
Yeah.

54
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.980
Back when it was a spy movie.
That's where the story,
it was a spy movie when

55
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.300
<v 3>we started and we know,</v>

56
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.410
<v 4>okay.
And so,
so I'd been kind of with this one from the beginning as,</v>

57
00:03:06.411 --> 00:03:09.890
as a support,
you know,
system,
part of the support system.

58
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.620
And there was a moment about a year and a half ago as,

59
00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:18.410
as these movies always have like a bump in the road,
you know,
and uh,

60
00:03:18.411 --> 00:03:23.090
this one was a pretty big one where we wanted to try switching the main

61
00:03:23.091 --> 00:03:27.620
characters are the protagonist because for the longest time,
uh,
nick,

62
00:03:27.621 --> 00:03:28.670
the Fox character,

63
00:03:28.671 --> 00:03:33.060
Jason Bateman's character was the protagonist who's the main character.
Uh,

64
00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:36.800
and the story was just not coming together,
um,

65
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.970
in that way.
So we said,
why don't we try flipping,
you know,

66
00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:43.100
Judy and nick and inlet,
uh,

67
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.030
Judy be kind of our eyes and ears coming into this new world.

68
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.170
And Lo and behold,
the story just kind of laid out,
you know,

69
00:03:51.171 --> 00:03:55.430
at our feet and we're like,
oh great.
You know,
we,
we figured it out,
but oh great.

70
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.460
Now we have to make all these changes,
you know,

71
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:01.750
and we only have about a year and a half to get this thing finished.
So,
uh,

72
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.500
it was obvious it was a two person job.
Uh,
and John Lasseter said,
could you jump,

73
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.220
you know,
the,
you know the movie pretty well.
Could you jump on with Byron,

74
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.410
you know,
and,
and see it through to the end.

75
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.410
<v 3>Clark,
does this freak you out as producer when they say,</v>

76
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.790
let's just start over and flip the story around you.
You know,

77
00:04:19.791 --> 00:04:20.780
it's interesting the,

78
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.720
you realize the most important thing is telling a great story.

79
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.720
And so definitely in that moment you think to yourself,

80
00:04:26.721 --> 00:04:28.550
are we really going to be able to turn this around?

81
00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:30.980
But what we try to do when we do it a lot in animations,

82
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.530
we very quickly make a new version of that film.

83
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.710
And I always feel like we have the other version sitting on a shelf over here.

84
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.190
Let's go experiment because we need to know for sure whether this was the right

85
00:04:40.191 --> 00:04:42.890
idea or not.
And when we did it and we turned it around in about six weeks,

86
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.320
you could just see this was the right way to go.

87
00:04:45.321 --> 00:04:48.170
You really fell in love with Jennifer's character right away.

88
00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:50.840
You were rooting for that character,
which is the thing we were struggling with,

89
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.880
with Nick's character.
Cause he's a cynical kind of a character.

90
00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:57.410
It was really easy to get on to Judy side and it just felt like it was right

91
00:04:57.411 --> 00:05:00.410
thing.
So at that moment in time,
you just start working with the team.

92
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.190
How do you please,
can we do it this way?
Please?

93
00:05:04.191 --> 00:05:08.960
Can we have some money in just a few more million?
That's going to be so good.

94
00:05:08.961 --> 00:05:12.980
Just a little mini likes it.
Nate's on board.

95
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.360
Well,
in your wonderful voice cast here.
So,
uh,
Jennifer,
we'll start with you.

96
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.350
Describe your character,
Judy Hopps uh,
is a bunny.
Yes.

97
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.780
And so when were you pulled into it and describe your character?

98
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.830
<v 5>Um,
when,
when I'm always,
I pulled into,
I was pulled into it,
uh,
to,
uh,</v>

99
00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:34.760
I mean it didn't take much pulling.
Yeah.
Cause you're a huge,

100
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.700
you're a huge Disney fan,
right?
It isn't a file.
Yes.
Um,

101
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.890
I mean d by The way,
this is a true story of my getting cast.

102
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.970
I was in Mickey Mouse Pajamas and I was pregnant with my first and it was in my

103
00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:51.110
kitchen and I had a message from all of my agents,

104
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.730
including my voice over agent.

105
00:05:52.731 --> 00:05:55.970
And I thought I was being fired from a different job

106
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.930
cause I just assumed and I'm not actually,
I'm actually a really like,
you know,

107
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.080
fiercely optimistic person,
like the character Judy hops.

108
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:07.160
But I was just sure that,

109
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:10.220
why would everyone call me at once unless they were trying to like soften the

110
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:14.750
blow.
And so I,
and my Mickey Mouse Pajamas,
I turned to my husband and I said,
oh,

111
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:19.100
I'm getting fired from this other job.
And he said,
or I swear this happened.

112
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:19.311
He goes,

113
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:21.650
or Disney's calling to offer you the lead in their next day and made a future.

114
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:22.940
And I was like,
that's mean,

115
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.250
<v 6>why don't you had to be like,
I'm obviously</v>

116
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.520
<v 5>you getting fired and I need support and Kleenex.</v>

117
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.480
And so I picked up the phone and I think goodness got everyone on the phone at

118
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:34.820
once and they said,
Disney's calling to offer you.

119
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:39.170
And I lost it for obviously positive reasons.
And I said,
I'll take it.

120
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:41.150
And they're like,
don't you want to know what the job is?
And I was like,
no,

121
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:42.440
I want this to be legally binding.

122
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:46.790
So just call them and say I'm in and then you can call me back and tell me what

123
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:49.940
it is.
Um,
so yeah,
cause it's a dream come true.

124
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.990
And I didn't stop crying for like a day,
but um,
that was like,
I mean,

125
00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:55.220
I was pregnant with my first kid,

126
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:58.440
so that was like two and a half years ago with this wild.
Yeah.

127
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.010
And uh,
the character,

128
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:04.430
Judy hops is a bunny on the police force of Utb.

129
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.170
She's the first Benny she's bought,
been brought in by a,
um,

130
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.570
an integrative mammal initiative.
And uh,
she,
she,

131
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.680
she takes her job seriously.
She does not take herself seriously,
but she is,

132
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.070
she's a bit self righteous,
which I appreciate about her.
She's,
like I said,

133
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:21.070
she's fiercely optimistic.
She's idealistic.

134
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.510
She believes anyone can be anything that like,

135
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.970
like my dream was to be in a Disney and made a feature.

136
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:30.590
Hers was to be a bunny cop and a and a on a forceful of predators.

137
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:31.461
And uh,

138
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:36.140
she moves to Zootopia from the outskirts called bunny borough.

139
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.700
And uh,
she is faced with the reality that not everyone,

140
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.540
not only does everyone not live in the peace and harmony,

141
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:47.660
she assumed Zootopia was,
uh,
but,

142
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.660
but not everyone is even really looking to.
Okay.

143
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.660
<v 6>And were you excited when they start,
when they decide to switch to the main,</v>

144
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.060
when they said you are now going to be the star of the movie?

145
00:07:57.061 --> 00:08:01.780
I Wa I wasn't upset about it.
Did you call Jason Up?

146
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.290
But I did know but I did win.

147
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.810
<v 5>I don't think I told you guys this,
but when they did tell me,</v>

148
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:06.620
cause there was a for,

149
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.790
they came up to Vancouver where I shoot a series once upon a time and um,

150
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.820
when I couldn't come down to La to record these guys and a couple others were

151
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:17.530
always very generous,

152
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.110
would come visit me in Canada and we've required up there and there was a day we

153
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.170
were like standing in the lobby going in and I asked how screening was going and

154
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:26.840
one of you said like,
oh no one told you.
And I was like,

155
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:30.560
told me what they were like we rewrote the movie and like you've got some more

156
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:31.340
work to do.

157
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.120
And I had to like not jump up and down cause like who doesn't want to be told?

158
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:35.450
Like,

159
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.730
cause I was having the time of my life like you're going to do this a whole lot

160
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:42.350
more.
And um,
I,
but I actually called my represent,
I called my agents to be like,

161
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.930
you call,
make sure that they weren't tasting.

162
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.960
<v 6>It's like,
do I get a raise</v>

163
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.490
illegally by binding?
Yeah.
And then Katie,

164
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.290
he was what I found amazing,
which I didn't know was the extra.

165
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:02.780
You've been in a lot of Disney movies,
like hero six,
record Ralph frozen feet.

166
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.940
And so now you play doctor honeybadger.
Yes.
Right.
Yes.

167
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.230
<v 7>I um,</v>

168
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.740
I was brought into the Disney family a while ago before scandal.

169
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.250
My husband,

170
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.920
it's take your husband to work day today because we're at Google and my

171
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:20.340
husband's so pumped about it.
Hi Adam.

172
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.350
And so about maybe like seven or eight years ago,
I'm,

173
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:28.440
I'm a waitress.
I'm a babysitter,
I'm a caterer.
I'm all these jobs.

174
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:31.560
And my friend worked at Disney and she asked if my husband and I would like to

175
00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:35.490
come into Disney once a week and just do improv games that we would play in

176
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:38.400
acting school for a bunch of different animators at Disney.

177
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.080
And we did that for about two years and we kind of got into the Disney family,

178
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:46.420
thank God through that.
And um,

179
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.420
slowly but surely I was able to meet Clark and rich and Byron and um,

180
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.970
and you know,
a lot of different people.

181
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:58.971
And that's how I ended up auditioning and working and getting apart in a frozen,

182
00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:02.250
another part in wreck it Ralph and then this part in Zootopia.

183
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.940
And so I feel really lucky because it's like the best,

184
00:10:05.941 --> 00:10:10.770
coolest family plays to work like ever.
So um,
that's,

185
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:11.913
<v 6>yeah,</v>

186
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.590
<v 4>amazing because she's with this like very early on when we're developing</v>

187
00:10:17.591 --> 00:10:22.270
characters and she'll do,
she'll do scratch dialog for,

188
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.910
for lots of different characters.

189
00:10:24.911 --> 00:10:29.230
And because to have like these guys in all the time,
I mean we would,

190
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.660
we would burn out or actors if,

191
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:36.620
if they're in there for every line that they need to deliver as we're making the

192
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.870
movie.
And Katie's really,
really great at helping us develop the characters.

193
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.580
<v 6>You forget I take,
they also wasn't I was I at the first table read for this.</v>

194
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.910
Wait,
no you were yeah,
no,
you were known,
right.

195
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.020
<v 4>Nate and Katie,
I think you guys are the ones in the cast.</v>

196
00:10:53.021 --> 00:10:55.330
You really stuck from the very well cause we do table reads.

197
00:10:55.331 --> 00:10:58.780
Once we have a first draft of the script that everyone feels pretty comfortable

198
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.980
about,
we'll sit down and we'll hire,
hire real actors,
real talented actors,

199
00:11:02.981 --> 00:11:05.350
not just us to come in and read the script through.

200
00:11:05.351 --> 00:11:08.290
And the hope with that is that you're going to discover a couple people who

201
00:11:08.291 --> 00:11:12.670
actually stick.
And these guys,
a Nate was there as claw houser and he definitely,

202
00:11:12.671 --> 00:11:16.690
definitely stuck in a big way.
We loved him.
And then Katie,
it was amazing.
And so,

203
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.690
and that's,
that's the way,
even with what you did with Ralph was that you had,

204
00:11:19.691 --> 00:11:24.260
I think you had a,
uh,
Sarah didn't you?
Did Ya?
Yeah.
Sarah and John and,
and uh,

205
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.200
Jack and Jane,
they were all there.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
it's,
it's a great,

206
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:29.560
you know,

207
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.480
first opportunity to hear the voices of the characters to field.

208
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.270
I'm kind of coming to life off the page.
Um,
I consider it like a,

209
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.410
we talk about screenings that we do,
uh,
with the films.

210
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.160
I consider like the table read like a first screening almost,
you know,

211
00:11:45.161 --> 00:11:48.370
just without the pictures.
And John and ed can tell too,
like our,
our bosses,

212
00:11:48.371 --> 00:11:49.440
they were like when they heard her,

213
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.000
<v 6>oh my God,
you got to keep that guy.
Oh,
he's so funny.
And they're,</v>

214
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.190
is he the guy in the Volkswagen

215
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.521
<v 2>commercial?</v>

216
00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:57.010
Do you remember his Volkswagen commercial where he takes a test drive and he

217
00:11:57.011 --> 00:12:00.610
starts laughing like crazy because when I first heard about Nate,
Jamie,

218
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:01.540
our casting director said,

219
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.950
you know who'd be great for Hauser is did you ever seen that Volkswagen course

220
00:12:04.951 --> 00:12:08.080
where that guy just last the ass.
I wasn't like,
Oh my God,

221
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:11.560
you've got to get that guy.
And so we can get him.
I know that's the thing.

222
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.160
Like we made all our,
we make our lists for these,
uh,

223
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:17.770
these characters who make our top picks for,

224
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:21.070
we go through actors and actresses and we look and we kind of make our wishlist

225
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:22.840
like a Christmas list for directors.

226
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:25.120
And the weird thing is that we got all our top picks on this movie.

227
00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:28.930
So when we were at the Hollywood premiere like two weeks ago and saw these guys

228
00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:30.340
assembled as a group,

229
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:35.140
that was surreal for us because it is such a powerhouse acting troupe.
It's just,

230
00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:37.990
it's amazing.
Well then we'll go into Nate and then come back to you Italian.

231
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.450
But Nate,
I mean your character's awesome.

232
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.513
<v 8>Oh</v>

233
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:44.760
<v 2>he is a cheetah.</v>

234
00:12:44.761 --> 00:12:48.330
And just tell us about the character and his obsession with she cures.

235
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:52.820
<v 8>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I play officer call Hauser who ends up,</v>

236
00:12:52.821 --> 00:12:53.980
I'm a,
I'm the

237
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:58.230
<v 9>receptionist in the ZPD,
which is where Judy hops is,</v>

238
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.540
is going to,
you know,
start work.

239
00:13:00.541 --> 00:13:04.350
So I kind of become one of maybe her first friends.
The funny,
the crazy thing is,

240
00:13:04.351 --> 00:13:05.550
is in the first table reads,

241
00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:09.570
I was one of Nick's best friends and then that happened.

242
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.260
That's what's always so crazy to watch the story,
you know,
change.
But yeah,

243
00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.760
so I get to be her biggest fan.
And then also Gizelle's biggest finch,

244
00:13:17.761 --> 00:13:18.710
Kira Shay.

245
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.560
<v 8>That's what's kind of funny.
I remember,
I remember</v>

246
00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.860
<v 9>like that was always like in the storyline that was obsessed with this pop</v>

247
00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.850
princess.
And it was so fun to be on.

248
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.060
<v 8>I wonder who it's going to be.
It wasn't going to be good.</v>

249
00:13:29.061 --> 00:13:33.360
They're going to get though.
I have lucky with Shakira.
I'll say it again.

250
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.550
What was it like meeting her at the premiere?
Did you hear what I did?
Oh,

251
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.010
hi.
Clouser Nate literally did that.

252
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.440
I introduced myself as Clauser.
Yeah,
Nice.

253
00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.310
<v 2>Tommy,</v>

254
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:58.310
you play a JAKKS and so tell your character is ridiculous.

255
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.400
And I love it.
I love it so much.

256
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.370
<v 10>It was kind of weird,
you know,
when the,
uh,</v>

257
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.610
I got asked to be in a Disney movie.

258
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:09.913
<v 8>Yes.</v>

259
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.200
<v 10>And then I didn't have to guess what kind of character I'd be playing</v>

260
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.490
and noted for one.
And uh,
he cracked me up.

261
00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.550
But the thing is with Disney and

262
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:43.620
I got offered a role in lion king and I turned it down.

263
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:50.490
I got kicked out a Disney park
and obscene tee shirt.

264
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.200
<v 0>All is forgiven,
right?
Well,
it's a new generation</v>

265
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.650
without dope,
you know,

266
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.260
<v 1>can,
you can,
uh,
rich and Byron,
there's no segue.</v>

267
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.340
<v 0>A rich and Byron.
Uh,</v>

268
00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.530
can you talk about just the casting of these guys and finding

269
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.540
<v 1>Jennifer and was it all,
we have this crazy idea,
let's do this,</v>

270
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:19.460
or you heard that voice all,
let's write a character for that?

271
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.040
<v 4>Well,
it's,
we,
we really worked from archetypes.</v>

272
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:28.970
When we look at the,
our,
our cast,
you know,
we or our characters,
you know,

273
00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:32.960
we needed a fiercely determined bunny,
you know,

274
00:15:32.961 --> 00:15:36.080
and a sly,
charming Fox,
you know,

275
00:15:36.081 --> 00:15:40.460
and they have to kind of work beyond the opposite ends of the scale.
Um,

276
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:45.490
and the way that Byron and I like to work is just putting up like photos of

277
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:51.140
people or characters or images of,
of characters like that,

278
00:15:51.141 --> 00:15:54.470
like comparable,
you know,
people and,

279
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:59.240
and actors will just kind of bubble out of those photos,

280
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.680
you know.
And like Byron said,
uh,

281
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.730
Jennifer and Jason were our first picks,
you know,
for,
for Nick and Judy,
you know,

282
00:16:07.731 --> 00:16:11.520
and,
and we look for not just the quality of voice or,

283
00:16:11.521 --> 00:16:14.720
or how they sound or,
uh,
how they deliver lines,

284
00:16:14.721 --> 00:16:18.140
but it's the chemistry between them.
And that's,

285
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.080
that's why we also will record together.
And when we can.

286
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.920
<v 2>Yeah.
And it's,
I think it's really tough.</v>

287
00:16:22.921 --> 00:16:24.990
I think these guys don't get enough appreciation.

288
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:29.460
People who do voice acting because a lot of actors and actresses can't do it

289
00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:33.530
because I mean it's,
it's one thing to be photogenic and you know,

290
00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.850
kind of a nice on camera,

291
00:16:35.851 --> 00:16:39.750
but when you're in a room by yourself and we're asking you to emote or make

292
00:16:39.751 --> 00:16:41.130
someone laugh or cry,

293
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.060
Jennifer as this crazy scene in the film where she breaks down and it's very

294
00:16:45.061 --> 00:16:48.690
genuine and not everyone can muster that emotion.
And so,

295
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:53.670
and it's even to be funny like Nate and uh,
Tommy and Katie,
I just,

296
00:16:53.671 --> 00:16:55.230
there's something about that.

297
00:16:55.231 --> 00:16:58.620
There's an extra layer of talent that don't think people appreciate cause we do,

298
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.490
we listen to a lot of people honestly for like for a Rapunzel for example,

299
00:17:02.491 --> 00:17:06.900
we listened to 300 actresses for Rapunzel's role and 150 for Flynn.

300
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.240
And this,
this day,

301
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.250
this film is a little different because we kind of knew who we wanted to go

302
00:17:11.251 --> 00:17:13.410
after.
And so we kind of made the,
that sort of wishlist.

303
00:17:13.411 --> 00:17:18.090
But it's incredible to see like how many people out there just to kind of lack

304
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.560
what these guys have in in spades.
Is it system?
It's an amazing,

305
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:22.030
<v 1>right.</v>

306
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.370
And can we talk about the environments because the environments are incredible

307
00:17:24.371 --> 00:17:24.680
and collect.

308
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.810
Can I bring you into this in terms of w w you probably regulated that cause it's

309
00:17:28.811 --> 00:17:29.290
insane.

310
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.560
I think the world's just keep getting bigger and bigger with Disney when you had

311
00:17:32.561 --> 00:17:35.370
it,
you know,
you see big hero six and year flying over,
you know,

312
00:17:35.371 --> 00:17:38.650
a San Francisco Kyo and it's just,
it's beautiful and amazing.
And I was like,

313
00:17:38.651 --> 00:17:41.820
oh my gosh.
And you see frozen than with the frozen world and everything with,

314
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:46.120
with the snow.
And then with this,
I mean you have Sahara Square,
Tundra town,

315
00:17:46.121 --> 00:17:50.040
rainforest district,
little area and bunny burrow.
So can you just talk

316
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.450
<v 2>about dealing with that since it,
a lot of environment,
that cost difference.</v>

317
00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.980
<v 3>There were a lot of production people gritting their teeth,
you know,</v>

318
00:17:57.981 --> 00:18:00.110
and they heard about this world,
you know,
it's always hard,

319
00:18:00.111 --> 00:18:02.870
but we start with the world.
It's interesting.
Jon laster always says,

320
00:18:02.871 --> 00:18:05.270
you got to take the audience to place.
I'd never been before.

321
00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.240
So even sometimes before we think too deeply about story,

322
00:18:08.241 --> 00:18:12.650
we think about the world and I think early on Byron and Jared and rich were

323
00:18:12.651 --> 00:18:15.920
really thinking about how do we do a movie like a talking animal movie,

324
00:18:15.921 --> 00:18:16.970
like no one's seen before.

325
00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:20.090
And they came up with this idea that the animal should all live and their

326
00:18:20.091 --> 00:18:22.940
different districts like the cold weather animals live in Tundra town in the hot

327
00:18:22.941 --> 00:18:24.560
weather down in most live in Sahara Square.

328
00:18:24.561 --> 00:18:26.790
And the mice characters live in little retention.

329
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:30.750
And you started to see what a great world you were building.
Um,

330
00:18:30.751 --> 00:18:33.480
so even though that meant it was going to be huge from that standpoint,

331
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.100
you realize again,
you're really going to support the story in an important way.

332
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.860
And then of course all those characters are going to come together into the

333
00:18:39.861 --> 00:18:41.180
downtown part of Zootopia.

334
00:18:41.181 --> 00:18:44.630
And it really came from research being in Africa and looking at the fact that

335
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.320
there's a watering hole where all the animals come to every day and around that

336
00:18:48.321 --> 00:18:49.154
watering hole.

337
00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:54.170
All of them get along drafts are there with hippos and rhinos and lions and then

338
00:18:54.171 --> 00:18:57.110
they go back to their respective areas,
uh,
after they drink from the water.

339
00:18:57.111 --> 00:19:01.400
And that kind of gave us the idea for the city.
So it is daunting in some ways,

340
00:19:01.401 --> 00:19:03.830
but I think just like working with rich on wreck it Ralph,

341
00:19:03.831 --> 00:19:06.500
it's we have to take the audience to place had never been before.

342
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.640
We have to create something that makes what we're doing in animation and,

343
00:19:10.641 --> 00:19:13.910
and the use of the computers be used to their full capacity.

344
00:19:13.911 --> 00:19:17.150
And I think that's where it's really great to see what the animation community

345
00:19:17.151 --> 00:19:17.984
is doing today.

346
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.930
<v 2>And they were there even a worlds within the movie that we couldn't include</v>

347
00:19:21.931 --> 00:19:26.460
because it's a 90 minute films so we can only fit so much of the world into what

348
00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:28.860
we're showing you guys.
Cause there were districts that we actually cut out.

349
00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:30.000
We had outback island,

350
00:19:30.001 --> 00:19:33.180
which was an Australian district full of weird animals with pouches and you were

351
00:19:33.181 --> 00:19:36.750
saying it's a good pickpocket joke.
Things like that would have been great.

352
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.090
Maybe next time it would have been fun.
And funny.
And then,
uh,

353
00:19:39.091 --> 00:19:42.840
we always talked about a nocturnal district under the city in caves and caverns.

354
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:46.860
Wouldn't it be cool,
right?
Oh,
well there was no room,
right?

355
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.590
Say we gotta do we gotta do another one?
So,
but it's this,
there's the,

356
00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:54.150
honestly the world is so big and the characters are so fun and compelling.

357
00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:57.660
We could have gone any one of a hundred directions and had a really fun story.

358
00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.830
And it's,
it's just like when you pitch these movies at,
uh,
at work where we work,

359
00:20:01.831 --> 00:20:05.580
we work with about 800 people altogether on these films over a period of four or

360
00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:08.080
five years.
And when you see a,

361
00:20:08.081 --> 00:20:11.340
an idea start to light up and when you get the sort of the balance right and

362
00:20:11.341 --> 00:20:13.950
people start to come up with ideas on their own,
they start to pitch you ideas.

363
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.240
That's when we really know that we have something that's going to work because

364
00:20:18.241 --> 00:20:20.520
that's what the audience is going to do.
They're going to look at that and go,
oh,

365
00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:22.550
wouldn't it be great?
And we see it on,
uh,

366
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.720
Twitter and Google and Facebook all the time.

367
00:20:24.721 --> 00:20:26.790
Like with people kind of throwing in like,

368
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:30.530
did you guys ever think of this like fan art that comes in share with us.

369
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.190
It's so great.
It's amazing.

370
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.250
<v 3>That's how we knew.
That's how we know that we're doing our job well.
You know,</v>

371
00:20:36.251 --> 00:20:40.460
when,
when we,
we began to engage with,
you know,

372
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.980
the audience and they began to,
their imagination starts to run wild and they're,

373
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.040
you know,
drawing pictures and sending them to,
and that

374
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.420
<v 1>as a filmmaker,
that feels really,
really good.</v>

375
00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:51.570
<v 2>Yeah,
we're very open.</v>

376
00:20:51.571 --> 00:20:54.000
I'm going to get the feeling from Google that you guys are like this too.

377
00:20:54.001 --> 00:20:56.460
But we're very collaborative,
especially with these guys.

378
00:20:56.461 --> 00:20:58.710
I mean when we bring in the voice talent,

379
00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.950
we don't want them to just read off the page where we bring them in.

380
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.590
We ask them to be in these films because of who they are as uh,

381
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.260
not just their acting persona,

382
00:21:07.261 --> 00:21:10.470
but who they are as human beings and the fact that they can ad Lib and bring

383
00:21:10.471 --> 00:21:14.550
humor that we wouldn't expect or just court we're can't possibly generate on

384
00:21:14.551 --> 00:21:14.760
around.

385
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.090
There's so much that like just these four right here brought to the film that

386
00:21:18.091 --> 00:21:20.810
wasn't on the page and that's,
that's another layer of talent.

387
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:21.420
<v 1>Where are they?</v>

388
00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.270
I mean they get to the point where they know the characters better than we do,

389
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.460
you know,
towards the end.
It's just,

390
00:21:26.461 --> 00:21:30.970
we're just giving these guys a jumping off point.
Yeah.
You know,
to explore.
Yeah,

391
00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:31.843
he just let him go.

392
00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.740
And can you just talk about just your favorite scenes from the movie without

393
00:21:34.741 --> 00:21:38.430
spoiling it?
Well,
I,
I do want to say to,
the film is absolutely phenomenal,

394
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.010
but the trailers don't show a lot of it,

395
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.680
which was phenomenal because I went to the film and thinking,

396
00:21:43.681 --> 00:21:47.460
I was going to say one thing,
the slots thing is amazing.
And in the fall,

397
00:21:47.461 --> 00:21:51.700
by the way,
this last 90 minutes of that,
it's 90 minutes of that low.

398
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:57.030
It just takes a great turn.
It's at a point and it's,
it's phenomenal.

399
00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.700
It's completely different than what I thought I was going to get.
And it's,

400
00:21:59.701 --> 00:22:00.990
it's a joy.
But what were,

401
00:22:00.991 --> 00:22:03.840
what was your favorite scenes either do or just your scenes,

402
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.660
the scene that you saw,
the,
the final cut that you liked the most?

403
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:11.890
<v 5>My favorite two scenes are the like mob scene.</v>

404
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.640
Like a little,
uh,
yeah,
Mr big.
That kills me.

405
00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.980
You guys will know what I'm talking about when you see it.

406
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.180
And my other favorite scene,
there's this,
when you get introduced to the world,

407
00:22:23.181 --> 00:22:26.690
like you're talking about Clark,
it's the first time that,
um,
you know,

408
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.860
Judy hops is on a,

409
00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:32.980
this awesome speeding train and the kick butts Shakira Song is blasting and her

410
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.130
headphones and it's just like you're seeing all the worlds that you just

411
00:22:37.131 --> 00:22:40.850
described and it's just,
it's like Disney on,
I mean,

412
00:22:40.851 --> 00:22:42.890
it's just the best at what you guys,

413
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.920
it's just unbelievably inventive and magical and something you've never seen.

414
00:22:48.291 --> 00:22:51.470
And I was moved to tears when I first saw it.

415
00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:55.800
<v 1>It's JD Cory's easily,
you know,
I have to say.</v>

416
00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.620
So those are my two differ.

417
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.990
<v 5>Um,
my,
my two favorites.
It would actually give too much away,</v>

418
00:23:01.991 --> 00:23:02.870
but I'll just say my,

419
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:07.300
my favorite two scenes were actually the ones that were the hardest for me to

420
00:23:07.301 --> 00:23:08.280
record.
One of what?

421
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.790
One of which being a very emotional scene that was mentioned a few minutes ago.

422
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:13.750
Um,

423
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:18.100
because I am so used to being live on camera and having,

424
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.180
you know,

425
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.960
my face and my body and costumes and props and things to help express something.

426
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:27.580
And it was like not only am I just having to use my voice to convey this
emotion,

427
00:23:27.581 --> 00:23:32.581
but I also add a point I think was blubbering and incomprehensible and they had

428
00:23:32.891 --> 00:23:36.220
to like pull me back a bit so you could actually hear what I was saying and then

429
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.870
try to find a layer of comedy.

430
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.920
Trying to find a layer of comedy on top of that was something I hadn't really,

431
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:44.380
I don't know,
it was a balance I hadn't had to really strike before in anything.

432
00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:48.020
Like I've either done,
I feel dramas or comedies.

433
00:23:48.021 --> 00:23:52.490
I haven't really been in something that was such a Meld of those two genres.

434
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.940
And then another scene that was my favorite,

435
00:23:55.941 --> 00:23:59.690
that was the hardest phone would totally be a giveaway.
But it's just,
it was,

436
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:04.190
it's one of those like famous Disney emotional punch in the gut scenes that

437
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:09.820
didn't actually involve as much of me as it was everything coming together.

438
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:15.190
Once you have the animation and the music and like it was just item it,

439
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:16.123
I'd give it,

440
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.610
<v 9>but it's really good.</v>

441
00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.540
And they were you able to Improv a lot because you came from that?
That was,

442
00:24:22.541 --> 00:24:23.730
you know that,
yeah,
that's my,

443
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.970
my background and that's what's cool is they kind of talked about it.

444
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:32.650
It's so amazing when you get in an environment where it is collaborative and

445
00:24:32.651 --> 00:24:36.540
they actually,
I mean you guys they'd gotten the booth with,
with me out of it.

446
00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.070
I don't know if that,
what was your experience,
but that's,

447
00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.740
I mean I haven't done a ton of,

448
00:24:41.741 --> 00:24:46.741
I've done two other actually series with TV or with a Disney animation wise,

449
00:24:46.991 --> 00:24:50.410
but the coolness of like reading with them and being,
cause it's a,

450
00:24:50.411 --> 00:24:54.610
it's kind of like prison in that way of it's a big glass wall.
And you know,

451
00:24:54.611 --> 00:24:59.470
you have the,
the,
the,
they're like great job,
you know,

452
00:24:59.471 --> 00:25:00.131
like,
so,

453
00:25:00.131 --> 00:25:03.980
so you can have a little bit of a disconnect sometimes as an actor in the voice

454
00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:07.390
over,
but that they got in and,
uh,
you guys always were.

455
00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.970
So there were times where I just kept talking forever.

456
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:13.330
I remember literally like I get them laughing and I'm like,

457
00:25:13.331 --> 00:25:16.640
I'm just going to go for like three minutes.
Oh yeah.
We,
yeah,
we have that.

458
00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:20.970
We have hours of evening hours.
No,
but I,

459
00:25:20.971 --> 00:25:24.120
I will say specifically though,
one of the cool things it,

460
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.660
which is a scene where I'm with the cell phone with,
with,

461
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.220
with a gazelle where there's like a,
I don't,
yeah,

462
00:25:30.221 --> 00:25:32.870
I don't want to give too much away,
but there ends up being,
um,

463
00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.370
something where that was a little bit like that where we got to play in to see

464
00:25:36.371 --> 00:25:41.050
it come to fruition and make it,
not that it's completely improvised,
but,
um,

465
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.510
but you,
you get to add a little bit to it.

466
00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.810
And that's always a cool thing as an actor to get to do.
How about your timing?

467
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:52.390
<v 10>Well,
you know,
I had a lot of experience doing Cheech and Chong albums,</v>

468
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:57.400
you know,
alone who just Cheech nine,
the engineers.
So,

469
00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.290
you know,
working with these guys with a piece of cake,
you know,

470
00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.360
cause that's what we did a you,

471
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:09.230
we would get in front of a microphone and just have an engineer and then we

472
00:26:09.231 --> 00:26:14.080
would just create with our imagination.
And so it was a easy,

473
00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:16.550
and,
but when I saw the movie,

474
00:26:16.551 --> 00:26:21.550
I mean I'm a big animated animation fan anyway,
you know,
cause,
uh,

475
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.630
in fact we used to,

476
00:26:22.631 --> 00:26:27.631
I had a nightclub in Vancouver and we had a little party for a kids went,

477
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.850
you know,
my son,
my brother's a children,

478
00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:36.090
had a birthday party and we showed I animated movies or cartoons and uh,

479
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:43.320
the kids where they watched it,
but it was the adults that really got it.

480
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:49.130
And so we used to close the club down on Sunday and put on the animation and

481
00:26:51.121 --> 00:26:52.270
just laughed ourselves,

482
00:26:52.271 --> 00:26:56.460
sick and then playing over and over and over again.

483
00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:03.540
And so when I saw,
when I saw this,
it brought me right back to that world,

484
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:09.510
especially,
especially the,
their scenes.
There's wolves howling.

485
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.180
They're all my God.
I mean,
and there,

486
00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.770
there are bits in this movie where I,
I'm,
I'm wanting to see,

487
00:27:16.771 --> 00:27:20.220
I can't wait to see it again because I want to feel that,
that,

488
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.060
that humor and the humor in the industry,

489
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.500
like a lot of animation,
you know,
it's the humorous kind of hidden,

490
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:33.260
you know?
But this one,
it was out in the open.
It was so,

491
00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:38.760
it was so crazy and so good.
And my character,
I was,

492
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:42.330
I just recovered.
In fact,
I came out of the hospital,

493
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.560
I had an operation and I came out of the hospital.
My son,
who was my manager,

494
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:50.010
he's a,
we got a voiceover Gig for you.
And I said,
what?

495
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.600
I literally got taken from the hospital in the car into,

496
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:02.630
into the recording booth and standing there and they're explaining the bit to

497
00:28:04.231 --> 00:28:07.980
me,
you know?
But like I said,
I had all that experience with,
with teaching.

498
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:11.430
Jaxa was no problem,
you know,
say this.
Okay,
no problem.

499
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.690
We're really merciless where like you had surgery,
get in here,

500
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:20.550
come on.
I mean that was incredible.

501
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.280
Thank you for coming in those times.
I mean there it is.

502
00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.780
<v 1>Well and and uh,</v>

503
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:33.240
with what I was most impressed with was right when the first kind of teaser

504
00:28:33.241 --> 00:28:36.180
trailer came out with the walk cycles of all the animals.

505
00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:38.730
So I kind of want to talk about what the technological hurdles where,

506
00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:39.564
what this movie,

507
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:43.140
cause that blew my mind because each animal has their different walks cycle at

508
00:28:43.141 --> 00:28:48.030
different 10 tendency and the animators really seemed like they were using all

509
00:28:48.031 --> 00:28:51.720
those features.
Like there's a great scene that I saw when Judy hopps,

510
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.380
Jennifer's character was chasing after the weasel and it was,

511
00:28:55.381 --> 00:28:57.810
she was bouncing off walls and stuff and the animals were doing a really good

512
00:28:57.811 --> 00:29:01.380
job with that.
But just the animals.
I mean it had to be crazy to develop that.

513
00:29:01.381 --> 00:29:04.290
And you guys also just had a lot of amazing software,
it seemed like with,

514
00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:06.860
with fis grid Bonzai and x Gen.

515
00:29:06.861 --> 00:29:11.700
So can you talk about just what was the next evolution in technology going into

516
00:29:11.701 --> 00:29:12.370
this movie?
And

517
00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:13.430
<v 2>know,
maybe I could talk to him,</v>

518
00:29:13.431 --> 00:29:14.770
maybe one of these guys to talk about that a little bit.

519
00:29:14.771 --> 00:29:17.500
Cause I'll talk about the animation part of it first because one of the things

520
00:29:17.501 --> 00:29:19.910
that uh,
and you guys are probably like this to here,

521
00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:22.900
when you get something that you're really passionate about and it's a project

522
00:29:22.901 --> 00:29:26.080
then if it doesn't feel like work and that when you give our animators,

523
00:29:26.081 --> 00:29:30.820
and we have about probably all like almost a hundred enemies in 1995 animators.

524
00:29:30.821 --> 00:29:35.320
And so,
uh,
when you can give them something that they love,
the work does itself,

525
00:29:35.321 --> 00:29:37.900
they will go to 150% on everything.

526
00:29:37.901 --> 00:29:42.400
And what we ask them to do on this movie was to not forget that these are all

527
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:45.430
animals.
They're not men in costumes.

528
00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:50.290
Don't think of them as guys walking around in suits.
And uh,
they studied every,

529
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:54.790
we have 64,
64 different species of mammal in this movie.
All different,

530
00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:59.380
all with different rigs,
different body anatomy,
different for different clothing,

531
00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:01.640
different scales.
We tried to be true to the scale of the animal.

532
00:30:01.641 --> 00:30:04.210
So if a mouse is two inches tall and our world,

533
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.560
then it's two inches tall in Zootopia.

534
00:30:05.561 --> 00:30:08.740
If a giraffe is 25 feet tall in our world standing on two legs,

535
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:13.240
same thing as utopia.
And so the animators geeked out,
they just said,

536
00:30:13.241 --> 00:30:16.720
we're going to do this.
And so especially with Jennifer and Jason's characters,

537
00:30:16.721 --> 00:30:17.501
the Fox and the rabbit,

538
00:30:17.501 --> 00:30:22.210
they looked at hundreds and hundreds of hours of real fox footage in real rabbit

539
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:23.950
footage.
And you'll actually see Jennifer's character.

540
00:30:23.951 --> 00:30:28.090
She almost gets stepped on by Rhinoceros in the movie.
And when she gets scared,

541
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:31.600
she goes back to the sort of primal instinct and this bunny behavior comes out

542
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:35.680
and she doesn't make very specific that bunnies to called [inaudible] look it
up.

543
00:30:35.681 --> 00:30:36.514
You can Google it.
Yeah,

544
00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:40.430
<v 4>see I tidy guys said,
all right.</v>

545
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.520
Anyway,
you can have you heard of this thing all the time.
Uh,
anyway,
somebody,

546
00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:46.970
you can look up banking and you'll see

547
00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.760
<v 2>exactly what Jennifer's character does because of,</v>

548
00:30:48.761 --> 00:30:51.370
that's why we have these Geeky animators who love this stuff.

549
00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:55.270
And if you give them a,
these projects and especially it's,
we've done it,

550
00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.280
we've done a lot of films lately with human beings.

551
00:30:57.281 --> 00:30:59.530
We'd done frozen and tangled and stuff and human beings are fine,

552
00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.070
but it's nice to kind of mix it up once in a while and give them something new,

553
00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:05.170
especially with this movie that had so much variety,

554
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.420
they just really got into it.
And do you guys want to talk about like the tech

555
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.240
<v 4>well and,
and just the,</v>

556
00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:15.020
the ability to render the fur on the character,
the,
the looks of,

557
00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.550
of them and the grooms.
Um,

558
00:31:17.551 --> 00:31:22.440
and like you said since big hero six we have this Hyperion system.

559
00:31:22.441 --> 00:31:27.441
It's a software that allows us just to output tremendous amounts of detail and

560
00:31:29.071 --> 00:31:33.450
information per frame.
You know,
when,
when we render the film.
Um,

561
00:31:33.451 --> 00:31:38.130
and so for the first time we were able to groom the character is not using like

562
00:31:38.131 --> 00:31:40.290
a cheat,
you know,
on,
for not making it,

563
00:31:40.291 --> 00:31:43.890
just this kind of stuff that looks kind of like human hair,
you know,

564
00:31:43.891 --> 00:31:47.960
and I on bolt,
you guys could barely pull off the scene of,

565
00:31:47.961 --> 00:31:51.620
of bolts that his head out of the car window and,
and,

566
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:56.010
and it was a pivotal scene in the movie and it almost didn't happen because the

567
00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.910
tech department just to know how they were going to pull it off and it was only

568
00:31:59.911 --> 00:32:02.490
seven years ago.
And now we have this system that,

569
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:07.870
that we can groom the characters with hundreds of thousands of individual pieces

570
00:32:08.461 --> 00:32:13.461
of strands of for just that our model to look exactly like they do,

571
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.820
you know,
in the wild.
So,
um,
our,

572
00:32:16.821 --> 00:32:21.030
our technology is just move forward leaps and bounds and in presenting a movie

573
00:32:21.031 --> 00:32:24.060
like this.
Yeah.
And I think,
I mean,
just a couple of quick statistics.

574
00:32:24.061 --> 00:32:28.170
So Jennifer's character has 2.6 million hairs on that rabbit,

575
00:32:28.171 --> 00:32:32.580
9 million on a draft.
So that's a lie.
Everything want to go on to render.

576
00:32:32.581 --> 00:32:35.400
But the most important thing is 9 million on a giraffe.

577
00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:39.980
How many on Tommy's character do you know?
Tommy's is,
he's not even

578
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.630
<v 11>wearing long clothes.
Yeah.</v>

579
00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.160
<v 3>More of him losing his more exposed,</v>

580
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.930
but 64 characters they studied each species for under a microscope,

581
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.340
discovered that at polar bears for is actually clear that a fox is first dark at

582
00:32:55.341 --> 00:32:58.130
the root and it gets light as it goes to the tip that there are dreadlocks on a

583
00:32:58.131 --> 00:32:58.964
JAKKS did,
uh,

584
00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.750
you could have an oily kind of look on an otter so that every single for groom

585
00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:05.690
is completely different.
Every animal is a different shape and size.

586
00:33:05.691 --> 00:33:10.280
So we can't actually replicate those animals and just change the size of them

587
00:33:10.281 --> 00:33:13.040
and make it different.
So you had 64 different models had to be created,

588
00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.990
64 different rigs that had to be created.

589
00:33:14.991 --> 00:33:17.990
Then we had to create shaders that would actually allow us to bring that,

590
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.920
have light,

591
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:23.120
reflect the fur and the correct way so that we as humans see it in the right
way.

592
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.190
And again with each type of Caribbean different,

593
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.070
the way that light reflects off of the fur is different.

594
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.580
So in every shot they have to think about that for each individual character.

595
00:33:31.581 --> 00:33:33.530
And then we said the world had to feel alive.

596
00:33:33.531 --> 00:33:37.370
So we needed plants and trees cause I was going to be the most way to make the

597
00:33:37.371 --> 00:33:41.490
world feel organic and we needed that throughout.
So for us we had to go in and,

598
00:33:41.491 --> 00:33:45.260
and get bonsai and look at the rain forest district in terms of the density of

599
00:33:45.261 --> 00:33:47.630
all of the foliage that is in that one area.

600
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.440
And then on top of that we said we wanted to have there be movement cause in any

601
00:33:51.441 --> 00:33:52.320
city there's movement.

602
00:33:52.321 --> 00:33:55.940
So we had to create technology systems would allow us to move the leaves and the

603
00:33:55.941 --> 00:34:00.170
branches on the trees and had the fur on the characters actually move in a way

604
00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:03.590
that makes it feel again realistic.
So you keep adding on.

605
00:34:03.591 --> 00:34:04.401
And then the last thing,

606
00:34:04.401 --> 00:34:07.010
which is huge and you sort of take it for granted as you start to watch this

607
00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:09.830
movie because the characters are walking out too.
But they all wear clothes.

608
00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:14.180
So every single character has a different cloth simulation that has to be

609
00:34:14.181 --> 00:34:15.650
figured out and they're different sizes.

610
00:34:15.651 --> 00:34:18.620
So how does that skirt move on an elephant versus on a mouse?

611
00:34:18.621 --> 00:34:21.410
Or how does the same thing for a t shirt move on to different types of

612
00:34:21.411 --> 00:34:21.861
characters.

613
00:34:21.861 --> 00:34:26.070
So four hours an intersect with for all those different kinds of firms.

614
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:29.060
So it was layer on pot on top of layer,
on top of layer,

615
00:34:29.061 --> 00:34:32.030
and each decision was made individually based on what we thought was necessary

616
00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:34.070
for the world.
But in the end,
when you look at all of it,

617
00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:37.070
it was a little daunting.
But again,
as as Byron Image of said,

618
00:34:37.071 --> 00:34:41.360
our team is so passionate about wanting to create great work that everybody goes

619
00:34:41.361 --> 00:34:43.640
into what they know and they figure it out for you.

620
00:34:43.641 --> 00:34:44.960
And it's a thing you just believe in.

621
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:48.260
And we're so lucky to get to work with these talented individuals who will go to

622
00:34:48.261 --> 00:34:50.060
the ends of the earth to make it happen for you.

623
00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.690
<v 1>Yeah,
no,
it's,
it's phenomenal.
It's great to just see Disney eat,</v>

624
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.540
you pushing these types of films.
And just not resting on your little laurels.

625
00:34:56.541 --> 00:35:00.590
It's,
it's great.
Um,
so I'm bringing them to know from our Google photos team.
Uh,

626
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:01.060
<v 11>yeah,</v>

627
00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:05.510
<v 8>yeah.
Well,
yeah.
Well,
yeah.</v>

628
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:06.770
<v 11>What you gotta do it all right.</v>

629
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:10.640
So I get the pleasure of talking about a couple of really fun things we got to

630
00:35:10.641 --> 00:35:14.520
do between Google photos and the folks at Disney for this movie.
Um,

631
00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.700
so we had a similar experience.
Byron is you had,

632
00:35:16.701 --> 00:35:20.210
so when I found out we were going to be in Zootopia,
I went and found Sundar,

633
00:35:20.211 --> 00:35:25.130
our CEO,
and I lifted him up and I put them up there like Simba that,
and I said,

634
00:35:25.131 --> 00:35:29.870
we're going to be in some Topia make this a thing.
I know my did not go so well.

635
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:33.750
He's still not talking to me.
But anyway,
um,
it was,

636
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:37.010
it was just such a great experience when we found out about this movie and we

637
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.070
knew we have to be a part of it because I mean,
if there's a universal truth,

638
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.440
right?
Other than death and taxes,
it's this,

639
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:48.450
humans and animals both suck at managing their personal photos.

640
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.080
Right?
They take way too many slots to take way too many selfies.

641
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:55.770
Hippos always forget to take their phones out of their pocket when they have a

642
00:35:55.771 --> 00:35:56.940
bath,
right?

643
00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:00.510
So we knew we wanted to be part of this movie and be able to help with those

644
00:36:00.511 --> 00:36:03.580
problems.
And so,
uh,
in addition to having a little clip in the movie,
uh,

645
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.620
which we really enjoyed our,

646
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:08.820
we also worked with Disney to create another sort of custom clip,

647
00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.460
which we're going to show now.
Let's cue the video please.
Oh,

648
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:18.720
<v 6>we all love our phones everyday.
We use our phones for this like all the time.</v>

649
00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:22.710
Can we take photos at every place,
every event,
and with every friend,
you know,

650
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:27.540
you don't want to lose those moments,
but hey,
things happen.
Phones break,

651
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:29.743
get your opt in.
Then

652
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:32.130
<v 11>tomorrow's another day.</v>

653
00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:37.950
<v 6>Good thing there's Google photos.
Your memories are automatically backed up.</v>

654
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:41.760
Always organized the gang completely searchable.
Wait,
is that all your family?

655
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:44.270
<v 11>Oh,
bunnies,
we are good at multiplying</v>

656
00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:48.020
<v 6>soap.
No matter where you are,
you can view your photos anytime.
Well,</v>

657
00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:51.470
almost anytime.
Suga photos if you live in Zootopia,

658
00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:56.210
but if you live anywhere else,
there's Google photos.
Disney,

659
00:36:56.211 --> 00:36:58.970
Zootopia in theaters March 4th,
like a PG.

660
00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:02.350
<v 11>Oh,
nice.</v>

661
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:06.740
All right.
So that was,
that was really fun.

662
00:37:06.741 --> 00:37:10.460
And then the other thing we got to do is we actually got to go ahead and have a

663
00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:14.660
little fun at the premiere.
So we got to go down to the Zootopia premier,

664
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.100
which was a couple of weeks ago down in La.

665
00:37:16.101 --> 00:37:19.550
And we got to actually go down and do some fun things at the red carpet.

666
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:24.680
Now this was my,
personally,
I think this was my 32nd red carpet event.

667
00:37:24.681 --> 00:37:29.200
33rd maybe.
Actually,
no,
I'm miscounting sorry.
This was my first one ever.
Wow.

668
00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.420
And so it was pretty awesome,
right?

669
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:34.820
It was a really great experience that you guys were even so nice as to set me up

670
00:37:34.821 --> 00:37:38.450
with a fake interview.
I really appreciate that.
I think this was the onion,

671
00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.000
so I'm waiting for that article to come out.
Um,

672
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.660
but it was just a great experience.
And so once all US riff raff like me got off,

673
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:45.081
uh,
you know,

674
00:37:45.081 --> 00:37:48.170
obviously the real talent came on and we want to have a little bit of fun.

675
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:52.280
So what we did is we set up an installation to take photos and so we went ahead

676
00:37:52.281 --> 00:37:56.630
and took photos and Nate try to control yourself.
Shakira ne we,
we took,

677
00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:00.920
we created an installation where we took photos from the vantage points of the

678
00:38:00.921 --> 00:38:04.250
animals.
So here you've got,
what if we were in Zootopia,

679
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.820
we were taking a photo of Shakira,
what it would look like if we were Elian.

680
00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.730
But what if we were a giraffe taking a photo of this event?

681
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:14.180
It will kind of like this,
right?
And you'd have that experience.

682
00:38:14.181 --> 00:38:17.030
And of course this is what it would look like if it was a journal.

683
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:22.070
So not quite the full scope,
but we got to have a little bit of fun with it.

684
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:26.900
With this installation.
We got some great photos.
Of course,
of Shakira.
We,

685
00:38:26.901 --> 00:38:31.000
um,
let's see here.
Who else?
We've got a,

686
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:35.330
here's Jennifer phone.
So this was a fun experience.

687
00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:39.490
We didn't get to see the shoes as much.
The jural didn't get much there.

688
00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.570
Uh,
we've got,
let's see.

689
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:45.030
<v 8>Wow.</v>

690
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:49.450
<v 11>Okay.
The idiot squad siren,
right.</v>

691
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:53.520
Is that your text by put the shoes.

692
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.710
Leopard tucks.
Tucks.
Let's be nice.
Kim.
Style payment is important.

693
00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:06.000
We got,
we got nay nay.
It rains.
Those shooting down my shoes.

694
00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:12.210
It was so rainy day.
Everyone was so,
it was not,
it was not good for that one.

695
00:39:12.211 --> 00:39:16.650
Yeah.
Okay.
So this was the Jason,
oh,
we got some good photos of,

696
00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.090
I think we could get Tommy to stand in one place for too long so we couldn't get

697
00:39:21.091 --> 00:39:25.320
all three photos.
Uh,
and of course we had,

698
00:39:25.321 --> 00:39:27.840
Katie is there,

699
00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.930
there's Adam also that was bring your husband and workday to

700
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.130
uh,
and so it was a really great experience.

701
00:39:35.131 --> 00:39:38.270
All these photos are up on Google photos,
uh,

702
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.370
so everyone can have a look and a and join the join the album.

703
00:39:41.371 --> 00:39:44.040
But it was a great experience and we really appreciate the opportunity to be

704
00:39:44.041 --> 00:39:46.110
part of it.
So thank you guys.
Thank you.
Awesome.

705
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:51.590
Linwood.
The audience questions.

706
00:39:51.591 --> 00:39:53.630
If you guys want to head up to the MOH people are running.

707
00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.440
<v 8>Okay,</v>

708
00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.950
<v 12>I have a chance to see it as a d 23 with my younger daughter.</v>

709
00:39:57.951 --> 00:40:01.620
She thought it was fantastic or clips from it.
And question I asked her,

710
00:40:01.621 --> 00:40:05.850
I want to ask here cause I thought it was a great answer was I saw a lot of

711
00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:10.340
things about unconscious bias in the clips that I saw and that's a big topic

712
00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:11.300
here at Google.

713
00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:14.840
Was that just you thought about or coincidentally had worked out of something

714
00:40:14.841 --> 00:40:15.660
wrong with it.
Now

715
00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:19.260
<v 2>you know it's,
it's oddly timely this movie and you know it wasn't,</v>

716
00:40:19.261 --> 00:40:20.310
it didn't start that way.

717
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.490
But one of the things that came up when we were doing that year of research is

718
00:40:23.491 --> 00:40:28.491
we found a very interesting fact about the mammal world and that's 90% of the

719
00:40:29.011 --> 00:40:32.340
animals and the mammal world are prey animals and 10% are predators.

720
00:40:32.341 --> 00:40:33.390
We actually say that in the movie.

721
00:40:33.391 --> 00:40:36.570
One of the characters says that and we thought that's really interesting.

722
00:40:36.571 --> 00:40:38.910
If you think about those two groups that are not equally balanced,

723
00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:44.330
if they've really stepped into the future and put this eating thing behind them

724
00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:48.420
a couple thousand years ago and figured evolved past it and they made this

725
00:40:48.421 --> 00:40:49.390
incredible,
uh,

726
00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:53.940
civilization did they completely put aside that mistrust of each other that

727
00:40:53.941 --> 00:40:55.110
existed so long ago.

728
00:40:55.111 --> 00:40:59.880
And that was one of the major kickoffs of what the story became and what

729
00:40:59.881 --> 00:41:02.670
actually became the main issue between nick and Judy.

730
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:04.380
Like if you watch Jennifer and Jason's character,

731
00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.200
that's what they're struggling with through this whole film.

732
00:41:07.201 --> 00:41:12.201
And the fact that you see hopps who has this amazing frank capra s character

733
00:41:12.211 --> 00:41:14.700
that has this beautiful core and wants to do something good in the world,

734
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.560
struggle with something that you didn't know existed within her,
it,
it made,

735
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:22.440
it gave the movie layers,
which I don't think anyone expected.

736
00:41:22.441 --> 00:41:25.740
And it as we went through the story,
it kept building and building and building.

737
00:41:25.741 --> 00:41:29.940
And we never set out to make preachy message movies.
We hate movies like that.

738
00:41:29.941 --> 00:41:32.940
We want to just have people experience the films through the emotional journey

739
00:41:32.941 --> 00:41:33.650
of characters.

740
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:37.910
And so that's what we really appreciate about what these guys gave us because

741
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:41.290
the natural performances and we have great writers and our Gr,

742
00:41:41.291 --> 00:41:45.200
our recode director at Jared Bush and Phil Johnson who was his co screenwriter,

743
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:48.650
wrote a very smart script and we had to be very careful about what the movie was

744
00:41:48.651 --> 00:41:50.900
saying and how it was saying it,
but it wasn't intentional.

745
00:41:50.901 --> 00:41:53.710
But we're glad it happened and we're glad people are talking about it.

746
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.033
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

747
00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:59.620
<v 10>So I've seen the extended preview at Disneyland and that looks so good.</v>

748
00:41:59.621 --> 00:42:03.580
My family is so excited about it.
Um,
I had a question for Jennifer.

749
00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:08.260
So you play snow white on once upon a time and you recently said that you go to

750
00:42:08.261 --> 00:42:12.730
Disneyland every week.
Month.
Yeah,
once a month.
Once a month.
That's not healthy,

751
00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:16.210
but I know the feeling.
It's a crazy.

752
00:42:16.211 --> 00:42:19.450
Now do you ever pretend to be snow white when you're interacting with the

753
00:42:19.451 --> 00:42:20.284
character?

754
00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.500
<v 5>I actually leave the,
um,
the snow white job to the ladies with the,</v>

755
00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:30.360
with the bobs and the like forties red and yellow dresses.
Um,
I actually,

756
00:42:30.361 --> 00:42:35.361
because our audience for once upon a time are typically Disneyland goers.

757
00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:40.290
We sometimes go in disguise because,

758
00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:43.140
and I really love this Disney actually,
they,

759
00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:47.630
they don't want us to cause a scene because they want there to be big.

760
00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:49.510
Have you escorts.
Right.
Well and that they want,

761
00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.470
but I feel like it's for such a cool reason.
It's not like a,

762
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:56.400
it's not like a Hollywood,
he reason it said they want the kids to,

763
00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:00.510
to gather on Mickey mass and to gather around,
you know,

764
00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:05.430
Winnie the Pooh and like those are the Disneyland celebrities and I respect that

765
00:43:05.431 --> 00:43:09.360
so much.
Cause that's what I mean.
I could gather around them too.
And so,
uh,

766
00:43:09.361 --> 00:43:13.380
so yeah,
so we usually like try and be a little incognito at the park.

767
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:18.850
<v 7>Hi.
Um,
this question is for Tommy.</v>

768
00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:24.040
So I grew up like watching your movies and I saw you live in San Francisco about

769
00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:26.620
seven or eight years ago.
It was amazing.
My laugh,

770
00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:30.460
like I couldn't stop laughing in my face,
like hurt so bad afterwards.
Um,

771
00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:34.090
so my question is how do you think your character is different from like the

772
00:43:34.091 --> 00:43:36.400
Cheech and Chong movies to like this character now?

773
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:38.420
<v 10>What was the question?
How was the,</v>

774
00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.860
how was this character that you're playing now a little bit different than when

775
00:43:42.861 --> 00:43:47.510
you were in your Cheech and Chong?
Well,
uh,
not really.

776
00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:53.830
I'm,
I'm a,
I'm a Yag.
That's the one,

777
00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:59.350
it's the t shirt.
He doesn't wear the teeth naked.
What you saw was me

778
00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.060
and our characters too.
You know,
we,
uh,

779
00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.240
Cheech and I would find the most ridiculous,

780
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:11.000
weird characters that we could find that were real,
that everybody saw every,

781
00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:11.913
every day.

782
00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:16.410
And that's what the strength of this movie is that you,
you,

783
00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:20.770
you know,
what this movie really did to me,
I mentioned it before,

784
00:44:20.771 --> 00:44:25.771
is that it made me appreciate humans more because instead of having one view of

785
00:44:29.171 --> 00:44:31.860
what a human should look like,
uh,

786
00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:37.110
this movie showed you that humans come in all sizes and shapes and,

787
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:42.630
and beliefs and,
and,
and tribes and everything.
And it,
just,

788
00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.510
that movie,
everybody fit in that movie.

789
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.990
There was a place for the hippos and their place for the draft and the place

790
00:44:48.991 --> 00:44:53.950
where the little tiny people.
And so,
and that's what,
uh,

791
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:57.180
made Cheech and Chong so popular is that we,

792
00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:02.580
we took real people,
you know,
we didn't have to invent anybody.

793
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.270
The people that we portrayed where,
you know,

794
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.310
our neighbors and people that we knew.
So it was a,
it was,

795
00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.790
it wasn't a stretch at all for me.

796
00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.960
<v 13>Thank you.
So I,</v>

797
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:21.360
the movie was fantastic but I also love all the more subtle call outs that were

798
00:45:21.361 --> 00:45:22.200
in the movie.
Um,

799
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:26.300
some of them were settled like the carrot on the back of the phone or uh,

800
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:28.770
the Zuber or mouse card or that sort of idea.

801
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:30.870
And some of them were a lot more overt like,
uh,

802
00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:34.680
the breaking bad stuff and the frozen jokes and so on.
How do you decide how to,

803
00:45:34.681 --> 00:45:38.160
like how do you manage all of that?
Cause that's really,

804
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.390
for me as a viewer that's really dense and I have,
and I,

805
00:45:41.391 --> 00:45:44.940
and I love it and I have no idea how you guys decide what to put in when you

806
00:45:44.941 --> 00:45:47.760
decide to do it.
How that creativity comes about.
I find that,

807
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:52.140
<v 4>well when,
when we're working in the story room,
we,
um,</v>

808
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:55.380
we encourage all that stuff from,

809
00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.980
from our story artists just from our writers,
just,
uh,

810
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:01.320
just lay it on thick,
you know,

811
00:46:01.321 --> 00:46:04.620
it's like we had so many like puns for like,

812
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:07.580
or like joke signs for different,
you know,

813
00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:09.930
a businesses that were animal ponds.

814
00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:14.780
And I think it's the stuff that really makes us laugh,
you know,

815
00:46:14.781 --> 00:46:18.570
are the ones that really make us grown the most,
you know,
or,

816
00:46:18.571 --> 00:46:22.910
or whatever seems appropriate for the moment.
It's like,
then it's in,
you know,

817
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:27.330
there really isn't a formula or,
or,
um,

818
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:31.200
any specific recipe of doing it.
It's just,
um,

819
00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:35.190
how much can we,
we just create tons of it,
you know,

820
00:46:35.191 --> 00:46:39.810
just a tonnage of,
of this stuff,
you know,

821
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:44.110
and,
and just try to plug it in where,
where it's appropriate.
And then we,

822
00:46:44.111 --> 00:46:47.610
we actually have to kind of manage it and make sure like,
is that,

823
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:52.510
is that one sign in that shot,
you know,
it should be there.
And somehow we,

824
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:56.630
we just kind of track it with our minds to,
and um,

825
00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:01.650
it's after,
since doing this on shows like the Simpsons and Futurama,

826
00:47:01.651 --> 00:47:06.090
it's like you Kinda,
you kinda becomes just kind of an innate,
you know,

827
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:10.830
a skill that you have in making one of these things that you want to make sure

828
00:47:10.831 --> 00:47:15.140
that the whole thing,
if you can tell,
I mean,
after doing this for,
for awhile,

829
00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:17.820
you can tell when it's starting to go off balance.
If you have too many,

830
00:47:17.821 --> 00:47:20.700
if you don't have enough,
you know.
Um,
but it's,

831
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.500
and there's stuff that we don't even know about.

832
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:26.240
People kind of slip stuff in and put like license plates and uh,

833
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:30.040
if you watch the movie,
there's a flashback received nick as a little boy,

834
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:33.850
<v 2>little,
a little fox,
like I can't,
I guess when he goes into,</v>

835
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:36.820
he becomes a junior ranger scout and is true,
uh,

836
00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:40.510
number is nine 14 and that's the birth date of the guy who did all the character

837
00:47:40.511 --> 00:47:41.680
designs in the movie.

838
00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.040
So it's all these little things or personal things or probably personal

839
00:47:45.041 --> 00:47:48.130
birthdates there's in jokes about our own movies that you probably saw the

840
00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:49.480
frozen jokes.
We've got those in there.

841
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:53.950
And it's great to have a world like that where you can actually do that and play

842
00:47:53.951 --> 00:47:56.230
with it because the movie the begs for it really well because

843
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:58.910
<v 4>the genre itself wants it.</v>

844
00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:03.530
It's a mirror image of like our world is,
you know,
the talking animal things are,

845
00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:05.420
are that,
that's what it's all about.

846
00:48:05.421 --> 00:48:08.630
That's kind of the main convention of this genre.

847
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:13.970
So as we were making the film it became obvious like it wanted more,

848
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.150
you know,
the story wanted more of this stuff,
you know,
and we,

849
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:20.580
we were happy to oblige.
Awesome.
Great.

850
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.830
I've got a question about um,
character creation process in particular.

851
00:48:24.831 --> 00:48:25.730
I was curious,

852
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.100
do you pick an animal and then figured out what the personality is?
A,

853
00:48:29.101 --> 00:48:31.190
do you have a personality in mind and pick an animal?

854
00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.760
How did that kind of work when you antimony Puma finds people that way?

855
00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:38.790
<v 2>I guess we start with sort of the story need.
I guess we like,
uh,
the,</v>

856
00:48:38.791 --> 00:48:43.490
the sloths are a good example because we were,
we were kind of brainstorming a,

857
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:47.130
okay,
well what would animals do in this world?
And Jim Riordan whose jobs,

858
00:48:47.131 --> 00:48:47.970
ups and stuff.

859
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.360
But what would be an interesting location if you need to go to yeah.

860
00:48:51.361 --> 00:48:53.460
Like what are appropriate things for these animals to do?

861
00:48:53.461 --> 00:48:56.670
And we have two heads of story.
Jim [inaudible],
Jim Riordan and Josie Trinidad,

862
00:48:56.671 --> 00:49:00.070
both really brilliant people.
And Jim said,
well,
you know,
it's like a,

863
00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:02.610
if it was a DMV,
it should be staffed by sloths.

864
00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:04.950
And he just sort of set at this off the cuff and he was sort of like,
oh,

865
00:49:04.951 --> 00:49:07.350
that's not gonna go anywhere.
And we're like,
oh wait,
wait,
wait a minute.

866
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:09.840
That's good.
Has that ever been done?
You know,

867
00:49:09.841 --> 00:49:11.850
like somebody has to have done that.
We thought it was like,
no,

868
00:49:11.851 --> 00:49:15.000
no one had ever done at Google.
And then I had to go chat.
Has anyone ever

869
00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:19.570
<v 4>wait a minute?
Did we just find something really,
really cool?
You know,</v>

870
00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:23.690
that that hasn't been done before.
And it's just kind of moments like that,

871
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:27.710
you know,
the Andrea and we tried to go,
that was the case of,

872
00:49:27.711 --> 00:49:30.230
of going to type,
you know,
with the animal.

873
00:49:30.231 --> 00:49:32.360
And then we would try to go against type for,

874
00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:37.540
for others because we didn't want the world to be like a story book animal world

875
00:49:38.091 --> 00:49:39.080
where,
you know,

876
00:49:39.081 --> 00:49:42.410
they're all kind of doing their appropriate jobs and it's all very black and

877
00:49:42.411 --> 00:49:45.530
white.
And uh,
we wanted it to,
to,

878
00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:49.970
to be different shades of gray,
you know,
that like our worlds and you know,

879
00:49:49.971 --> 00:49:52.250
that it was more complex than

880
00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:54.970
<v 2>then.
You know,
like a story book.
Yeah.</v>

881
00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:58.090
Talking to animal work and maybe the exception of some of that is that with the

882
00:49:58.091 --> 00:50:01.540
lead characters,
the characters are really driving the story.
Like Judy and nick,

883
00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:06.650
Judy,
we picked a rabbit because,
uh,
with these movies and with a,

884
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:07.920
when we need to root for someone,

885
00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:09.970
you want them to be as much of the underdog as possible.

886
00:50:09.971 --> 00:50:13.210
So the more obstacles we could put in her way,
including how cute she is,

887
00:50:13.211 --> 00:50:18.010
she's teeny,
she's cute.
And uh,
there are female cops on the police force,

888
00:50:18.011 --> 00:50:19.390
but they're all huge animals.

889
00:50:19.391 --> 00:50:22.990
There's a huge elephant and there's a female polar bears and female tigers.

890
00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:28.320
But Judy as a rabbit has this kind of ridiculous idea being this big tough cop

891
00:50:29.151 --> 00:50:31.850
in this world.
And some more you got to go,
well that's ludicrous.

892
00:50:31.851 --> 00:50:32.960
She's never going to accomplish that.

893
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:36.290
That's great for us because that gives Jason's character,

894
00:50:36.291 --> 00:50:40.340
the cynic who grew up in Zootopia and has been sort of ground down by this
world,

895
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:43.760
able to kind of poke at her and kind of poke at that sort of frank capra

896
00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.470
idealism that she has.

897
00:50:45.471 --> 00:50:50.200
And it's great story fuel for us because if we don't have that conflict then

898
00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.320
because in that case we'll,

899
00:50:51.321 --> 00:50:54.050
we'll really think about that for a while because there were other people in the

900
00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:56.720
story trusts,
we're poking at Nick's character like,
well shit,

901
00:50:56.721 --> 00:51:00.230
he be a fox or should it be like a big tiger or something that's got more sort

902
00:51:00.231 --> 00:51:02.600
of size contrast.
But what we liked about the foxes,

903
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:07.400
they have this great a sense of like cutting and sneakiness that you expect.

904
00:51:07.401 --> 00:51:11.450
And Jason was perfect for that and they are,
the chemistry was great,
but then,
um,

905
00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:12.231
you know,
we want want to,

906
00:51:12.231 --> 00:51:16.220
to also keep a nick as a small Predator so that in those scenes there's a scene

907
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:20.990
where I'm Jennifer and Jason's characters are wedged between two huge polar bear

908
00:51:20.991 --> 00:51:23.750
thugs in the back of a limousine and they're being driven off to be killed.

909
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:28.280
And that's great because you want that threat to be there cause the duo there,

910
00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:31.050
they're underdogs as well,
you know?
Yeah.

911
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:34.170
I guess the rest of vague,
right.
It,

912
00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:37.840
<v 14>thank you so much for coming over and telling us about all of this.</v>

913
00:51:37.841 --> 00:51:42.190
And especially in bringing some of these other things that we won't get to see

914
00:51:42.191 --> 00:51:42.830
in the movie.

915
00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:46.360
And you obviously thought a lot about and thought a lot about creating and how

916
00:51:46.361 --> 00:51:47.500
they interact with this world.

917
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:51.130
Do you feel like there are more stories that you can tell in this or are we

918
00:51:51.131 --> 00:51:53.590
going to get a chance to see some of these kind of realized,

919
00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:57.850
especially seeing how well,
uh,
as Utopia is doing in,
uh,

920
00:51:58.090 --> 00:51:59.440
early reviews and things like that.

921
00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:03.680
<v 3>Lee's Clark,
but he's got good luck.
Luck.
Please,
please write to Clark.</v>

922
00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:08.010
Can we pick another one?
You know,
I always hope that that's where we can go.

923
00:52:08.011 --> 00:52:08.980
We never think of,

924
00:52:08.981 --> 00:52:13.110
but we'd never embark on a film thinking how can this be something with many

925
00:52:13.111 --> 00:52:13.471
stories,

926
00:52:13.471 --> 00:52:16.140
we're always focused on the mainstream because we have to ultimately create the

927
00:52:16.141 --> 00:52:18.900
best story possible and hope the world falls in love with the characters and the

928
00:52:18.901 --> 00:52:21.690
world.
But secretly,
the hard part is,

929
00:52:21.691 --> 00:52:24.060
and it's at this moment in time where we all have to let go of this,
right?

930
00:52:24.061 --> 00:52:26.760
It's going to go out into the world.
The world gets to see it.

931
00:52:26.761 --> 00:52:29.520
But these characters that we've spent and,
and environments,

932
00:52:29.521 --> 00:52:31.260
we've spent years building and creating,

933
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.490
<v 2>okay.</v>

934
00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:34.410
<v 3>Ent and it's always hard.</v>

935
00:52:34.411 --> 00:52:39.411
It's really an emotional thing to say goodbye to this cast and say goodbye to

936
00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:40.650
our team.
Cause you know,

937
00:52:40.651 --> 00:52:44.400
we work with 800 people and then suddenly we're just three people trying to

938
00:52:44.401 --> 00:52:47.640
think of what's that next idea.
So it is always that kind of bittersweet moment,

939
00:52:47.641 --> 00:52:50.730
but you do secretly kind of hope you can revisit those characters in the world

940
00:52:50.731 --> 00:52:53.520
because we've had so much fun building it and this has been such an incredible

941
00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:55.980
experience.
You guys in.
If we do another one,

942
00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:59.110
so we count on you guys to Vancouver,

943
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:04.610
<v 2>I'll go back.
I will say that we,
some of these stories,
I'll give you an example.</v>

944
00:53:04.611 --> 00:53:06.980
So the movie Clark and I worked on about seven years ago.

945
00:53:06.981 --> 00:53:09.350
Bolt is sort of a closed ended story.

946
00:53:09.351 --> 00:53:12.260
The dog and the girl are happy on the farm together in a sort of,

947
00:53:12.261 --> 00:53:13.094
it's buttoned up,

948
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:16.250
nice and clean and you can walk away and kind of that story exists in that

949
00:53:16.251 --> 00:53:21.050
little envelope.
Um,
this was built with so much potential.

950
00:53:21.051 --> 00:53:22.970
I mean,
these guys,
oh,
I want him to spoil the end for you,

951
00:53:22.971 --> 00:53:26.430
but there's so much potential of where you could go with the world.

952
00:53:26.431 --> 00:53:27.750
And even the things we were talking about earlier,

953
00:53:27.751 --> 00:53:31.410
things we couldn't include that are so much fun and so compelling that when you

954
00:53:31.411 --> 00:53:34.500
mentioned them to people,
people go,
oh my God,
that would be great.
And then,
uh,
so,

955
00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:36.150
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
hopefully,
okay,

956
00:53:36.151 --> 00:53:38.680
we'll see how it does when it goes out in the world.
But,
so I,

957
00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:40.860
I would love to come back to this world sometimes.

958
00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:45.220
<v 1>Thank you.
Thank you guys so much.
Yeah,
I mean,
as he said,
it's,
it's getting,</v>

959
00:53:45.221 --> 00:53:48.230
you know,
critical praise and everyone loves it.

960
00:53:48.231 --> 00:53:50.860
It's thing like a hundred percent on rotten tomatoes right now.
Like it's just,

961
00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:53.320
it's crazy.
And just Disney seems to be,
you know,

962
00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:56.860
hitting on all cylinders now and,
and in this new golden age and stuff,
it's just,

963
00:53:56.861 --> 00:53:59.950
it's,
it's absolutely phenomenal.
You guys are just amazing.

964
00:53:59.951 --> 00:54:04.720
So thank you guys so much for being here.
And,
uh,
uh,
Zootopia comes out March 4th,

965
00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.790
so go see it.
So thank you guys so much.

966
00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:08.050
<v 0>Thank you.
Thank you guys.</v>

967
00:54:08.051 --> 00:54:13.051
Thank [inaudible].
