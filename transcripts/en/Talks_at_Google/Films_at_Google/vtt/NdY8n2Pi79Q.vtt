1
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.210
You're welcome at the glass house.
Drink.

2
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.860
I spooned name,
uh,

3
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.700
hot time Bush or seven full time from when I was 12.

4
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.930
What the vote mean to you?

5
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.040
I can't see.

6
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.080
I told women power is in your hat on one case.

7
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.700
Some of us do cake off

8
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.450
my life.
I've been respectful.
Dumb what men told me,

9
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.290
wife,
my wife.
That's what you're meant to be.

10
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.480
But I can't have that anymore.

11
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.320
Never underestimate the power.

12
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.270
We women have to define our own destiny.

13
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.780
Five,
this stuff

14
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.100
we should copy into the hall of Communications.

15
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.640
My job is 24.
No means nothing to me off.
I must say.
You're making the law.

16
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.330
We have reached a state of anarchy.

17
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:27.320
We can no longer tolerate those responsible and whatever.
Where you can,

18
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.920
we'll stop you.
What are you going to do?
Lockers it were up.

19
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.150
We were in every,
oh,
we're off the human race.
You can't stop as all,

20
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.540
we do not want to door.
They test.
We want to build on it.

21
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.543
It does.

22
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.250
Yeah.
The waves forward.
No more,

23
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.580
no less than you would be willing.

24
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.190
Never,
never give up the fight.

25
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.300
<v 1>Good evening.
Um,</v>

26
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.970
I'm absolutely delighted to welcome you here and not least because you're about

27
00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:30.700
to see a film,
which I absolutely loved.

28
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.920
And by the end you will be extremely angry with Switzerland.

29
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:33.783
Just look out for that.

30
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.420
And not least because it's such a groundbreaking film in so many ways.

31
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.290
And we're very lucky to have a female director and a female writer at 94% of

32
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:45.640
films in Hollywood are directed by men.
75% of leading roles go to men.

33
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.670
So having a film that focuses on female experiences I think is,

34
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.110
is really overdue and reading.

35
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.890
<v 2>It's been a passion project for a decade for solar and wind done Britt land</v>

36
00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:57.610
together.
And so when she came to about six years ago,
like probably most people,

37
00:02:57.611 --> 00:03:01.150
I was thinking it's big hats and,
and courses.
So I didn't,

38
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.340
I wasn't really terribly interested if I'm honest.

39
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.660
And so when I sat down and looked through an incredible body of research that

40
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:11.810
Sarah had already built on,
which we built on during the course of,
um,

41
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.680
the writing and then into production and beyond.

42
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.400
And we actually set up a website where we can download all of this information

43
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:22.880
by the end so that collectively we could all kind of draw from it.
Um,
it,

44
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.060
it was really extraordinary and I,
you know,

45
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:28.270
I took a wrong steer the first time I wrote it and it was only two.

46
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:31.810
I really went back and looked at the testimonials of the working women that they

47
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:35.870
felt very contemporary and very vivid and really genuinely shocking.
Yeah.

48
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.570
<v 1>So when you talk about that,
it's about the idea that instead of following,</v>

49
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.880
you know,
Mrs Pancoast,

50
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.340
one of the iconic characters or even following a high profile,
you know,

51
00:03:43.341 --> 00:03:45.950
so there's princess of fear is another example or one of the,
you know,

52
00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:48.920
the middle class women who you might find,
you know,
has their own Wikipedia page.

53
00:03:48.921 --> 00:03:52.220
You're trying to look for somebody who wouldn't have ever made it to Wikipedia.

54
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.630
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean,
I think the class,</v>

55
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.530
she was really big for us and the fact that there were so many women who were

56
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.220
absolutely instrumental in the organization and in the kind of hierarchy of the

57
00:04:01.221 --> 00:04:05.450
suffragette movement and they had huge sacrifices placed on their lives.

58
00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:07.310
But ultimately if they were incarcerated,

59
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.150
they could either pay bail to get out or it didn't really matter if they had a

60
00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:12.920
week away because they didn't,

61
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.130
they weren't dependent on jobs or that income was for the working woman.
It was,

62
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.000
it was,

63
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.600
it was devastating to her life if she was incarcerated for even a few days cause

64
00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:24.320
she could lose her job.
So I think that was what we really wanted to do.
And also,

65
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.420
you know,
those photographs you talk about,

66
00:04:26.421 --> 00:04:30.010
we saw some really amazing photos of these laundries in east London and everyone

67
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.160
looked impeccably clean and beautiful black aprons and white starch shirts.

68
00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:37.670
And it was only one you broke down and started to read the incredible list of

69
00:04:37.671 --> 00:04:39.260
diseases and not disease,
sorry,

70
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.320
infections and injuries and conditions that came out of working in this place.

71
00:04:44.961 --> 00:04:48.600
And you want to say actually they had an incredibly short shelf life.
Um,
I,

72
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.040
you read as a kind of lie going on about how you represent that era.

73
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.810
<v 1>It's always a big question.
When it comes to the feminist movement,</v>

74
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.720
how much do you try and play down intro,
feminist conflicts?
Um,

75
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.730
so we know in the suffragettes for example,
that Mrs Pancreas,

76
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.520
but it was one of our own daughters over who got the vote when you were rising

77
00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:06.750
it Abby,
how much did you think,

78
00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:10.230
how much drama am I going to put in between the women themselves as well as

79
00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:11.280
their fight outwards?

80
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.650
<v 2>Um,
I think in a way it was,
I mean,</v>

81
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.400
most I think most good,
um,
writings about what you leave out,

82
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.761
you know,

83
00:05:20.761 --> 00:05:24.300
so it's just basically you're constantly stripping back and stripping back as

84
00:05:24.301 --> 00:05:27.240
much as she can.
And so,
you know,
it's,
the old adage is take out every third line.

85
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.680
And so I think the,
you know,

86
00:05:28.681 --> 00:05:33.360
you always wanted to make those relationships feel authentic and of the now.
Um,

87
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.670
so I guess that's what I focused on than anything,

88
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.500
was to try and make it feel like it had sort of contemporary resonance.
I mean,

89
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:41.723
there was a,

90
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.460
there was an amazing drum you could have done about Emily and Pancoast.

91
00:05:44.461 --> 00:05:48.240
There's an amazing drummer you can do by 71,
Davidson.
But in a way,

92
00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:51.600
it's all about putting,
um,
the kind of political and the personal for me.

93
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:55.080
And the big change is actually happening in the most undramatic moments.

94
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.140
But those are where the real drama moments happen.

95
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.480
And it's very weird because you haven't seen it yet.

96
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:01.610
So I don't want to give too much away.
But,
um,

97
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.930
and so it was always about using history to kind of act as this wonderful gal

98
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.470
point of resistance and this kind of beautiful visual sort of touchstones

99
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.030
throughout the film.
But it was always reflecting back to these,
ironically,

100
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:17.390
these kinds of fictional characters lives who are kind of carry the authentic

101
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:18.050
truth of,

102
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.070
of a woman moving effectively from a passive place to medicine activism.

103
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:23.570
So that was always the focus really.

104
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.170
<v 3>Well,
I think the schisms in the movement because they were schism.
But you know,</v>

105
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:30.410
if you look at any political movement,
never schisms at the top.

106
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.630
And in a way had we focused on them,

107
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.870
it would have been an examination of firstly the exceptional women,

108
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:38.780
the painkillers and also an examination of power and what it does.

109
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.830
And I think what was more interesting and more engaging with the admiral or

110
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:47.360
connected with the contemporary world was to look at,
um,
the ordinary women,

111
00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:50.870
the women with no platform,
no document in her journey towards activism.

112
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.070
And what we forget because we get received so much about the schism is the

113
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:58.310
comradery and the unifying things.
And you know,

114
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.820
in a way I think that was kind of more interesting to bring that out there is

115
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:04.520
friction,
but I think to look at that is interesting.

116
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.890
And how important to you was it that it was an ensemble piece?

117
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.910
Because one of the things,
you know,

118
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:11.270
the very famous test about the Bechdel test of,
of women in cinema is not just,

119
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.970
Oh,
you know,
all them is no more than one woman in it.
Um,
you know,

120
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:16.070
do they have names?
Do they talk about something other than a man?

121
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.020
Actually representing the relationships between women is one of the prompts.

122
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.550
We keep arms even in a film we have a female protagonist.

123
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:25.700
She's often a hunger games example surrounded by men.
Yeah.

124
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.820
So was that something that was a conscious decision on your part?
Yeah,

125
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:30.020
I think it was very exciting,

126
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:33.290
the idea of looking at the relationship between women and as Abby said before,

127
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:37.730
but the idea you so rare that you have in one film,
Carey Mulligan,

128
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:40.760
Anne Marie Duff had an a bottom Carter or having proper roles,

129
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.640
a little role for Meryl Streep and Romola Guy.
Right.
You know,

130
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:47.750
to see all those women working together and there was on set this very unusual.

131
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:49.850
So I'm fucked.
I can stop them laughing the whole time.

132
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.720
It just sort of break them up to get shot.
But,
but um,

133
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.540
there was this great sense of comradery.

134
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.350
<v 2>Yeah.
And I think it's also an economic thing.
You know,
you're,
you know,</v>

135
00:07:59.351 --> 00:08:02.590
if women don't get those roads and don't get the ensemble films beyond making

136
00:08:02.591 --> 00:08:04.570
people laugh or the romantic wrong Kong,

137
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.450
then you won't ever be able to prove yourself in the box office and the

138
00:08:07.451 --> 00:08:10.210
algorithm was won't work and no one will give you the money to make those
movies.

139
00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:13.390
So part of the journey to actually going,
no,

140
00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:17.170
I want three lead actresses in this foam and then slowly it and I want them all

141
00:08:17.171 --> 00:08:20.740
to get paid the same as if it was a man is actually,
and then it sells as well.

142
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.320
Then you start to change the model and people start going,
okay,

143
00:08:23.321 --> 00:08:26.440
we might do another film that might be about the female fighter pilot pilots,

144
00:08:26.441 --> 00:08:29.490
which of which there were a fantastic group and the second world war that have

145
00:08:29.491 --> 00:08:30.730
never been written about,
for example.

146
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.660
<v 3>So this is the important point for all the audience is.</v>

147
00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:34.400
But if you like films like this,

148
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:37.970
you have to go out and encourage everyone you've ever met to go out and see it

149
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:41.260
because that's the only way that you will get more.
Yeah.
Yeah.

150
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.790
To reverse the trend and I think,
you know,

151
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:48.320
there is an appetite for female centered films but we need to work hard to prove

152
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:52.250
it.
I mean it was an interesting thing on this film that when we were casting the

153
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:56.280
male roles they were harder because the agents kept on ringing up and saying can

154
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:59.690
they be a bit bigger,
the male roles.
So you know,

155
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.380
it's a kind of inverse of what

156
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.700
<v 1>can we getting a fight scene or kind of Ben Whishaw was characters ziplining</v>

157
00:09:04.701 --> 00:09:08.180
down through the laundry or something to beef it up.
A bit of beef it up.
Um,

158
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.033
one which note I show.

159
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.040
The one thing I did want to ask you was that there's been a lot of discussion

160
00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:15.680
really about recasting traditionally male roles.
You know,

161
00:09:15.681 --> 00:09:18.710
this idea of Gina Davis has of just going through your script and just changing

162
00:09:18.711 --> 00:09:20.620
a couple of the male characters names to female characters,

163
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.150
not even necessarily changing all that much else.

164
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.050
Can you think of a film or character you'd love to see rebooted,

165
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.140
which kind to see a female Scarface or

166
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.070
<v 2>I'd love to see Goodfellas.
I'd really like to take good photos.</v>

167
00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:35.830
I'd love women to be able to be violent.
I'd love them to be able to be sexual.

168
00:09:35.831 --> 00:09:37.840
I'd love them to be able to be inappropriate.

169
00:09:37.841 --> 00:09:39.490
I'd love them to be able to be aggressive.

170
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:44.850
And I'd love men to be able to be soft and magnolia steel.

171
00:09:44.921 --> 00:09:48.880
Magnolias no,
I mean,
you know,
I,
I,
I'd love to,
I'd let you know,
I love,
I'm a,
my,

172
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.860
I'm love Scorsese firms.
I mean,

173
00:09:50.861 --> 00:09:54.450
I love them and I want women to be able to be as flawed.
I want them to rail.

174
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.230
It was flawed as they are in life.
You know,

175
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.840
we've written about a group of heroes,
but you know,

176
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.570
this is another on other ways.
And I think people can be flawed.

177
00:10:01.571 --> 00:10:03.940
Women can be flawed and heroes.
And that's why I tried to do

178
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.010
<v 1>the other thing.
I read something that you said a Abbey,</v>

179
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.710
which was that you'd find emoney widen Davidson's perse.

180
00:10:08.711 --> 00:10:11.810
So you'd seen it during the course of filming and there's been a huge debate

181
00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:14.630
about whether or not she meant to kill herself by throwing himself under the

182
00:10:14.631 --> 00:10:17.630
horse.
It's,
um,
it's often referenced the fact she had a return ticket.

183
00:10:17.631 --> 00:10:20.150
But the thing you mentioned was the fact that she had a postage stamp,

184
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:24.410
which women often use to let people know that they were in,
in prison.

185
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.560
Are there any other details like that that you've managed to bring into the film

186
00:10:27.561 --> 00:10:29.480
that people should look out for when they're watching it?

187
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.360
<v 3>Oh,
that's a really lovely story of the m scarf.
Well,</v>

188
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:34.830
the thing about the return ticket by the way,

189
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.880
is the everybody had to return ticket that day.
So,
um,

190
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.750
cause they sold them as return ticket.

191
00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:42.960
So I'm not sure that tells you that she thought she was going to get back.

192
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.450
And also as a woman who was going to do a protest,

193
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.570
she know I actually want to be arrested for that protest.

194
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.270
So I don't think she ever thought she was going to get a train back from that.

195
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.560
Whatever happened.
Yeah.
Um,
but,
and it's so interesting doing a historical film,

196
00:10:55.561 --> 00:10:58.980
cause I could literally,
I've now spoken to probably 30 historians,

197
00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:02.450
but I could find someone who argued every which way on every single point.

198
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.490
You realize there's no single version of history.

199
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.740
So if anyone says it's inaccurate though,
but I'll be wrong.

200
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.020
But what was the other bit,
the bit about,

201
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.810
I know I take the point in this program,

202
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.520
I hope not going dish at the back of one of the things.

203
00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:19.920
I know that there's this lovely story,

204
00:11:19.921 --> 00:11:21.760
but it's slightly blends the end the and turn it off.

205
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.730
<v 2>Yeah.
So there I went in there.
Okay.</v>

206
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:31.170
We sort of blend Andrew anyway,
but they didn't know about the robot.
No,

207
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.900
that's fine.
I think anything is when you watch it.

208
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.760
One of the things I think that it still shocks men stays with me as the emoney

209
00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:40.140
Walden Davidson was forced fed 49 times and actually just to be force fed once

210
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:42.690
is very,
very dangerous.
So forcemain times wait,
so kind of,
yeah,

211
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.500
<v 1>I think that's one of the most shocking moments in the film.</v>

212
00:11:45.501 --> 00:11:47.570
I mean there are a lot of,
as you see parallels with,

213
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.430
with what's happening contemporarily now,

214
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.140
but both the idea of how somebody is radicalized and what that means for their

215
00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:57.340
life and also what kind of extra judicial confinement means.

216
00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.870
And what states do,

217
00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:01.300
what violence they inflict on people that they want to suppress.

218
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:02.134
I thought that was,
yeah,

219
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.950
you certainly don't flinch in the force feeding scenes from the,

220
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.790
I mean there is I think a very strong Amoco of rape and what's happening in

221
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:13.590
those scenes and then the women did talk about it.
They tend to violation.

222
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.690
Absolutely.
On that note,

223
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.580
probably I like to take a couple of questions from the room.

224
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.000
We've got some microphones.
If you would like to put your hands up.

225
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:25.430
<v 0>Can I have a Mike over here</v>

226
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.330
that just wanted to know whether there was why now and you must have researched,

227
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:38.450
but there have been other attempts to write this book and turn it into a movie.

228
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:38.960
What,

229
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.190
what do you think was the reason that this thousand lines now and this happened

230
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:47.090
in 2015 only when would you actually as a,

231
00:12:47.091 --> 00:12:51.770
as a story to tell table because I was surprised to hear nobody ever,

232
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.420
it's such an opposite material and for so long has been ignored.

233
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.260
<v 3>Well,
I think it's a symptom of inequality.
It's,
you know,</v>

234
00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.720
in a way you were the academics who consulted on this project.

235
00:13:01.721 --> 00:13:03.850
So we're not surprised it hasn't been made.

236
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:06.190
It took ages to get this story into the academy,

237
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.320
wasn't on the school curriculum for years.

238
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.440
Women's history is marginalized even though it was an incredible movement and it

239
00:13:12.441 --> 00:13:16.570
spanned over 50 years and involved on thousands actually of women and was the

240
00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:19.210
biggest movement,
political movement of it's t at the time.
Um,

241
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.990
it has been kind of in some ways buried.

242
00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:27.260
And I also think in terms of why it hasn't got to the big screen,

243
00:13:27.261 --> 00:13:31.060
is it also because you know,
as,
as Helen mentioned at the beginning,

244
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.600
there's a paltry amount of women in film.
Unfortunately,

245
00:13:34.601 --> 00:13:37.690
I'm very hopeful it's going to change,
but there's one to 10%.

246
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.210
I mean this year at the London film festival,
against the odds,

247
00:13:40.211 --> 00:13:43.090
there's 46 films directed by women,

248
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.430
but that's still 20% of the festival,

249
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:49.930
which is great because it defies the odds of 1% to 10% of films directed by

250
00:13:49.931 --> 00:13:50.560
women.

251
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.920
But we're still in a situation where you don't have many women's stories are

252
00:13:53.921 --> 00:13:54.940
women behind the camera.

253
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.550
<v 1>And my final question to wrap up,</v>

254
00:13:57.551 --> 00:14:00.430
really as we're sitting in a room full of incredibly young,

255
00:14:00.431 --> 00:14:03.040
energetic tech savvy women and men,

256
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:07.450
what can they do to help women in film and to help the feminist fight more

257
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:08.284
generally?

258
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:11.250
<v 2>Well,
I mean,
I would just to say I think another reason why I think,</v>

259
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.870
I think it's the digital age actually.

260
00:14:12.871 --> 00:14:16.530
I think the fact that we are so globally connected with,
um,
uh,

261
00:14:16.531 --> 00:14:18.900
stories of inequality that were flat back on our own,
you know,

262
00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:23.000
two to three women are killed by a partner or ex partner every,
every weekend,

263
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:27.780
the UK.
And we see that globally and,
and so I think it makes us self reflect.

264
00:14:27.781 --> 00:14:31.860
I think it's,
you know,
I think it's allowing the discourse to happen in a,

265
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.080
in a democratic way.
So even the bad and as one as the good needs to be online.

266
00:14:37.081 --> 00:14:40.680
So that's really exciting.
I think it's just telling everybody to go and see it.

267
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:46.230
Please.
It's a really,
genuinely,
it's a little,
I think we're curious.

268
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:50.010
We're curious to see if it is going to make it in the box office or next week

269
00:14:50.011 --> 00:14:52.910
we'll be weeping into our champagne glass.

270
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.290
It's very tough.
We're really on the front of Vermin too,

271
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.620
but,
um,
yeah,
we just,
it would,
I mean,
genuinely we just need to prove it.

272
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.280
I think that's a brilliant moment to wrap up and I hope everyone give a really

273
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:08.340
big round of applause to you.

274
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.670
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>
