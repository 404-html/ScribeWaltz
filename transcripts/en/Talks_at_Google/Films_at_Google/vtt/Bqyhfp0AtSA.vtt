00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.190
Hi

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.870
<v 1>One,
welcome to toxic Google today.</v>

3
00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:08.660
It is my absolute pleasure to welcome Steve Martino,

4
00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:11.150
Craig shelter and Karen Disher for the peanuts movie.

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.460
<v 0>Thank you so much for joining us today.</v>

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.260
<v 1>Um,
I would love to talk about,
so this is such a huge kind of responsibility,</v>

7
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:26.930
you know,
bringing peanuts into 2015 and into 3-d.
Um,

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.970
so I'd love Steve to know,
you know,
how,

9
00:00:28.971 --> 00:00:32.100
how did you feel about this responsibility and working with Craig and working

10
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:34.470
with the,
you know,
the Shults legacy?

11
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.960
<v 2>Well,
working with Craig has been fantastic,
but after our first meeting,</v>

12
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.950
I was honored that,
uh,
he wanted to work with me on the film,

13
00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:47.450
but as I went home I was like,
oh my gosh,
this is,
this is a huge responsibility.

14
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.760
A peanut is a big part of it.
It's like woven into the fabric of our lives.

15
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.440
And I grew up with a TV special,
you know,
the Christmas special in particular,

16
00:00:57.441 --> 00:01:00.860
I think it was six years old when that first at the air.
Um,

17
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.870
it was a big deal.
And so,
you know,
as I got back to blue sky,

18
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.850
the wonderful thing is that people started lining up at my door.
It's like,

19
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:14.510
I,
you don't understand,
I need to work on this movie because,

20
00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:17.180
and everybody's got a peanut story,
you know,

21
00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:21.650
whether it was a snoopy or a certain character that they connected with.

22
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.341
Uh,

23
00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:27.341
so what I found as I arrived back at blue sky where a team of people who kind of

24
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:30.080
joined me and taking on that responsibility,

25
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:34.910
but we kind of made a commitment to do our very best to uphold,
you know,

26
00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:37.790
the wonderful tradition that peanuts has.
Okay.

27
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.160
<v 1>Um,
as you mentioned,
your,
everyone kind of has a peanut story and uh,
Craig,</v>

28
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:45.010
I'd love to know for you where,
where it came in,
you know,

29
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.300
you were screen a store,
a screen writer on this.
Um,
what,

30
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:52.210
what part of your experience growing up with a peanuts kind of came into play in

31
00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:53.050
making this film?

32
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.610
<v 3>Well,
yeah,
I have your see now,
my,
you,</v>

33
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.950
my dad had over 50 specials and a lot of specials people have never seen before.

34
00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:03.760
He did a live action with animation before and some other stuff.

35
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:08.260
So my son had gone to a film school and he became a screenwriter.

36
00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:10.210
And in the process while he was doing a screen writing,

37
00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:14.110
I'd worked on a couple of previous projects.
One was happiness is a warm blanket,

38
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:17.230
which has a direct to DVD special if it came out a while ago.

39
00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:20.670
And then the probably the last TV special we did,
which is,
um,

40
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.910
he's a bully Charlie Brown based on a marble store that my dad had always wanted

41
00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:27.890
to do.
So from that I had,
I was,
uh,

42
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.300
in the wall one Christmas and I heard this song,
uh,
Snoopy's Christmas,

43
00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:34.900
which is from the old world guardsmen album.
And uh,

44
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.410
within that I had a vision of what that would look like,
animated.
And I thought,

45
00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:41.290
why Sunday it'd be really cool if I can animate this thing turned into a TV

46
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:43.450
special.
And from that I kind of grew,
grew,

47
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:47.590
grew until we met Steve and blue sky and blew it out into a full blown movie.

48
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.270
<v 1>And Karen,
I'd love to know a,</v>

49
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.690
it's peanuts is story panels and story is a very visual medium already.

50
00:02:55.691 --> 00:03:00.040
But you've got your drawing from,
you know,
65 years' worth of work.
Uh,
what was it

51
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.580
<v 4>like kind of taking on that task of starting being the first step of translating</v>

52
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:06.550
this onto the screen?
It was terrifying.

53
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.460
I mean,
really it was the most intimidating thing I've ever done in my life.

54
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:15.850
Not only from,
you know,
being a fan as a kid growing up with it,

55
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.270
not even imagining one day I'd get paid to like draw these iconic characters,

56
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.500
but then to not mess it up.
You know what I mean?

57
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:27.040
I think that's been everyone's mantra at blue sky through this whole process is

58
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.870
don't mess it up.
Don't mess it up.
Like please,
we can't mess it up.
So yeah,

59
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:34.270
it was,
um,
I mean,
especially our first,
you know,

60
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:39.271
we did all these trips up to Santa Rosa to work in the Schulz compound and you

61
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:39.851
know,

62
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:44.020
collaborate together and you've got all the drawings of the characters up on the

63
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:44.351
wall.

64
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:49.351
And here I am sitting at a table across from Craig Schultz and here's my paper

65
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:54.190
and my pencil announce like,
okay,
draw Charlie,
Charlie Brown.
I'm like,
Oh God,

66
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.000
please don't judge me.
You know?
And,

67
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:00.220
and the first few drawings I felt were horrible,

68
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:04.120
but Craig was very generous and very nice and Oh,
good job,
that looks great.

69
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:08.080
I'm like,
ah,
it's still probably took me a year to relax,
um,

70
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.520
to where I just felt like,
okay,
I can just draw them and it's,
and it's cool and,

71
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.750
and no one will kill me.
So,

72
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.880
<v 2>and those first weeks we were working with paper,
I mean,</v>

73
00:04:17.881 --> 00:04:21.450
so much of our storyboard work now was on San teaks and digital,

74
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.860
but our first trips up there to Santa Rosa,
we got out of the story pads,

75
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.030
markers,
uh,
and there was no undue delete.

76
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.320
You go to draw Charlie Brown and you start and fail.
It's a fail.

77
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.480
<v 4>Uh,
I'd love to talk about the kind of drawing style of it because there was,</v>

78
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.810
there's this wonderful element of it.
Where do we see as it's a three d film,

79
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.470
but it doesn't necessarily,
it's not in your face.
It's very,

80
00:04:45.471 --> 00:04:47.820
it felt very true to the poses.
The characters I love,

81
00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:50.630
like they're either profile or a profile or they're like head on.

82
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.260
And I think my favorite kind of little visual touches all the little like two d

83
00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:58.610
kind of accents.
Um,
can you guys talk about sort of developing that for it?

84
00:04:58.611 --> 00:05:00.770
Was it a technological challenge or was it just like,

85
00:05:00.771 --> 00:05:01.940
we got to have this in here.

86
00:05:01.941 --> 00:05:06.941
Let's figure out how to do it with just super easy and it wasn't super easy.

87
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.930
Uh,
you

88
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.081
<v 2>know,</v>

89
00:05:09.081 --> 00:05:12.800
what are the key when it comes from is that I thought there was an opportunity

90
00:05:12.801 --> 00:05:15.050
with computer animation to,
you know,

91
00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:17.600
create the world in a way that would be rich.

92
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.660
And yet it needed to be on style with what sparky Charles Schultz,

93
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.960
uh,
drew.

94
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.260
And so I knew walking into this that I'm asking the world peanuts fans who are

95
00:05:30.591 --> 00:05:34.910
going to go really see,
gee,
I don't know about that.
Uh,

96
00:05:34.911 --> 00:05:39.500
so we went overboard to make certain that everything we did in terms of our

97
00:05:39.501 --> 00:05:42.320
animation style or posing a,

98
00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:46.730
one of the mantras I had is I want to find the pen line in everything we do.

99
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.860
Even though we're using computer animation,

100
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.480
you can see in the style that we've chosen for Charlie Brown renamed the other

101
00:05:53.481 --> 00:05:54.200
characters.

102
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.430
You can see that little wiggly pen line in his mouth or little ink droplets for

103
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:02.780
eyes.
And that was a very purposeful decision to say,

104
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.760
we're asking the audience to walk with us into,
you know,

105
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.700
a three d presentation in this film.

106
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.650
We need to be very well anchored in everything else that we do in pose and

107
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.640
animation.
Uh,
even in the way we handled textures and materials.

108
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.040
<v 1>I actually would love to talk about the textures and materials because they
were,</v>

109
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.480
so,
it's,
this is such a nerdy thing,
but they were so like tech,

110
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.630
like I tangible almost like I felt like they'd be like a little fuzzy if I

111
00:06:27.631 --> 00:06:28.440
touched them,

112
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.640
but then the clothing felt very kind of realistic and the hair was very

113
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.190
appropriate for the style.
Um,
and it,

114
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.830
I don't know if it's necessarily something that has been in blue sky films

115
00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:40.540
before.
Did you guys kind of revamp that process a bit?
Or?

116
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.710
<v 2>We did.
We actually ratcheted when it comes to materials,</v>

117
00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:47.410
we ratcheted ourselves back and said,
you know,

118
00:06:47.411 --> 00:06:49.810
this is a particular style for this movie.

119
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.200
The character silhouettes have to stand out first and foremost.

120
00:06:53.201 --> 00:06:57.820
I want to see the silhouette of that Charlie Brown pose.
Uh,
but we thought,
well,

121
00:06:57.821 --> 00:06:59.230
we can add a little something.

122
00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:02.950
And I saw somebody brought up there Beagle and uh,

123
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.140
that is one of the,

124
00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:09.400
one of the reasons that I thought it would be exciting to use computer animation

125
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.430
to see snoopy with soft for many people came up to me and their memory of a

126
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.920
peanuts came from a plush toy.
You know,

127
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.130
and I thought if we could bring the characters to life and have some of that

128
00:07:21.131 --> 00:07:23.500
softness and tactile quality,

129
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.030
but what it required is that the texture is always sit back a little bit.

130
00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:28.661
It's a matter of fact,

131
00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:33.610
we got partway through the film and we were evaluating how the characters looked

132
00:07:33.611 --> 00:07:38.500
against the backgrounds.
And we,
I kind of reoriented our thinking to say,
look,

133
00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:40.960
we need to just kind of pull back.
So stylistically,

134
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:44.350
everything felt like it was in the same style and world.

135
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.530
<v 1>I thought one moment where the three d and the camera work also complimented
the,</v>

136
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:53.510
the new style very well was the,
uh,
aviation sequences.
Uh,
and I,

137
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:54.650
I was curious as to kind of,

138
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:58.760
they're very different than the kind of grounded in the real world of Charlie

139
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.030
Brown.
What was the approach to those,
the flying a sequences?

140
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:07.510
<v 2>Well,
it comes from the comic strip.
I'll tell you everything in this movie.
Uh,
it,</v>

141
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:12.590
the roots of any decision that we may comes from the comic strip.
And as we,

142
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:16.130
you know,
spend time in Santa Rosa had looked through,
you know,

143
00:08:16.131 --> 00:08:20.420
looked at original strips and we had access to all of the comic strips.

144
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.760
Uh,
if you look at any of the,

145
00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:27.761
a flying ace or any of the fantasy sequence or fantasy comic strips that Charles

146
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.380
Schultz drew,
he drew with more perspective.

147
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.700
All of a sudden you see roads going back,
you know,
into depth.
Uh,

148
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:39.200
there was a lot more ink,
you know,
in detail you'd see cobblestones and you know,

149
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:43.880
it just was a richer presentation in that pending style.
So for me,
I thought,

150
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:47.660
well,
here's the opportunity to unhinge the camera,
you know,

151
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:51.450
have a camera language that was more diagonals and dimensional and,

152
00:08:51.451 --> 00:08:55.040
and more camera movement because we're in Snoopy's imagination.

153
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.460
And the comic strip was kind of suggesting that.
And then Charlie Brown's world,

154
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:04.490
it's a more kind of formal composition that really is derived from the comic

155
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:05.664
strip.

156
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.550
<v 1>Okay.
You're an aviator.
You not,</v>

157
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.120
<v 3>well yeah,
for 40,
40,
50 years,
something like that.</v>

158
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:15.980
But the original concept for the movie was,
it was called snoopy first.

159
00:09:15.981 --> 00:09:20.460
The Red Baron original concept I had had was to take Johnny Brown's world,

160
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.550
which is classic to d right out of the Christmas special sorta.
I'll look.

161
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:27.540
And then my fantasy was to anything blend into the CG world.

162
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:30.540
So when I first started presenting the idea and I went to blue skies,

163
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:33.750
I knew they'd be able to handle the CG portion was they said,
well,

164
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:36.180
we don't do two d.
I'm like,
okay,
I have the friends the problem.

165
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.490
But Steve saw that problem with camera angles.

166
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.570
And so when you're in a Brown's world,
cause these two worlds dovetail together,

167
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:44.820
you already feel like you're looking at the comic strip to camera,

168
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:47.070
doesn't panel place.
It's not a lot of movement.

169
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.530
And even said from the camera up cycle,
is this,

170
00:09:49.531 --> 00:09:51.440
all I gotta do is just stick the camera,
leave it there on this.

171
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.640
That's sort of what it was until we get a snoopy Snoopy's mine.

172
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.940
And I think the unique thing is once you're in Snoopy's world,

173
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.420
we actually finally get to see what Snoopy's thinking.
And we see soupy flying,

174
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.570
the Halloween special and so forth.
We seem in the common,

175
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.800
but we've never really seen what goes on in his mind.

176
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.470
And this movie gave us a chance to Rudy,
you know,

177
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:11.130
see what snoopy really thinks and how this crazy dog and visualize the world.

178
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:14.280
And that was really exciting from a camera standpoint and a movie standpoint.

179
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.010
And from my writing standpoint,
everybody opened it up.

180
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.080
<v 2>Well,
the most fun,
Craig owns a biplane.
And early in the journey,</v>

181
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:25.590
he took me up in that by plane.
It's say,
okay,
here's what the dog fights like.

182
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:28.470
And we went up and we did stalls,
we did loops.

183
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.490
And there was amazing things that I learned from that just from us,

184
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.580
an audio perspective.
Like when you go up on a stall,
the sound,

185
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.590
the engine just cuts out and you go flying down anyway.
Uh,
that helped.

186
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.640
<v 3>And then to be honest and be authentic,
we had,
you know,</v>

187
00:10:43.641 --> 00:10:47.440
Skywalker sound found out that I,
Craig has a biplane,
oh,
can we record that?

188
00:10:47.441 --> 00:10:50.290
So we had Skywalker sound come out and we had Mike's put on the airplane,

189
00:10:50.291 --> 00:10:51.490
on the engine,
on the outside.

190
00:10:51.491 --> 00:10:55.420
We've got 10 people on the ground and we did a bunch of low passes and I had a

191
00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:57.110
girl in the cockpit,
don't all they are bad.

192
00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.340
So we've got all the doppler effect sounds.
And uh,

193
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.650
they were thrilled and we did a lot of authentic sounds within the movie.

194
00:11:02.651 --> 00:11:05.050
I think that most creative when we did the movie opens,

195
00:11:05.051 --> 00:11:08.120
you'll see a pin line go across the screen.
And,
uh,

196
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.310
what we did is we had our art director take the original pen that my dad used

197
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.920
and his age and his original paper used and I,

198
00:11:14.921 --> 00:11:18.430
Lucas San went up and recorded those pin line movements that are just exactly

199
00:11:18.431 --> 00:11:22.000
like my dad would have done as he's drawing the comic strip and we'd recorded

200
00:11:22.001 --> 00:11:22.621
ice skates,

201
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:26.260
says kids skate thrashy ice skating sounds from my dad's ice arena put into the

202
00:11:26.261 --> 00:11:28.930
movie.
So a lot of Nice little touches like that.

203
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.320
<v 1>Um,
I'd love to know,</v>

204
00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:35.130
and Karen it actually like to hear your thoughts on this first because I think

205
00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:38.160
it would probably be the easiest to kind of get,
oh,

206
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.220
I don't want to say like trapped in the shadow of but,

207
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.320
but keep reusing the original material as reference.

208
00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:45.780
But you guys are obviously bringing your own kind of story to this.

209
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.490
So I'd love to know for you,

210
00:11:47.491 --> 00:11:51.120
what was it like kind of striking a balance between the classic imagery of the

211
00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:54.100
original comics and then sort of your

212
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.820
<v 4>guys' own take on it?
Yeah,
that was definitely really hard,
especially for me.</v>

213
00:11:57.821 --> 00:12:01.090
Like I was saying like it was intimidating just wanting to draw the characters.

214
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:03.790
Exactly right,
exactly.
On model,

215
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:08.791
which when you're doing storyboarding for a feature that's typically not um,

216
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.520
really productive cause you kinda gotta work fast.
You know,
it's a very,

217
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.600
the work of a storyboard artists is to just Redo,
Redo,
Redo your,

218
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:21.130
just the first line of,
of the work.
You're testing things out.
If they don't work,

219
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.620
you know,
you didn't spend two months animating something,

220
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:25.720
you spent maybe a day or two and you can just throw it away.

221
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.700
So you got to work fast.
But I would just,
I mean honestly,
I'll,
I'll confess,

222
00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:34.870
I just traced for probably the first month or two,
I would go to the website,

223
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:39.370
find a Charlie brown pose and then just,
okay,
at least I know I'm not,

224
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.000
again,

225
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.470
disrespecting the tradition and the memory and the heritage or doing something

226
00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:44.981
crazy.

227
00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:49.540
And then I started to realize that that was really paralyzing me and not

228
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.300
enabling me to do my job the way I should,

229
00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:55.990
which is to be thinking of new stuff and thinking of gags and like pushing the

230
00:12:55.991 --> 00:13:00.070
envelope.
So I finally got over it and relaxed and I was like,
okay,

231
00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:03.070
his head's not perfect here,
but it still looks like Charlie Brown.

232
00:13:03.071 --> 00:13:07.570
So it was tricky.
It was tough.
It was not like any other thing I've worked on.

233
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:09.460
But,
uh,
it was awesome.

234
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:15.360
<v 2>I think also from a story perspective,
we wanted to strike this balance of a,</v>

235
00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:18.780
there can be moments for fans where you're like,
oh,

236
00:13:18.781 --> 00:13:21.180
I remember something like that from before,

237
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:26.540
but we didn't want the movie to be just a collection of a greatest hits from the

238
00:13:26.731 --> 00:13:31.650
past.
It's a feature film.
Craig and Brian and a Neil Giuliano,

239
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.900
the writing team,
you know,
craft at a feature film story with narrative drive,

240
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:40.680
character arc,
you know,
a real feature story.
The characters are,
you know,

241
00:13:40.681 --> 00:13:45.600
they're based on the characters we know.
So those,
those things don't change.
Uh,

242
00:13:45.601 --> 00:13:49.740
and if now and again we might intersect into a moment that we remember from the

243
00:13:49.741 --> 00:13:54.630
comic strip,
you know,
that's a nice little added beat.
But there were,
you know,

244
00:13:54.631 --> 00:13:57.480
the story is new.
So there are a lot of new things in there as well.

245
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.200
<v 4>But you know,
we also,
um,</v>

246
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.640
we really did push the envelope at times cause we would get beat together in

247
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:07.600
Santa Rosa.
It was usually a,
myself,
our head of story,
Jim Cameroon,

248
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.730
our animation supervisor,
Nick Bruno,

249
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.810
and we definitely did what animators do and you know,

250
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.640
Nick would jar Charlie brown naked and we,
you know,

251
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.910
put in a toilet gag and we all knew that none of these would see the light of

252
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:23.620
day,
nor should they,
but it's still,

253
00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:26.330
you kind of get it out of your system and you have fun with it and it just kind

254
00:14:26.331 --> 00:14:28.630
of helps you loosen up.
All in all.

255
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:33.160
<v 2>That's where Craig came in.
Yes.
That's when Craig learned that,</v>

256
00:14:33.161 --> 00:14:38.050
say the word no over and over and over again.
And he was always right.

257
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.700
Um,
I think one wonderful way though that you guys have kind of honored the

258
00:14:42.701 --> 00:14:47.420
tradition of it is bill Melendez is the voice of snoopy.
Oh yeah.
And uh,
how,

259
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.010
how did you guys do?
Well,
Craig and I made that trip down to his,

260
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.760
to his office.
Yeah.
That was something I already wanted to do when it,

261
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.320
when we're talking about the voices and it hadn't come up yet.

262
00:14:57.321 --> 00:14:59.570
And as we talked about snoopy and Woodstock and so forth,
I said,

263
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:02.300
would it be cool if we could get bill a credit in the movie?
You know,

264
00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:03.630
so we call Melendez studio.

265
00:15:03.631 --> 00:15:07.670
Steve and I went over there when we dug in to their archives and found out

266
00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:10.970
already how much stuff they had saved over the years of bill being snoopy and

267
00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:11.480
Woodstock.

268
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.990
And we had enough material to put in the movie and craft all the voices that we

269
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:18.650
needed.
So that was phenomenal.
I,
and I'm already proud that we did that for bill.

270
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.950
Well,
and it's,
I love honoring bill,

271
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.220
but when we put those clips into our first story reels,

272
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:29.270
there's no way we could have created anything as funny as charming.

273
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:34.040
He was amazing.
Uh,
you know,
they're just sounds that he,
that snoopy makes,

274
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:39.370
it's like comedy gold and there was no reason to recreate it.

275
00:15:39.741 --> 00:15:42.680
And we worked with Randy Tom.
He figured the formula out.

276
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.920
Randy works at Skywalker sound.
Um,
you know,

277
00:15:45.921 --> 00:15:48.860
so we could have if need be recreated.

278
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:51.560
But thankfully we use bill and you know,

279
00:15:51.561 --> 00:15:54.620
we all go through our lives and come across one or two people that you will

280
00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:57.860
never forget and blow bill minuses,
one of those type people.

281
00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.860
He was so big and bolster us and had his big mustache.

282
00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:04.490
He was always happy and it's like anyone that met bill would never forget bill.

283
00:16:04.491 --> 00:16:07.830
He was a tremendous person.
He passed away a couple years ago.
But uh,

284
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.950
I remember when I was like 10 years old,

285
00:16:09.951 --> 00:16:13.010
he took me out shotgun shooting trap shoot.
And he was tremendous.

286
00:16:13.011 --> 00:16:15.170
A trap shooting.
And I've never forgotten that.

287
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:17.270
50 years later I still remember going trap shooting with a bill.

288
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.880
And then can you talk a little bit about the Ed,

289
00:16:19.881 --> 00:16:23.660
the new boys cast because you've got some wonderful young actors and yes,

290
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:28.180
I couldn't be more proud of a,
of the group of actors,

291
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.860
all kids and where it starts,

292
00:16:30.861 --> 00:16:33.680
Craig and I talked about this at the very beginning.
You know,

293
00:16:33.681 --> 00:16:36.680
Charlie Brown for me was Charlie Brown from the Christmas special.

294
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.580
Linus was Linus from the Christmas special,
the Halloween special,

295
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.700
those voices imprinted on me.

296
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.900
And as there were specials that came later as a kid even,
I'd be like,

297
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:52.310
well that's not quite the Charlie Brown.
And you know,
that I remember.

298
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.760
So it was one of the things I was most nervous about.

299
00:16:55.761 --> 00:16:59.900
And in particular I was nervous about as casting a Linus because Linus has this

300
00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:04.901
beautiful little list and a Christian Kaplan who's our casting director,

301
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.510
scoured the country,
thousands of audition tapes.

302
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.960
Thankfully I didn't have to listen to all of,
you know,
thousands of them.

303
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.070
He narrowed them down.
Uh,

304
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:18.080
but I'm so happy with the voices that we've found and,

305
00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:21.080
and the objective was to try to match the cadence,

306
00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:24.980
the rhythm and the kind of vocal timber of,
uh,

307
00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:29.870
of those original characters.
And when we found Linus with that list,

308
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:34.100
I'm like,
oh my gosh.
He came to blue sky,
uh,

309
00:17:34.101 --> 00:17:35.590
two weeks ago.
And,
uh,

310
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.070
they were just touring him around the studio because often we do our recording

311
00:17:40.071 --> 00:17:44.800
outside of our studio and he was walking around the state.
Every animator,

312
00:17:44.801 --> 00:17:48.770
it's like,
oh,
say something.
Say Charlie Brown,
they just wanted to hear Linus,

313
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:49.683
his voice.

314
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:52.150
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

315
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.971
<v 3>Yeah.
It is amazing.
I mean,</v>

316
00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:56.930
I was fresh off the blanket movie where we had to do the casting and I

317
00:17:56.931 --> 00:18:00.590
discovered that the best way to get oh dish and the kids was not having to come

318
00:18:00.591 --> 00:18:03.200
in and read lines in the Christmas special Halloween special.

319
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.350
The best way was to have them come in and simply introduce themselves,

320
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.900
tell me what school they go to,
what grade they're in,
what their hobbies are,

321
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.590
and invariably when we cast that movie and this movie within,

322
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:14.630
I say no more than five words.

323
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.240
I knew if they were right or wrong and you just start chucking them out.
Nope,

324
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.250
nope,
nope,
nope.
When they get in the acting,
acting,

325
00:18:19.251 --> 00:18:22.640
it's a little different because then a lot of people can mimic stuff and parody

326
00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.360
stuff,
but when you,
you want them to just kind of be genuine,
heartfelt,

327
00:18:26.361 --> 00:18:28.940
and not do much acting in our kids I think are spot on.

328
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:32.210
Everybody's seen the movies where they said,
boy,
those that cast,
it's dead on.

329
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.430
<v 2>You know?
It's interesting working with kids and I love working with kids.</v>

330
00:18:37.431 --> 00:18:40.490
I've coached soccer my entire life.
And uh,

331
00:18:40.491 --> 00:18:44.990
what is amazing is they have such rich imaginations.
When we record,

332
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:46.870
we don't have any footage,
uh,

333
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.600
because we're recording the voices and then we animate to those voices and then

334
00:18:50.601 --> 00:18:52.070
the movie starts to take shape.

335
00:18:52.071 --> 00:18:57.071
So I'm asking any actor to go on a journey with me in a room that has just four

336
00:18:57.381 --> 00:19:01.760
walls and a microphone,
and we talk about what this scenario is,

337
00:19:01.761 --> 00:19:02.660
what's going on.

338
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:08.020
And they were amazing in the way that they could imagine themselves there and

339
00:19:08.151 --> 00:19:10.280
create.
It's like,
it was so good,

340
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.980
<v 3>easy for them.
Um,
but it was good fun though.</v>

341
00:19:12.981 --> 00:19:15.740
Recording sessions where a great time.
The other cool thing,

342
00:19:15.741 --> 00:19:18.770
there's a little bit of Trivia there is that the movie's called the peanuts

343
00:19:18.771 --> 00:19:19.830
movie by Schultz and I,

344
00:19:19.831 --> 00:19:22.530
and the by Schultz is important because there's four generations is Schultz

345
00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:26.270
solvency.
90% of the movie comes from my dad's comic strip.
Then there's myself,

346
00:19:26.271 --> 00:19:29.570
his son,
and his grandson,
which is my son.
But beyond that,

347
00:19:29.571 --> 00:19:32.060
there's this great grandson is the voice of a little character.

348
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.940
We call it little kid that's a little kindergartener,
good character.

349
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.480
And he was cool because his voice is distinctly different than the rest of the

350
00:19:38.481 --> 00:19:41.270
kids in the movie.
You recognize that this isn't a voice I've heard before.

351
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.730
And uh,
it was fun putting anything into the film.

352
00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.790
<v 1>Um,
I think one of my last questions for you is,
um,</v>

353
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.890
why do you think we need Charlie Brown in this day and age and what is one of

354
00:19:51.891 --> 00:19:55.100
the things that you were most excited for audiences to kind of connect with with

355
00:19:55.101 --> 00:19:56.180
this new film?

356
00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.490
<v 2>Tell you,
for me,
and I've grown to appreciate Charlie Brown so much more.</v>

357
00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:02.673
Uh,

358
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:07.430
what I love about what Craig and Brian and Neil did is they looked at the,

359
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.760
you know,
50 years of Charlie Brown said,
well,
you know,

360
00:20:10.761 --> 00:20:12.500
what are the qualities that he has?

361
00:20:12.501 --> 00:20:16.520
There were comic strips off and where he had to put up with Sally,
his nagging,

362
00:20:16.521 --> 00:20:19.490
you know,
little sister.
And,
and from that,

363
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.720
we've got a wonderful theme in the story where we get to hold up the qualities

364
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:27.740
that he's always had,
that Charlie Brown is kind,
he's honest,

365
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.590
and most of all,
he perseveres.

366
00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.890
He's the guy that never wins that baseball game,

367
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.630
that kite never flies.

368
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:40.660
But he picked himself back up and he tries again and he became kind of the,

369
00:20:41.061 --> 00:20:44.750
uh,
the spirit of the making of this movie,
at least for me.
You know,
when,

370
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.800
when we were trying to work on something,
you know,

371
00:20:47.801 --> 00:20:52.150
we would have one of those failures like,
oh,
that doesn't look right.
Or,
you know,

372
00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:55.690
I go home.
It's like,
oh,
we're going to do this.
If it was a bad day,

373
00:20:55.691 --> 00:20:58.360
I'd put on my Charlie Brown sweatshirt the next day.
It's like,

374
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.130
today's a day we're going to win the game.

375
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.000
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

376
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.290
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

377
00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:07.170
I don't think the very first day I went back to blue sky and we just met with

378
00:21:07.171 --> 00:21:09.780
Steve and so forth that we had the whole blue sky team came in and asked him the

379
00:21:09.781 --> 00:21:11.550
same question.
I said,
how many of you,

380
00:21:11.551 --> 00:21:13.310
the audience think the Charter Brenda's bald?

381
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.440
And probably 60% of the people put their hands.
If I thought,
oh my God,

382
00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:19.970
I'm in trouble already.
And then we got to design Charlie Brown.

383
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.340
But I think I kind of led sort of a charter brown light because we knew the son

384
00:21:23.341 --> 00:21:26.070
of a celebrity,
for example,
you have a lot of people come to your house,

385
00:21:26.071 --> 00:21:28.740
your kids are coming to all of the time.
You always got to ask yourself,
you know,

386
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.700
do they really like me for who I am?

387
00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:34.350
Or do they like we just because of being around Neil Sparky's house and the

388
00:21:34.351 --> 00:21:37.440
swimming pool,
everything else and the journey and Charlie Brown,
he's,
he's,

389
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.600
he's dealing with that same thing,
which we all deal with.

390
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.180
Am I like to people like me for who I am and so forth.

391
00:21:42.181 --> 00:21:43.870
So we explored that journey and,

392
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:45.840
and Charlie Brown's world of what it would be like.

393
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.760
I also was interested in the journey with how people see yourselves and see each

394
00:21:50.761 --> 00:21:53.640
others as,
as small children when they see each other.
You know,

395
00:21:53.641 --> 00:21:57.960
I remember being in third grade and seeing this girl and I'd literally felt like

396
00:21:57.961 --> 00:22:00.990
I was in love when I was in third grade and I look at third graders now and

397
00:22:00.991 --> 00:22:01.830
there are these little tiny think,

398
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.260
how could I possibly have been in love with third grade?

399
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.560
But those little kids have those complex feelings.
And that's again,

400
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.690
when my dad expressed in the comic strip and we kind of carried that theme in at

401
00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:15.150
the movie that they do have those complex thoughts and a very adult little,

402
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.033
there is small,

403
00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.160
<v 4>big heads.
I think for me,
um,</v>

404
00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:25.400
why we still need Charlie Brown very much is he's,
he's a,
he's just a good guy.

405
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:28.580
Like when you walk out of the movie,
you have this,
um,

406
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.300
it just has a very timeless feeling.
You know,
you're not in the modern day,

407
00:22:32.301 --> 00:22:36.290
you're not like a hundred years ago.
It just kinda feels timeless.

408
00:22:36.291 --> 00:22:40.550
And he is just someone you either know or you are,
you know,

409
00:22:40.551 --> 00:22:45.440
we all try for things and fail as,
as Craig and Steve said,
but,

410
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:50.240
but he's,
he's just a good guy and there's not snark in this movie,
you know,

411
00:22:50.241 --> 00:22:54.740
there's not pop culture references.
Um,
it's just,

412
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.700
it's just a very,
in a way,
a very simple and plain story.
You know,

413
00:22:58.701 --> 00:23:03.080
he's not going to go to another planet and like save the Galaxy,
but what kid is,

414
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:07.790
you know,
and,
and so it's a very aspirational movie in a,
in a different way.

415
00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.930
You know,
it's,
it's,
it's going to tell every kid who has a bad day.
Like,
you know,

416
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.960
it's all right because I was a good guy at the end of the day,
you know.

417
00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:19.310
So we have time for just a few audience questions and Kevin here is going to ask

418
00:23:19.311 --> 00:23:24.170
them on behalf of the Internet and hello.
So,
um,

419
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:27.280
<v 2>I want to start with all three of you.
And so what is,</v>

420
00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.000
which is your favorite character and why?
And Karen,
maybe,

421
00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:34.750
which one was your favorite to work with?
And also,
uh,
Craig,

422
00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:39.220
maybe talk about also,
um,
who your father's favorite character was to write for.

423
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.240
<v 4>Okay.
Well,
I mean I think from a pure animation,</v>

424
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:50.180
snoopy is going to be where you can have the most freedom,
you know,

425
00:23:50.181 --> 00:23:52.830
freedom of movement and the craziness of the,

426
00:23:52.831 --> 00:23:56.180
the stuff he can do that you just can't do with 'em or shouldn't do.

427
00:23:56.181 --> 00:23:59.270
Maybe the human characters.
But yeah,

428
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:03.240
free snoopy is just pure animation and what stocks really fun to do too.
Like he,

429
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.820
people kind of forget about them as the little side,
but he's,
he's so much fun.

430
00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:11.000
And then you get the Eagle Scouts in there and it's this group of little birds

431
00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:13.850
and the possibilities are endless.
And uh,

432
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.900
some of the snoopy Woodstock scenes in the,
in the movie or the best,

433
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:20.630
in my opinion,
they're just cause there's no dialogue.

434
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.100
You can't use it as a crutch.

435
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.130
You can't like send it in for punch up for new funny lines.

436
00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:30.131
It's like pure just action and gags and slapstick and fun.

437
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.633
<v 3>Yeah.
I think for me,</v>

438
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:35.780
I think as it was almost profound for me is it as Steve's team got the animation

439
00:24:35.781 --> 00:24:39.920
done?
Yeah.
We have characters from the very first comic strip.
We have suremy,

440
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:41.210
we have violent,
we have patty,

441
00:24:41.211 --> 00:24:44.510
we have all the classical characters and I literally fell in love with him all

442
00:24:44.511 --> 00:24:47.630
over again because of the way you see it now in three d and Cgi,

443
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.430
they become much more identifiable and the movie,
I love Sally,

444
00:24:52.431 --> 00:24:55.610
I've always loved salary.
I think she's,
she's hilarious and and so forth.

445
00:24:55.611 --> 00:24:58.070
Then a funny Sally stories,
we were casting the voice.

446
00:24:58.071 --> 00:25:01.820
I walked in and they didn't know who I was.
It was my first time out to,
uh,

447
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.460
to watch some voices been record and she was sitting there on the island said,

448
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:08.750
I said,
I saw your,
you're playing Sally.
She says,
yes.
I said,
we'll keep,

449
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.440
can you read me off?

450
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.590
One of the lines from the Christmas special and she just went into the speech

451
00:25:12.591 --> 00:25:15.800
and she could do the full blown every line from the Christmas social she had

452
00:25:15.801 --> 00:25:19.800
memorized and you just rattled them out and certain she,
her name is Mary,

453
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.230
and she was just phenomenal to work with.
And uh,

454
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.580
later on she found out who I was,
but uh,
that was fun.

455
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:30.680
Give her a little bit of stage and she'll fill it up.
She's gone.
Yeah.

456
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:34.370
And the second part of the question was maybe who your father's favorite

457
00:25:34.371 --> 00:25:36.050
character was to write for.

458
00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.930
I never liked to speak for what my father would have thought and,
and so forth.

459
00:25:38.931 --> 00:25:41.000
All I can say is that for the most part,

460
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.440
my dad will typically say that most of his personality,
he was Charlie Brown,

461
00:25:45.441 --> 00:25:47.810
Charlie Martin,
who we,
who is what,
who he was.

462
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.420
And snoopy was who he would've liked to have been.
I mean,

463
00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:53.360
the fantasy the snoopy has,
I think we all have these fantasies.
And I,

464
00:25:53.361 --> 00:25:56.960
my dad obviously live in that same kind of world and that's probably the easy

465
00:25:56.961 --> 00:25:58.070
way to sum it up.
He was really,

466
00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.490
every character was a piece of my dad at some level.

467
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.650
But I think the majority of my dad,
this is Charlie Brown,

468
00:26:03.651 --> 00:26:04.820
which is not a bad thing to say.

469
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:08.220
<v 2>Um,
and Steve,
uh,</v>

470
00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:10.590
did you guys ever consider a different type of animation for this?

471
00:26:10.591 --> 00:26:14.490
I know blue skies,
obviously a 3-d stew,
you know,
CGI studio,

472
00:26:14.491 --> 00:26:18.300
but any ever consider stop motion or two D for this?
No,

473
00:26:18.301 --> 00:26:22.560
but we added a lot of two d animation to the movie.
Uh,

474
00:26:22.561 --> 00:26:26.340
so matter of fact,
when I'm,
some of my favorite moments in the film,

475
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.610
a Charlie Brown,
whenever he imagined dreams,

476
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:35.190
a little thought bubble will pop up.
It's all two D it looks to me,

477
00:26:35.191 --> 00:26:38.670
I always say it's the,
it's the daily strip.
So it's black and white.

478
00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.280
It's done in pen and ink.
Uh,

479
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:45.310
to me it's some of the nicest peanuts animation,
uh,

480
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:49.830
ever done because it really looks like Sparky's pen line come to life.
Uh,

481
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:54.360
and we ended up adding a lot more two d then I think we ever thought we would,

482
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:58.590
uh,
starting in the movie.
So there's always lots of little speed lines,
you know,

483
00:26:58.591 --> 00:27:02.010
uh,
Lucy gets bonked on the head with a typewriter and of course you have to have

484
00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:05.830
those little flowery bonks and type,
ah,
graphy uh,

485
00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:10.770
so there's plenty of two d mixed in with the 3-d.
Um,
but you know,

486
00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:12.150
our paintbrush.
And,

487
00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.270
and I felt that there was something we could do with three d that would bring

488
00:27:15.271 --> 00:27:18.120
this world to life in a,
in a different way.

489
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.270
<v 3>I,
he did and he did a wonderful job.</v>

490
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.390
There's a transitioning now Charlie Brown's world to be Santa World,

491
00:27:24.391 --> 00:27:25.710
which we struggle with for a while.

492
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.800
And Steve would back in the studies what Melendez had done it again.
We've,

493
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.260
not only did he go to my dad's comic strip,
we also did a lot of,

494
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:34.760
and Melendez and Melendez had these phenomenal color backgrounds,

495
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:36.940
almost psychedelic stuff from the 70s.

496
00:27:36.941 --> 00:27:39.090
He put it in there and Steve's team find a way to blend that.

497
00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:41.010
And with three d it really looks wonderful.

498
00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.620
<v 2>So your,
um,</v>

499
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:49.340
your slides show a lot of analysis that I've not seen before.

500
00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.600
Are you going to have a tie in with the Shults museum so that you can present

501
00:27:53.601 --> 00:27:57.320
some of the analysis,
whether that's the historical change through time,

502
00:27:57.321 --> 00:28:01.460
it was a really nice layout or how are,
you know,
how is,

503
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.180
how are the characters laid out on the page?
I've never seen that before,

504
00:28:05.181 --> 00:28:08.930
although I've looked at all this trips.
Right.
What's your tie in with the museum?

505
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:14.110
There's an exhibition that's up right now at the museum that has even a few of

506
00:28:15.141 --> 00:28:18.170
the slides that are from my presentation.
You know,

507
00:28:18.171 --> 00:28:22.320
it's kind of done up in museum style,
uh,
kind of talking about,
uh,

508
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:26.470
some of the journey and uh,
they've,
they've done a wonderful interactive,

509
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.750
a part of the museum as well that's kind of tied into the movie.

510
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:34.700
And I've done a couple of talks.
I gave a talk there.
Well,
we had a whole team,

511
00:28:34.701 --> 00:28:38.360
a whole panel.
Karen was there.
Uh,
we were there two weeks ago,

512
00:28:38.361 --> 00:28:39.830
I think it was a,

513
00:28:39.831 --> 00:28:44.831
and did a panel and I had done a similar kind of presentation to all of their

514
00:28:44.901 --> 00:28:49.580
major donors.
The museum is such a part of this journey for us.
So,

515
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.760
um,
yeah,
maybe there'll be more after that.

516
00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.900
<v 3>Yeah,
that's for those of you who haven't been up there,</v>

517
00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:56.750
we just had an exhibit called animating comics,

518
00:28:56.751 --> 00:29:01.010
which kind of showed how the early stuff was done and then that transitioned

519
00:29:01.011 --> 00:29:02.030
into the blue sky exhibit.

520
00:29:02.031 --> 00:29:04.910
Right now we're sort of just putting up right now we have a couple of great

521
00:29:04.911 --> 00:29:07.700
photo op things where you can literally get on the dog house and behind you it's

522
00:29:07.701 --> 00:29:10.340
going to be the Eiffel Tower,
the clouds and get a nice picture yourself.

523
00:29:10.341 --> 00:29:11.480
Sit down and Snoopy's dog house,

524
00:29:11.481 --> 00:29:14.870
which is a full blown three d model they made up there.
It's a,

525
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.760
it's a beautiful exhibit being installed at this time.

526
00:29:16.761 --> 00:29:18.350
So come on up to Santa Rosa,
see us.

527
00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:21.581
<v 2>Um,</v>

528
00:29:21.581 --> 00:29:25.540
so I have so many fond memories of the music from the specialist and I'd love to

529
00:29:25.541 --> 00:29:30.150
hear some of your thoughts about,
uh,
uh,
how you planned or,
uh,
how you,
uh,

530
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:33.030
decided on musical choices for the movie.
You know,

531
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:37.390
it follows the overriding objective for the film,
which was,

532
00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.550
uh,
this is a new story,
but based on characters we've loved,
uh,

533
00:29:42.551 --> 00:29:47.380
we want moments that are those touchstones for fans.
And so,
you know,

534
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:51.910
first and foremost,
a Christoph back was our composer on the film.
And as a,

535
00:29:51.911 --> 00:29:56.350
I spoke with him as we discussed the music for the movie,
first and foremost,

536
00:29:56.351 --> 00:30:01.180
the mute the music needed to support the storytelling.
Uh,
but that said,

537
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.290
there are moments that we have jazz combo.
You,

538
00:30:04.291 --> 00:30:08.310
you can't have a movie like this without Linus and Lucy theme.

539
00:30:08.311 --> 00:30:12.690
So we have Vince Guaraldi [inaudible] original performance,
you know,

540
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.490
in a couple of important moments in the film.

541
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.220
And then we also,
uh,

542
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.250
I had the chance to work with Megan trainer,
uh,

543
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.490
who is a contemporary artists,
uh,

544
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:29.080
and she really seemed to capture the spirit of Charlie Brown and peanuts and

545
00:30:29.081 --> 00:30:32.050
wrote two original songs.
We originally,
uh,

546
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:36.820
I was working with her to write one song for the film in one particular area

547
00:30:36.821 --> 00:30:41.230
that I thought she would just be right for.
And she did that and it was amazing.

548
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.840
And then she got to know the story.

549
00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:48.580
And this Charlie Brown story just kind of sunk in with her and she wrote this

550
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:51.910
other song just out of the blue,
sent me a demo,
said,
you know,

551
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:55.420
it just came to me because I was so taken by the story.

552
00:30:55.421 --> 00:30:59.410
And so make certain to stay through the early part of the credits.

553
00:30:59.411 --> 00:31:03.790
Both songs are in there and kind of their full form.
Uh,
so it's been quite a mix.

554
00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:07.180
You know,
there are times in the story where the f you know,

555
00:31:07.181 --> 00:31:10.990
the power of a full orchestra is the way to underscore the Amo,
you know,

556
00:31:10.991 --> 00:31:12.130
that particular moment.

557
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.220
And then there are other places where the jazz combo does it.

558
00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.840
And then there were places where Megan trainor song actually helps service the

559
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:22.480
story.
And that was what was most important.

560
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:27.990
<v 5>Thank you.
I think this is our last question.
So,
uh,</v>

561
00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:31.720
first of all,
I really would like to thank you all for doing this.

562
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:36.510
And I've been a penis fan for over 40 years.
I grew up with this and um,

563
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.030
I watched penis in three different languages in four different countries.

564
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.050
So this is a huge to me personally.
Um,

565
00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:47.440
and I actually spent a whole day at the museum yesterday,
saw the beautiful exit,

566
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.930
got the picture done,
wearing the gear.

567
00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.960
I'm probably always the oldest person to do that,
but I didn't care.
Uh,

568
00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:58.570
I've doubted my question to you,
especially to,
to Craig.

569
00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:02.110
Um,
your dad passed away in 2000 and um,

570
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:07.060
I know that he made it clear actually even in his interview that you guys

571
00:32:07.061 --> 00:32:11.020
actually the children and the father agreed that there will be no more of

572
00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:15.730
drawing of peanuts.
So,
um,
but now to see this,

573
00:32:15.731 --> 00:32:19.450
this beautiful,
but so as an a lifetime fan,

574
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.480
my greatest concern for the peanuts franchise and this legacy is that how are we

575
00:32:25.631 --> 00:32:29.620
going to just somehow continue this into the 21st century?

576
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.550
Because this is something that started in the 1940s and,
and the,

577
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:38.110
there's a generation that growing up watching this really specific like sensory

578
00:32:38.111 --> 00:32:43.100
and sensory cartoons,
this is something different.
Um,
so therefore,

579
00:32:43.101 --> 00:32:45.950
I think this is beautiful thing.
But also I would like to ask you,

580
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:50.750
what is the plan for this franchise?
Are you guys now the children and,

581
00:32:50.751 --> 00:32:55.670
and um,
and Mrs. Schultz agreed to create more,
a little bit different stories.

582
00:32:55.671 --> 00:32:57.920
Is it okay,
are you going to continue?

583
00:32:57.921 --> 00:33:02.921
This is a momentum and are you going to keep going on to create more peanuts,

584
00:33:03.351 --> 00:33:06.230
legacy that will be more suitable to the 21st century?

585
00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.870
<v 3>Well,
I think,
let me kind of address a couple of these things.
Uh,
number one,</v>

586
00:33:10.871 --> 00:33:13.600
as far as the commerce strip,
you know,
we,
we feel the commerce,

587
00:33:13.601 --> 00:33:15.580
Europe was like the cost.

588
00:33:15.581 --> 00:33:18.670
Those are you not gonna have somebody else come in and try to copy Picasso.
So,

589
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.810
you know,
we knew that the commerce trip was sacrosanct.
The,

590
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:25.450
and the family met with an attorney back in the 70s and we told her,
dad,

591
00:33:25.451 --> 00:33:26.620
you said we don't,
you know,
did,

592
00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.280
my dad was going to have somebody else do the common ship when he passed on and

593
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:32.470
you know,
just so have income for the family.
And the family said,
no day,

594
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.650
we don't want anyone at all.
This comes,
this is your work.
You've done this.
Every,

595
00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.170
every strip,
every letter is strictly years.

596
00:33:38.171 --> 00:33:40.750
We would never have somebody even thinking about drawing the comic strip.

597
00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.930
And the other hand,
you know,
there are peanuts fans.
We all love peanuts.

598
00:33:43.931 --> 00:33:47.200
We want penis to continue.
So they are becomes dilemma.
How do you continue?

599
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:49.570
How do you make peanuts continue,
you know,
without,

600
00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.510
without doing something new with the commerce service,
again,
we've been,

601
00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:55.680
we've been really blessed and lucky that all the newspapers have continued to

602
00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:56.830
rise to the commerce ships.

603
00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.860
And I find that the comic strips today or is as relevant as they were in the

604
00:33:59.861 --> 00:34:02.590
1960 [inaudible] the 1950s,
the themes applied all of us,

605
00:34:02.591 --> 00:34:06.610
the messages at the same,
it's all about heart and,
and,
and so forth.
Um,

606
00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:09.580
when it comes to the movie,
you know,
we want to bring in a new generation.

607
00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.770
Do you say person disappeared?
Kids that are all just,

608
00:34:11.771 --> 00:34:14.410
we're working on their iPhone and IPAD.
They don't see the old content.

609
00:34:14.411 --> 00:34:16.900
So the best way to do that is do you have a via creative vehicle,

610
00:34:16.901 --> 00:34:21.220
it's going to drive them back to that media.
And,
and my hope for the movie,

611
00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:24.940
my main hope was at the movie would be the Rock in the pond.

612
00:34:24.941 --> 00:34:28.000
And the ripple effect was going to be what's going to drive all you people after

613
00:34:28.001 --> 00:34:31.380
seeing the movie to wonder,
Gosh,
she's a little cruel Sally.

614
00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:33.280
She just seems more interesting.
I need to know more about,

615
00:34:33.281 --> 00:34:36.100
or I need to know more about [inaudible] go back and read the conscious of the

616
00:34:36.101 --> 00:34:39.430
bugs and refund the message that my dad created.
Cause this is just a tiny,

617
00:34:39.431 --> 00:34:41.410
tiny sampling of what that world is all about.

618
00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:44.130
<v 5>Thank you all so much.
And uh,</v>

619
00:34:44.131 --> 00:34:46.110
everyone go enjoy the peanuts movie and visit the penis.

620
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:50.430
<v 0>There's also museum.
Thanks for joining us today.
Thank you for having us.</v>

621
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.890
