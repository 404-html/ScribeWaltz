00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.540
Welcome to talk to Google.
I'm Kevin Belk and I'm Dana Han Klein.

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.570
And today we're welcoming the cast of Warner Bros,
new movie entourage.

3
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.920
So you know them as Ari Vincent Chase,
Eric Murphy and turtle.

4
00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:16.900
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to Google Jeremy Piven,

5
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.010
<v 1>Kevin Connolly
and director,
creator,
writer,
producer,</v>

6
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:26.844
Doug Allen.
Yeah,

7
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.680
take a seat.
We'll go down bro.

8
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.230
Hi
Audi.
I liked them.

9
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.310
<v 2>Alrighty.
So welcome to go guys.
Uh,
such a great job in the movie.</v>

10
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:51.900
So let's give a round of applause for that

11
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.730
<v 1>great film.</v>

12
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.031
<v 3>You know,
Doug,</v>

13
00:00:58.031 --> 00:01:00.220
you did such a great job of giving each character kind of their own sub plot

14
00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:03.790
that fed in Vince is,
and it was just,
it was really,
really good.
And you know,

15
00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:06.640
catching the audience audience up to exactly where they need it to be if they

16
00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:07.421
hadn't seen the series,

17
00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:09.750
but they did kind of getting them up to date with their characters.

18
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:13.330
So can I want to go through the all you guys and talk about how the evolution of

19
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:16.540
your characters over the series right into the movie.
And you know,
turtle,

20
00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:19.090
I kind of want to start with you,
Jerry.
Uh,
you know,

21
00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:21.700
you're always probably the slowest character to kind of evolved throughout the

22
00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:22.534
series.

23
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.060
<v 0>Um,
but then,
you know,
oh,
turtle is a terrorist.</v>

24
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.040
I sat in the back row so you didn't call on me first.

25
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.120
That was my plan and you just blew me up.
So continue,

26
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.090
I got notes from the studio wants it.
Otherwise,
uh,
no,
but you,

27
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:38.070
the biggest growth throughout the series,
especially once it

28
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.990
<v 3>hit,
you know,
season six about and you're,
you know,
kind of world exploded with,</v>

29
00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:43.640
you know,
meeting up with Mark Cuban.

30
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:45.620
So can you talk about the evolution of your characters?

31
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.330
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah.
I,
you know,
I think,
uh,
I also think he maybe had the most room to grow.</v>

32
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:52.220
If you look at turtle in season one,

33
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:56.090
he was a negotiating with a girl to make out with him and they'll show her with

34
00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:59.020
Vince eats breakfast in the morning too,
you know,

35
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.000
chasing after Ronda Rousey in,
in the movie.

36
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:06.920
And also he was making $200 a week is as the driver and then sold the Tequila

37
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:08.830
company with Mark Cuban and made millions of dollars.

38
00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:12.260
It's one of my favorite lines.
Kevin Dillon is Johnny drama,

39
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.120
shockingly says turtles a millionaire.
And uh,

40
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.110
it's kind of plays itself out in the movie where he gets caught in this romantic

41
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.430
or business angle with,
with Rhonda.
And Doug's done an amazing job.

42
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.320
Evolution.
Ising that's not a word I know.
Turtle.
We've got smart people,

43
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.950
<v 0>great crowd by the way.
Great.
I know I can't slip.
I can't slip where it's,</v>

44
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:37.020
I make up by you guys.
That's not fair.

45
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.200
<v 2>They do it.
How about that?
Jerry's disrupting the vocabulary,
isn't he?</v>

46
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.810
Uh,
well,
you know,
one,

47
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.370
one thing that Vince is supposed to do is be a solid,

48
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.680
steadfast leader for the rest of the guys.
He's,
the example is the rock.

49
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.890
And,
um,
and,
and he is sort of this,
you know,
this,

50
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.910
<v 4>this,
this,
this is grounding this.
He's,</v>

51
00:03:05.911 --> 00:03:07.990
he's the grounded part that

52
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.320
<v 2>all of the other guys swirl around.
So,
you know,
I,</v>

53
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:14.410
I've always really enjoyed bringing that aspect of the character,
the Zen,

54
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:17.500
like quality,
this nonchalance and you know,

55
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:20.800
really his evolution is in his career.

56
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.830
And of course in the movie now he not only wants to act but also to direct and

57
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:28.220
that seems like,
uh,
you know,
the,

58
00:03:28.221 --> 00:03:33.100
the last thing an agent wants to hear their client declare,
um,

59
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.410
but really sets the whole movie in emotion.

60
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.540
<v 4>Beautiful Segue and a jet.
Mr Jeremy Piven over here with Ari gold.</v>

61
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.810
<v 1>Yeah.
All right,
good.</v>

62
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.000
<v 4>These are my people,
man.
This is my demographic right here.
I love it.</v>

63
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.670
As for stock as response.
Exactly.
Um,

64
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.620
if you guys only knew what a caveman I was,
I mean,
I'm on a keypad.

65
00:03:56.621 --> 00:04:00.490
I'm just a disaster,
so it's pathetic.
Um,

66
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.400
Ari had basically one seen the pilot a really great season,

67
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.690
a great moment with Kevin Conley.
Was He at Coi?

68
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.100
And um,

69
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.400
he was a seemingly a complete and utter pig that was cheating on his wife with a

70
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:22.360
sports illustrated model.
But the reality was,
Doug,
did you always,

71
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.270
was that a mistake or did you,
did you know that he was going to be,

72
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:28.240
what happened with that?
I never thought we'd go past the pilot,
so I just,

73
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.540
I just wrote the following slide I could come up with and then I'm like,
wow,

74
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:35.200
if this guy's this better guy,
it's not going to be great.
And,
and uh,

75
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:39.820
obviously we cast a Perry Reeves is Mrs Ari and she crushed it.
Yeah.

76
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.720
Amazing.
Um,
and Ari is,
is,

77
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.860
is one of these guys who,
um,
you know,
we'll do,

78
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:50.560
it's by any means necessary to get the job done.

79
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:55.561
He is a rageaholic and very reactive and a is an equal opportunity offender and

80
00:04:57.251 --> 00:05:01.090
says the unsayable.
And I think that's one of the reasons why people love him.

81
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.300
By the end of the series,
he realized that the thing,

82
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.510
the things that meant the most to him in this life for his wife and family,

83
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.320
so he was willing to give up his livelihood for which you never thought Ari

84
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:15.760
would ever do.
And that's where we pick up,
you know,
with him at the movie.

85
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.210
And,
um,
he is continuously trying to evolve.

86
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.090
And that's what I thought was brilliant about the movie was like doing a

87
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:26.950
spirituality tape,
having Ari gold,
attempting to be spiritual is,

88
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.390
is ridiculous and was really,
really fun to play.
And Doug,

89
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:36.391
just the look of horror as I was destroying a $250,000 Mercedes,

90
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.560
you know,
Jerry,
Jeremy has broken a lot of things on the set.
Um,
you know,

91
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:44.440
we kind of try to bring fake computers and stuff,
but they don't look good.

92
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:46.780
He's thrown him across the floor and you know what he really does?

93
00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:50.740
He gets so into it and immerses himself,
you know,
really,

94
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:54.840
really deep and it's incredible to watch.
So.
Gotcha.
And how about your just,
uh,

95
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.980
for the writing process with the creating of the character's and kind of the

96
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.813
<v 3>revolution?</v>

97
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.850
<v 5>Well,
I mean,
you know,
evolution,</v>

98
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.300
it's a funny thing because the critics always want to talk evolution and actors

99
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.850
really want to talk evolution.
But for me,
you know,

100
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.710
this is a show about childhood best friends and really as you guys don't,

101
00:06:10.711 --> 00:06:13.810
most of them don't change that much.
You know,
you usually go,
wow,

102
00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:17.860
he's the same as he was.
Then there's a couple,
I mean,
Jer,
Jerry screwed me.

103
00:06:17.861 --> 00:06:22.030
I mean,
Jerry went and got himself in shape.
Now he's this handsome guy,

104
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.550
you know,
I mean,
yeah,
I mean there's no doubt.

105
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:26.663
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

106
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.710
<v 5>there's no doubt.
When I was casting turtle it was like,
okay,</v>

107
00:06:32.711 --> 00:06:37.420
I need a funny fat guy.
So,
um,
so then when we start getting into the movie,

108
00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:41.110
Jerry and I are having lunch and Jerry is not eating anything again and I'm
like,

109
00:06:41.111 --> 00:06:43.510
Jerry,
you got to eat some lunch.
He's like,
what do you mean?
I'm like,
well,

110
00:06:43.511 --> 00:06:46.420
you're going to put on a hundred pounds,
right?
We're going to get you back.
And,

111
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.890
and the truth is he did have the most room for growth.
And um,

112
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.960
it's been an amazing thing to see.
I mean,

113
00:06:52.961 --> 00:06:57.160
Jerry was so much younger than everybody else,
um,
when we started.
So,

114
00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.850
but for everybody else,
their stories definitely have growth and any evolve.

115
00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:01.870
But I think at the end of the day,

116
00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:06.040
Ari was always this really good family man who just has a big mouth,
you know?

117
00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:10.030
But he is a loyal guy and he'll kill for him.
And these guys too.

118
00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:12.980
So their stories may change,
but at the end of the day they're core to me is,

119
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.320
is the same.
And I think the movie is almost a reset,
you know,
I like,

120
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.160
I hope you never had to see an episode to start this movie and go,
okay,

121
00:07:21.161 --> 00:07:24.030
I get what this is.
And either you go along for the ride.
Okay.

122
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.000
<v 3>You don't sell very much Kevin.
Well,
when I was coming up the stairs I tripped.</v>

123
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.850
Is there any way that we could keep that off the internet?

124
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.370
It's never going to happen.
Right.
I should just accept that.

125
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:41.000
I'm going to be looking at that.
It's already on the Internet.
Literally tripped,

126
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.650
almost fell on my face and it was embarrassing.
We need more of that.
By the way.

127
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.810
I won't be pushing out all the stairs cause we need a viral moment that I saw a

128
00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:52.550
couple cameras.
I'm hoping they were stills,

129
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:55.520
but I was literally on my face on the stairs coming up.

130
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:59.840
So if you'd be kind,
be cautious please.
Thank you.

131
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.380
Um,
no,
you know,
my character's Oh,
Ben trying to evolve for years,

132
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:07.940
but now he's having a baby.
So it's about as evolved as a,
as you can get.

133
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:10.310
So hopefully he'll grow up a little bit,
but we'll see.

134
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.930
<v 6>Um,
so as you mentioned,
you know,
it's,</v>

135
00:08:12.931 --> 00:08:14.910
it's been a while since the pilot and it's been,
what,

136
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.110
11 years since you guys first stepped into these roles and,
and,
um,
you know,

137
00:08:19.111 --> 00:08:20.850
you're bringing in a new audience to this film,

138
00:08:20.851 --> 00:08:24.300
but you're also honoring the audience that loved and watched all of the show and

139
00:08:24.301 --> 00:08:27.060
it was on,
um,
what were some of the things that you had to,
you know,

140
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.430
you took care with Tim to bring in the new audience?

141
00:08:29.431 --> 00:08:32.400
We watched it with some people who hadn't seen any of the series before last

142
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.960
night,
and they loved it.
That's what you have succeeded.
But,
um,

143
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.070
<v 5>I mean,
you know,
I,
I looked at the script when I started and said,
yeah,</v>

144
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:43.910
there's things that we have to clean up from the moon,
from the show for fans,

145
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:46.730
but really just get into this as quickly as possible.
You know,

146
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:50.360
I didn't want to spend a lot of time on Vince got married and what happened and

147
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.560
Ari retired.
Okay.
He's a type a guy,
these types of guys all the time.
They say,

148
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:57.960
you know what,
going to pack it all up and then they end up coming right back,

149
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:01.290
you know it.
Um,
so it was very,

150
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:04.650
very important that Piers Morgan thing was obviously a device to catch people
up.

151
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:08.970
I needed something.
Piers was great and made a very credible in real.
But um,

152
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.280
you know,
it's,
at the end of the day,

153
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:15.570
this shows about working class guys who made it big and get to live in this

154
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:16.710
fantasy land.
At the end of the day,

155
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:18.990
they really care about each other more than they care about all the toys and

156
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:21.780
stuff.
So I think that's an easy thing to latch onto.

157
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:24.560
And if you like the characters,
you go along with it.
So yeah.

158
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.260
<v 6>Was it easy to slip back into these characters?
You know,</v>

159
00:09:27.261 --> 00:09:30.380
it's been a reasonable amount of time since the series ended.

160
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.080
Did you guys find that you're just as comfortable with today as you were?

161
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.510
<v 5>I mean,
I couldn't get,
I couldn't wait.
I mean,
I live in New York,</v>

162
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:39.840
so I miss these guys.
And uh,
you know,

163
00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:44.841
I was really just anxious for us all to get back together and being in our

164
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:48.210
characters because really,
you know,
acting is reacting.

165
00:09:48.211 --> 00:09:52.040
And when you're working off,
you know,
Jeremy and,
and,
and,

166
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.090
and all these other characters and you see Johnny drama,
it's,

167
00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:00.100
it's really easy just to respond to that and be present.
The,

168
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.750
you know,

169
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.970
you touched on this a little bit where there's something really special about

170
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:04.770
these characters that we,
you know,
they all grew up from,

171
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:08.170
nothing came from nothing and the other extremely relatable and I loved it.

172
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.660
You know,
the juxtaposition with Haley,

173
00:10:09.661 --> 00:10:12.320
Joel Osment character in the movie where he's like the air of the fire,

174
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.650
we'll have of the spot,
this family,
and he says it's entitled Brats.
So,
you know,

175
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.560
it was a secret of keeping these characters a wadeable even though,
you know,

176
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.160
the craziest stuff from our,
he and you know,
he making the mistakes.

177
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:27.210
But I think the things that makes you love these guys aside from obviously these

178
00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:31.470
actors are likable.
It's an intangible that you,
you have to cast.
But you know,

179
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.910
Ari goes home to his wife and kids every night.
My son plays a son.

180
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:40.860
So I liked that he does that.
But,
um,
so you know,
and these guys,

181
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.260
and they say it and they do it with action,

182
00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:47.010
it's more important that they look out for each other,
then they get a Ferrari.

183
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:50.040
So yeah,
all the toys are there because it is a wish fulfillment.

184
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:52.230
We want people to watch this and go,
wow,

185
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:54.690
that's a great life and I'd love to live it.
But more importantly,

186
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:57.330
I'd love to live it with my friends that really can't afford to do that.

187
00:10:57.331 --> 00:11:01.410
You know?
And it's how I grew up and it's really how all of us kind of grew up.

188
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:05.130
And I'm still best friends with the kids that I was friends with from

189
00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:08.280
kindergarten on.
So,
and a lot of them,
you know,
some of them,

190
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.010
I have friends who've made fortunes and I have friends who,
you know,

191
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:14.010
work as policemen and do all sorts of things.
And when we get together,

192
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.300
there's no difference.

193
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:18.060
It's the same dynamics that we had and that's what I really want with these
guys.

194
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:18.894
So,

195
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.870
<v 6>so this question is for Jeremy and Doug.
Um,
you know,</v>

196
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:26.760
Ari gold is a historic cinematic figure now,

197
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.200
um,
you know,
is there,
how much of it is,
is written in advance?

198
00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:33.330
How much of it is Jeremy like improving?

199
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.550
One of my favorite scenes would been involved with paint,

200
00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:40.080
a picture frame and a very innocent looking kitten.
My cat.

201
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.700
I'm sorry.
Um,
yeah.
How much room is there to play on set and how much,

202
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.850
how much of it is like a written in advance to be true to the character?
Well,

203
00:11:47.851 --> 00:11:51.990
I mean it's all of our jobs to make the written word seem improvisational.

204
00:11:51.991 --> 00:11:54.080
That's what,
that's what we do.
That's what we love

205
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.020
<v 4>to do.
And so Doug,
you know,
it takes a long time to write this and he,
you know,</v>

206
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:02.380
we honor those words and uh,
if something comes up,
you know,

207
00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:06.910
I come from an Improv background and so I,
I do love to mix it up,

208
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:11.260
but this is really about making those words come to life.

209
00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:15.850
So the stuff with the kitten,
all that is absolutely written.
You know,

210
00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:16.301
I just,

211
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:21.301
I'm not an insane person that just decides to smash a glass kitten in the middle

212
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:26.590
of a scene.
You know what I mean?
Actually I probably would do that.
Yeah.

213
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:31.810
But no,
we had eight or 10 breakaway glasses,

214
00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.190
glass cases,
and I just went to town and it was just cathartic.

215
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.180
But usually,
and with all of them,
I mean,
you know,

216
00:12:39.181 --> 00:12:42.190
we'll do a take that's exactly like the script and then I'll go,

217
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:42.820
you got any ideas?

218
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.600
But more importantly they'll usually call me up the night before I got an a
line,

219
00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:49.900
I got an idea.
And then Jeremy,
the biggest thing Jeremy always does,

220
00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:52.090
which has given us some amazing moments is end of takes.

221
00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:55.990
He'll just throw things in because like that scene in the psychiatrist office,

222
00:12:55.991 --> 00:12:57.370
you know,
he's got a,
uh,
two,

223
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.210
two and a half page monologue for him to start improvising in the middle of that

224
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:04.570
would be a,
it would be mind boggling if he could do that,
you know.

225
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.510
So I think it's really those ends of moments where he comes up with,

226
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.860
we will try it.
But,
uh,
you know,
we try to,
we try to get the script,

227
00:13:11.861 --> 00:13:14.170
especially cause you know,
we shot this in 34 days,

228
00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:16.600
which I don't know if you guys know what that is.
A really short,

229
00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.250
really short things.
So,
and we have a lot of dialogue.
The script was 160 pages.

230
00:13:21.251 --> 00:13:24.580
A typical comedy is usually 105 maybe.

231
00:13:24.581 --> 00:13:28.210
So we got to move and move and move.
So I gotcha.
And so,
uh,

232
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.150
Adrian and Kevin and I want to talk about your guys' relationship cause it's

233
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:34.360
almost very brotherly.
I mean I know you have your,
obviously your characters,

234
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.130
you know,
brothers would drama on the film,

235
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:38.380
but you guys are almost like brothers too,
it seems like.

236
00:13:38.381 --> 00:13:40.940
So can you talk a little bit about that relationship and how that's kind of

237
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.453
played out?

238
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.720
<v 3>Well,
I think,
uh,
I mean I was mad at managing is tomorrow's before,</v>

239
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:51.350
before it moved me out to California.
But obviously,
you know,
uh,

240
00:13:51.351 --> 00:13:54.010
it was probably a dynamic that,
you know,
started in,

241
00:13:54.011 --> 00:13:56.000
in our childhood where he served,

242
00:13:56.001 --> 00:14:00.470
trusted my judgment and sort of knew that I have it turns out maybe don't have

243
00:14:00.471 --> 00:14:02.510
such great taste and material.

244
00:14:02.511 --> 00:14:05.760
I definitely steer them down the wrong road a few times,
uh,

245
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:09.830
meeting and Queens Boulevard and name to name a few.
But,
uh,

246
00:14:09.831 --> 00:14:12.980
I think more than anything,
there's just a trust there.
And,
uh,
you know,

247
00:14:12.981 --> 00:14:15.980
I think that Vince knows that at the end of the day he has his best,

248
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.570
his best interest in mind.

249
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.770
<v 4>Yeah.
And something happened.
It happened in the movie where suddenly he,</v>

250
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.810
uh,
is,
is more of the sex symbol then Vince,

251
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.860
and we've been joking about whether or not Doug was mad at me or Kevin.

252
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.610
We literally,
I was like,
Doug,
what do I do?
It's like,
well,
and I,

253
00:14:35.611 --> 00:14:39.600
and then I called the whole movie.
I was like,
Doug,
starving old scare people off.

254
00:14:39.601 --> 00:14:44.280
You're not naked the whole ovary.
Um,

255
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.330
but yeah,
I mean the,
the they,
we are the straight men.
They know we're uh,

256
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:52.280
you know,
sort of part of what drives the story

257
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:57.280
<v 5>forward because our solid grounding is sort of what gets these boys going and</v>

258
00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.890
keeps the bucks coming in.
Yep.

259
00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.700
<v 6>Um,
so one of my other favorite story lines,</v>

260
00:15:03.701 --> 00:15:06.670
and this was with Ronda Rousey cause she's a bad ass.

261
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.090
So was that role written explicitly with her in mind?
You know,

262
00:15:10.091 --> 00:15:13.000
you've had some great people come in and play versions of themselves,
but she is,

263
00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.850
I think a unique appearance of the entourage of universe.

264
00:15:15.851 --> 00:15:19.520
And what was it like fighting her or trying to almost fight her?

265
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.850
<v 2>Well,
you want to start with how she,
her,
I'll start.</v>

266
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.730
<v 5>Initially everyone saw the movie,
but I'm right.
Or I don't know.</v>

267
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:31.350
But so initially she was the Armie Hammer role,

268
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.410
but rob there really,
I mean a year and a half ago,

269
00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:35.900
almost two years when we cast her,

270
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.800
she was a very different place than she is today.

271
00:15:37.801 --> 00:15:42.330
So she was kind of a little unknown.
I mean to the,
to the real fighting crowd.

272
00:15:42.331 --> 00:15:44.970
They knew her,
but really not.
So,
um,

273
00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.640
initially she was going to be the one that was like threatening Vince.

274
00:15:47.641 --> 00:15:49.530
Like I thought it was a funny idea to have Vince.

275
00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:53.610
And then Jerry and I were at lunch and I think honestly it was like at the same

276
00:15:53.611 --> 00:15:56.190
moment,
but that we thought this would be a perfect thing for him.

277
00:15:56.191 --> 00:15:59.370
Like there's something that just seemed like a perfect combination and I had

278
00:15:59.371 --> 00:16:02.760
never even met her,
but we,
we,
we set it and then we set a lunch with her.

279
00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:04.470
We had a lunch with her and weirdly enough,

280
00:16:04.471 --> 00:16:08.310
she had just started randomly watching the show at a training session.

281
00:16:08.311 --> 00:16:10.830
So she was up to,
I don't know if Jerry like season five.
Yeah.

282
00:16:10.831 --> 00:16:12.960
Something like that.
So,
and then,
uh,

283
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:17.310
we went to lunch and they immediately had a really cool chemistry and,
and um,

284
00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.690
so Jerry can take it from there with,

285
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:19.581
<v 2>yeah,
I was just,</v>

286
00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:24.320
I was a big fan of her is way before she came on to do the entourage movie.

287
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:27.860
And,
uh,
it was weird,
but she went to,
because we did all this stuff,
and again,

288
00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:29.660
I don't want to give too much away for those who haven't seen it,

289
00:16:29.661 --> 00:16:34.520
but we did all the nonphysical stuff first.
I'm getting to know her as,

290
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:38.510
as just Rhonda,
the person and she's just really sweet,
charming,

291
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.440
intelligent woman.
And I just,
I wasn't getting it.
I was like,
how is she this?

292
00:16:42.441 --> 00:16:46.250
I can't imagine how she could be as intimidating as people think.

293
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.840
And then we did the stuff in the cage and I saw her face change from like,
oh,

294
00:16:50.841 --> 00:16:53.600
this is Rhonda.
The persons who Rhonda,
I'm a whoop your ass.

295
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:58.700
Jerry's fees changed real quick too.
Honestly.
I,
you know,
uh,

296
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.050
in terms of acting,

297
00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:03.680
it didn't really take a whole lot to react to her charging across the ring and

298
00:17:03.681 --> 00:17:06.770
giving me a front kick to the stomach.
And she actually recommended,

299
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:11.390
there's a little bit of a flip in the movie where she flips me in and I wanted

300
00:17:11.391 --> 00:17:14.540
to do it.
I wanted to try to be a part of all the stones and all that.

301
00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:17.780
And she said,
Jerry,
listen,
you're not the biggest guy in the world.

302
00:17:17.781 --> 00:17:20.330
I've broken guys ribs before who are a lot bigger than you.

303
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.430
I just looked over at the stunt man,
I think,

304
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.460
and in my mind he was having like a coffee and I think I grabbed his coffee and

305
00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:28.690
I tagged him in and he got his words is probably appropriate,

306
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.980
but she's also won three fights,

307
00:17:30.981 --> 00:17:33.410
I think since the time we started shooting the movie.

308
00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:34.930
And she's an incredible person

309
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:39.120
<v 5>and you can also,
as a man,
you want to believe that you can.
You can beat her up.</v>

310
00:17:39.121 --> 00:17:39.670
I mean it's fine.

311
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:44.080
<v 2>You Kevin,
Kevin Dillon was sitting there was like,
Bro,</v>

312
00:17:44.081 --> 00:17:45.820
I could take her,
you know,
no.

313
00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.220
Walberg walked in and I forget where said something like,

314
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:55.160
<v 5>uh,
you look like a Clint Eastwood in,
uh,
what,
what's that?
That movie?
Uh,</v>

315
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.560
where he was like,
meet everybody.
But anyway,
Dylan,
I think Dylan,

316
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:01.200
until he saw Jerry there,
he was being serious.
I think he was like,

317
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.310
because he'd never seen her fight.

318
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.600
And then just the one you see the movement that this really is an interesting

319
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:08.940
one on the cover of sports illustrated,
the most dominant athlete in the world.

320
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:12.550
It's amazing to watch and the transformation,
like he says in our personalities.

321
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.090
Incredible.

322
00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.790
<v 2>And something weird happened.
Now anytime I watch a fight of her,</v>

323
00:18:15.791 --> 00:18:19.390
as I turned it to Adrian from the rocky movies,
I'm like in the crowd,

324
00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:23.050
like at home,
like crying at the TV,
just praying.
It's u Windsor.

325
00:18:23.051 --> 00:18:25.780
If I turned it to Adrian from the rocky movies when I watch her thighs.

326
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.060
So your money's on her over Mayweather,
right.
If she actually fights an absolute.

327
00:18:29.061 --> 00:18:32.050
Okay,
good.
Um,
so you know,

328
00:18:32.051 --> 00:18:35.740
I think anybody in everybody in Hollywood wants to be in an entourage episode,

329
00:18:35.741 --> 00:18:39.520
movie,
everything.
Um,
at what point do you have to start saying no to people?

330
00:18:39.521 --> 00:18:41.350
Like it's,
it's takes place in Hollywood.

331
00:18:41.351 --> 00:18:44.220
So it's awesome that you are able to integrate so many awesome cameos.

332
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:49.090
<v 5>Just like everyone who wants to buy tickets.
We will say no to no one,
anyone.</v>

333
00:18:49.091 --> 00:18:50.140
I mean,
we got calls,

334
00:18:50.141 --> 00:18:53.260
we're on the set and I get a call that the clay Matthews from the Green Bay

335
00:18:53.261 --> 00:18:56.740
packers is in town and,
and he's got a wedding,
but it's his favorite show.

336
00:18:56.741 --> 00:18:59.350
He's willing,
he's willing to miss the wedding if we can find something for him.

337
00:18:59.351 --> 00:19:03.790
I'm like,
all right,
come on down.
You know,
so we,
you know,

338
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.690
it's like a fire sale.
Come on down.
We packed it in.

339
00:19:07.691 --> 00:19:10.090
And the truth is some people go,
what's with all the cameos?

340
00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.990
That's the life that Mark Walberg leaves.
You know,
when the movie was finished,

341
00:19:13.991 --> 00:19:16.090
I called them up and said,
I'm going to bring it to your house to show it to you.

342
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.820
I get there and Kevin Duran answers the door.
I'm like,

343
00:19:18.821 --> 00:19:21.610
I'm not ready to show it the Kevin Duran yet.
And he's like,
well,
you're going to,

344
00:19:21.611 --> 00:19:25.260
so let's go.
So it's just,
that's what it is.
So the,

345
00:19:25.261 --> 00:19:28.540
the more we can get in a realistic version that the better.
So

346
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.033
<v 7>that's great.</v>

347
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.840
<v 2>And uh,
you know,
Jeremy Fellows,
Chicago native go cubbies.
Let's,
yeah,</v>

348
00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:39.540
right.
Why not?
What the cubs on that one,
Huh?
Back row,

349
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.580
we'll be quiet now.
Well,
you really want to,
you know,

350
00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:44.250
you were really one of the big oak characters,
you know,
early on in the show.
So,

351
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.150
you know,
Ari,

352
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.970
<v 4>he just seems destined to always kind of go for that top job.</v>

353
00:19:47.971 --> 00:19:52.360
He has his own agency and then he,
you know,
bronze now a studio head.

354
00:19:52.361 --> 00:19:54.930
So kind of what is that top goal for Ari?

355
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.280
Because he just keeps chasing and chasing and Jayson gets names.
Yeah.
He,

356
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:03.240
he's ridiculously ambitious and,
and he will,
nothing could stop him.

357
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.660
Uh,
he believes he's qualified for every job.

358
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.910
And I th I think that,

359
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.213
<v 7>mmm.</v>

360
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.900
<v 4>He's actually a great studio head.
I can't tell you what happens.
Okay.</v>

361
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.850
<v 7>Um,
but</v>

362
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:22.130
<v 4>ultimately I could see him going into politics and going ridiculously far.</v>

363
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.600
I don't think there's anything that he wouldn't be able to accomplish or think

364
00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:30.900
that he could heal.
He would will it to happen no matter what.

365
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:33.890
<v 7>MMM.</v>

366
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.160
<v 4>Okay.
And you know,
Doug,
what was,
you know,</v>

367
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:39.680
kind of the challenges of getting this would be made and was there any fear of

368
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.950
it's too late or we've ended it or

369
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:48.130
<v 5>I'm a neurotic Jew,
so I'm always in fear,
but,
um,
the,
you know,</v>

370
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.350
the challenge was the script get a script,
right?

371
00:20:50.351 --> 00:20:53.620
They could sustain itself for 90 minutes and really,
you know,
feel like a movie.

372
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:54.640
Um,
you know,

373
00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:59.641
in the show I could have lean on one character and less on someone and then the

374
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.200
next week switch it around this.
Everyone had to have a full thing.

375
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.860
And like I said,
the script was extremely long.
Uh,
you know,

376
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.560
I told Warner brothers the studio because they were very worried about it.

377
00:21:07.561 --> 00:21:11.560
I said,
I believe me,
we speak fast and these guys are going to go,
go,
go,
go,
go.
So,

378
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.380
you know,
the movie is obviously not long even though the script was,

379
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:17.560
but the script was the biggest challenge.
And then,
you know,
these guys schedules,

380
00:21:17.561 --> 00:21:18.240
they all,
you know,

381
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.760
had different things they were doing and finding the time to get it in together.

382
00:21:21.761 --> 00:21:24.820
But once we got into production,
it was,
it was pretty smooth sailing.

383
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.700
I'm going to start taking audience questions if you guys want to start lining up

384
00:21:28.701 --> 00:21:29.534
at the mic.

385
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:29.830
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

386
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:33.880
<v 6>Um,
and so speaking of this script of Oh wow,
he was right.</v>

387
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:39.420
Three hours.
Wow.
Um,
before,

388
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:43.600
before we get to the last question from us.
Um,
so,
uh,
speaking of this script,

389
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:46.620
you know,
you,
you decided to bring in alcohol and them villains,
uh,
you know,

390
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:50.950
the outside forces of pseudo evil,
that challenge these guys that are,
you know,

391
00:21:50.951 --> 00:21:54.710
Billy Bob Thornton and Haley Joel Osment as though the Larson [inaudible] Larson

392
00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.260
and dad tribes some creepy.
Um,

393
00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:00.670
what was the decision to bring in an outside kind of negative force as opposed

394
00:22:00.671 --> 00:22:02.120
to going with one of the,
uh,
you know,

395
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.410
various challenges that the guys have met up against in previous?

396
00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.230
<v 5>You know,
what I really wanted to shed a light on,</v>

397
00:22:08.231 --> 00:22:11.260
on kind of what's happening in Hollywood now,
you know,
um,

398
00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:12.700
the studio is really our farming,

399
00:22:12.701 --> 00:22:17.290
these movies out in the hedge fund guys and people who don't care about movies

400
00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:19.540
at all.
And,
and you know,
it's been a joke for Hollywood for 20 years,

401
00:22:19.541 --> 00:22:21.190
that the studios don't care about the movies.

402
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:25.510
Now you've got another layer where it is just,
what is it worth?

403
00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:28.270
What does each person a value?
So a,

404
00:22:28.271 --> 00:22:31.000
we just thought that was an interesting way to do it.
And you know,

405
00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:34.230
it's a very realistic look at those guys.
I mean,
because you know,

406
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:38.380
there are those guys that come in and I've had those words said to me like,

407
00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:42.370
I don't give a crap whether this movie's good.
I only care if it makes money.
So,

408
00:22:42.371 --> 00:22:45.370
and,
and,
you know,
when you put your heart and soul into it,
you know it,

409
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.730
that's hurtful.
And obviously you get it.
We all want to make money.
That's,

410
00:22:48.731 --> 00:22:52.240
you know,
uh,
the business of it.
But you want to make a good movie.

411
00:22:52.241 --> 00:22:53.470
That's what you set out to do.
So,

412
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.780
<v 8>okay,
great.</v>

413
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.420
<v 5>Gotcha.
Yeah.
Two questions.
First one.
Where's Lloyd?</v>

414
00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.670
And the second question is,

415
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.420
can you talk about your favorite cameo each you who your favorite person to work

416
00:23:04.421 --> 00:23:08.560
with was?
Where's Lloyd today?
Yeah.
Right now we saw,
we saw him last night.

417
00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:10.990
It's a premiere.
We should have brought them.
Actually we had to see,
I dunno.

418
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.230
I Dunno.
He actually is Raleigh filming today cause he's doing it.

419
00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:18.400
He's doing a new TV show and now my favorite cameo in the movie because it's so

420
00:23:18.401 --> 00:23:21.010
bizarre that he's in the same movie as Gary Busey is Warren Buffet.

421
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.530
It was just weird,
you know,
so,
and,

422
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:26.560
and Warren came to the set cause he wanted to make a,
uh,

423
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.240
he wanted to make a little film with the entourage guys,
uh,

424
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:34.510
for the Berkshire Hathaway stock holders meeting.
So I said,
okay,

425
00:23:34.511 --> 00:23:37.140
but you're going to be in the movie now.
So,
um,
and he was great.

426
00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.740
It was a great sport.
So,
well actually I want to follow up with that.
Uh,

427
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.670
there was a short film that was released online with Ras character kind of

428
00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:45.060
transitioning him from the series into the movie.
And it,

429
00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.610
was that ever part of the movie?
Was it kind of like,

430
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.520
do we want to include this or was it just pulled complete,
separate thing,

431
00:23:49.521 --> 00:23:50.354
you know?
Um,

432
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.540
but it was great cause Cadillac gave us an opportunity to show that kind of

433
00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:57.380
bridge.
So,
um,
and you know,
when that car doesn't exist.
So it was nice day.

434
00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.480
I saw that four years ago and it gave me an inspiration for the movie.
But uh,

435
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.830
they're not even going to,
they're not even planning on making it.
So

436
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.110
big fan of the show questions for Doug,
Jeremy Agent.

437
00:24:09.111 --> 00:24:10.670
What was more painful to watch?

438
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.560
He break his leg on set filming the football scene or turtle get beat up by

439
00:24:15.561 --> 00:24:20.420
Ronda Rousey.
Thanks.
But by far,

440
00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:21.254
seeing Kevin

441
00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:26.600
<v 0>get hurt.
I mean,
but I mean,
cause Jerry Real,</v>

442
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.150
by the way,
that's a very,

443
00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.600
it's a metal rod metal plate and eight screws in my leg.
So I like to take it,

444
00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:37.210
by the way,
this is a very rob Rod Koski question because Kevin,

445
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.410
it was Jerry tackled him and Kevin said,
well I thought I heard something pop.

446
00:24:41.411 --> 00:24:44.860
And then 20 minutes later they tell me that Russell Wilson,
Rob Gronkowski,

447
00:24:44.861 --> 00:24:47.710
you're holding ice on his leg.
I think they're,
I think they're punking me.

448
00:24:47.711 --> 00:24:51.280
And we'd go upstairs and Gronk calcium wants to shoot him up with a Tarald shot

449
00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.840
to get them back on the field.
And he says,
what else do you have to do today?

450
00:24:54.841 --> 00:24:57.730
And Kali says,
well,
I,
I'm a sexy.
And Greg Koski is like,
well,

451
00:24:57.731 --> 00:25:00.880
you can't get shut off if you have sex.
And he's like,
I'm not having sex.
I'm rob.

452
00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:04.810
Hey,
back then to break this to you buddy.
But we don't actually have sex.

453
00:25:04.811 --> 00:25:06.480
So I don't know

454
00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.090
<v 3>actually have to,
you know,
finish it the deal,
if you know what I mean.</v>

455
00:25:10.091 --> 00:25:14.980
I just have to pretend,
you know.
But,
uh,
yeah,
no,
I mean,
I knew my leg was broken.

456
00:25:14.981 --> 00:25:18.060
I think a few few people did.
Doug was I just thinking denial because they know,

457
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.960
you know,
Doug's one of my buddies,

458
00:25:19.961 --> 00:25:22.600
and I know he would never want me working hurt,
but you know,

459
00:25:22.601 --> 00:25:26.440
I kind of walked her hobbled around for a few days then on the broken leg.

460
00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:29.920
And we actually,
when I did,
uh,
some people just done,
I was exaggerating.

461
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.830
So we did this sex scene.
Yeah.
Jerry.
I'm like,
Jerry,
did you hear that?

462
00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.790
Sounded like chop a chopstick.
Go.
That's it.
It's sent literally.
And uh,

463
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.370
so this girl is as on top of me and I'm like,
I'm,

464
00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:41.840
you have to be careful of my leg.
And she said,

465
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.200
<v 0>rolling</v>

466
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.620
<v 3>rise.
I'm like,
no,
my leg is broken.
Just saying okay.
Yeah,
no John,
you're like,</v>

467
00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.690
so uh,
yeah,
no it hurt.
I mean I got through it.

468
00:25:52.691 --> 00:25:55.660
Thank God we were had sunglasses on and it was a party scene.

469
00:25:55.661 --> 00:25:56.494
So that was basically,

470
00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:01.140
<v 0>and he was on Molly so he could act as weird as you want it.
Like Doug was like,</v>

471
00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:04.470
you really look like you're on drugs.
I'm like,
oh I was,
I was on plenty of drugs.

472
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:05.071
He's like,
all right,

473
00:26:05.071 --> 00:26:07.770
well don't tell anybody cause it looks like you can act actually for once in

474
00:26:07.771 --> 00:26:12.300
your life.
I did not say that.
Yeah.
I just like to say from the back row,

475
00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.230
I have never seen,

476
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:18.290
<v 5>seen such a heroic display as Kevin plane through the whole week on a broken</v>

477
00:26:20.961 --> 00:26:22.790
leg.
I would've,
I would've

478
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.920
<v 0>random falling and crying,
come on me.
He deserves that.</v>

479
00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.340
And the truth is almost any other day,

480
00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:31.601
<v 5>you know,</v>

481
00:26:31.601 --> 00:26:35.170
you can shut down for six weeks that day when you have Greg Koski there,

482
00:26:35.171 --> 00:26:37.150
Russell Wilson,
Clay Matthews,
Bob said,

483
00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.970
there's no way we're getting them all about Mike Tyson that you're going to get

484
00:26:39.971 --> 00:26:43.090
them all back together.
So the fact that Kevin,
and again,
no one told him to keep,

485
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.530
in fact,
I actually kept saying,
you need to go to the hospital.
And he was like,

486
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:50.750
no,
no,
I'm fine.
But um,
so,
but it did save us.
It really did it,
but no one knew.

487
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.420
<v 2>Right.
It's funny too because Rhonda,
you know,</v>

488
00:26:52.421 --> 00:26:55.690
you're around these people that's ground Koski Ronda Rousey one,

489
00:26:55.691 --> 00:26:59.170
one person tougher than the other and I don't know.
I'm not tough.

490
00:26:59.171 --> 00:27:03.310
So I'm like,
yeah,
I think my legs broken and,
and Rhonda was like,

491
00:27:03.311 --> 00:27:07.710
your leg is not broken.
I was like,
I'm like,
I'm pretty sure it's broken.

492
00:27:07.711 --> 00:27:09.700
You're saying,
Kevin,
if your leg was broken,

493
00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.550
you wouldn't be standing here and we wouldn't be having this conversation.

494
00:27:12.551 --> 00:27:17.260
And I went,
okay,
I guess so roll the cameras.
Total sense.
That makes total sense.

495
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:19.180
So yeah,
keep drinking.

496
00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.720
Hey,
so my question is,
uh,
towards the end of the series,

497
00:27:25.721 --> 00:27:28.810
how much influence did mark Walberg still have on it?
And,
uh,

498
00:27:28.811 --> 00:27:29.770
in the movie as well?

499
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:31.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

500
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.930
<v 5>I mean,
mark,
you know,</v>

501
00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:37.120
his influence didn't change and mark from the beginning kind of let me have the

502
00:27:37.121 --> 00:27:40.150
reins that you can do what you want with my life and do,
you know,

503
00:27:40.151 --> 00:27:44.320
mix and match it with other people.
So Mark's best thing was being a producer,

504
00:27:44.321 --> 00:27:45.101
which is,
you know,

505
00:27:45.101 --> 00:27:48.550
I needed Martin Scorsese and mark would call him up and get them,
you know,

506
00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.480
mark really got this movie made,
you know,
he,
I ran into him,

507
00:27:52.481 --> 00:27:55.000
I kind of thought the show was over and I ran into him and he's like,

508
00:27:55.001 --> 00:27:55.751
where's the script?

509
00:27:55.751 --> 00:27:59.380
Everyone's asking me every press junket I do for the odds are I was crip.
I like,

510
00:27:59.381 --> 00:28:02.260
oh,
I don't know,
is anyone really gonna want to make that?
And he said,

511
00:28:02.261 --> 00:28:05.110
I promise you write the script and I'll get it made.
Some work has been,
uh,

512
00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:09.850
you know,
the real definition of a producer,
but he's never gone.
Like,
Oh,

513
00:28:09.851 --> 00:28:12.310
here's a story,
let's put this in there,
or whatever.
So,

514
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:13.380
<v 1>okay.</v>

515
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.080
<v 2>Yeah,
I think mark believed in us from the beginning.</v>

516
00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:18.990
That was one of the best things he ever dig,
at least from me speaking from me.

517
00:28:18.991 --> 00:28:23.640
I mean I felt very confident at a young age knowing that a guy like Walberg

518
00:28:23.641 --> 00:28:27.840
believed so much in this and was putting his name on it and he was behind.

519
00:28:27.841 --> 00:28:29.880
It just felt good confidence wise.

520
00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:34.710
And then he also gave us the confidence that there was a market for the movie.

521
00:28:34.711 --> 00:28:38.190
Like we,
we,
we didn't know.
We were all say,
well,
you know,
but he was like,
guys,

522
00:28:38.191 --> 00:28:40.080
I know this is going to work.
Just like he's always done.

523
00:28:40.081 --> 00:28:42.360
He's been a great sort of,
you know,

524
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.790
I just influence across the board for the entire run.
Yeah.

525
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:46.930
<v 5>And it,
and it's interesting from the beginning,
you know,
the,</v>

526
00:28:46.931 --> 00:28:48.440
the scariest screening I've ever had.

527
00:28:48.441 --> 00:28:51.630
If this was the pilot at his house with his crew,

528
00:28:51.631 --> 00:28:55.320
which is like 30 deep and,
uh,
you know,

529
00:28:55.321 --> 00:29:00.210
obviously Adrian is a very different type of,
of actor than,
than Marcus.
And,

530
00:29:00.211 --> 00:29:02.610
uh,
you know,
it comes on and there's 30,
you know,

531
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.610
I don't want to call them thugs with tough guys from Boston.

532
00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:08.910
An agent comes on and when it goes,
Maki would kick the crap out of that guy,

533
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.280
you know,
and uh,
you know,

534
00:29:11.281 --> 00:29:15.360
and the thing ended and everyone was like,
you know,
Kinda quiet.

535
00:29:15.361 --> 00:29:18.390
And mark got up and he was like,
I,
and I'm thinking the whole time,
like,

536
00:29:18.391 --> 00:29:21.210
they hate this.
This is a nightmare.
This is the worst thing that ever happened.

537
00:29:21.211 --> 00:29:25.360
Did up and mark it up because we got a huge hit here.
I guarantee it.
And,
uh,

538
00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:28.710
he's been that kind of supportive and,
and since day one,
so,

539
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:35.350
hey guys,
I'm a huge fan of the show.
Saw the movie last night.
Fantastic.
Um,

540
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:40.310
my question is actually for Jeremy Piven,
uh,
Ari gold.
Um,
so what first,
well,

541
00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:42.250
two questions actually.
First off,
what

542
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.780
<v 4>is your favorite Ari gold insole that you've ever done?
A show or movie?</v>

543
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.360
And then the second question is,
can we hug it out?

544
00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:56.240
<v 0>They want to come up here and hug him for real?
He's approaching,
he's a pro.</v>

545
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:04.350
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

546
00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.540
<v 4>uh,
the gift that keeps giving.
How much do you hate dug for that?</v>

547
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:16.880
Do you love it?
I'm like,
oh no,
no,
it's all good.
I,
I mean,
yeah,

548
00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:18.200
that was one of those moments where I was,

549
00:30:18.201 --> 00:30:21.980
when Kevin and I were very early on at the end of a scene and they didn't yell

550
00:30:21.981 --> 00:30:23.990
cut.
So we just kind of kept going.

551
00:30:23.991 --> 00:30:27.890
And then here we are 11 years later and people are asking to hug me.
So it's

552
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:32.350
<v 0>task,
at least that they say to me,
let's hug it out,
get a little bitch,</v>

553
00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.440
get over here and hug it out.
You little bitch.

554
00:30:35.441 --> 00:30:37.310
And literally once a day somebody yells at me,

555
00:30:37.311 --> 00:30:40.240
I like the APP outside of their car window.
I go,

556
00:30:40.241 --> 00:30:43.900
are you doing to meet June 3rd?

557
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.600
<v 4>Um,
as far as,
um,
I almost want to ask you guys what,</v>

558
00:30:49.601 --> 00:30:53.940
what your favorite Artie golden sold was.
I don't think we can say,
hey,

559
00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.360
I am five.
And again,

560
00:30:55.870 --> 00:31:00.490
all of you saw Jeremy as Ari gold on CNBC last week saying it's anal anal night

561
00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:05.491
at the gold's house be which was aligned from season one or maybe the pilot

562
00:31:05.561 --> 00:31:10.300
even,
I don't know.
Yeah,
so,
but uh,
well they asked Doug Rohde a foe,

563
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:13.900
uh,
Ari gold autobiography called rules to rule by,

564
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:19.270
and I went out to promote it and I,
I,
I was obligated,

565
00:31:19.271 --> 00:31:21.250
literally contractually obligated.

566
00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:26.200
I swear to God to show up as Ari gold and,

567
00:31:26.201 --> 00:31:31.030
and I,
I had my publicist tell all these people like,
we're on live television.

568
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.800
You guys know that this,
if I show up as this character were on the today show,

569
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.930
I know you're live,
but how am I going to play Ari gold without swearing?

570
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:45.610
I mean,
it's,
it's would be like a UFC fighter without striking,

571
00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.420
you know,
you have to,
you have to get,
and sure enough,

572
00:31:49.421 --> 00:31:52.900
like every show I went on,
I just started swearing

573
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.240
and people were furious.
I had to apologize to the today show.

574
00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:03.190
I just kept screaming.
Can I swear here by the way?
Yeah.
I mean,
I kept like,

575
00:32:03.191 --> 00:32:06.700
at one point it was like a hockey fight fight where you pulled the Jersey over

576
00:32:06.701 --> 00:32:08.350
to the other guy's head.
You just keep swinging.

577
00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:13.680
Like I just kept screaming rapid the fuck up on live television.

578
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.800
And then I snapped out of it and realize my God,
what is,
what has been happening?

579
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:21.700
It's a big,
what's the balance of that?
Because some of the stuff he says is just,

580
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:24.910
it's,
it's so funny,
but it's so crazy.
Is that why it works?

581
00:32:24.911 --> 00:32:28.870
Because it's just completely crazy stuff.
I've never ever censored it.

582
00:32:28.871 --> 00:32:29.980
And the truth is,

583
00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:34.840
it is a special actor who can say,
cause I mean,

584
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:35.470
again,

585
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:39.090
most of the lines are written and I've tried to say that myself and if I said

586
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:42.770
him,
they would be,
I mean,
it'd be horrifying,
but Jeremy has an intangible,

587
00:32:42.771 --> 00:32:46.100
like I said,
to be a lovable asshole.
And you know,

588
00:32:46.101 --> 00:32:48.450
at the end of the day that he loves Lloyd and that to,

589
00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:51.230
<v 3>he has his back the same way these guys do.
So to,</v>

590
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:55.680
to Rex's credit racks is tough as nails,
man.
You're,

591
00:32:55.681 --> 00:32:58.160
you're not going to hurt his feelings at all.
So I mean,

592
00:32:58.161 --> 00:33:02.160
like Jeremy will say that he will run it by racks in the morning and ask him if

593
00:33:02.161 --> 00:33:06.510
it's okay if I talk about things getting squirted on your face or whatnot.

594
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:12.400
And,
and rex really doesn't care.
He's never,
he's like,

595
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.650
he's just like tough is now.

596
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:17.690
<v 4>Yeah,
he,
he was always up for it.
He found it funny.
He just,</v>

597
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:22.550
nothing fazed him whatsoever.
So it made it,
it made it a little bit easier.

598
00:33:22.551 --> 00:33:25.680
But there will be times where I would read the script and just think they're

599
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.370
there.
There's no coming back from this.
I will,
I will,

600
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:32.240
I will turn off everyone that has ever watched the show.

601
00:33:32.241 --> 00:33:34.340
And so that was our challenge when it was really fun.

602
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:38.040
<v 8>This questions,</v>

603
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.740
<v 9>this question's for uh,
Jeremy as well.
Um,</v>

604
00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.760
you mentioned that you came from a Improv background,

605
00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:49.380
so I was wondering what were the inspirations,
if any,

606
00:33:49.381 --> 00:33:51.990
at all for the Ra gold character?

607
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:58.320
<v 4>Well,
um,
as Doug was saying earlier,
I mean,
Mark Walberg is,</v>

608
00:33:58.321 --> 00:34:03.321
is the one is the reason why we're all here and it's loosely based on his world.

609
00:34:03.981 --> 00:34:08.120
And Ari Emanuel is his agent,
you know,
it's no secret.

610
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:09.050
Um,

611
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:14.030
and Ari Emanuel is a incredibly powerful agent.

612
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.090
Started Way Morris and then bought a,
I mean it started endeavour bought.

613
00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:20.660
William Morris just took over IMG,

614
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:23.540
he's taken over the world and you know,

615
00:34:23.541 --> 00:34:27.860
he is a fast talking shark,

616
00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:32.180
um,
who is incredibly abrasive and you know,
you know,

617
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:37.190
is brilliant and prolific in what he does and has add and all these wonderfully

618
00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:41.420
beautiful qualities that you see in the fictional character.

619
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:45.320
And I have heard that in the middle of business calls,
he'll just go,

620
00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:48.170
you don't want to be the guy from TV.
You want to be the guy from the show.

621
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.220
I beat the guy from the show going to be the guy from the show.
And,

622
00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.890
and I remember I was with him in Vegas one time.

623
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.930
We were sitting there and he said to the waitress,
I'm the real Ari,

624
00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.210
you don't have the real [inaudible].
And I'm like,

625
00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.030
she doesn't even know who the real aria is.

626
00:35:02.031 --> 00:35:05.690
Stop saying that she doesn't have cable.
So he looks like you're insane.

627
00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:06.953
Stop saying.

628
00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:14.650
<v 3>And so,
um,
so,
uh,
we're gonna wrap it up here with a question.
Uh,
last question.
So,</v>

629
00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:14.890
uh,

630
00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:18.900
what are your guys favorite kind of character moments from either the series of

631
00:35:18.901 --> 00:35:19.360
the movie?

632
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.260
<v 8>Just kind of what you're most proud of about,
about the entire thing?</v>

633
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:29.030
<v 3>Well,
I mean,
you know,
for me,
uh,
we were able to do things as a,
as a,</v>

634
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.150
as a production crew,
um,
that,

635
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:35.120
that TV shows at that time weren't doing,
I mean,

636
00:35:35.121 --> 00:35:37.980
when we did the Sundance episode,
you know,

637
00:35:37.981 --> 00:35:41.790
we were there shooting and Sundance and nobody really knew,
you know,

638
00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:44.010
any of us were,
I mean,
Jeremy has been around Jeremy's,

639
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.070
you've been in a bunch of money,
so people knew Jeremy was,
but for the,

640
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:49.290
for the four guys were just kind of walking around and we looked like a little

641
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.560
indie.
So we're stealing shots at Sundance and then,

642
00:35:52.561 --> 00:35:56.580
and then we did the same thing at the Cannes film festival and the U Two
concert.

643
00:35:56.581 --> 00:36:01.110
And the Laker Games.
So for me the,
the best part of the experience has,

644
00:36:01.111 --> 00:36:03.280
and I'm sure you guys will agree to a certain extent,

645
00:36:03.281 --> 00:36:07.830
it's been sort of the live sort of shooting and some of the things that as a

646
00:36:07.831 --> 00:36:10.920
production,
the whole team effort we were able to pull off.

647
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:12.890
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

648
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:16.910
<v 2>Uh,
for me,
we kind of this and credit to Doug on this too,</v>

649
00:36:16.911 --> 00:36:19.460
like the style of the walk and talk,

650
00:36:19.461 --> 00:36:23.270
which is something that we've done on this show since the beginning where it's a

651
00:36:23.271 --> 00:36:27.200
three or four page scene and it's either a four or five of us in the actual

652
00:36:27.201 --> 00:36:30.950
scene and it's,
it's one camera,
one shot,
no cuts,

653
00:36:30.951 --> 00:36:32.810
and it has a feeling like a play almost.

654
00:36:32.811 --> 00:36:35.270
Cause you can get three quarters of the way through the scene,

655
00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.940
one little screw up and you're going back to one to start again.

656
00:36:37.941 --> 00:36:41.150
So that always gave a new kind of energy to a scene.

657
00:36:41.151 --> 00:36:44.390
And you also know if you knock it out and everyone's on top of their game,

658
00:36:44.391 --> 00:36:48.260
you get to go home early,
which is always kind of fun.
But,
uh,
no,
see it like that,

659
00:36:48.261 --> 00:36:52.220
that added so much to the show for I,
I had never experienced anything like that.

660
00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:56.450
And like just having no close ups or nothing like sharing the frame with four

661
00:36:56.451 --> 00:37:00.410
guys and it's still,
the scene is just as equally funny,
if not even more funny.

662
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:03.020
It was always pretty cool to do.
Um,
you know,

663
00:37:03.021 --> 00:37:08.021
there's a misperception that this show is only a sh show and now a guy's movie.

664
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.880
But that's in fact not true.
It's,
you know,

665
00:37:13.881 --> 00:37:18.290
it's not just a bunch of uncouth crude guys.

666
00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.350
There's a lot of heart to this show and I think it's,

667
00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:26.300
I think a lot of women really respond to it.
And there's a,
there's a,

668
00:37:26.301 --> 00:37:26.920
there's a,

669
00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:30.240
<v 0>yeah,
that's a fan on the audience.
I know.</v>

670
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:33.060
<v 2>And by the way,
women can be quite crude as well,</v>

671
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:35.663
<v 0>but,</v>

672
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.260
<v 2>but uh,
there's,
there's,</v>

673
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:42.560
there are moments in this movie and one in particular where I literally tear up.

674
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:46.320
It's so touching and beautiful the way these guys treat each other and how they

675
00:37:46.321 --> 00:37:49.380
have each other's back.
And I really love that about this show.
It's got so much,

676
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:54.030
so much dynamic and so much depth and also just a lot of superficial fun.

677
00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:56.813
<v 8>Jeremy [inaudible].</v>

678
00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:00.630
<v 4>Um,
God,
I don't even know where to start because it's,
you know,</v>

679
00:38:00.631 --> 00:38:05.310
there's you,
you throw yourself into every scene and every episode,

680
00:38:05.311 --> 00:38:08.400
every season.
So,
um,
yeah,

681
00:38:08.401 --> 00:38:12.990
I think it would actually be ultimately I think the movie is

682
00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:13.930
<v 8>okay</v>

683
00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:17.800
<v 4>better than anything.
It's like the culmination of everything we've ever done.</v>

684
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.940
And I don't know if Doug was new when he was writing,
for instance,

685
00:38:21.941 --> 00:38:26.420
that last episode that he was planting the seeds to give for instance already

686
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:27.400
this conundrum,
you know,

687
00:38:27.401 --> 00:38:32.200
to be the king of Hollywood or to forget it all and prove himself to his wife

688
00:38:32.201 --> 00:38:33.610
that he,
she means the world to him.

689
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:37.960
But he basically planted seeds perfectly for the movie.

690
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.190
And I think the movie is really about something and it is a male fantasy,

691
00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.260
see a male fantasy show,

692
00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:49.440
but you won't see that coming that it really is about loyalty and friendship and

693
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:53.140
then ultimately family and all these great things.
So to do that,

694
00:38:53.141 --> 00:38:57.790
to pull it off and to make it funny and entertaining and then to sit with

695
00:38:57.791 --> 00:39:01.120
audiences and watch them laugh and really get it and be with it.

696
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:02.770
That's really gratifying.

697
00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:04.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

698
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:08.060
<v 5>What about your,
Doug,
cause you've just seen the entire series.
Yeah,
I mean,
uh,</v>

699
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:11.210
you know,
not to be corny.
This stuff with my son.
Uh,
Jeremy,

700
00:39:11.211 --> 00:39:13.640
I think Jeremy said that my son when he was five,

701
00:39:13.641 --> 00:39:17.000
she would play his son and he's not an actor.
I'm not trying to turn them into,

702
00:39:17.001 --> 00:39:20.390
you know,
one of these crazy kids.
But,
uh,
so the only thing he's done is this,

703
00:39:20.391 --> 00:39:20.760
but the,

704
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.830
those moments on the set and basically that he's grown up with these guys.
Um,

705
00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:27.680
it's not quite boyhood,
but you know,
it's,
uh,
it's,

706
00:39:27.681 --> 00:39:29.950
it's been great to my quiet and even,

707
00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:34.430
and honestly to watch him in the movie.
I don't know if you saw him last night,

708
00:39:34.431 --> 00:39:36.400
but I mean he got to,
you know,
the screen is,
I've been through,

709
00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:39.380
he got a huge laugh and it just,
it,
it makes me very happy.
So.

710
00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.753
<v 1>Great.
All right,</v>

711
