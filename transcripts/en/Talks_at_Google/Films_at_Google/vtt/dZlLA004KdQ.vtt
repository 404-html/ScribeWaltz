00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.020
[inaudible].

2
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.350
<v 1>All right,
well we'll kick it off.</v>

3
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.690
<v 2>My name is Malique goop marred.
I am a director of content partnerships,
um,
at,</v>

4
00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:30.320
at Youtube and,
um,
it's such a great honor to,
to have the,

5
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.370
the cast and the producers from 12 years a slave directed by Steve McQueen.

6
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.130
<v 1>True,
true to his honor.
We have with us here today.</v>

7
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.330
<v 2>Julie,
tell Eduphoria who plays the,
the title character Solomon Northrop.</v>

8
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.750
Lupita Nyong'o who plays Patsy Alfre Woodard,
who plays mistress Shaw,
um,

9
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.830
a DD Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner from plan B who are producers on the film.

10
00:00:56.131 --> 00:01:00.850
So,
so thanks again and welcome to to Google Los Angeles.
Um,
and we,

11
00:01:00.851 --> 00:01:04.050
we know that it's a very,
very busy time.
It's award season,

12
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.570
lots of red carpets and we wanted to also start with congratulating you for the,

13
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:12.200
the Golden Globe for best drama.
So deserve it.
And uh,

14
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.660
<v 1>none of them
actually have a question.</v>

15
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.520
<v 2>The,
is that,
that actual Golden Globe and,
and is it made out of gold?</v>

16
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.080
Would love to one day holding.
Uh,

17
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.620
we'd love to kick it off with a quick short trailer,
um,
from,

18
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.770
from the film to tee things up.
So

19
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.560
<v 3>Solomon,
if you want to sit her,</v>

20
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.540
say as little as possible.

21
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.890
There is no jurisdiction this slavery pleases with the property.

22
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.410
I did as instructed.
There's something wrong.
It's wrong with the instruction

23
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.310
is up

24
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.630
12 years a slave.
I was a funny man.

25
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.900
<v 2>Talk about the story behind the story.</v>

26
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:14.400
Like I think that that it's fascinating,
um,
for from a couple of different,

27
00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:15.001
you know,
stand points.

28
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:20.001
It doesn't seem like it's like the very first movie on Hollywood's list to Megan

29
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.930
and thank God that you guys created the movie.
Buckin you know,

30
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.290
maybe you start with the producers,
you know,
Dee Dee Dee and Jeremy Can,

31
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:31.080
can you tell us the story behind the story is around the creation of the movie?

32
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.333
Sure.

33
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.790
<v 4>We met with Steve Mcqueen five years ago.</v>

34
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.030
We saw hunger before it even premiered in Toronto and were blown away when we

35
00:02:42.551 --> 00:02:45.820
asked to sit down with them and have a meeting and say,

36
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.350
we think you're amazing.
And we'd like to try and find something to do with you.

37
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.180
He said,
well,
what does that mean?
Um,

38
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.830
but it evolved into a conversation about things that matter to us.

39
00:02:56.831 --> 00:03:01.831
And he asked us a really questions to why do you think it is that no American

40
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:07.651
film has really addressed the institution of slavery the day in,

41
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.880
day out experience of what that decades and decades long era of American history

42
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:15.140
was.
And we said,
we didn't know,
um,

43
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.380
with humility and some distress.
And we said,
why don't we try?

44
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.730
And that was,
uh,
that was honestly the very,
very beginning,
right,

45
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.283
that

46
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.770
<v 5>picking up from that point,
um,</v>

47
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.480
and Steve had very clear ideas about certain elements.

48
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.000
Um,
the screenwriter,

49
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.190
John Ridley became involved in the project at a certain point in the process.

50
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.080
Steve's partner,
Bianca found or came across because it existed,

51
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.410
but came across this incredible book,

52
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.510
Sama Northrop's memoir,

53
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.460
which I would encourage everyone if you have an opportunity to read this piece

54
00:03:56.461 --> 00:03:59.970
of material.
Uh,
it's an incredible,
uh,

55
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.700
overwhelming,
devastating,

56
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.850
a heartbreaking story.

57
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.330
And that became the basis of what we then turned into a screenplay that got us

58
00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:14.970
to starting to shoot the movie in June of 2012.

59
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:19.971
It was a fairly quick process after the recognition that the manuscript was the

60
00:04:20.821 --> 00:04:23.160
basis of the movie that Steve had in his mind.

61
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.630
<v 2>That's fantastic.
And,
um,
yeah,
I,
I hadn't heard of the story.</v>

62
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.080
I'm sure many of us hadn't heard of it before,

63
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.520
before you brought it up.
Um,
I even took a African studies,

64
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:38.310
African American studies classes in college.

65
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.550
My mom came of age in civil rights or in Harlem in the 60s,

66
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:46.890
and none of us heard you guys found this,
this great,
great materials.

67
00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:50.980
And thank you.
Um,
I do want to ask a question for the Peta.
Um,

68
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.360
your portrayal of,
of Patsy,
um,
was,
was so strong,

69
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:59.640
was so truthful,
um,
and you,
you've gone on,
you know,

70
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.420
an amazing ride.
You came out of Yale drama school,
um,

71
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.920
not,
not that long ago.
And,

72
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:09.890
and now you're on red carpets and an awards and,
and what,

73
00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:11.800
what's your journey been like?

74
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.310
<v 6>Oh my,
it's been,
it's been an adventure.</v>

75
00:05:17.311 --> 00:05:20.640
It's been,
um,
it's been a lot,
uh,
you know,

76
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:24.180
it all started with Steve calling me to offer me this pot.

77
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.950
And that in itself was a life changing experience,

78
00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:31.210
having the opportunity to,
um,

79
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.330
embody such a phenomenal woman that Solomon Northup described as having an air

80
00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:40.550
of loftiness.
The neither labor nor lash could rid her off.
I mean,
I,

81
00:05:40.551 --> 00:05:43.800
it was such a privilege and I thoroughly,

82
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.100
thoroughly enjoyed playing patsy and,
and then,
um,

83
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.610
there was this long wait and then the press begun and uh,

84
00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:54.210
you ready for what's about to happen?
And my answer was always no,

85
00:05:54.211 --> 00:05:56.290
I have no idea what's about to happen.

86
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.720
But know I was surrounded by people who've been through it before and who have

87
00:06:00.721 --> 00:06:03.950
been so,
so supportive of me from the very beginning.

88
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:08.570
So I've never felt alone or panicked as such.
Cause I've had,

89
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.630
I've had a backup.
So it's been,

90
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.690
it's been a long fine and I'm just so happy for how this film has been received.

91
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.340
It's not easy subject matter,
but the fact that people are embracing it,

92
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:25.280
the way they have an engaging with it is very exciting.

93
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.720
<v 2>Can you tell us about the call that you got when you were offered the role?
Um,</v>

94
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.710
I've,
I've read or heard or saw that you weren't sure,
you pause,
you had to,

95
00:06:37.711 --> 00:06:41.880
you had to think about it and,
um,
what,
what drew you to the role,
but,

96
00:06:41.881 --> 00:06:44.820
but also what would frightened you or scared you were about to?

97
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.600
<v 7>Yeah,
I was quite intimidated by it actually in the end when I,</v>

98
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.070
when Steve called me,
you know,
I'd done,
I actually like dd,
I've known Steve for,

99
00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:56.960
um,
for a while,
ever since hunger,
I went out just to Amsterdam to away lives,

100
00:06:56.961 --> 00:07:01.430
to have a coffee with them and just walk and talk about film and about life.
And,

101
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.220
um,
and I,

102
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.020
and I'd want it to work with them and we wanted to try and find something to do

103
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.350
together.
And so I was excited to get to get the call,
you know,

104
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.150
that he had this project that he wanted me to look at it and I,
uh,

105
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.500
so he sent it to me and you know,
obviously I was stunned by the story.

106
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:20.120
Like everybody else.
I'd never heard of fellow in north.

107
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:21.050
I've never heard of this story.

108
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:26.030
I'd never seen a film from inside this experience inside the slave experience.
I,

109
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.700
I kind of concluded they wouldn't,
they wouldn't be one somehow that,
uh,

110
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.570
the received information was always that it's impossible to do,
you know,
that,
uh,

111
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.680
that you need to approach this material from a kind of oblique angle.

112
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:38.110
You can't just have a,

113
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.530
a story that talks about the experience from somebody who was inside the

114
00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:46.730
experience from us,
the perspective of a slave themselves,
you know?
Uh,
so,
um,

115
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.810
I'd kind of,
uh,
uh,
in a weird way accepted that.
And um,

116
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.210
and so when I read the,
when I read the screenplay,

117
00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:58.190
I didn't even see Allaman really in it the first time I saw it as a story of

118
00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:01.310
somebody,
a man who went through this kind of extraordinary experience.

119
00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:04.190
And I remember feeling the weight of that.

120
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.140
And I looked at the story and I looked at his journey in the context of like the

121
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:12.860
wider conversations about race by race,
politics about slavery,

122
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:18.110
about making films,
about slavery,
about the,
the,
the,
the pressure,

123
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.040
uh,
the responsibility.
Uh,
and you know,

124
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.000
all of those things kind of intimidated me and I didn't want to be the guy at

125
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:30.650
the center of something that in the end wasn't what I wanted it to be because I

126
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:33.160
somehow had let it down.
Right.
Uh,

127
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.760
I felt that because Solomon was in every scene and every sequence of the film

128
00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:38.594
that the,
um,

129
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.750
that I had to be absolutely sure that I could get to all those places.

130
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.810
In the end of course,
I realized that,

131
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.730
that I was thinking with the completely the wrong part of my hand,
you know,

132
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.080
and um,
uh,
when I was,

133
00:08:50.081 --> 00:08:54.830
Steve was quite surprised by my initial reaction.
And so I went back anyway to,

134
00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:58.830
to read the book.
And as I was looking at the book,
I realized that course,
the,

135
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:00.300
the,
the,
the,
the,
that was the point.

136
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:03.210
The point wasn't that I had to worry about any of those things.
You know,

137
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:04.044
there was a,

138
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.360
there was something in the way that the book is written and the way Sullivan

139
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:08.090
talks about his story that you really is,

140
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.730
we realized that this is a sober reflection on a man's life over this period of

141
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:14.720
time.
And he writes about it with such a,

142
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:19.440
such poetry with such humility was such a kind of understanding of the human

143
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:23.760
experience,
the human spirit,
a kind of three dimensional reality,

144
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:27.900
the way he talks about all the other people in the,
in the story,
um,

145
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.310
with and given them the Jew,

146
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:32.670
giving them the respect that we know two dimensional,
one dimensional characters.

147
00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:36.030
He got to know all these people very well and talks about them as,

148
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.980
as human beings.
And it becomes that very beautiful thing of a,
of a first person,

149
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:43.920
historical narrative that sends you right back into a time and place,

150
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.680
a primary source.
And,
um,

151
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.430
and I guess at that point I realized that I was connecting with that and I

152
00:09:50.431 --> 00:09:53.850
didn't have to worry about the kind of,
the historical geo political race,

153
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:54.840
politics of everything.

154
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.930
And all of that was kind of nonsensical and I don't know why I went down that

155
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:01.290
path in the first place,
but I did.
And,
uh,
and of course,

156
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:04.500
at that point when I realized I just,
my,
my responsibility,

157
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:08.900
my job was to tell Solomon story as best I could.
Yeah.
Then I was at,
within my,

158
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.450
called Steve and apologized.
And yeah,

159
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.890
<v 2>there's,
there's,
there's something that,
um,
you know,
the,
the,
the,
the,</v>

160
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:21.670
the film is about African slavery in America.
Um,
but,

161
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.610
but it also seems like it's,
it's this,
you know,
wider canvas that,
that you,

162
00:10:26.611 --> 00:10:30.460
that the team,
that,
uh,
um,
you know,
creators,

163
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.390
you painted,
you know,
it's,
you,

164
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.860
you tell the story of the horrors of slavery that the triumph over it.

165
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:38.580
Um,

166
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.580
but it also seems to be about the overcoming of oppression just in the world in

167
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:50.220
general.
Um,
you know,
the Holocaust crimes against women,
human trafficking.

168
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.050
Um,
today,
what was this,

169
00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:56.610
was this film also a call to action or a reminder,

170
00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:01.410
um,
to,
to look at what's right under our noses in,

171
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.640
in 2014

172
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:08.380
<v 8>there's a,
a shot,
uh,
uh,
Solomon</v>

173
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.910
and I,
I'm forgetting when it comes,
but he turns,

174
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:18.140
he's gazing out and then he turns and looks directly into the camera directly at

175
00:11:19.091 --> 00:11:19.691
the audience.

176
00:11:19.691 --> 00:11:24.460
And Steve has said that he meant to,

177
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.413
to,

178
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:30.010
to drive home the point of when Solomon looks out at us,

179
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.580
it's on you.
Yes,
this is,
this is,

180
00:11:33.581 --> 00:11:35.740
this is a historical treatment,

181
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.520
but what are you going to do with what you're seeing?
So that's,
that's,

182
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.210
that was an intentional shot there.

183
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.900
<v 7>Yeah.
It's a story about engaging with what we want human respect means.</v>

184
00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:50.590
And I think that's what the book was about.
Um,
that's,

185
00:11:50.591 --> 00:11:54.190
I think that the essential part of what Solomon was talking about

186
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:58.210
<v 2>is,
is,
is human respect and human dignity.
And that is something that,</v>

187
00:11:58.211 --> 00:12:02.860
of course can be applied to.
So our age,
a very directly to every,

188
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.180
to every age.
And,
uh,
that's why that's the fundamentally the relevance,
I think.

189
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:11.210
Yeah.
There's also,
um,
spoke to it,
a lot of,

190
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.190
we could crowd source a lot of these questions and um,

191
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.510
that seems to be something like almost,
um,
uh,

192
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.950
oddly familiar and accessible,
um,
about the film.
Um,
you know,

193
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.150
Solomon is a guy who lives in the city,
you know,
we live in the city.
He,
he's got,

194
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:33.120
you know,
a family and kids.
I have family and kids.
He's got an opportunity to,

195
00:12:33.121 --> 00:12:36.790
to help his family and then we've all been there.
Um,

196
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:41.500
and then everything suddenly changes.
Um,
it was almost an,

197
00:12:41.501 --> 00:12:45.310
I don't want to read into it,
but it felt like you were,
um,
putting,

198
00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:47.740
putting an on ramp for us,
no matter what race,

199
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:52.480
no matter where you come from an onramp into,
um,
you're free.
But here,

200
00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:56.380
here's,
here's how this other experience has,

201
00:12:56.381 --> 00:12:59.170
has been [inaudible] was that,
was that by,
by design?

202
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.420
<v 5>I think that stuff is in the story,
right?</v>

203
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.290
I mean as it happens that relate-ability uh,

204
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.580
I think that it's right though that Steve understood that those elements made

205
00:13:11.581 --> 00:13:14.200
the story,
uh,
accessible.
And,

206
00:13:14.201 --> 00:13:18.810
and he's talked about it at times as it's obviously based on a real person,

207
00:13:18.811 --> 00:13:23.010
but he's talked about it as almost like a fable are something that has for all

208
00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:26.790
of its complexity,
its,
its richness.
It's its three dimensionality.

209
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.050
There's also an element of like a universal language quality of it that,

210
00:13:31.051 --> 00:13:34.160
that anybody can understand.
And I think that that as a filmmaker,

211
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.200
I think he very astutely understood that,
that,
that,

212
00:13:37.201 --> 00:13:42.060
that allowed people to access this.
And,
um,
as,
as Lupita said,

213
00:13:42.061 --> 00:13:42.450
you know,

214
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:47.450
one of the great aspects of this experience has been the public's receptivity

215
00:13:48.181 --> 00:13:51.900
and,
and embracing of this movie,
uh,
for all,
as she would tell,

216
00:13:51.901 --> 00:13:54.690
said the conventional wisdom about,
you know,
what is acceptable,

217
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.460
what isn't and what will people access of what will they not access.
Right.

218
00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.620
<v 8>I'm just going to say also,
uh,</v>

219
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:06.950
when we have seen some really good attempts at Ed,
uh,

220
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:11.200
looking at darkly at a period during slavery,

221
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.790
we could always sort of look at a distance.
We be emotional about it,

222
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:16.420
but you could,

223
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:21.400
there was a distance there and that's exactly what Solomon's story,

224
00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:21.940
uh,

225
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:26.940
gay is the gift of it is that we go in with him and,

226
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:31.660
and that's why people have such a visceral reaction to it.

227
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:36.640
Go on the journey.
And so,
you know,
of course people have talked about,

228
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.680
you know,
how brutal it is,
uh,
as well as beautiful.

229
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.510
But again,
I think Steve has said there's,
there's only five,
maybe six,

230
00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:49.180
six instances actually of violence in it.

231
00:14:49.181 --> 00:14:54.181
When you think of what watched today just on TV with all of the crime scene

232
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:57.020
investigations,
all those kinds of things,
what are,

233
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:02.200
what are teenagers are used to seeing happen to heads and things on screen that

234
00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:03.560
it really isn't,
but what,

235
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.640
why it hits us so hard is how successful it is at bringing us in.

236
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:16.110
We go in,
as you say,
down the rabbit hole with,
with solid,
right,

237
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:17.463
right.

238
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.410
<v 9>Take,</v>

239
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:23.350
Massey could a lot of manage his own time,

240
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.900
manage them all the cursor to Pharaoh's power sample,

241
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.530
a lot white plantation class.

242
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.700
This is nice.

243
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.613
<v 1>So Alfre</v>

244
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:52.400
<v 2>portray,
um,
another type of southern women that um,</v>

245
00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:57.430
history doesn't tell that story too often.
Um,
you,

246
00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:02.230
you were once a slave but you're now,
um,
or your characters,
a plantation owners,

247
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:02.860
um,

248
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:07.860
wife and therefore also a slave owner herself and she's got this almost surreal

249
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:14.290
sense of esteem that Patsy's,
um,
character,
uh,

250
00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:19.180
connects to and they have this really interesting relationship and their lives

251
00:16:19.181 --> 00:16:22.590
are so different.
We would love to,
to hear more about what,

252
00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:27.490
what that relationship was and,
and what,
um,
each Scott out of it.

253
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:29.383
<v 8>Well I think</v>

254
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.740
what Lupita said about patsy having the air of loftiness,

255
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.990
I think Mr is Shah.

256
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.170
They say way is apps and everybody else,

257
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.890
she is an exceptional person.
Patsy is,

258
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:51.200
and it doesn't matter what station you put a person like that in that is still

259
00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:53.960
going to come from them.
There are women in that house.

260
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:57.140
Ms. Mr [inaudible] is not getting invited to tea parties at the other

261
00:16:57.141 --> 00:17:01.610
plantations.
But there are certainly women in every plantation house.

262
00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:06.460
There's lots of women.
Concubines,
you know,
just,
you know,

263
00:17:06.461 --> 00:17:08.990
that's,
that's how life was.

264
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.770
So there are people in her house that she could have tea with,

265
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.870
but this person has shown this incredible sense of,

266
00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:22.910
of,
of character and you're drawn to her.
So she recognizes that in patsy.

267
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.930
That's why I think she likes spending time with patsy because it makes her

268
00:17:26.931 --> 00:17:27.650
special.

269
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.980
One thing that Mr [inaudible] has to do what she has to constantly try to feel

270
00:17:30.981 --> 00:17:35.981
special because she knows how to do the form of I'm I have arrived.

271
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.100
Uh,

272
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:42.100
that's why she forces Plat to sit with her is that she knows and everybody in

273
00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:48.260
the area knows that he knows more words then her husband and all the other

274
00:17:48.261 --> 00:17:52.590
masters.
Right.
And so,
but it is so self centered.

275
00:17:52.591 --> 00:17:54.270
It doesn't matter what's going on with him,

276
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.300
what's going to happen when he gets back.
Let's have tea.

277
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:02.160
So she has created her own little elite circle there.
Those are the people,

278
00:18:02.161 --> 00:18:04.590
she wants to sit with it.
But at the same time,

279
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.810
she is trying to get patsy to use her,

280
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.740
her attraction to,
to elevate her state in life.
And,

281
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.290
and of course he doesn't do it,

282
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:21.291
which makes her even wore a person to be admired and drawn to.

283
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.520
So I think that's the basis basis of how she,

284
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.740
what she wants from that relationship.

285
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.010
<v 2>And Lupita,
I'm curious,
you know,
the,
um,</v>

286
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.530
the scenery,
the environment of,

287
00:18:36.531 --> 00:18:41.370
of this movie in Louisiana was,
was so,

288
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.490
so rich and Steve's um,

289
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:48.720
sort of bringing out the beautiful icons and imagery of the south of the

290
00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:53.720
plantations,
the cotton fields that the weeping willows.
Um,
I must've,

291
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.440
I imagine it must've been like living in,
in,
in,

292
00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:01.250
in history and you're very real presence as well.

293
00:19:01.251 --> 00:19:03.600
W W what was it like being on set,

294
00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:06.300
but it also being in that history,

295
00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.650
<v 6>I mean,
it was so useful.</v>

296
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.180
I can't imagine this film being shot any other place because the history is so

297
00:19:13.181 --> 00:19:14.620
present in Louisiana.

298
00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.580
The oak trees that were surrounding us were like 300 years old.

299
00:19:18.581 --> 00:19:22.780
So they witnessed people like Solomon and patsy and you know,
they,

300
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:26.930
they'll probably black people who would hang from those trees and,
and um,

301
00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:31.360
so it was always very present and also the heat is a character.

302
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:33.563
<v 4>I,
you know,</v>

303
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.360
<v 6>you,
you prepare,</v>

304
00:19:35.361 --> 00:19:40.361
I was preparing him Massachusetts and not in Massachusetts and Connecticut or

305
00:19:40.881 --> 00:19:43.730
this role where I was living and um,
you know,

306
00:19:43.731 --> 00:19:48.731
and then you get down to Louisiana and everything changes in the heat.

307
00:19:49.161 --> 00:19:50.450
Your priorities change.

308
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.480
<v 4>You know,
I really have to walk that fine.</v>

309
00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:02.060
Do I need that sound rich right now?
So

310
00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:06.350
<v 6>hot and um,
you,
so it changed my gate,
itch it,
it just,</v>

311
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.500
it took me that extra mile into character to think about the fact that these

312
00:20:11.691 --> 00:20:14.300
were the conditions that the slaves were working under.

313
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.720
They were picking cotton for how many hours in these conditions.

314
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:22.280
Our first day on set was 108 degrees and we wish shooting the cotton picking

315
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.900
season.
So,
you know,

316
00:20:23.901 --> 00:20:28.130
and it's back breaking work as well to bend over and you have to have a plan.

317
00:20:28.131 --> 00:20:30.710
If you're going to pick 500 pounds of cotton a day,

318
00:20:30.711 --> 00:20:34.460
there's got to be a system in place.
And so it was all so helpful.

319
00:20:34.461 --> 00:20:39.410
And I remember the first time I put on like my costume,
Patty Norris,

320
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:44.420
the costume designer,
she said to me that my clothes were from an actual sleep.

321
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:48.450
It was actual sleeve woman's garb.
And I looked down at it,

322
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.950
had these intricate patchwork on the,

323
00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:55.951
on the skirt and I was just met with the fact that every single stitch on this

324
00:20:56.171 --> 00:21:00.100
good story and I was standing in it to you though.

325
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:05.230
And yeah,
I mean all those things helped so much with getting into character.

326
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.500
Right,
right.
So,
uh,
another,
another clip.

327
00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.100
<v 10>Oh,
went domestic Charles Plantation.</v>

328
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:17.330
You admit it freely and you know why I got this from Mr Schulte.

329
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.750
Ms Is not shown even grab me know,
so

330
00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.840
<v 11>thank you so much.
I make myself gay.</v>

331
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:39.840
Day In,
day out is modern,
any Madea and food out,

332
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:44.620
<v 10>be clean.
That's what I did here.
What?</v>

333
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:45.620
I went to Charlottesville

334
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.530
<v 2>and then we know where we're,
the seam goes after that.
Okay.
Can,</v>

335
00:21:49.531 --> 00:21:54.050
can you tell us how did you prepare for,
for that,
um,

336
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:58.580
specific scene that,
that day?
Um,
you know,
pro probably,
you know,

337
00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:03.630
I guess one of the hardest days and Patsy's life and I'm sure a hard day in your

338
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:04.744
life as well.

339
00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:05.901
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

340
00:22:05.901 --> 00:22:10.220
And the book Solomon Describes a day as one of the darkest days of all times.

341
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:14.810
And that is significant considering how much violence there was on this

342
00:22:14.811 --> 00:22:15.644
plantation.

343
00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:20.920
He talks about hearing the crack of a whip from dawn to dusk on this plantation.

344
00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.790
So he was always something that I was aware it was coming.

345
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:27.980
But in preparing for Patsy,

346
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.810
patsy always had an undercurrent of grief because that was a condition of her

347
00:22:32.811 --> 00:22:33.644
life.

348
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:39.070
But I couldn't sentimentalize one day from another states work for me.

349
00:22:40.071 --> 00:22:41.080
It was,
I,

350
00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.840
it was just making it practical that that was what I was going to have to do on

351
00:22:44.841 --> 00:22:49.130
Tuesday.
No,
but,
uh,
the day before,
uh,

352
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.690
we did a scene in which I needed the wounds from,
uh,
uh,

353
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.610
from previous,
uh,
with things patty has previous with things before that one.

354
00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:02.840
And we,
we,
we had,
um,
those put on my back and it took four hours.

355
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.150
And so the next day for the next day,

356
00:23:05.151 --> 00:23:08.510
I was looking at the call sheet and I saw that I was going to be in the makeup

357
00:23:08.511 --> 00:23:12.500
chair for six hours to do the pre whipping and then the post whipping scarves.

358
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.400
And uh,
I said to the makeup artists Color Davey,
listen,

359
00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.750
I'm just going to go home with these guys so that tomorrow we can cut my w I

360
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.300
work in half.
And she loved the idea.
So I went back to my hotel room and,

361
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.020
and I tried to get some sleep.
Uh,

362
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.110
I had a very hard time sleeping the entire time that I was,

363
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.170
we were making 12 years a slave.

364
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.180
But that night I slept even less because these guys would just ever so present

365
00:23:38.181 --> 00:23:41.420
on my back.
And I was uncomfortable.

366
00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:43.940
I stepped on my belly and I just,

367
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.660
I was just haunted by these things on my back.

368
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:52.070
And I remember weeping at night and I was fretting to myself.

369
00:23:52.071 --> 00:23:57.071
And then it occurred to me that my discomfort was temporary and the woman whom I

370
00:23:57.831 --> 00:24:01.730
was so privileged to portray her discomfort was permanent.

371
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.850
And it just puts everything into perspective for the next day.

372
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:10.090
And it was that one thing I needed in preparation for the next day that I could

373
00:24:10.341 --> 00:24:12.320
not have planned,
you know,

374
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.560
but it just really centered me and gave me just presence of mind for the next

375
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.490
day's work because there was absolutely no other way that I could prepare for

376
00:24:22.491 --> 00:24:27.440
the humiliation and the Sh,
just the heartbreak of being stripped naked and,

377
00:24:27.441 --> 00:24:31.640
and,
and,
and whipped.
So anyway,
the next day I got on set.

378
00:24:31.641 --> 00:24:36.641
And what I found is that was everyone's so focused on the work at hand,

379
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:43.370
so I wasn't going in it by myself.
You know,
I was going in with my,

380
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:47.240
my cast members to a towel,
Michael Cera,

381
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:52.400
and we all needed each other to make it happen.
I mean,
it was,
it was,

382
00:24:52.401 --> 00:24:56.540
um,
our responsibility to just do,

383
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.400
do the scene as,

384
00:24:58.401 --> 00:25:02.930
as honestly and openly as we could.
And,
um,

385
00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.990
I remember,
I,
it was heartbreaking,

386
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:10.640
but it was such a joy to be able to go there as well.

387
00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:12.780
<v 2>It was amazing.
Um,</v>

388
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.800
and I have to imagine that it's going back and forth between that real history

389
00:25:19.461 --> 00:25:24.200
and then your real life were,
you know,
one moment,
you know,
apps,

390
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:28.600
these apps,
and then in the next moment he's Michael,
um,
uh,

391
00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:33.470
dismiss have been jarring.
Um,
yeah.

392
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.130
<v 6>Yeah.
It wasn't actually,</v>

393
00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.060
I don't think it was ever Jari we all recognize that it will do this.

394
00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:44.250
It was our job to do these,
to play these roles.
And my goal would have been,

395
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.780
it would have done his us a disservice if he was any gentler,
you know,

396
00:25:48.781 --> 00:25:52.950
he went there full force at Lee and he was so scary.
Um,

397
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:57.300
but it was exciting to be able to work with someone who was that committed and,

398
00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.360
and to do it with people that you trust and,

399
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:05.690
and gained extra respect for and love because of their commitment to their

400
00:26:06.121 --> 00:26:08.790
roles.
I,
it never was jarring to me.
No.

401
00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.000
<v 2>What was it like working with Steve Mcqueen?
Uh,
uh,
uh,</v>

402
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.570
you were quoted as saying he's making films that people will be talking about

403
00:26:17.571 --> 00:26:20.580
and watching 50 years from now.
Um,

404
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:24.710
tell us more about the style and this is also enough to,
to,

405
00:26:24.711 --> 00:26:27.680
to anyone who would love to hear more.
Um,

406
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.890
<v 7>Steve,
you know,
is,
uh,
I just,</v>

407
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:34.610
I mean from everything that I've seen of his from before,
you know,

408
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:39.200
from hunger shame,
you know,
he just has an exceptional autistic quality.
I mean,

409
00:26:39.201 --> 00:26:41.900
he's really a true,
I mean obviously he has an autistic background,

410
00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:42.411
but he's somebody who,

411
00:26:42.411 --> 00:26:46.680
who's involved in every aspect of filmmaking in a way that I do think is,

412
00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:51.330
is rare that he is,
um,
that he just seems so,

413
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.150
so born to it and a,
and has this kind of depth of,

414
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:59.370
of passion that matches his ability.
Uh,

415
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.450
and it means that you feel completely in safe hands in any,

416
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:05.220
in whatever he asks you to do.

417
00:27:05.221 --> 00:27:09.240
And wherever he is asking you to push whatever avenue you're going to go down,

418
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.400
you'll never feeling that you can.
Um,
you know,

419
00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:15.240
you want to keep one foot on the dock and one on the boat.
You know,
you are,

420
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.170
you are,
you are,
you're free just to get in the boat and sail away with them,

421
00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:24.110
you know,
and uh,
and see whatever,
whatever comes out of that.
You know,
I,
um,

422
00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:24.620
you know,

423
00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:29.590
I've never shot a film in sequence and I remember that in the first early on I

424
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:34.020
spoke to Steve about maybe shooting this in sequence,
you know,
um,
and uh,

425
00:27:34.021 --> 00:27:37.350
and he said he liked the idea but that because of people's schedules,
you know,

426
00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.390
um,
uh,
it just wasn't possible.

427
00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:41.570
So we had to shoot certain bits in it in different.
Uh,

428
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.970
so we started on the apps plantation actually.
And,
uh,

429
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:49.740
and so in a way that was very good for me because I got to see,
um,

430
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:52.750
Michael and Steve Working together and,

431
00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.580
and could just start to plug myself into that process.

432
00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.940
And what I kind of think I learnt by that is the kind of freedom with which they

433
00:27:59.941 --> 00:28:04.290
approach the work and the determination to find out absolutely everything that

434
00:28:04.291 --> 00:28:07.940
I've seen can offer to leave no stone unturned and then to a mental,

435
00:28:07.941 --> 00:28:08.760
leave the scene,

436
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.690
leave the moment having left everything on the floor and a and then go out and

437
00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:15.960
enjoy,
enjoy life.
We had it.
I mean,
we had a great time as well,

438
00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:18.660
making this film and that's a,
it's maybe surprises people,

439
00:28:18.661 --> 00:28:21.840
but we put a lot of passion into the days.
Uh,

440
00:28:21.841 --> 00:28:24.870
and we were working at such a pitch.
We have 35 days to shoot the farm.

441
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:29.490
So we had a total intensity while we were working on the,

442
00:28:29.491 --> 00:28:32.950
on the project,
uh,
people were coming and going,
uh,
because of the,

443
00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.410
the sort of odyssey nature of it.

444
00:28:34.411 --> 00:28:37.010
So they were parties for people who are arriving,
actors who were arriving,

445
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.650
there were parties for actors who are leaving.
You know,
we were able to,
uh,

446
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:42.840
to get out there and enjoy each other,
get to know each other.

447
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.920
And that is the kind of family relationship with Steve wanted to build on that

448
00:28:46.921 --> 00:28:48.690
set because uh,
uh,
and the,

449
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:53.430
and all of that is part of allowing people to go to those places on the days,

450
00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:56.850
in the moment,
in the,
in the heat and whatever.
I think by the end of it,

451
00:28:56.851 --> 00:29:00.000
we were prepared to do anything to tell the story with Steve and,
uh,

452
00:29:00.001 --> 00:29:03.780
and he was a kind of fearless leader who was also prepared to go to any lengths

453
00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.600
to tell Solomon the story and how there was just no,

454
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.440
there was no boundary to that.
I think he's a remarkable film maker.
Um,

455
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.820
for that reason.
Just the kind of depth of passion and ability.
Right,
right,

456
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.020
<v 8>right.
Yes.
I wanted you to talk because I,</v>

457
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.860
I think the day that I arrived,

458
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:26.400
because we had left apps plantation and because of the character of Mr is Shah,

459
00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.360
I think we might've been working differently than was the style that he had

460
00:29:34.361 --> 00:29:36.280
already.
He had already created.

461
00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:40.240
We actually sort of came up with it on,

462
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:43.960
on the move because,
uh,

463
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.160
if you're gonna lead this very solid foundation that you got it,

464
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.360
it can't be one of those little spare tires that you put on in your car is

465
00:29:55.361 --> 00:29:59.940
leaning to one side.
And so we had to find it in,

466
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:04.090
in motion in the day.
And it was also something we had no frame of reference for.

467
00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:06.950
Right.
So,
um,
but the,

468
00:30:06.951 --> 00:30:11.640
the reason I came on was that I had seen all of Steve's work when,

469
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.960
when it was happening and uh,

470
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:18.580
so I said yes before I even knew what he wanted me to do.
Um,

471
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.350
but for me,
he is,
um,

472
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:28.600
I like working with people that I,
that that I learned something each time out.

473
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:32.290
You don't learn a lot.
I'm a be honest on movie sets anymore.

474
00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.850
It used to be because it was different,
uh,
work ethic.

475
00:30:36.851 --> 00:30:39.010
There was a different aesthetic from,

476
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:43.360
and people came to their disciplines from a love of it,

477
00:30:43.361 --> 00:30:45.910
from wherever they move from in the world to do it.

478
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:50.680
Now it's kind of like the Toyota factory moves to town and everybody chooses a

479
00:30:50.681 --> 00:30:55.120
department they want to specialize in because if we go to the places for tax

480
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:56.740
incentives,
but anyway,

481
00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:01.830
so he is one of those people that not only what was I going to learn something

482
00:31:03.731 --> 00:31:04.660
about myself,

483
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:08.350
I was going to learn something about the other departments I was going to see,

484
00:31:08.351 --> 00:31:09.550
I was going to be told,

485
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.540
he lets you know what he is seeing the whole time and so,
uh,

486
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:19.590
again there's no separation between the actor and the director and he's one of

487
00:31:19.631 --> 00:31:22.960
those people that tells you things you can actually activate.

488
00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:28.540
That's,
that is the main problem with directors.
If they do speak at all,

489
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:32.440
it's usually conceptual.
I'm not going to get any more jobs.

490
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:35.643
<v 5>Hi.</v>

491
00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:41.430
<v 8>But it's like having,
I was just heaven.</v>

492
00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:46.580
It's like having the best piece of music and you're at the top of your form as a

493
00:31:49.501 --> 00:31:54.501
musician and you've got a maestro that is an extension of,

494
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:59.310
of of you yourself.
I mean it's just,
I've said this,

495
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.910
I would've gone to Kabul and pulled cable for him.

496
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.510
<v 5>Something that just occurring to me is that I remember when,</v>

497
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.300
when deedee and I were in early conversations with Steve,

498
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:15.750
he talked about the scene where Solomon is forced to with patsy and it's like

499
00:32:16.001 --> 00:32:19.060
you understood that that seemed contained enormous power.

500
00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.030
And it's so remarkable to hear,
you know,

501
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:27.090
these incredible actors talk about their experiences inside of that framework as

502
00:32:27.461 --> 00:32:28.680
if it was like almost pre,

503
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:33.750
but somehow he understood that even before that process happened and before the

504
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:38.380
actors were cast.
And that's,
that's that kind of um,
musicality,
uh,

505
00:32:38.381 --> 00:32:40.090
organic creative PR

506
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:44.030
<v 8>evolving process that Alfie was just talking about.
Um,
so we,</v>

507
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:48.680
I think we all left this experience with just enormous respect and admiration

508
00:32:48.681 --> 00:32:49.514
for Steve.

509
00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:50.050
<v 2>Oh,</v>

510
00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:54.690
we'd love to talk a little bit about the completed film and then how it's being

511
00:32:54.691 --> 00:32:59.230
received.
And I want to start off with the descendants of,
of Solomon Northup.

512
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:03.710
Um,
I saw the site that I'm a forensic box up,

513
00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:07.520
put ups basins of solomon.com and if you guys haven't seen that,

514
00:33:07.521 --> 00:33:10.410
you have to check it out.
It's almost like the real,
the real,

515
00:33:10.411 --> 00:33:15.330
real ending of the movie after the credits roll because it's hit the great,

516
00:33:15.331 --> 00:33:18.240
great,
great grandson,
the great,
great,
great,
great granddaughter,

517
00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.900
all posting videos.
There's a woman who plays violin like,

518
00:33:21.901 --> 00:33:26.280
like Solomon and their bio's and,
um,
it goes on in their lives.

519
00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:31.140
How have the descendants,
um,
uh,
embrace this movie?

520
00:33:31.141 --> 00:33:35.040
And how has that interaction been?
What,
what's been the feedback

521
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:40.210
<v 6>that's sort of been that,
that the best treasurer on,
you know,</v>

522
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:44.670
in the wake of the film we didn't,
we didn't know what we would find.

523
00:33:44.671 --> 00:33:49.671
I think there's been a Solomon Northup Day in Saratoga Springs every July for

524
00:33:50.971 --> 00:33:52.500
about five years.

525
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:58.070
And I think last year it was attended by maybe 30 or 35 to send it.

526
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.520
Right.
And it was a deeply intimate,
thoroughly felt,
but,

527
00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:10.140
but local affair.
Um,
and this,

528
00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.423
but we had,

529
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:15.360
we had a thought that if the movie got seen and if it was well received and if

530
00:34:15.361 --> 00:34:20.361
it was discussed that it would be found and that we would find these people that

531
00:34:20.791 --> 00:34:24.720
they would find us.
And it's been,
I mean,
it really,
it's,

532
00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:26.170
it's such a thrill.

533
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:31.260
I did a Q and a in DC for the Polaris Foundation and during the Q and a,

534
00:34:31.261 --> 00:34:35.670
this woman stood up and I just want to say,
I am the great,
great,
great,
great,

535
00:34:35.671 --> 00:34:40.020
great granddaughter of Sun and read me the lineage and which when I burst out

536
00:34:40.021 --> 00:34:42.780
crying and um,

537
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:46.410
she had her son with her and it's a,
now we had,

538
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:51.450
we got Christmas cards and we've gotten emails and congratulations and this

539
00:34:51.451 --> 00:34:55.200
website and the collection of people on it,

540
00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:59.770
the breadth of people,
people of every race,
color,
shade,

541
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.060
Sex,
a age skill.
It's,

542
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:08.200
it is the most moving and you think this man lived as played by two tall and

543
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:16.650
look who's here for it.
Um,
but that just keeps coming.

544
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:18.800
<v 8>You know,</v>

545
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.800
that's one of the things about this film that is such a gift and it gives us the

546
00:35:26.391 --> 00:35:29.950
possibility to,
uh,
to do,
you know,

547
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:34.990
jettison so forward into health and wellness as a culture,

548
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:36.171
as a society.

549
00:35:36.171 --> 00:35:41.171
Because Americans have not wanted to hear about slips.

550
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:44.730
Slavery,
black people would say,
you know what?

551
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.410
This is the bum me out or I'm going to be so pissed off and why people would
say,

552
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.140
you know,
we didn't have any money.
My people have made,

553
00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.360
we didn't own anything or I wasn't there.

554
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:57.930
It was like nobody want it to look at that and so,

555
00:35:57.931 --> 00:36:02.010
but when you cut off the things that you think are negative,

556
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.800
you also cut off the incredible things that,
that,

557
00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:10.590
that are born out of that,
I mean none of us would be here.

558
00:36:10.591 --> 00:36:15.591
We would not be a super power if we had not had 300 years of forced labor.

559
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.320
And that's a terrible thing.
But it's at,

560
00:36:19.321 --> 00:36:24.321
and we are all related that the genealogical society in d c says that 65% of

561
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.360
Caucasian Americans have significant black blood.

562
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:35.160
So we try to like parcel up and eat on different sides of the cafeteria and all

563
00:36:35.161 --> 00:36:37.110
that.
I know you all don't but

564
00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.260
read by departments.

565
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:45.560
But the truth is it is a family history.

566
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:50.280
It is our American family history.
And when we embrace it,

567
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.910
and it wasn't long ago.
And when we embraced that,

568
00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:58.911
we began to understand ourselves and accept ourselves and we begin to understand

569
00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:03.880
each other or a little bit more and to

570
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:10.200
most of the ills that we have thrown money and you know,

571
00:37:10.201 --> 00:37:15.201
rap sessions and work sessions at since the sentence since the 60s you could

572
00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:22.011
just trace it right back in 2014 the fact of how many incarcerated people are in

573
00:37:24.781 --> 00:37:29.781
this country and how many incarcerated people are black and brown men.

574
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:35.160
But it traces right back to,
and when you understand where a thing happens,

575
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:38.940
you,
you approach,
you approach solutions in a different way.

576
00:37:38.941 --> 00:37:41.730
So all of that to say,
and I,
I,

577
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:46.760
this is an American story.
By that I mean that it's,

578
00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:48.590
it's our history.
It is the,

579
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.490
it is a west African story.
It is a history.

580
00:37:53.491 --> 00:37:58.080
It is a British story.
It's all of that.

581
00:37:58.081 --> 00:38:03.060
Everybody that's involved in that and it informs us right today.

582
00:38:03.061 --> 00:38:04.230
And when we don't,

583
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:09.330
when we don't recognize that and embrace that,
we lose out,

584
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:11.040
first of all on all the great things.

585
00:38:11.041 --> 00:38:15.440
But we also will constantly stay off kilter.
Um,

586
00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:17.040
that I,
I just,

587
00:38:17.041 --> 00:38:21.570
I'm hoping that that it is the beginning of being able to,

588
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.930
to talk about solutions.
Yeah.

589
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:30.500
<v 2>Well I'd love to thank you.
Then.
I'd love to cut to some questions.
So,
um,
if,
uh,</v>

590
00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:35.410
people can line up for the mic,
but um,
on that note before,
before we do that,

591
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:40.150
um,
we're,
we're,
we're Google.
We love art.
We love great movies.

592
00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:44.890
Thank you Russell Love data.
And if we can go to the slide,

593
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.400
we want to talk a little show actually depict a little,

594
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:51.940
a little bit around the conversation that,
um,

595
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:55.030
this movie has really spurred on.

596
00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:59.360
So this is on google.com search trends around the,

597
00:38:59.361 --> 00:39:03.400
the phrase,
uh,
12 years a slave,
but we also bundled in,
um,

598
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.730
things like Solomon,
Northrop and slavery.
Um,

599
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.680
and you can see there's not a lot of conversation happening around that.

600
00:39:11.681 --> 00:39:15.100
And then there's this surge when,
when you release the,
the,

601
00:39:15.101 --> 00:39:17.440
this great picture of that.
That's off the charts.

602
00:39:17.441 --> 00:39:19.790
And if we can go to the next slide.
Um,

603
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:24.840
this is on youtube.com when you search for the phrase 12 years a slave,

604
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:30.420
there's over 200,000 search results that come up.
So this is,
um,

605
00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:34.960
uh,
clips that Fox is putting up interviews that,
that you guys are doing,
um,

606
00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:39.430
discussions that are happening,
uh,
in,
in,
in,
in,
in the world.

607
00:39:39.431 --> 00:39:41.210
So you guys are really,
really,
uh,

608
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:46.280
resonated and encourage this conversation around slavery.
Um,

609
00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:50.560
but that hasn't happened,
um,
in,
in the way that,
that it has now.
So anyway,

610
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.423
thank you man.

611
00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:56.660
<v 0>MMM [inaudible]</v>

612
00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:01.920
<v 12>so why don't we cut to two questions.
One,</v>

613
00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:04.550
I just saw the film and I just,

614
00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:08.480
I just have to say it's been absolutely amazing and thank you so much for,

615
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:12.470
for that.
This is our history.
It's an American history.
Like you said,

616
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:15.920
was there a certain resolution or something that you all felt that,
oh,

617
00:40:15.921 --> 00:40:18.200
I have to be this or I have to do something,

618
00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:22.190
some kind of takeaway that you all had after the experience of making this film?

619
00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:26.440
<v 7>What it was a,
I mean,
it's so all encompassing this and the experience.</v>

620
00:40:26.441 --> 00:40:29.200
It was the most extraordinary experiences of my life,
you know,
as a,

621
00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:34.360
as an actor and a,
and outside of being an actor.
Um,
there was just a,

622
00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.310
there was a remarkable sense of,
of,

623
00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:40.660
of passion and a responsibility and privilege.

624
00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:41.571
And,

625
00:40:41.571 --> 00:40:44.740
and I feel like the process of making this film and the process of getting out

626
00:40:44.741 --> 00:40:49.310
this idea of,
um,
of,
of engaging with,
with human respect,
you know,

627
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:53.020
it's something that I think all of us can take into our lives,

628
00:40:53.021 --> 00:40:57.790
into our work communities,
into our,
all the social aspects of our existence.

629
00:40:57.791 --> 00:41:01.990
It's a,
it's a,
it's a very fundamental part of how we exist.
And I think that,

630
00:41:01.991 --> 00:41:02.461
that,
this,

631
00:41:02.461 --> 00:41:07.120
that this film encouraged me to continue to engage with those ideas and to do

632
00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.990
things that aren't in my power to,
uh,
to support that.
You know,

633
00:41:10.991 --> 00:41:15.910
we're always kind of pushed to be divided somehow into,
into genders,

634
00:41:15.911 --> 00:41:19.150
into racism,
to religions,
into sexualities and a,

635
00:41:19.151 --> 00:41:21.970
and just let left the kind of pitch it out and fight against each other.

636
00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.170
You know,
and I think that,
uh,
but what films like this speak to is,
um,

637
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:30.340
is the nature of how divisive that is and where that can lead to and,
uh,

638
00:41:30.341 --> 00:41:34.070
and I think we can all engage in our lives to reverse those trends.

639
00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.170
<v 13>Hi.
I just want to say I love you all.
Ms. Woodard.</v>

640
00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:40.060
You're probably one of my favorite actresses in the whole world,
so,

641
00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.820
and it's such a privilege,
but I've heard you speak

642
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:51.390
this particular role.
How difficult did you personally find it?

643
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:54.790
What did you do to prepare for it?
How did you go about that?
And,

644
00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:01.440
<v 8>um,
it wasn't difficult at all because</v>

645
00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:08.060
I don't know how to describe it.
When,
when I,
when I take on a role,
um,

646
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.230
first night that,
you know,
not with Steve,

647
00:42:11.231 --> 00:42:13.190
I agreed before I even saw the script abuse you,

648
00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:17.950
but I read it and if while I'm reading,
if by page five,

649
00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.290
every time my part comes up,

650
00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:24.160
something happens emotionally on those lines while I read it,

651
00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:25.750
then I'm hooked.

652
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:31.470
I usually put it away until probably the day before,

653
00:42:31.961 --> 00:42:33.850
maybe two days before I shoot.

654
00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:38.750
But what I started to do is just in my everyday life,
uh,

655
00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:42.400
I see where that person is from the time period,

656
00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:47.380
the type of person just by clues that other what people say about them,

657
00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:51.550
you get ideas about them.
So if I'm at whole foods,
I live in this area,

658
00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:56.440
I'm in whole foods,
you know,
I'll just suddenly start to toy with dialect,

659
00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:01.110
finding that person,
the way they speak and I start to toss in,

660
00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.200
you know,

661
00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:07.200
just dialect and so that it becomes natural so I don't have to turn it on.

662
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:12.010
When I get there I start to work on that person.
The way that they move,

663
00:43:12.011 --> 00:43:15.940
the way that they walk and their sensibilities.

664
00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:22.530
You have to leave behind any evidence of yourself to,

665
00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:26.980
to,
to stand up and flesh out another person.

666
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.930
That's what all of our training is about.
They take you,
take,
you,

667
00:43:31.931 --> 00:43:35.590
take you to a neutral point.
So then you,
so when you start to work,

668
00:43:35.591 --> 00:43:36.640
you build on that.

669
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:43.230
How I feel about mistress Shaw is absolutely of no importance and especially

670
00:43:44.891 --> 00:43:48.280
it's detrimental to how to do anything about it.

671
00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:52.150
All my responsibility is,
is to find that person's reality.

672
00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:54.430
And I think about

673
00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:00.850
you slowly start to take things on what she would like to do.
How can you,

674
00:44:00.851 --> 00:44:03.550
and I just kind of play that out as I'm moving around.

675
00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:06.100
I don't work on the words.

676
00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:10.730
I think in real life we never know where we're going to say until we say it.

677
00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:15.730
So I want to know as little about what I'm going to say more about

678
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.370
defining who I am,

679
00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.180
who be being that person,

680
00:44:23.181 --> 00:44:24.650
standing in that person.

681
00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:28.310
So the one thing that I did with dialect,

682
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:33.820
I felt terrible because I was so happy to be there that I would just kind of

683
00:44:33.931 --> 00:44:35.370
giddy because it had been working.

684
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
You guys were all tired and it was hot man no to Tim had to run up the road and

685
00:44:42.781 --> 00:44:47.781
up the stairs and the first time you ran up we were going to rehearse it.

686
00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:52.050
But I thought,
you know,
you just come up and we'd kind of say just the camera.
He,

687
00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:56.010
he ran up and he was not a breath and he was sweating.

688
00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:59.710
But when he got there,
I was so shocked at,
Oh,
I'm really sorry

689
00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.130
you had to run the game.
And I was like,
oh my gosh.
Were like,

690
00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:10.870
so I had to go,
okay,
but,

691
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:16.250
but it worked because I could not have any awareness of their world or any

692
00:45:17.241 --> 00:45:18.590
feelings about it because,

693
00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:22.910
because she lived in her own kind of space.

694
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:27.320
So the one thing that I did do was I decided to do work on dialect.

695
00:45:27.321 --> 00:45:32.321
So I try to incorporate because everybody was coming from different places,

696
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.220
like in the Gullah islands off South Carolina,

697
00:45:37.221 --> 00:45:41.020
there's still people that probably speak closer to uh,

698
00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:45.650
the African tongues than before.
And so I knew some Gullah,

699
00:45:45.651 --> 00:45:48.380
I decided that I had come in from that direction.

700
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:53.180
There in New Orleans is just like a Gumbo.
That's why they have Gumbo.
It's,

701
00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.670
you've got rent,
you've got Spanish,
you got west Western it.

702
00:45:55.790 --> 00:46:00.790
So I started to toy with mixing the sounds and also her trying to put on airs to

703
00:46:04.371 --> 00:46:08.600
be what she had seen before.
Tossing in some words,

704
00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:12.560
but not quite having the hang of how they come out.
So just,

705
00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:15.050
just subtly with,
with dialogue.
But,

706
00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:19.320
but that's usually how I put a character together.
Thank you.

707
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.690
<v 14>As everyone else.
Thank you so much for this movie.
I come from the nine.</v>

708
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:30.300
It states where I grew up and it's always been something that haunts me,

709
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.480
this subject matter because every time I'm,
I'm more angry.

710
00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:38.640
So the scene where Plat is hanging and slave life was going on behind,

711
00:46:38.641 --> 00:46:42.570
children are playing and I know there's part of that that was instituted

712
00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:44.400
probably they couldn't look at him.
Um,

713
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:48.330
I wondered how much of that was in the book or was that inspired by

714
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:51.140
improvisation or the director's input?

715
00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:56.990
<v 7>It was,
um,
it was a mixture of things really.
The,
uh,
I think,
um,</v>

716
00:46:57.230 --> 00:47:01.520
a lot of it is in the book.
I think the children or something that Steve put in,

717
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:06.770
if I remember at the,
uh,
on the day,
um,
you know,
I think he was,

718
00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:11.180
it was something Steve was very interested in.
Uh,
you know,
the book is,

719
00:47:11.181 --> 00:47:14.120
so obviously we have to truncate the book a lot.

720
00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:19.100
And what that means is there were certain sequences that had to kind of speak to

721
00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:23.090
why to things then we could put into the film.
Um,
you know,

722
00:47:23.091 --> 00:47:27.260
the nature of the book,
I mean,
you know,
as Jeremy was saying earlier,

723
00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:31.210
it's an extraordinary biography.
It's extraordinary and a,

724
00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:33.490
and there are so many details that we couldn't keep into.

725
00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:36.940
We couldn't put into two hours.
So there were,

726
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.030
there were things that we had to kind of come up with that,

727
00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:43.150
that represented the kind of emotional journey that people were going on in

728
00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:43.780
different ways.

729
00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:48.490
And I think Steve was just trying to find different images that could represent

730
00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:52.750
not only the physical torture,
but also the psychological torture that was,

731
00:47:52.751 --> 00:47:57.010
that was happening and how,
um,
and how that society was kind of,

732
00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.670
we're sort of working and was,
and was controlled.
So,
um,

733
00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:03.610
so he used different elements.
I mean,
we,
we,
we,
we,

734
00:48:03.611 --> 00:48:05.440
we tried to make a film that was a very,

735
00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:09.550
very accurate representation of the book.
Um,
and,

736
00:48:09.551 --> 00:48:13.840
and also give more of the scope that the book has that we couldn't necessarily

737
00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:15.460
fit into the,
into the two hours

738
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.790
<v 15>the institution of slavery has had such,</v>

739
00:48:18.791 --> 00:48:22.750
I like lasting direct impact on American culture,
American life.

740
00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.420
And it's something that if we're not always the most informed about,

741
00:48:25.421 --> 00:48:27.730
we're still always kind of remember,

742
00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:31.900
but I also was struck by how many people in the movie involved with the movie.

743
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:33.970
We're not American.
Um,

744
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.870
but people who grew up surrounded by this reminders of this institution versus

745
00:48:37.871 --> 00:48:41.500
people who kind of heard about it maybe secondhand,

746
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:45.430
maybe who experienced it in different ways from across the Atlantic are.

747
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:49.220
<v 7>Yeah,
I think we will all vary.
I mean,</v>

748
00:48:49.221 --> 00:48:53.510
we're all very connected to this experience,
you know,
in the,
uh,
kind of,
uh,

749
00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:58.540
it's just the way that it's that slavery globally worked basically in terms of a

750
00:48:58.851 --> 00:49:01.700
west Africa,
which is where my aunt and my family come from.
Ebo people,

751
00:49:01.701 --> 00:49:06.200
hundreds of thousands of Ibos are taken out of the bite of Benning.
Um,

752
00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.110
I was in caliber just before coming over to shoot the film,

753
00:49:09.111 --> 00:49:11.780
which is in the east of Nigeria,
out of slavery museum,

754
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:14.930
which had a roll call of the number of emails that were taken out about

755
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.830
particular port.

756
00:49:15.831 --> 00:49:19.700
So it was never something that I felt any distance from in that way.
Um,

757
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:22.130
obviously growing up in London and a,

758
00:49:22.131 --> 00:49:25.280
and the nature of the slave trade and the West indies and how that affected not

759
00:49:25.281 --> 00:49:26.930
only,
uh,
that area,

760
00:49:26.931 --> 00:49:31.670
but then also Britain and the nature of the sort of industrialization of
Britain,

761
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:36.550
France,
Portugal,
uh,
then into South America.
You know,

762
00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:41.480
I mean the slavery was international and um,
and uh,

763
00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:44.810
and this story is very specifically American,
but then,

764
00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.170
but speaks to so many things that are kind of wider than that,
you know,

765
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:52.010
and it always felt to me correct.
I didn't,
you know,
uh,
uh,

766
00:49:52.011 --> 00:49:53.810
there was always a kind of question whether there's,

767
00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.090
you can legitimately tell other stories in that way.

768
00:49:56.091 --> 00:49:57.860
And I felt like you can because,

769
00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:01.820
because by definition it's correct that there's an international element to the

770
00:50:01.821 --> 00:50:05.750
story.
I think 95% of the people who made this foam or American,
you know,

771
00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:08.240
but it always felt right to me that there was,
that there was,

772
00:50:08.241 --> 00:50:11.480
there were elements and strong elements of that represented the fact that this

773
00:50:11.481 --> 00:50:15.740
isn't just a,
it wasn't just an American phenomenon.
It's about,
uh,
about people,

774
00:50:15.741 --> 00:50:19.370
about our,
our,
our collective history in Europe and the states and Africa.

775
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:25.160
To add on to that,
to that question,
just really quickly,
um,
uh,
how has,

776
00:50:25.161 --> 00:50:28.250
how has the movie been received and in places like Nigeria,

777
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.230
<v 2>Kenya,
Britain,
France?</v>

778
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:34.700
<v 6>Well,
I,
it's not out in Africa that,
yeah.
But yeah,</v>

779
00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:38.530
so we don't yet know,
but there's definitely a lot of interest.

780
00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:43.320
Was an interest on online,
a lot of support from what has,

781
00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:47.760
what has been heard from over here and,
and in the UK

782
00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:51.140
<v 2>it's a number,
it's the number one film in the UK regulations.
Thank you.</v>

783
00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:52.163
<v 0>Okay,</v>

784
00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:58.380
<v 2>great.
Thank you up.</v>

785
00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:02.160
<v 6>Yes.
I just,
something that,</v>

786
00:51:02.161 --> 00:51:04.440
that I remembered while you were talking,

787
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:09.330
if you guys realize that we were a slave economy longer than we were anything

788
00:51:09.331 --> 00:51:13.950
else,
but yet we deny that.
So that's why we're,

789
00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:15.570
that's why we're off balance.

790
00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:22.383
<v 0>Thank you.</v>

791
00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.090
<v 2>Um,</v>

792
00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:28.090
and thank you to the cast and the producers for we're making this great film.

793
00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:30.540
Um,
good luck.
This awards season.

794
00:51:30.541 --> 00:51:34.200
We know that there's a lot of great things to come and we want to thank you for

795
00:51:34.201 --> 00:51:36.240
spending time with us at Google.
I like,
thank you.

796
00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:37.373
<v 0>Thank you so much.</v>

797
00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:42.250
