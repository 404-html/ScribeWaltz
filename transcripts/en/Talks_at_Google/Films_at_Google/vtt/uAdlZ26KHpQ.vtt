00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.180
Hi everybody.
I just want to get right to it.

2
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.530
Let me please introduce our wonderful guest today.
We have a day Patel,

3
00:00:11.531 --> 00:00:14.290
the star of the film,
and Luke,
Luke Davies,
the screenwriter,

4
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.950
and then a special treat.
We have the real life sorrow Brierley in house.

5
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.403
<v 0>Please help.</v>

6
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.900
<v 1>So welcome to Google.
Yes.
Hello.
Thanks.
How was your lunch?</v>

7
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.910
It was the first question us.
Yeah.
Uh,
great.
Well,
uh,

8
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.610
some of the folks in the audience haven't had a chance to see the film yet,

9
00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:43.250
so I thought I could start with a question for you,
Luke.
Uh,

10
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.200
maybe you could tell us about the film as well as,

11
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:49.520
tell us what attracted you to this particular story.
Very simply,

12
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:53.610
it's a true story about a five year old boy.
Uh,

13
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.320
this is him now as an adult.
And this is the guy who plays him as an adult,
uh,

14
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.670
who under very traumatic and calamitous circumstances.

15
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:04.700
One day gets lost on a train and winds up,
um,

16
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.080
2000 kilometers away in Calcutta.
Uh,
after many scrapes,

17
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:11.810
he winds up in an orphanage.
He gets adopted by an Australian couple.

18
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:14.690
He grows up in Australia.
He loses his Hindi,

19
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.490
Hindi and 25 years later he learns off the existence of Google earth and he has

20
00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:21.380
about five memories in his head,

21
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.110
visual memories from when he was five years old of his village.

22
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.830
And he starts following the railway lines out of that train station where he

23
00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:31.310
arrived at Cal Carter.
There's massive train station.
Uh,

24
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.480
and then more and more obsessively following those railway lines looking for

25
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.670
matches to these visual clues.

26
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.900
And what attracted me to it was just that it's a magnificently pure and simple

27
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:43.580
fable about,
um,

28
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.220
reunification with the lost mother and maternal love and hope and persistence

29
00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:50.450
and love.
It was,

30
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.600
I just wanted to write this screenplay that was very simple and very powerful.

31
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.530
Yeah,
it was a lot of universal themes in the film.
Great a day.

32
00:01:57.531 --> 00:01:58.850
My next question is for you,
uh,

33
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.630
I had the honor of being at the tail tiff premiere where this film got a

34
00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:06.380
standing ovation and I think it was the runner up for the audience award as soon

35
00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:09.500
as resonating with audiences.
And I was just curious,
why do you think that is?

36
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.620
What do you think about the film is causing people to really have this very

37
00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:13.760
visceral reaction to it?

38
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.000
<v 2>Um,
I really think it's an anthem of a unity in humanity really.
Um,</v>

39
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.510
you know,
it's so triumphant.
It's core.

40
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.060
It's a story about mothers and sons and,
uh,
you know,

41
00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:30.620
I think that those themes are so universal,
you know,
and um,
you know,

42
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:32.810
that's what you want to do when you go into this dark room.

43
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:37.040
You want to be transported and inspired and,
and you know,
the fact that,
you know,

44
00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:40.220
we're breathing a second life into what is essentially a true story,

45
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:44.570
which this young man here so bravely transversed is,

46
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.340
it makes it even more inspiring.

47
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.800
<v 1>Great.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Um,</v>

48
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.080
so those game we all played growing up,

49
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.540
who would play you in a film and so no to that.

50
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.220
Did they pull it off?
Look,
did an amazing

51
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.540
<v 3>job.
Yeah,
he has.
He has pulled it off.
That wasn't my real question.</v>

52
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.880
Uh,
now my real question is,
um,
you know,
uh,

53
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:14.110
you saw the film and,
you know,
I'm curious about your reaction to seeing it,

54
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:17.530
but more how did it change your understanding of your own story?

55
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.570
Having seen a dramatize in a film,

56
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:23.470
did it change how you saw your own journey and your own discovery of,

57
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.690
uh,
birth parents?
It didn't really,
because,
um,

58
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.900
I've lived,
um,
you know,

59
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.590
and I've told my story so many times to my parents and myself,
um,

60
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.530
sort of,
you know,
internally and,

61
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.380
but seeing it for the first time,

62
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:45.640
I thought I'd be quite desensitized from it because I've lived it.

63
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.780
And,
uh,
but,
uh,
but it wasn't not that at all.
It was,
um,

64
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.560
I was just so sort of intuit,
um,
clinching onto,
you know,

65
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.590
my knees and,
um,
and you know,
there was such a pivotal times,

66
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.270
um,
we're crescendo the points where,
you know,
I had tears in,

67
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.330
in myself as well.
So,
um,
you know,

68
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.230
the movie was just so true,
no to my story,
which is great.

69
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.180
And,
um,
and yeah,
it's just,
um,
and just looking at it,

70
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.450
um,
you know,
the way they've done everything was just amazing.
And,
um,
and it,

71
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.460
you know,
there's,
there's auditorially talking about it,

72
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.420
which I had been for such a long time in being written in the book as well,

73
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.580
but seeing it out,
um,

74
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.750
and played out with the day of and in the other states whose,
um,

75
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.700
it was just another sort of level I guess,
um,

76
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.180
which not only myself,
but my family got to see it to my adoptive family.

77
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.230
And,
um,
and also,
you know,
people in the world to,

78
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.550
what was it like to see it with your adoptive family?
I'll look.
It

79
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.300
will because I used to tell him so many times,

80
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.710
this is the events in the stages and phases that I went through,
um,

81
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.100
in India and now they actually can see what it really is visually.

82
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.100
And that visual,
um,
since got heightened,
uh,

83
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.070
from the auditorium and,
um,
and they just broke down.
You know,

84
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.890
dad just said,
we didn't really know,
you know,

85
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.530
even though you told us and what you went through.

86
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:28.210
But seeing it was just another climax in your senses.
And we all sort of,

87
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.610
um,
after seeing the movie just sort of cuddled each other and,
um,
and yeah,

88
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:35.180
for about 30 minutes.
And,
um,

89
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.760
it was just such a pivotal moment there of letting them actually see something

90
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:42.310
that they hadn't sort of been longing for such a long time.

91
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.800
Did Nicole Kidman pull it off for your mom?
She did.
Amazing job.
She did.

92
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:51.220
She's like that,
that uh,
there's a,
there's a person,

93
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.020
there's a specific scene where she tells us,
tells me it was you.

94
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.440
Um,
so,

95
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.850
<v 4>um,
about,
you know,
being,
um,
you know,</v>

96
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.700
not having children where she states that,
you know,

97
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.760
they could actually have children,
but,
um,

98
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.680
mom and dad collectively decided not to because they wanted to help someone that

99
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.390
was more in need than sort of having children themselves.
Great.

100
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.290
Thanks Dave.
The next question for you.
So as product manager of Google Earth,

101
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:26.550
I have to have one question about it.
Uh,

102
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.960
and it's generally when you see technology and films computer,

103
00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:34.490
is there generally a foil or a prop where I think what's nice about this film,

104
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:37.850
what's especially touching at me as you brought this product to life and I think

105
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:40.190
it's where you're acting and you're reacting to the product.

106
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.240
And I was just curious what was the process to really kind of bring this to life

107
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:44.570
and have it.

108
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.810
<v 2>Thank you.
Thank you for that.
Well,
um,
I've said this before,</v>

109
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:51.740
but I spent a lot of my career staring in front of all these scenes,

110
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.060
these screens,
you know,

111
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:57.230
pretending to gather all this information and run to a character that's more

112
00:06:57.231 --> 00:07:01.730
important than myself.
And you know,
I'm playing a plethora of,
um,
you know,

113
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.290
tech centric guys.
But you know,
the interesting thing about this is a,

114
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.151
you know what,

115
00:07:07.151 --> 00:07:11.570
I'm sitting in front of this laptop and it's an entirely emotional experience.

116
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:15.260
That relationship with technology that Saroo has,
you know,

117
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:18.560
he's looking at this screen,
he's looking at those blurry pixels,

118
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:20.860
which is what it was back in the day.
You know,

119
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.900
the refresh rates and the W it wasn't as developed as it is now and he's drawing

120
00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:30.910
so much history,
so much pain,
so much,
um,
memory from these,

121
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.330
these pixels.
So it was kind of some of the hardest stuff I've ever had to do,

122
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.710
you know,
as a performer and a is really validating,
you know,

123
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:41.710
to finally be able to sit in front of a screen and uh,

124
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.320
I feel like you're doing something of a real gravitas.

125
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.770
<v 4>Yeah,
I heard you got Google earth training lessons.
Yeah,</v>

126
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.520
<v 2>I did.
I did.
It was in the schedule,
I think it was twice a week.</v>

127
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.220
That's just sit down and you,
you helped with the program,

128
00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:59.020
you gave us the right a little bit.
Yeah.
Just made us period.
Perfect.

129
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.500
<v 4>Yeah,
just one small detail that I think is really why I love the fill it's so</v>

130
00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:06.190
authentic is um,
you know,
Google Earth right now we've launched version seven,

131
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.660
but when they were in the film,
they were using four and five.
Uh,

132
00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:14.320
and we had to do some archeology to find those old versions and make sure they

133
00:08:14.321 --> 00:08:16.870
worked on laptops.
And if you watch the film very carefully,

134
00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:20.200
the first time he uses it,
it's earth for the second time he uses it.

135
00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:22.270
Or later in the film it's earth pro five,

136
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.780
which is just to say these filmmakers paid a lot of attention to detail and all.

137
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.340
And it's very authentic that way.

138
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.220
Nothing's nothing that they did with the product or you know,

139
00:08:30.221 --> 00:08:33.340
with really anything in the film I think took unnecessary liberties.

140
00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:36.850
And that's why part of the reason I think it's so powerful is that authenticity.

141
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:42.050
Um,
Luke,
so we talked a little bit about this,
uh,
about,
uh,

142
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.100
these universal themes of home mothers and sons finding your own identity and

143
00:08:47.981 --> 00:08:52.420
what other pieces of art books,
movies,
um,

144
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:57.570
art inspired you or did you draw from to kind of tell this universal story?

145
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.880
You called it a fable earlier.
Are there other

146
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.950
<v 1>very,
very specifically the,
um,
the first act of the film where we're,</v>

147
00:09:05.951 --> 00:09:07.840
where it's the five year old actor,

148
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.470
Sunny Parr who plays Saru as the five year old who gets lost.
Um,

149
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.880
my model for that first hour of the film really was,
um,
is Wally,

150
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:21.650
is the,
is the robot wandering around the post apocalyptic kind of environment.

151
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.820
Um,

152
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.820
and so I wanted to kind of create something of the texture of the feeling of the

153
00:09:28.071 --> 00:09:31.910
first act of Wally,
which I find a really emotional first hour.

154
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.300
That film to me changes direction slightly.
When it gets up into space,

155
00:09:35.301 --> 00:09:39.440
it's suddenly a bit of a different tonal world.
So,
uh,

156
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.170
that was my big influence for the first part of the film.

157
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.490
The rest of it was just trying to find a way of telling this extremely

158
00:09:46.491 --> 00:09:51.290
emotionally heart breaking and heart wrenching story.
Um,

159
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.280
and to make,

160
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:56.780
my aim was basically to see if I'm sitting in the audit in a theater and I can

161
00:09:56.781 --> 00:10:00.860
hear people crying around me,
I feel great
there.

162
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:05.440
And this is a multiple Kleenex kind of film.
Absolutely.

163
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.220
The first time we screened it here for Googlers,

164
00:10:07.221 --> 00:10:12.080
there's a lot of ugly crying in front of coworkers.
Uh,

165
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.150
so sorry.
Um,

166
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.680
<v 4>what is the message that you want people to take away from this film when they</v>

167
00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:22.440
see it?
What do you hope is communicated by it?

168
00:10:22.441 --> 00:10:25.170
And they take away from seeing your story traumatized?

169
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:31.030
<v 3>Well,
um,
when you read the book and I guess,
you know,
you'd be sort of the same.</v>

170
00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.990
It's watching the movie as well that I think,
you know,

171
00:10:34.991 --> 00:10:39.040
at the end of the day it's a powerful movie,
uh,
to individuals.
Uh,

172
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.270
no matter who you are really.
And what sort of state of frame of mind you,
um,

173
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.320
you be at the end of it.
But I'm really,

174
00:10:47.321 --> 00:10:51.370
at the end of the day it'd be sort of a empowerment,
um,

175
00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.420
of understanding,
um,
in,
you know,

176
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.970
knowing that there is actually a way,

177
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.290
if you were sort of ever to be in a position that I was in,
um,

178
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.800
perhaps these are this kinds of things that you could use from,
you know,

179
00:11:05.801 --> 00:11:09.190
extracting,
extrapolating from your memories,
um,

180
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.790
how to sort of find your hill way home with,
uh,
you know,

181
00:11:12.791 --> 00:11:17.050
it's from people from the war or,
um,
people from different countries.

182
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:21.380
Um,
I really think,
you know,
that's sort of the,

183
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.580
the main thing out there as well.
As you know,

184
00:11:24.581 --> 00:11:28.360
there's other things as well as in like,
you know,
love and,
um,

185
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.440
and family and you know,
unification.
Um,

186
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.940
and you can just sort of talk about it and sort of so many different ways from

187
00:11:36.941 --> 00:11:41.790
political to social,
um,
to,
uh,
sort of,
uh,
um,

188
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.590
hallway but other things.
But,
um,
I think that's the main one really,
um,

189
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.800
that there must be other people out there that have been in the same situation

190
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.970
but just haven't been able to sort of,
you know,

191
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.090
understand what their feelings and,
you know,

192
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:06.100
their dreams are telling them.
And this is the,
this is a story that,
you know,

193
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.290
when you've been dreaming for something that,
you know,

194
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:12.250
it means that you've been longing for it and he must suppress it,

195
00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:16.960
diffuse it somehow and,
and listen to it.
And that's what I did.
I,

196
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.460
I headed for such a long time,
these memories.
And when I came to,
you know,

197
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:26.020
when I was 22 and 28,
um,
I,
I didn't know what to do,

198
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:31.000
but I sort of use,
you know,
the feelings and the dreams and all that.

199
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:33.280
And,
um,
and,
you know,

200
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.930
went out and did what I did because otherwise if you don't,

201
00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:41.790
it's just going to stick with you for such a long time.
And,
um,

202
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:46.060
and before you know it,
you're maybe too old,
um,

203
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.100
to do anything about it,
but you know,

204
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:52.030
you certainly got to listen to your heart and your dreams.
They mean something.

205
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:57.310
Do you remember the exact moment that you learned about Google Earth?
Um,

206
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.410
when I was,
uh,
when I was at school at the Canberra University there,

207
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.690
that's,
that's when I,
um,

208
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.870
sort of got in touch with it because Sam was talking about it.
I was a 2005,

209
00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:15.420
late 2004,
2000 seats.
Swine,
Google first launch.
Yeah.

210
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.930
So that's,
you know,
for me,
Google Earth was embryonic.

211
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.400
Um,
when I was in my early twenties,

212
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.520
when I looked at the map in my bedroom,
I was like,
you know,

213
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:32.521
I can't find my home town using the map because I can't find Cardwell.

214
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:37.070
Uh,
well I didn't know it back then.
I can't find boring poor.
Um,

215
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:41.800
but the visual memories that I have a thought to myself back then in my early

216
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.120
twenties,
that they must be or will be a program later in the future,

217
00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:49.510
they'll come out that I could use those memories and it evidentially has

218
00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:50.560
happened.
Google earth.

219
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.100
<v 4>That's great.
Um,</v>

220
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.010
couple more questions but then I'm going to turn it over to audience questions.

221
00:13:56.011 --> 00:13:59.190
If you guys want to start to think of questions and uh,
start to line up,

222
00:13:59.191 --> 00:14:03.600
but I think they'll set up the mic in the back.
Um,
so a day,

223
00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:04.710
my next question is for you,

224
00:14:04.711 --> 00:14:09.000
I was looking at your imdv page and looking at some of the films that you've

225
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.340
made and be gentle
please.

226
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.790
Okay.
We won't talk about this early films,
but uh,
you know,
there,

227
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:21.360
there's an interesting theme that happens in a few of your films.

228
00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:24.210
Slumdog of the man who knew infinity and of course lion,

229
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.860
it's a character leaves their home to discover their destiny and then comes
back.

230
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.660
Maybe that's how I'm looking at it.

231
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:36.060
And you actually have an interesting sort of ancestry where your ancestors are

232
00:14:36.061 --> 00:14:36.894
from India.

233
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.830
Your parents grew up in Nairobi and then you grew up in London and now reside in

234
00:14:40.831 --> 00:14:44.250
the states.
So with all of these things,
what does home mean to you now?

235
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.700
You don't have characters that have discovered it in different ways in your own

236
00:14:47.701 --> 00:14:52.080
life.
I was home redefined,
redefined.
Uh,

237
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.530
<v 2>God,
that's interesting.
I do,</v>

238
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.810
I do gravitate towards the idea of a fish out of water,
you know,

239
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.880
I can relate to that.
You know,
you know,

240
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.410
going to school I was never really popular or anything like that,

241
00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:07.970
so I always felt like a bit of an outsider looking in at times.
Um,

242
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.970
and uh,
yeah,
I left home when I was 16,
you know,

243
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.470
and discovered India shooting this film,
some dog for the first time.

244
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.640
And it was a completely eye opening experience.

245
00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:24.140
It was part of my heritage that I had shunned growing up for a long time so I

246
00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:26.780
could fit in,
be normal,
be be like everyone else.

247
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.270
And when I went there and witnessed this city with this amazing Bombay,
Mumbai,

248
00:15:32.271 --> 00:15:35.930
this amazing filmmaker Denny Ball,
you know,
you're seeing things,
you know,

249
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:37.730
going into the slums and,
you know,

250
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.800
just dusting incredible,
incredible things.
It kind of,
um,

251
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.900
open up my mind to a higher level of consciousness,
I guess.
And,
uh,
you know,

252
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:51.230
I've gone back since and done five films,
but you know,
home to me,

253
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.230
I have a fascination with trees.
This sounds very hippy,

254
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.520
so just stick with me here.
But I,
uh,
whenever I go to a hotel or something,

255
00:15:58.521 --> 00:16:02.120
I'll draw a little tree.
It looks like a piece of Broccoli,
but as the best like,

256
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.890
and then I write,
grow next to it and I sign it and leave it on.

257
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.470
And the idea of it is,
uh,
you know,
home is the roots to me.

258
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.350
And the roots are so important because if the,
you know,

259
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:18.110
that's where the tree gets us nourishment.
It's strength.
And,
uh,
it's,

260
00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:19.220
it's,
it's grounding.

261
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:24.170
And from there with good roots and a knowledge of home and a connection to it,

262
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.900
you can grow on,
you know,
grow into this mighty tree bearing fruits.
And,

263
00:16:28.901 --> 00:16:32.090
and I know it sounds crazy,
but you know,
that's my idea of it.
And I've,

264
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.410
I feel my parents,

265
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.070
<v 4>everybody,
everybody who works in Google Earth as a hippie.</v>

266
00:16:36.071 --> 00:16:40.800
So you're in good company.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I think so.
Yeah.

267
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.690
It was a beautiful,
I asked a hard question.
Um,

268
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.620
so last question is actually for all of you and it comes from our followers on

269
00:16:47.621 --> 00:16:50.410
social media.
So we posted a question,
what would you like to ask you guys?

270
00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.480
And the question is,

271
00:16:52.481 --> 00:16:56.080
what was the most exciting or inspiring scene for each of you in the film?

272
00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.720
And if other folks want to start lining up for questions,
please feel free.
Well,

273
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.360
you wrote it.
It's based on you.
So,

274
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.640
but yeah,
I love the scene where,
uh,

275
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.820
where Dev comes to see sue,

276
00:17:15.821 --> 00:17:19.000
his mother played by Nicole Kidman and,
um,

277
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.020
and he finds out that they chose not to have kids,
that she could have had kids,

278
00:17:23.021 --> 00:17:26.170
but they chose to help kids who are already alive.

279
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.370
I really liked that scene a lot.
I agree there too.
Yeah,

280
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.250
that was pretty special.
I had a front yeah.

281
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:37.680
<v 2>Row seat to Nicole Kidman,
just pouring her soul out and uh,
you know,</v>

282
00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:40.830
she really performed from the gut and that,
but,
uh,
yeah,
that's,
I mean,

283
00:17:40.831 --> 00:17:45.360
all of it for me was completely profound.
You know,

284
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:49.470
as a,
I grew up in the process filming the movie,
you know,
and,

285
00:17:49.471 --> 00:17:53.880
and golf is one of those directors that allows you to really be open and
exposed.

286
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.290
But,
uh,
am I allowed to talk about the end?
Is that even,

287
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:03.690
you know,
I mean,
I don't know,
but uh,
there,
there's so many,
but um,
you know,

288
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:07.710
one that the end,
you know,
you should watch,
but it's very,

289
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.860
they've seen it.
They've seen enough or enough of them.
I've seen it,

290
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:16.080
there are enough of them seen it.
But that scene,
uh,
as,
as real as it gets,

291
00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:20.820
you know,
I,
that was the first thing I shot in the film.
So I flew out to,

292
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:25.050
to,
to India and uh,
Garth was like,
you know,

293
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.650
as a little sperm you are swimming up to this moment,
so don't mess it up.

294
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.260
I was like,
okay,
no pressure then.
Um,
but you know,
it,

295
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:36.630
it's terrifying cause you know,
so much rides on this moment of unity.

296
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.823
And uh,

297
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.150
we get there and we start filming me and Priyanka who plays the Indian mother,

298
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.620
she's an incredible actress and there's not much to do in the kind of location

299
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:47.490
that we were filming it.

300
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.430
So every night we would all be having dinners and things and he's like,

301
00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:52.950
you can't see it now for a week before we shoot this.

302
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.520
And the next time I saw her was in the scene.

303
00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:01.140
So this,
this man was like,
wait a second.
And he goes away,
comes back,

304
00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:05.160
and I started following him through these alleyways and I come out to this

305
00:19:05.161 --> 00:19:08.880
opening and then at the end of the,
you know,
far in the distance,

306
00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:11.550
I can see these three figures and they start approaching me and we're getting

307
00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:12.384
closer.

308
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.590
And I started to recognize it to Priyanka and they've done this incredible

309
00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:20.280
makeup on her face to HR and,
uh,
you know,

310
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.850
all these,
there was no planted extras.
You know,

311
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:27.060
all those people in the village where there were real villages,

312
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.830
they didn't understand what I was saying.
Um,
but they could feed off that energy,

313
00:19:31.831 --> 00:19:34.560
the truth.
And,
um,
by the end of it,

314
00:19:34.561 --> 00:19:37.560
I felt like I was in Avatar because we're embracing,
we're crying.

315
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.690
It's a moment of complete joy and sadness also.
And,

316
00:19:42.691 --> 00:19:43.740
um,
you know,

317
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.460
that all these hands to start reaching out and feeling my face and touching me,

318
00:19:47.461 --> 00:19:50.790
and you look around and they're crying with you and laughing with you.
And,
uh,

319
00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.460
it was,
yeah,
that was a really special moment.

320
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.140
<v 4>Yeah.
Well,
he has a great stop.
Oh,
go ahead.</v>

321
00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.690
<v 1>Well,
I also,
I would love to speak because we're here.</v>

322
00:19:58.691 --> 00:20:00.790
I love in terms of the technology of the film.

323
00:20:00.791 --> 00:20:04.180
I love that moment right near the end where you're pretty much giving up where

324
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.820
you zoom out fully up through India and,

325
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.050
and the whole of the planet is just like hovering there in space at this final

326
00:20:11.051 --> 00:20:14.430
moment before you start to zoom back in.
That moment to me is like,
ah,

327
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.820
hairs on the back of my neck.

328
00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.300
Really sound designer that where they make you feel hollow.
Right.
That's

329
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:23.000
<v 4>amazing.
That's amazing.
All right,
great.
Well we have some audience questions.
Uh,</v>

330
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.090
so we'll start with the first one please.
I want to thank you for the film.

331
00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:30.870
I saw it a couple of days ago and I don't remember the last time I cried at a

332
00:20:30.871 --> 00:20:34.680
film.
My question is,

333
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.280
is what happened to your mother in India?
What,
what's up with her now?

334
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.630
Oh,
um,
she's good.
She's healthy.

335
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:46.800
So he's my brothers and sisters.
Um,
and uh,

336
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.770
and I bought her house,

337
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.570
<v 3>um,
because before she was a reading a house and so,</v>

338
00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.393
<v 5>mmm.</v>

339
00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.440
<v 3>And the house was,
you know,
there has that she's been living in,</v>

340
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.980
she didn't want to sort of move away to anywhere else,
uh,

341
00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:06.600
because her friends were,
you know,
within that sort of vicinity of the house.
Um,

342
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:07.021
so she,

343
00:21:07.021 --> 00:21:11.890
she just wanted that house and I sort of put some money in every month just to

344
00:21:11.891 --> 00:21:16.870
sort of help her out and she doesn't have to really work anymore.
Um,
but,

345
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.300
but she's good log sheets,
probably fitter than me.
Really.
Um,

346
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.230
amazing woman.
So strong mentally and physically and um,

347
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.840
yeah,
I think I've got good traits,

348
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:36.030
no wrinkles,
million dollar ones.
Um,
and um,
and yeah,

349
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.910
so I'm really happy.
She's about 63,
64 I use of age.
Um,

350
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:42.420
and um,

351
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:47.350
but she's just doing really look great and we talk just about every month

352
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.420
through a translator.
So,
and I've seen her about 14 times.
She's still in Canada?

353
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:57.970
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So she's still there in the same house.
Um,
so,

354
00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:02.200
um,
I'm really fortunate actually,
um,
that,
um,
she's got good health,

355
00:22:02.201 --> 00:22:06.730
so that's great.
Great.
Hey guys,
I'm John.
I'm on the Google Earth Hour.
Each team.

356
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.020
I know I wanted to ask,

357
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:13.120
if you could go back in time to 2005 when you first discovered Google earth,

358
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.280
if there was one feature you could add,

359
00:22:15.281 --> 00:22:18.420
still would have made your journey's yeah,
off the record.

360
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:23.450
I tried to crack it and cannot penetrate into Google.

361
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.570
Um,
yeah,
I've got a hacking,
but it was,
it wasn't very good.

362
00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:33.190
Um,
um,
that's okay.

363
00:22:33.191 --> 00:22:34.090
We know all about it.

364
00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.560
Shield did didn't work.
Um,

365
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.610
I don't,
I'm not too sure really.

366
00:22:47.611 --> 00:22:50.010
I think everything just happened the way it mean to happen.

367
00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:55.170
My destiny was meant to happen that way.
But um,

368
00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.530
but I think if the clarity of,
um,
you know,

369
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:03.630
Google Earth back then was a lot better then the whole search would have been,

370
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:09.060
you know,
a lot easier as well as the speed,
the refresh rates and so on.

371
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.650
But funny thing about it is that,
you know,
that version of Google Earth,

372
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:15.870
when I saw my hometown,

373
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:21.590
I would have been the only person in this world that knew where those landmarks,

374
00:23:23.431 --> 00:23:28.290
where and what and what they were as well.
And for a normal person,

375
00:23:28.291 --> 00:23:31.350
they were looking at,
you know,
something that I was looking at on Google,

376
00:23:31.351 --> 00:23:35.460
assuming Dan back then,
um,
they would have gone,
what is that?

377
00:23:35.461 --> 00:23:37.830
It just looks like a bush.
But no to me,

378
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:42.930
I could tell them right down to the grassroots what it is and that's how sort
of,

379
00:23:42.931 --> 00:23:45.710
you know,
have you been mind memories were so guess,
you know,

380
00:23:45.711 --> 00:23:48.740
if it was a little bit more the clarity,
the resolution would have been better.

381
00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.580
It helped.
Okay,
great.
It sounds like what I was meant to be happened.

382
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:57.620
Well that's right.
You know,
um,
the children that came out of that,

383
00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.600
the Isa,
which is the Indian Society of [inaudible] and adoption,
um,

384
00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:07.740
I just think we're all Destiny's child and we carve out and Mike what the future

385
00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:10.700
is for ourselves.

386
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:15.180
So things were meant to be the way the word [inaudible].
That's,

387
00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:17.250
that's how it was meant to be then.
Thanks.

388
00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.730
<v 6>Thank you guys so much for being here with us today.
Um,
through,</v>

389
00:24:20.731 --> 00:24:21.660
I wanted to ask you,

390
00:24:21.661 --> 00:24:26.370
there's no way to collapse decades of your rich life into a buck or into a
movie.

391
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.630
So I was wondering if there's any events or relationships or nuances of your

392
00:24:30.631 --> 00:24:34.620
life that maybe didn't make it into the public eye that you might be able to

393
00:24:34.621 --> 00:24:35.454
share with us?

394
00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.960
<v 3>Well,
it's,
it's a massive story.
Um,</v>

395
00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:47.770
I think there's,
you know,
there's,
there's quite a few sort of events,
um,

396
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.250
and stages or phases of the,
the whole journey,
um,

397
00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:55.950
raw from inception that could have been in there,
but,
um,

398
00:24:55.990 --> 00:25:00.130
or great,
you know,
or great raw data.
Um,

399
00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:05.560
but,
um,
I think these sort of the main,
you know,
one's,

400
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.930
um,
you guys sort of peak pretty well.
Um,
especially Luke Day.

401
00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:14.050
He was a script writer.
Um,
I think,
uh,

402
00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:19.000
one of them would have been the drowning in the river in the Hughley river.

403
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.410
Um,
can I tell a little bit about that story for people who don't know?
Oh,
okay.

404
00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.200
So actually they did put it in there,

405
00:25:26.201 --> 00:25:30.480
but it was in an early draft of the script and then,
so I had to lose it.
Yep.

406
00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:35.200
And the draining of the Hughley River,
I'll tell you about it and what it is.

407
00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.370
I didn't know how to swim,

408
00:25:36.371 --> 00:25:41.170
but I love the border and the Hughley river has a tidal system.

409
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.860
And I didn't understand that I was only a kid.
And,
um,

410
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:49.450
and I was jumping off a ledge onto a,
sorry,
I step onto another step.

411
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:54.870
And I was having so much fun that I didn't realize that I was going step by step

412
00:25:55.301 --> 00:25:57.100
by step,
even by the,

413
00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.900
to the point where there was no step at the end of that stamp brought down the

414
00:26:01.901 --> 00:26:05.620
bottom because the Todd had sorta gone down.
And um,

415
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:08.290
and I jumped in and,
um,

416
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:13.030
in the tide and there was no bottom and I didn't know how to swim.

417
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.310
The rips got me and I'm just,

418
00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:19.510
and I'm just like going down and then up,
down,

419
00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:21.340
up for a couple of times.

420
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.810
And then the last time us just took the tiniest bit of breath and I was just

421
00:26:25.811 --> 00:26:29.950
going down to the obese and I thought,
you know,

422
00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.020
that's the end of me.
And I saw the light,

423
00:26:32.021 --> 00:26:36.130
the sun sort of dim more and more and more.
And I'll put my hand up.

424
00:26:36.131 --> 00:26:40.690
And the only thing that Ahca think of at that point of time was my mother and my

425
00:26:40.691 --> 00:26:43.210
sister.
And I was just thought to myself,

426
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.870
hope they're okay even though I'm about to sort of go.

427
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:51.270
And all of sudden out of nowhere,
this hand,
this angel,
this hand just came in,

428
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.140
grabbed me out.
And um,
and yeah,
it was,
that was,

429
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:59.550
that was the most amazing beat.
Such a powerful,
you know,
point of time.

430
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.410
Which hand was it?
Um,
it was,
um,
it was just a guy,
um,

431
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:09.240
one of the store workers that actually somehow had noticed this kid,
you know,

432
00:27:09.241 --> 00:27:14.240
his hands going up and down,
um,
bobbing up and down.
Um,
and,
um,

433
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.430
if it was any longer than I would've been gone.

434
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.150
<v 1>Great scene.
One of the reasons that had to go,</v>

435
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:25.020
it was just because it would've been a super expensive day with safety officer's

436
00:27:25.021 --> 00:27:29.060
underwater cameras,
uh,
health and safety issues that were extremely problematic,

437
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.560
problematic in that river in terms of insurance.

438
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.640
It would have been a gnarly day shooting and it would have cost a lot of money.

439
00:27:35.641 --> 00:27:38.280
So,
but there were other reasons too.
Why in the end it went,
it's a,

440
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:39.180
it's a beautiful moment.

441
00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.220
<v 3>I don't think I could have cried one more time in the film,</v>

442
00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.780
but that would have been like,
you could almost think that,
Ooh,

443
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.020
from the audience point of view,
um,
oh,
he's going,

444
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:54.520
she know how the story ends there.
But um,
it's amazing.

445
00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.990
You know what,
what's out there really.
Um,
uh,
I'm very fortunate actually.

446
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:03.030
Very survivorman please.
Hi,

447
00:28:03.031 --> 00:28:04.510
I'm this one's for Luke.

448
00:28:04.511 --> 00:28:08.500
What was the process like turning the book into a script?

449
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.730
Like how do you choose the important moments?
Because there's a lot of material,

450
00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.573
right?

451
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.320
<v 1>For me,
I,</v>

452
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:19.790
I just always tried to keep in mind that this story was about this very singular

453
00:28:20.251 --> 00:28:24.690
emotional journey towards wholeness.
All the rest of it was just,
uh,

454
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.420
frills and trappings,
including the technology.

455
00:28:27.421 --> 00:28:32.250
The technology had to only serve us,
uh,
so rosy emotional story.

456
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:36.660
Um,
technically the process was I had a previous relationship with the producers.

457
00:28:36.661 --> 00:28:39.570
They said,
have you heard this story about this Indian cuter got lost?

458
00:28:39.571 --> 00:28:42.960
And that was the week that the story had been floating around because the book

459
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:47.760
had just come out and I had heard the story.
Uh,
I kind of auditioned for the job.

460
00:28:47.761 --> 00:28:49.680
I wrote a story,
I read the book quickly.

461
00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:52.260
I wrote a structure of how I would approach the film.

462
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.800
The main big thing was that from the very beginning,
I said to them,

463
00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.320
this story is so powerful and so amazing.

464
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.710
Do you mind if I try to write the first draft of the screenplay?

465
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:06.540
We don't do the typical thing and begin with your star adult actors and

466
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:09.870
establish them and their world and then something happens and then you look back

467
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:12.210
and tell the story and come back to where you were.

468
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:16.470
Let's try and begin at the beginning with a five year old actor at the moment he

469
00:29:16.471 --> 00:29:21.210
steps on the training,
gets lost.
Uh,
and they,
they were really supportive of that.

470
00:29:21.211 --> 00:29:24.660
So it always had a very linear structure.
Um,

471
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:29.870
the process was just trying to find the biggest emotional storylines that made,

472
00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:33.060
gave the story a really good beginning,
middle,
and end.

473
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:36.000
And that when you reach the end,
you feel a sort of,

474
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.410
I would call it a kind of triumphant,
exhilarating sadness if the film works.

475
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.500
It's both sad and extremely hopeful and triumphant.

476
00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.470
<v 4>Thank you so much for joining us.
My name is Celine.</v>

477
00:29:47.471 --> 00:29:52.090
I'm on the Google Earth outreach team.
Um,
I'm particularly interested in,

478
00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.980
in your perspectives on storytelling.

479
00:29:53.981 --> 00:29:58.981
Storytelling has been for thousands of years away to raise awareness and bring

480
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:03.010
community together and through any,
and I think the,
the,

481
00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:05.710
the methods have changed over time and technology is certainly at a,

482
00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:10.720
at an interesting place from my perspective now of of enabling maybe the same,

483
00:30:11.621 --> 00:30:13.180
maybe different types of stories.

484
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:17.890
Can you talk a little bit about how you see storytelling changing or changed

485
00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:21.760
over time and maybe going forward from the perspective of how technology can

486
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.890
help or plays,
plays a role there?

487
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:29.370
<v 1>Well,
I think that the technology changes constantly and that's,</v>

488
00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:34.230
that's just something to be embraced.
But the stories I think remain extra.

489
00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:38.700
The great stories remain really a prime primitive,
not primitive,

490
00:30:38.701 --> 00:30:43.200
but primal and elementary and elemental,
that's the word.

491
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.150
Um,
and this one for me,

492
00:30:45.151 --> 00:30:48.360
I just imagined that the story of reunification with the last mother,

493
00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:53.430
this basically has to be one of the oldest stories in the history,

494
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.560
in the emotional history of human civilization.

495
00:30:55.590 --> 00:31:00.210
It's got to be as old as it can possibly get from the origins of our

496
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:04.140
civilization.
Reunification with the lost a mother.

497
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:08.280
There was no kind of more powerful force.
I think then maternal love and the,

498
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.891
and a,

499
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:13.560
a story about the loss and deprivation of maternal love is really,

500
00:31:13.561 --> 00:31:17.550
um,
it's full of peril and that's hopefully what drives this film.

501
00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:24.560
<v 3>Yes.
And um,
and also Google earth and,
um,</v>

502
00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:29.090
and how it's being used.
That's technology which,
um,
which,

503
00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.890
which is the other part of the story too is that,
you know,
when I,

504
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:37.050
when I'm doing my search,
how am I going to use these memories in my head,

505
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.720
uh,
and by using technology,

506
00:31:39.721 --> 00:31:44.640
which is out there and no one's really thinking about it.
Um,
but I am,

507
00:31:44.641 --> 00:31:47.690
it's like,
you know,
it's this application,
um,

508
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:50.490
out there in a lot of people you know,
that are here,

509
00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:54.690
just use it to look at their houses.
I've been,
I did myself,
um,
rooftop,

510
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:59.670
but,
um,
but it's,
it's just that,
um,

511
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:04.890
that idea that's just crystallized in your head as in like this application

512
00:32:04.891 --> 00:32:09.870
could be utilized from our own personal benefits and,
um,
and you know,

513
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.660
when I did use that idea and thank God,
you know,

514
00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:15.960
Google Earth did come when it did.
Um,

515
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:20.570
otherwise if it wasn't there for me then I don't think we'd be here sort of

516
00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:21.810
talking.
That's true.

517
00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.050
<v 2>Right.</v>

518
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:23.591
<v 4>Dave,
actually,</v>

519
00:32:23.591 --> 00:32:27.640
maybe you could take a crack at that question where storytelling fits into the

520
00:32:27.641 --> 00:32:30.930
world we live in today and what purpose it serves and society.

521
00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:35.920
<v 2>I mean,
I think it's the highest form of escapism,
you know,
there is,</v>

522
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:40.880
you know,
um,
I aye.
Yeah.

523
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.810
I mean,
I,

524
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:45.770
that's something that really I connected to as a young child was going in and

525
00:32:45.771 --> 00:32:48.710
watching films.
It's shaped the way I think,
my ideals,

526
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:54.140
everything about the way I see the world.
So,
um,
for me,

527
00:32:54.141 --> 00:32:54.381
you know,

528
00:32:54.381 --> 00:32:57.590
especially when you go to India and see what they're movie stars mean to them,

529
00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:01.660
you know,
you know,
there's a population there,
you know,

530
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.970
that is below the poverty line in a very high part of the population.

531
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:10.010
And that that type of cinema is so well catered to these massives.
You know,

532
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:14.480
it's the perfect form of escape is in the dancing,
the colors,
the,
you know,

533
00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:18.410
big spectacle and uh,
you know,

534
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:22.430
I mean that cinema is changing,
but for me it's just,
it's an inspiration,

535
00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:27.260
you know,
it provides hope and yeah.
You know,
in terms of technology,

536
00:33:27.261 --> 00:33:31.070
I guess,
uh,
it's becoming simpler to be able to tell stories now.
You know,

537
00:33:31.071 --> 00:33:35.270
people are telling shooting movies on their phones now you're capable of doing

538
00:33:35.271 --> 00:33:38.630
that.
Uh,
you need less and less people and you know,

539
00:33:38.631 --> 00:33:40.610
the equipment's getting smaller and more powerful.

540
00:33:40.611 --> 00:33:45.611
So it's making it easier and more accessible to a wider range of people to be

541
00:33:46.161 --> 00:33:47.900
able to go in and shoot a film.
You know,

542
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:51.260
we shot some of the scenes in Slumdog on a little canon camera.

543
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:55.190
I think it was like 45 frames per second and you blend them together and it

544
00:33:55.191 --> 00:33:59.360
creates,
is slightly jumpy.
But that's what Donna used as the memory,

545
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:03.500
the flashbacks and it creates stuck a real visceral color and a kind of

546
00:34:03.501 --> 00:34:06.810
dreamlike quality to stuff.
But,
uh,
you know,

547
00:34:06.811 --> 00:34:11.450
it with last month as you make money makes you more adaptable and a good things

548
00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:13.160
come from that.
So that's what happened in that situation.

549
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.410
<v 5>But anyway.
Thanks.
Next question.</v>

550
00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:22.360
<v 7>Hi,
I'm grace.
Um,
I recently just showing the Google marketing team,
um,</v>

551
00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:25.570
and I was just wondering like from your guys' perspective,

552
00:34:25.571 --> 00:34:29.530
since you all played such a different kind of role and had different

553
00:34:29.531 --> 00:34:33.040
perspectives and experiences interacting with the story,
um,

554
00:34:33.041 --> 00:34:37.780
what particularly surprised you the most in terms of what you learned or

555
00:34:37.781 --> 00:34:42.700
something that you didn't expect to happen or discover?
Um,

556
00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:44.470
can you just share that insight with us?

557
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:50.390
<v 5>Wow.
They don't ask easy questions around it and uh,</v>

558
00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:52.640
that's how,

559
00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:56.240
what it was something I learned that I didn't ex at discovery that I didn't

560
00:34:56.241 --> 00:34:59.750
expect.
I might take a,
I need to think about that for a minute.
No,

561
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:06.980
sorry,
go for it man.
You know that you guys
were all stumped.
Yeah,

562
00:35:06.981 --> 00:35:07.814
you got us.

563
00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.270
<v 3>Actually,
I,
I didn't really know.
You know,</v>

564
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:17.520
I did what I did and then all of a sudden all these things just uneven,

565
00:35:17.521 --> 00:35:21.300
envisaged or this to come about.
And for me,

566
00:35:21.301 --> 00:35:24.850
I'm just taking it a step at a time.
And,
uh,

567
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:29.500
even though everything is expedited so much from,
um,
you know,

568
00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:34.240
finding my family to all of a sudden the news going global,
um,

569
00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:39.180
to a book,
to a movie and then a stage show as well.
Um,

570
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.290
you know,

571
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:44.580
about a year ago I was still processing that I've done something so amazing,

572
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.690
which is to form a family and that's something just doesn't,
you know,

573
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:51.840
gets diffused the weight off your shoulders,
just like that.

574
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.000
And I think it's just being,
you know,

575
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.830
in time that will sort of hit me that,
um,
you know,

576
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:03.810
you've done something incredible and you know,
um,
you should be proud of it.
So,

577
00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:07.950
uh,
and I am so,
but it's just taking time because there's so many other things.

578
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:12.090
Um,
but yeah,
to answer your question,
that's sort of a how I feel at the moment.

579
00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:16.930
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean,
as an actor kind of feel like I've grown so much,
you know,</v>

580
00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:20.760
it's hard with someone that looks like me to get,
um,

581
00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.730
such a diverse,
meaty journey to go on roles.

582
00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:29.770
So,
you know,
this has been a beautiful journey cause you know,
there's this,

583
00:36:29.771 --> 00:36:34.771
this young man here who's resin through so much adversity and has been generous

584
00:36:35.981 --> 00:36:38.440
and brave enough to share their story to the world.

585
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:43.510
And then there takes a talented team like Garth,
our director and Luke,
you know,

586
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:48.700
to bring it even further and closer and breathe life into it.
And then I,

587
00:36:48.701 --> 00:36:51.670
you know,
I get to step on and put the icing on the cake.
But,
uh,

588
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:56.740
it's really been a journey of exploration.
What I have learned,

589
00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.570
which it comes up at the end of the film is,
uh,
you know,
80,000 children,

590
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:05.560
you know,
go missing every year in India.
That I did not,
no,

591
00:37:05.561 --> 00:37:08.770
I did not know this scale of,
uh,
of,

592
00:37:08.771 --> 00:37:13.450
of this situation that we want to talk about,
you know,
and uh,
you know,

593
00:37:13.451 --> 00:37:17.200
films like this can allow this conversation to happen,
you know,
and you know,

594
00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:20.740
if it changes the life of one child,
then you know,
we've,
you know,

595
00:37:20.741 --> 00:37:24.580
that it makes it all worthwhile,
you know,
but,
uh,

596
00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.920
this is a recurring problem and,
you know,

597
00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.160
hopefully we can bring light into this situation.

598
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.320
<v 1>I do.
I remember discovery,
uh,
an amazingly funny moment.</v>

599
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.260
So there's the scene in the middle of the film where little son,

600
00:37:37.261 --> 00:37:38.100
he was walking along,

601
00:37:38.101 --> 00:37:41.340
he finds a spoon in the ground and there's a funeral going on.

602
00:37:41.341 --> 00:37:45.900
There's a little boy being carried along on an open a thing by a bunch of men

603
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.890
and they're all chanting.
And so the producers in India,

604
00:37:49.891 --> 00:37:53.310
they were doing all the casting stuff for that day's shoot.
They were like,

605
00:37:53.311 --> 00:37:58.110
we need 15 men and we need,
uh,
the dead 11 year old boy and the,

606
00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:00.480
uh,
one of the casting companies comes back and they're like,

607
00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:03.510
we're all good with the 15 men were having a bit of trouble with the 11 year old

608
00:38:03.511 --> 00:38:06.750
boy.
And the producers are like,
what are you talking about?
And they're like,
well,

609
00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:09.640
the police permissions,
it's really difficult to find a dead 11.

610
00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:19.250
<v 5>Wow.
That's something you,</v>

611
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:23.503
next question please.

612
00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.820
<v 6>Hi Guys,
thank you for being here.
Thanks for sharing the story.
Um,</v>

613
00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.890
I have a six year old son.
It's struck a big chord for me.
Cried the whole time.

614
00:38:32.891 --> 00:38:36.460
You'd be happy.
Um,
my Saru is for you,

615
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:41.490
the scene in the movie where you are taken in by a woman and it seems great.

616
00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:46.030
It seems like she's warm and it's a safe place and then you started feeling like

617
00:38:46.031 --> 00:38:48.250
it wasn't,
and then you left.
You escaped.

618
00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:51.640
How as a five year old being by yourself like that,

619
00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:56.641
did you navigate those situations and instinctually know not to stay with her?

620
00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:01.000
<v 3>That particular scene?
Um,
with Rama,</v>

621
00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:07.330
who's the guy that came in that tipped it off because I had a gut feeling,

622
00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.120
um,
that,
you know,
as a child,
that's what happened.
You know,

623
00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:14.440
it just didn't feel that the situation was right.

624
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:20.000
It was more wrong than anything else.
So,
um,
that's how really sort of,
um,

625
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.710
came about that,
you know,
they're not really here to help me.

626
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:28.810
I'm the guy,
you know,
things would it be too close with,

627
00:39:28.811 --> 00:39:33.400
uh,
it's,
you know,
whichever way is going to sort of go.

628
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:36.220
But you know,
I didn't want to find that out,
which was going to go.

629
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:40.720
So it made the valley in attempt to run off and you know,

630
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:45.640
maybe they were going to help me,
but,
um,
but my gut feeling is telling me,
no,

631
00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:50.170
this is wrong and you need to get out.
And so I did.
Thank you.

632
00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:54.080
<v 6>Hi.
Um,
thanks for coming.</v>

633
00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:58.190
I first just wanted to acknowledge your point about the drowning scene.

634
00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:00.620
I actually haven't seen the movie yet,
so I didn't know that was cut.

635
00:40:00.621 --> 00:40:05.330
And I thought that was profound in the book because it just reminds me about how

636
00:40:05.331 --> 00:40:08.900
life is a combination of your,
your personal tenacity.

637
00:40:08.901 --> 00:40:11.810
Obviously your story is pretty much all about your personal is nasty,

638
00:40:11.811 --> 00:40:15.830
but then those moments of sheer luck and guardian angels or whatever it may be,

639
00:40:15.831 --> 00:40:17.940
that combined with,
um,

640
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:22.740
your intent to get to get you to where your eyes anyway,

641
00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:25.520
it was interesting to hear you talk about that.
My question however,

642
00:40:25.521 --> 00:40:29.210
is really about what compelled you to write a book.

643
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:31.910
And especially,
you know,
given it's an autobiographical,

644
00:40:31.911 --> 00:40:35.930
I just kind of am always in awe of people who feel compelled to put their story

645
00:40:35.931 --> 00:40:37.550
in writing for public consumption.

646
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.413
<v 3>We'll,
um,</v>

647
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:44.330
I actually got asked to write a book from a for publishing companies.

648
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:45.890
I'm not actually,

649
00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:49.250
not that I actually went out there and I'm asking you to write a story about

650
00:40:49.251 --> 00:40:52.220
this because it's so personal.
But,
um,

651
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:55.230
but the thing about it is that,
um,

652
00:40:55.460 --> 00:41:00.350
it just went sort of snowballed in India and everywhere in India when I first,

653
00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.890
you know,
found my family and,
uh,
from India,
you know,

654
00:41:03.891 --> 00:41:08.090
went to sort of Australia and then the whole world.
And,
um,
that's when,
you know,

655
00:41:08.091 --> 00:41:12.740
sort of publishers,
um,
got hold of or knew about the story and got in contact.

656
00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.790
And so I had a choice of,
um,
you know,
sorta telling my story,

657
00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.060
which in fact has been out,
you know,
it's out a really didn't,

658
00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.630
I did have a choice of like not telling it and sort of how keeping it private,

659
00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:28.640
but I thought,
you know,
what I did is just so unique,
profound and amazing,

660
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:32.510
and if it could help someone else that's been,
like I said before,

661
00:41:32.511 --> 00:41:36.350
my situation and that's,
well,
that's gold for me.
Um,

662
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:41.410
and so I grab the bull by the horns and,
um,

663
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.740
and I decided a year I'll write a book about it.
And,
um,
and you know,

664
00:41:45.741 --> 00:41:49.750
the process started and your needs now graduation.

665
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.850
Thank you.
One more question.

666
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:56.280
<v 6>Okay.
Hey,
hey.
Um,
I really enjoyed the movie.</v>

667
00:41:56.281 --> 00:42:00.090
I thought it did a really good job of showing complexity and I think,
um,

668
00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:03.450
of the situation and at the end you feel grateful,

669
00:42:03.451 --> 00:42:07.200
but you also feel this heaviness that,
that there's just,

670
00:42:07.201 --> 00:42:11.100
it's a complex story and I think you all really pulled it off really well.

671
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:15.370
And my question is first,
so do,
there's this point in the,
um,

672
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:20.360
in the movie where you,
you know,
you go to the,
the,
the,
um,

673
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:23.730
you eat Indian food and you're at in your at and t and you kind of,

674
00:42:23.731 --> 00:42:28.290
it hits you and these memories come back.
And so my question is really,
it's very,

675
00:42:28.291 --> 00:42:31.350
I find memories very interesting and kind of,

676
00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:34.290
I was really curious in leaving the film,

677
00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:39.210
did those memories haunt you or as you grew up or when did you carry them with

678
00:42:39.211 --> 00:42:42.930
you?
Or did they suddenly come back to you and you couldn't resist them?

679
00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:47.270
<v 3>Um,
do question actually.
And um,</v>

680
00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:51.120
and the reason for those,
um,
I guess it's called,
um,
uh,

681
00:42:51.121 --> 00:42:53.700
juxtaposing where you're living down.

682
00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.640
Then all of a sudden I get a flashback and that's what they were,
they were,

683
00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:58.050
they were flashbacks.

684
00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:03.410
And the way that flashbacks were triggered was the scene with the jelaby.

685
00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:05.933
Um,

686
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:11.060
and the ones that are not in the movie would be a flashback,

687
00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:15.210
would be triggered by,
um,
I would see,
you know,
a family,

688
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:19.350
um,
in Australia,
even though I've got my adoptive family,

689
00:43:19.351 --> 00:43:23.100
the old see other families there and that have,
you know,

690
00:43:23.101 --> 00:43:25.400
the to the nuclear family,
they had the,
you know,

691
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:30.290
two kids in the mother and father and all of a sudden just saying that,
um,

692
00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:34.290
I'd be in a sort of straight of frame of mind of um,
you know,

693
00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.890
sort of just,
you know,
sort of wondering about my,
you know,

694
00:43:37.891 --> 00:43:42.570
my past life and that just by looking at that would trigger things.

695
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:47.330
And I would sort of remember,
you know,
border was life for myself.
Um,

696
00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.410
as a char to be playing with my sister,

697
00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:53.820
running around my mom's leg in know salary and,
you know,
playing sort of,

698
00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:58.170
um,
um,
hide and seek.
So,

699
00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:01.350
um,
so that's,
you know,

700
00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:05.580
that was one of the things that sort of stayed with me by these trigger points

701
00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:10.740
and there was multiples of them.
Um,
and you know,
that that made it sort of,

702
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:14.580
um,
sustained.
And that's why I'd probably also,
you know,

703
00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:18.660
didn't lose those memories as well as sort of my dreams as well during the night

704
00:44:18.661 --> 00:44:22.830
too.
So,
um,
but you know,
there,

705
00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.130
there was times where we sort of,
you know,

706
00:44:26.131 --> 00:44:28.140
you did just didn't know what to do with it.

707
00:44:28.141 --> 00:44:32.130
Sometimes you just fill in a heap and,
um,
and about it,
you know,

708
00:44:32.131 --> 00:44:36.600
in your personal self.
Um,
and you know,
there was also things that,

709
00:44:36.601 --> 00:44:41.520
songs that would trigger members as well,
multiples of them and,
and you'd always,

710
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.750
and sometimes there was times where you just have just a whole heap of just

711
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:50.160
memories,
go flick,
flick,
flick or within thought,
sort of 30 seconds.

712
00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:55.530
Um,
almost like,
you know,
you know,
when you see Predator,

713
00:44:55.531 --> 00:44:59.220
I don't want to go that far,
but we're,
here's that kind of,
yeah,

714
00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:03.990
that's how it was,
but,
you know,
multiples of them.
So,

715
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:07.270
um,
and yeah,
it's just,
you know,
memories like that.

716
00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:12.210
I'm sort of glad that it was like that because it stayed in my memory.
Um,
and,

717
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:16.290
and I suppose maybe there was a reason for that,
that stay there.

718
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:20.720
It was meant to do something,
you know,
later on,
but I just hadn't worked in.

719
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:24.090
W just hadn't worked out at that point of time.

720
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:30.270
Excellent.
Well,
thank you everyone.
Thank you guys for your wonderful,

721
00:45:30.271 --> 00:45:33.270

I think it was a great session,
and if you haven't seen the film,

722
