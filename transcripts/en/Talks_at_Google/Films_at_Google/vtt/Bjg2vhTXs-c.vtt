00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.190
Hi everyone.
Welcome to toxic Google.

2
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.260
My name is Olivia Ma and I'm so,

3
00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:16.261
so honored to welcome Bob Odenkirk and Tom Hanks today to discuss their roles in

4
00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:18.550
the upcoming Steven Spielberg film,
The post,

5
00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:22.560
which hits theaters on December 22nd so please join me in welcoming Bob Odenkirk

6
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.460
and Tom Hanks.

7
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.043
<v 1>So</v>

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.121
<v 0>first of all,</v>

9
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:35.940
I just want to thank you all for taking the time to join us here at the youtube

10
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:37.410
space in New York.
Um,

11
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:40.350
it's such an honor and such a time we movie to be discussing today.

12
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.520
I also just want to start by saying this is a deeply personal for me because my

13
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.480
father,
my late father worked for a long time as an executive,

14
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.640
as an editor and executive at the Washington Post Company.

15
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:53.670
He worked under Kay Graham when he first got his start and then leader for his,

16
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.000
for his son Donald.
And so seeing the movie last night,

17
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.620
which I had the pleasure of doing was,
was really,
really meaningful.
Uh,

18
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.840
and so I just want to start by asking about the timing of all of this.
You know,

19
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.550
uh,
it's been reported that Steven Spielberg got the script in Ma in March,

20
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:12.180
I believe.
And then you all started filming in May and here we are in December.

21
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:13.530
And the film is about to hit the theaters.

22
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.830
Talk a little bit about why you felt like it was important to make this movie

23
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:18.030
now and what the urgency was

24
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.270
<v 2>first.
Cause I'm hip to some of this stuff and Bob's not.
So,
uh,</v>

25
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.520
uh,
uh,
Amy Pascal who is a producer,
red,
uh,

26
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.480
Liz Hannah's draft spec script that was written in,
uh,

27
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.240
in October.
Uh,
we read it,
uh,

28
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.810
in a by that I think Steven and marijuana.

29
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.700
When did you read it for the first time after you were at or know when did it

30
00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:45.790
start shooting?
Well,
we read,
I read it in February and we,

31
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.350
the first day of shooting was may,

32
00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:52.090
which is a brutally short post for a preproduction time.
Uh,
and,

33
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.960
uh,
we,
we,
uh,
my last day was I think the 26th of July,

34
00:01:55.961 --> 00:02:00.280
so it shot that fast.
But at the same time,
Liz,
Liz,

35
00:02:00.281 --> 00:02:04.090
Hannah screenplay was really about Katharine Graham,
uh,

36
00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:05.380
becoming Katharine Graham.

37
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.600
The Pentagon papers were presented in it as though it was,
uh,
you know,
uh,

38
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.690
the treasure chest,
but we didn't know what was inside the treasure chest.

39
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.010
Josh singer who wrote a spotlight among many other things,

40
00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:22.180
he ended up teaming up with,
uh,
uh,
with,
uh,

41
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.440
Liz because Steven wanted more information,
more details,

42
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.240
more of the procedure that went on in to this week of American history so that

43
00:02:31.241 --> 00:02:34.270
we were constantly working with new pages,
new materials.

44
00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:38.890
There were whole scenes that didn't exist until,
for example,
we met,

45
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.320
um,
uh,

46
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.530
Daniel Ellsberg who leaked the Pentagon papers for the Rand Corporation.

47
00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:48.040
And there are scenes in the movie that came directly from our,
uh,

48
00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:49.810
our talk with him.
So it was a,

49
00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:54.610
it was greatly influx from the moment we first read it right up until the last

50
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.030
day we shot.
Yeah.
Does that answer the timeliness of it or it,

51
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.740
it just so happens that we're making a movie that took place in 1971.

52
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.580
And if you invert the,
uh,
the integers to 17,

53
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.830
it's like we're making a movie about current events.

54
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.000
<v 0>Yeah.
They're,
they're certainly,
it was a lot of residents with,
uh,</v>

55
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:14.760
some of the events that are happening in the world today.
Um,

56
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.540
talk to me a little about preparing for these roles and what the research

57
00:03:18.541 --> 00:03:19.351
process was like.

58
00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:21.450
You mentioned you had the opportunity to talk with Daniel Ellsberg,

59
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:25.470
who of course was a critical player in this entire story.
Um,
you know,

60
00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:29.220
what was it like to sort of really immerse yourself in the culture of a 1970s

61
00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:33.210
newsroom?
And you knew Tom Knew Ben Bradley,

62
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.560
which is pretty cool.

63
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.440
<v 2>I had met Ben Bradlee,
um,
through Nora Ephron.
Uh,
and this was years ago.
I act,</v>

64
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.340
believe it or not,
I actually met Katharine Graham the day she died.

65
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.010
Uh,
that was a fluky thing.
Wow.

66
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.150
We didn't know that was happening to the service you provide.
Yeah.
That's,

67
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.960
that's how deep I was willing to go into the research.
Uh,
but,
uh,

68
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.180
but knowing that they're,
there is a boy.

69
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.570
Katharine Graham wrote this amazing a autobiography as did,
as did Ben.

70
00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:08.230
And there's oceans of video,
there's a lot of material that you can find out,
uh,

71
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.900
about the particulars.

72
00:04:09.901 --> 00:04:14.210
But digging into the process of the,

73
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.510
the pre Watergate pre all the president's men version of the Washington Post,

74
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.600
that was,
that was just grunt work.

75
00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:25.110
We met an awful lot of people and we just asked them every possible question we

76
00:04:25.111 --> 00:04:30.111
could about how to get the paper out and the importance of this week and the

77
00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:33.540
history of it because it really wasn't an assault on the first amendment.

78
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.460
The New York Times was,
I think the word is in joined are conjoined.
They were,

79
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.050
they,

80
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.110
they were forced to stop publishing by the Justice Department and the idea of

81
00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:47.370
the Washington Post saying,
well,
we've got,
we've got the papers as well.

82
00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:52.371
So we're going to do whether they ran a flush into the danger of being

83
00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:54.600
imprisoned for treason,
uh,

84
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.270
for giving up of national a national secrets.
Uh,

85
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.090
and on mine,

86
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.740
I'm an Lord from that is also the background of the paper itself because they

87
00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:05.400
were not,

88
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.200
the Washington Post at that time was not just competing with the New York Times

89
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.640
for national prominence.
They weren't even the number one paper in Washington DC.

90
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.650
The Washington Star,
which never doesn't exist anymore,
was the number one paper,

91
00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:20.484
Washington DC.

92
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.570
So you get all this kind of magnificent flexing of journalistic muscles.
I mean,

93
00:05:24.571 --> 00:05:28.500
you know,
Ben Bradley was just,
he was a man possessed.
He was,
he was,
uh,

94
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.010
he was a hunting dog when it came down to doing the work of the fourth estate.

95
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.310
And Katherine Graham had to deal with the realities of her father started the

96
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:41.610
newspaper and when he died he gave the newspaper to her husband,

97
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.840
not her.
So her husband ran it.
Their son,

98
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.960
Don had actually served in Vietnam and uh,
at the,

99
00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:52.870
at the whims of history and these,
these papers,
uh,

100
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.890
that study that had been a commissioned and had been sitting around the rand for

101
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.240
for years,
divulged just the,
what's the word,

102
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:05.510
the rocky road in which American involvement got into this thing that was

103
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:09.940
killing,
that was killing about 8,000 young Americans every year.
Uh,

104
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.900
and to the total of 52,000,
I think died.
So a,
it ends up being this,

105
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:19.901
this treaties on people who understand that they're dealing,

106
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.650
they have to have a degree of cynicism because both Ben bag,

107
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:26.850
dicky in and everybody in the newsroom and,

108
00:06:26.851 --> 00:06:31.851
and Ben Bradlee and k knew that elected officials lie in order to curry favor

109
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:35.090
and hold onto their power.

110
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.420
And yet that cynicism could not give way to,
uh,
a,

111
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.390
a blanket statement or a desire just to run with anything that is not,

112
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:49.391
that was not the provable codafide a research driven truth that they then ended

113
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:54.980
up finding out.
And that's really what the struggle is day in and day out.

114
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:57.860
And the six days it was paper.
My research was,

115
00:06:57.861 --> 00:07:00.440
I Read Ben Beg Dickins Autobiography,

116
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:05.080
<v 3>which is a great book.
He's a great journalist.
Gave his whole life to journalism.</v>

117
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.230
You cared about it deeply and uh,
it was a great youtube interview with him.

118
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.130
And so how do you find that Youtube,
what do you do?

119
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.940
You gotta get one of these fancy computers?

120
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.240
<v 2>Well,
I'm gonna let's go ask,
let's go down to the library.</v>

121
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:26.220
<v 3>This building and a woman goes down an aisle and she finds the file.</v>

122
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.970
Uh,
actually I wanted to ask about your,
your character Ben,

123
00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:34.500
back to him because um,
you know,
he's somewhat of a lesser known character,

124
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.940
but he had this essential role and actually acquiring the Pentagon papers from

125
00:07:38.941 --> 00:07:43.290
Daniel Ellsberg and there's an incredible scene in the hotel room when you go to

126
00:07:43.291 --> 00:07:47.970
actually meet him to get the papers and you promise him that you are going to

127
00:07:47.971 --> 00:07:51.270
publish them.
And I want to talk about that scene.
Yeah.

128
00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:53.610
And just like the courage at that,

129
00:07:53.611 --> 00:07:56.550
that is sort of on manifested in that in that moment.

130
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.680
I think it's balls and not so much courage because Ben isn't utterly,

131
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.350
completely sure that it will get published.

132
00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:06.930
He's assuring Ellsberg so you can have the story,

133
00:08:06.931 --> 00:08:10.980
but any wants it to be published.
He thinks it's the right thing to do,
I think.

134
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.290
But you know,
he,

135
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.810
he didn't run the paper and he knew that whenever you hand stuff over to the,

136
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.630
the bosses,
even though I think he was tight with Bradley,

137
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.020
I'm not sure how long they'd worked together,
but it seems to me,

138
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.110
it seems like they'd worked together for a couple of years.
And,
uh,

139
00:08:25.111 --> 00:08:27.660
and he was a seasoned reporter by the time he got hired there.

140
00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:32.661
So I imagine they had a comradeship of years of journalism,

141
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.850
uh,
shared.
And uh,
but he,

142
00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:41.340
he had a promise Helzberg he would publish it in order to walk away with the

143
00:08:41.341 --> 00:08:44.130
papers.
He also had to take a second set of the papers,

144
00:08:44.131 --> 00:08:47.970
which he always felt bad about because it went against his,
um,

145
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.480
rules of being a journalist.
Um,

146
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.100
Ellsberg asked him to take two copies of the,
the papers,

147
00:08:56.101 --> 00:09:00.960
one to give to the Washington Post and one that he secretly gave to a

148
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:05.490
congressman to read into the record,
into the congressional record,

149
00:09:05.491 --> 00:09:08.310
thereby making it public.
And,
um,

150
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.920
after the Washington Post did with,
you know,

151
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:14.970
published papers and got in trouble alongside the New York Times,

152
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.830
then a beg dicky and did deliver the papers to a senator whose name,

153
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:23.730
I can't remember,
who didn't read all the papers,
but he read a chunk,

154
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:27.960
he read a couple hours worth into the congressional record.
So there's no,

155
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.250
that has to be public.

156
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:34.251
So thereby getting kind of any which way kind of breaking this code of silence

157
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:40.320
on them.
Yeah.
Do you think if,
if this moment happens today,

158
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:44.460
that journalists working in the environment,
would,
that we're living in today?

159
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:47.190
We would make the same decision?
Oh,
absolutely.

160
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.020
<v 2>I,
I,</v>

161
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.870
I think one of the things that has been learned from this checkered period of

162
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.860
our history is that you have to take to the barricades at some point.

163
00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:57.660
And they would,
uh,
the,

164
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.960
what's interesting is the assault that would go on in regards to the first

165
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:05.040
amendment would not be the same as it was in 1971 at that time,

166
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:09.150
they had the power in order to literally cease the presses from operating and

167
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:14.160
making it impossible to literally physically publish the information.

168
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.281
Uh,

169
00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:19.200
that what's going on now is a different sort of assault on the first amendment

170
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:23.910
if sort of fight it is a constant,
uh,
de-legitimizing of the truth,

171
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:24.560
uh,

172
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:29.560
which at the same time raises up the legitimacy of what truly is a false media.

173
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.040
Uh,
you can decry,
oh,
that's just fake news,

174
00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:35.940
that just fake news that comes out into the mainstream media.
Uh,

175
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.560
but they,
they go the extra distance in order to have the multiple,

176
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:44.760
multiple sources.
And so all of this stuff can be confirmed.

177
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.810
And yet there is also,
as we know,
uh,
you know,
oceans of a,

178
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:53.400
of outlets that don't,
that don't give a damn about the truth and forcefully or,

179
00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:56.640
or are,
are putting out news that they know themselves.
It's false.

180
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.510
And in that way,
that's a different sort of assault on,

181
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.160
let's understand that you can take the first amendment of the Constitution and

182
00:11:05.161 --> 00:11:09.690
maybe not even bother with the rest of them because in that first amendment is

183
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:11.580
we are guaranteed this,
the,
the,

184
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.700
the no government will establish a national religion.

185
00:11:14.701 --> 00:11:18.840
So we have freedom of religion.
They cannot stop us from a Freedom of assembly,

186
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.630
which means we get to hang out with likeminded people.

187
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:26.250
We have freedom of speech in order to say anything we want to short of yelling

188
00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:30.900
fire in a crowded theater when there is no fire and a freedom of the press,

189
00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:33.540
you cannot stop the press from Walter,
uh,
from,
uh,

190
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.920
from existing take that that literally is the foundation for the American

191
00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:42.170
democracy and all of a,
all of Western society when you,
when you can,

192
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.380
when you try to conspire in order to attack any one of those,
uh,

193
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.550
on any form,
you are doing this,
you're doing literally the same work of a,

194
00:11:51.551 --> 00:11:55.450
at an administration that was truly taking on and putting the,
the uh,

195
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.190
the force of a government behind the ceasing of,
um,

196
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.740
of publication and therefore,
uh,
removing the right to uh,
uh,

197
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.900
the freedom of the press.

198
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.740
<v 3>Totally agree.
I think one of my favorite fun facts about you,</v>

199
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:10.300
which I think maybe you should confirm here,

200
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:14.020
is that you send a coffee maker to the White House press corps.

201
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.393
Has that happened

202
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:19.210
<v 2>a long ago?
Uh,
when I was just a visitor,
uh,</v>

203
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.240
we visited the empty a White House press room and there were,

204
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.990
there were like three people there.

205
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.680
It has to be staffed 24 hours a day because something goes on.

206
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.620
Someone's got to be there to turn on the cameras and the microphone and start

207
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:35.860
rolling.
And I saw they had the saddest,
oldest,

208
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.770
shittiest little mister coffee that had already been there for like 12 years at

209
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:45.220
guys,
you need a new coffee maker.
So I sent them a pretty good espresso machine,

210
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.180
but that was like 15 years ago.
And when I went back and saw it again,

211
00:12:49.181 --> 00:12:52.270
it was the same,
same espresso maker.
I said,
guys,
come on.

212
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.480
So I sent them a new one for so then they could pursue truth,

213
00:12:55.481 --> 00:12:59.320
justice and the American way and it's,
and it's open for everybody.
Any,

214
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.730
any member of the press car could get a decent,
decent cup of coffee now.

215
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:05.711
<v 3>Well Bob,</v>

216
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:08.680
I wanted to ask you a little bit about your decision to take on this role

217
00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:11.380
because your,
your career has really spanned a lot of different genres.

218
00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:15.010
You've done Mr. Show and comedy and then of course breaking bad and better call

219
00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:18.610
Saul.
What was it like to work with Steven Spielberg on a historical film?

220
00:13:18.611 --> 00:13:22.930
It was very intimidating and I felt like I felt out of place.
I really did.

221
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:27.040
And shows hardship.
Oh well we tricked you.
We,
uh,

222
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.940
they used only the good takes.
That's how they did a,

223
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.440
it was truly the,

224
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.090
I haven't been this intimidated in like 30 years since I first got hired at SNL

225
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.900
where I wrote for this guy when I was 25.

226
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.370
And so it's like literally that's how long it's been since I had that feeling

227
00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:50.200
that I had on this movie of like,
I am going to be fired.
I should be fired.

228
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.970
I should call them,
you should fire me.
But it just felt like it was just,

229
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:55.871
look,
you know,

230
00:13:55.871 --> 00:14:00.871
I've been very lucky to work on some great dramas on TV Fargo and breaking bad

231
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:04.930
and all,
and these are respected projects and great,
great creators and stuff,

232
00:14:04.931 --> 00:14:07.440
but this was another level.
And,
uh,

233
00:14:07.441 --> 00:14:12.350
I've always loved Tom's work so much and Steven Spielberg is it,

234
00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:17.020
you know,
it's just,
he's an icon,
you know,
and uh,

235
00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:20.560
so it was intimidating,
but Steven's very nice.

236
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:24.990
And Luckily I played a guy who I could relate to,
I think,
beg Dickins,

237
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.890
um,
anxious energy coupled with his,
uh,

238
00:14:29.891 --> 00:14:34.600
in his,
in his biography he talks about learning to fade into the woodwork.

239
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.660
That's like,
uh,

240
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.900
he learned as a journalist to just quiet himself down to get people to talk.

241
00:14:40.901 --> 00:14:45.520
And I thought I maybe it was able to combine those using my natural nervousness

242
00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:50.050
to both recede away from the camera and then,
uh,
you know,

243
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:54.050
be a energetic when needed.
So it was really fun.

244
00:14:54.051 --> 00:14:55.970
And I had some comedy in it too with the,

245
00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:01.130
the nerves of trying to get the phone call to happen cause I have some tenuous

246
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:05.960
connection to Ellsberg Beg Dicky and actually worked with Ellsberg at rand and

247
00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:10.820
he sort of put together in his mind who would have,
uh,
the,

248
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:12.140
uh,
hoods,
but,
uh,

249
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.980
put these papers out and he chase down Ellsberg and,

250
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:20.120
and it was a tricky thing to get the papers and Ellsberg was,
you know,

251
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.150
scared that he was going to get arrested.

252
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:27.740
So there was a lot of tension in my scenes and I get to use that,
you know,

253
00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:32.540
use my own natural,
a nervousness to play it,
I guess it played well.

254
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:34.790
I feel good about it.
And you know,

255
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.980
obviously I think a lot of you have seen the movie.
Anybody.
Yeah.

256
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.080
A couple of you.
I mean we're,

257
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:46.160
one thing we haven't talked about is Merrill and I'm Katherine Graham and,

258
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.550
and Tom was talking about how that early draft,
uh,

259
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.640
Liz Hannah's draft was very much about her journey as a woman to own her power

260
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.750
that she had been given.
But she and w internally was like,

261
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.080
I don't know if I have a right to this.
As smart as she was,

262
00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:07.700
as composed as she was as a person,
it just was such,
not,

263
00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:12.230
it was so not done.
And it was so not something she was familiar with,

264
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:17.510
uh,
that it was hard for her to assume the power that she'd been granted granted,

265
00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:21.740
and that was hers.
And so in this movie,
in the course of the story,

266
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.980
you watch her grow into that.

267
00:16:24.981 --> 00:16:29.981
It's really an amazing thing alongside everything that Tom said about the

268
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:34.370
stories of getting the papers and fighting back against the government and

269
00:16:34.371 --> 00:16:38.010
getting the crackdown and sorting out this mystery,

270
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:42.290
the suspense actually have that.
It's a mix of so many things.

271
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:47.060
This movie and that story is all there from Liz's script.
I mean,

272
00:16:47.061 --> 00:16:51.170
two of my favorite moments are of the movie are when Kay Graham makes the

273
00:16:51.171 --> 00:16:55.650
decision on the phone to go ahead and say,
yes,
we're going to publish.
Now.

274
00:16:55.651 --> 00:16:59.480
My other favorite movie moment is when she's walking down the steps of the

275
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.460
Supreme Court.
Oh yeah,
it's this holy cow.

276
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:06.610
All of these women are looking at her with a sense of awe and inspiration.

277
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.420
Here's the one of my favorite scenes,

278
00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:13.421
not because I just because it worked so well when she goes to that board room

279
00:17:13.761 --> 00:17:15.020
and she's all prepared,

280
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:20.060
she's going to give this presentation and it's all men and they don't,

281
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:24.380
they look right pastor,
as she talks,
no one listens to her.

282
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.310
And the way that plays out,
you feel it,

283
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:32.660
you feel her being ignored and you're like,
it's crazy to it.

284
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.260
And the moment that we're living in right now was,
wait,

285
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.370
I'm going to ask one more question then everyone here at please have your

286
00:17:37.371 --> 00:17:39.580
questions ready.
I want to ask you,
Tom,
you know,

287
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.080
I was surprised to learn this was actually the first project you'd ever done

288
00:17:42.081 --> 00:17:45.830
with,
with Meryl Streep.
Um,
talk about what that was like to work with her.

289
00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:48.260
And then if there's other,
you know,
actors that either of you had,

290
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:49.860
would have always wanted to work with.

291
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.440
<v 2>Well you dare not assemble a list cause as soon as you do,
you'll,</v>

292
00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.740
it'll never happen.
It's just,
it's just bad luck.
And you know,
my,

293
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.150
there,

294
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:04.800
we had never just been in projects in which there was a Meryl Streep role that

295
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:09.690
we could go to for her.
A gold go to her for or,
and I guess vice versa.
I mean,

296
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.280
I can't sing a lick,
so there was no way I could put myself in Mama Mia that,

297
00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:17.310
that the,
that which would have been,
you know,
the clothes I could get,

298
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:21.780
the intimidation factor is truly off the scale.
I mean,
we,
we,
we knew each other,

299
00:18:21.781 --> 00:18:24.660
we met each other.
I would say hello to each other,
but the,

300
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.090
the mystery of Merrill is how does she do it?

301
00:18:27.091 --> 00:18:31.380
And it turns out she does it just like anybody else does.
You know,
you,
you,

302
00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:33.990
you sit,
you'll run your lines a bunch.
She starts,
she stopped,

303
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:37.590
she goes back and forth.
She's part of an ensemble and yet she's so,

304
00:18:37.591 --> 00:18:41.910
she does it like everybody else,
but she does it unlike anybody else.
There's no,

305
00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.780
there's one way to do it that,
that,
that scene where she has it,

306
00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:50.781
she's only ever been either the the daughter or the wife of the person who ran

307
00:18:50.851 --> 00:18:55.851
the paper and that moment where she's getting yelled at on the phone by people

308
00:18:56.951 --> 00:19:00.090
who are saying under no circumstances can you publish.
Well,

309
00:19:00.091 --> 00:19:04.320
I don't think you should because if it was me,
I wouldn't do other people saying,

310
00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:06.060
if you don't publish,
we're going to resign.

311
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.610
Because there's no sense of being a journalist if you're not going to run with

312
00:19:08.611 --> 00:19:12.680
this.
And that decision is placed solely on her.
And I,
I,
uh,

313
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:16.740
my voices in it,
are you on the phone to know?
But you're,

314
00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:19.280
you're in the other room when it's all going on.
Yeah.
You,
you,

315
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.540
you threatened to a,

316
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:24.600
you threatened to resign and you don't know what's going to happen.

317
00:19:24.601 --> 00:19:27.780
And I think it's one of the,
it's,
it's a powerful moment.

318
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.340
And I think the history of cinema coming from,
she'd hate if I said this to it,

319
00:19:32.341 --> 00:19:37.341
but I think the greatest actor who has ever been on cellulose,

320
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.580
Meryl Streep.
All right.
We're going to take a few questions from the audience.

321
00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:45.510
There's a microphone here and yeah,
so I'll start with you.
Okay.

322
00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.840
<v 4>Thank you guys so much for being here.
Big Fans of both of you.
Um,
really,</v>

323
00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:53.440
really quickly.
Tom,
I wanted to tell you a fast story.
My mom is such a huge fan.

324
00:19:53.441 --> 00:19:56.830
She was about to give birth to my brother in labor or having contractions while

325
00:19:56.831 --> 00:19:59.140
you were about to win the academy award.

326
00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:02.710
She didn't want to go to the hospital because she wanted to see you when she

327
00:20:02.711 --> 00:20:06.360
went to the hospital after as much urging and was able to see when and then

328
00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:09.520
successfully delivered my brother.
So she's a big fan.

329
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.270
<v 2>Uh,
is your brother okay?</v>

330
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.410
What's his name is Forrest Gump.

331
00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:19.120
<v 4>Yeah.
Um,
but huge bandwidth though,
right?</v>

332
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.620
<v 2>The prelude.
Is your brother a smart or is he</v>

333
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.580
very glad to hear that.

334
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:31.140
<v 5>Um,
I wanted to ask,
I thought that was very eloquent in your description of your,</v>

335
00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:35.970
sort of the changing nature of technology in terms of disclosures back when this

336
00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:37.380
movie takes place.
And you know,

337
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:40.680
currently how a lot of disclosures are affecting politics today.
It,

338
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.150
it made me wonder for both of you,
you know,
has ever working on a movie,

339
00:20:45.151 --> 00:20:46.350
especially when that's political,

340
00:20:46.351 --> 00:20:50.470
like this really challenged or changed any of your opinions about sort of a

341
00:20:50.471 --> 00:20:53.680
strongly held belief that you had going into it?

342
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.760
<v 3>Uh,</v>

343
00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.760
I mostly did comedy in my life and I made fun of stuff that came from my brain.

344
00:21:02.021 --> 00:21:06.730
And so I,
uh,
um,
you know,

345
00:21:06.731 --> 00:21:10.990
I don't,
I don't have a,
no,
I would say that hasn't happened for me.

346
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.510
<v 2>The,
the thing that happens when you,
you,
you,</v>

347
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.660
you take on a job because you think you know enough of the story and then in the

348
00:21:18.661 --> 00:21:19.650
process of it,

349
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.650
you end up learning more and more and more and more until you find out.

350
00:21:22.651 --> 00:21:26.040
Literally,
I didn't know that.
Um,
uh,

351
00:21:26.041 --> 00:21:30.910
I made this when I'm made this movie called,
um,
well most recently,

352
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:35.580
uh,
the movie a Sally about Shazli's rude for landed the plane out on,

353
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.520
on the Hudson.
Uh,
all of the,
uh,

354
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:43.480
industry and union and Ntsb National Transportation Safety Board pressures that

355
00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:47.890
is on somebody who did that was extremely eye opening.
It made you number one,

356
00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:52.210
maybe not want to fly on a commercial airliner anymore because you find out how

357
00:21:52.211 --> 00:21:56.700
little they're paying their pilots,
uh,
and how they cut costs.
Uh,

358
00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.520
but also,
uh,
he,
uh,
he,
for 18 months,

359
00:22:00.521 --> 00:22:04.570
he had no idea if he was going to be found,
uh,
responsible for,
uh,

360
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.600
for landing the plane of the way he did,

361
00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.540
in which case he would have lost his license and would have lost his,
uh,
his,

362
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.720
his literally the way that he could make a living and find that stuff out.

363
00:22:13.721 --> 00:22:17.440
And you kind of think really,
and yet those are,
those are the Yukon pine out.

364
00:22:17.441 --> 00:22:22.030
These common ordinary details of truth with makes the original reason we want to

365
00:22:22.031 --> 00:22:25.750
do the movie even kind of like grander because you just find out how much truly

366
00:22:25.751 --> 00:22:26.890
is is at stake.

367
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.140
<v 6>Okay.</v>

368
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:28.973
<v 5>You're welcome.</v>

369
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.650
<v 6>Hi.</v>

370
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.150
<v 5>So,
um,
Mr Hanks,</v>

371
00:22:34.151 --> 00:22:37.990
your Instagram is one of my all time favorites and doing the important work of

372
00:22:37.991 --> 00:22:42.730
documenting a femora around the world.
Um,
and I was wondering,

373
00:22:42.731 --> 00:22:45.880
you've spoken so articulately today about some of the challenges facing and how

374
00:22:45.881 --> 00:22:50.881
do you consider using your platforms and speaking publicly about things that are

375
00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:54.540
going on versus doing fun,
things like that that,
um,

376
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.800
just bring a little pleasure to people's lives.
You know,

377
00:22:56.801 --> 00:23:01.540
it's interesting because I do,
do you have a big internet social platforms?

378
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.790
<v 3>My,
my issue is that I,
I did comedy for 25 years.</v>

379
00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.860
Pretty straight.
Just that.
No.

380
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:13.780
And so I have s fans from that world and it's very critical world and they're

381
00:23:13.781 --> 00:23:15.340
used to my political opinion.

382
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:20.410
And then I have a larger group of people who've seen me in drama.
So,

383
00:23:20.411 --> 00:23:23.560
even though I spent most of my life with these fans who would completely

384
00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:25.060
understand if I made a

385
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.890
cynical or crass political comment,

386
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.290
I have to be careful because I'm,

387
00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:37.380
I have more fans who don't know I ever spoke up about my opinion about anything.

388
00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:42.910
And they think I'm a dramatic actor.
And if I were to say something,
um,

389
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:47.180
pointed,
they might feel insulted and wonder why I'm even commenting.

390
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:50.480
So I keep my mouth shut.
I'm trying to navigate this thing.

391
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.093
I don't know what to do.

392
00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:53.210
<v 2>I think,
uh,</v>

393
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:58.470
I think the desire is for authenticity in whatever you put out there.

394
00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.670
And if you're,
if,

395
00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.980
if you have eight bajillion followers and you're going to use them in order to

396
00:24:05.981 --> 00:24:10.300
sell your new product or steer them towards something that you're actually being

397
00:24:10.301 --> 00:24:14.890
paid to endorse,
I think that's disingenuous.
And it removes the,

398
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.330
removes the great promise of what all this connectivity,
uh,
was,

399
00:24:19.331 --> 00:24:24.250
was meant to,
to provide.
I,
I don't,
I don't care.

400
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:28.630
By and large what most people have to say about the,
uh,
the,

401
00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.870
the issue of the day or,
you know,
it's like this,

402
00:24:31.871 --> 00:24:34.060
you were in where the ice bucket challenge came around,

403
00:24:34.061 --> 00:24:38.020
but that was just a great thing.
But you can't create that again.

404
00:24:38.021 --> 00:24:42.820
You can't suddenly,
you know,
uh,
uh,
just by putting it out there,
make a,

405
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.070
make something become as important as that.

406
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:49.760
There is a natural kind of like microbiology to all this stuff.
And I,
I,

407
00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:52.280
I,
I,
when,
you know,
I don't,
I,

408
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:56.520
I put up visual Haikus and every now and again,
you know,
post,
uh,

409
00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.980
pictures of,
you know,
guys I knew who fought in World War II,

410
00:24:59.981 --> 00:25:03.720
who passed away and just say,
Godspeed,
thanks for being there because I,

411
00:25:03.721 --> 00:25:08.620
at the end of the day,
I just,
I don't trust somebody who uses it for an agenda,

412
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.060
be it either self serving or you know,
can be,
like you said,
saying,

413
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:17.430
uh,
oh,
I have something important to say about this.
And I'm not saying they,
okay,

414
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.160
fine,
but I don't have to pay attention to it.
So.
Well,
thank you.
Thank you.

415
00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:23.520
All right.
Okay,
I'll I,

416
00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.530
it means you look out and look or wander around and look at the ground a lot.

417
00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.390
You got to like always be looking down.

418
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.690
And why do people always lose pacifiers from,
there's babies.

419
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.460
There's millions of pacifiers lying on the streets all the time.

420
00:25:36.461 --> 00:25:40.630
I don't know why.
Yeah,
well,
but we,
if you,
if in order to use them,

421
00:25:40.631 --> 00:25:42.020
you've got to run them through your dishwashers.

422
00:25:42.021 --> 00:25:45.070
So I'd like to watch TV with a found pacifier in my mouth

423
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:49.160
<v 3>sometimes.
What's up?
Hi,
I'm Diana.</v>

424
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:50.480
I run a channel about physics,

425
00:25:50.481 --> 00:25:52.970
so I have to ask an important question about the universe,

426
00:25:52.971 --> 00:25:55.040
which is a definitely related.

427
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.970
Why do you post pictures of the Solo Mittens?

428
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.970
<v 2>There's a story behind every one of those mittens.
It belonged to somebody.</v>

429
00:26:04.971 --> 00:26:08.360
They got it as a gift.
They bought it.
Sometimes it's an expensive gloves.

430
00:26:08.361 --> 00:26:11.180
Sometimes it's a cheap one.
But I just like to thank,

431
00:26:11.181 --> 00:26:13.310
someone was walking around and you know,

432
00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.670
their mind was somewhere else and they put their glove on and they walked a

433
00:26:16.671 --> 00:26:21.020
little bit more and they reached for the other one.
And where did it go?

434
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.600
What's going on in their lives.
Why did they do that?

435
00:26:23.601 --> 00:26:26.900
And the one that really gets me his little baby booties would you find a little

436
00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:28.340
baby booty?
So it needs,

437
00:26:28.341 --> 00:26:32.510
some kid was rolled around in a stroller in the middle of February and probably

438
00:26:32.511 --> 00:26:36.710
lost their toes to frostbite.
You know,
they had to go to the emergency room was,

439
00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.750
it was a big thing there.
There is,
there was,

440
00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.800
there was a before and after story that goes along with those,
uh,

441
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:47.610
those gloves that I just find who hasn't lost a glove in this world.

442
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:52.260
And uh,
I think it unifies us.
It's the great promise of social media brings us,

443
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.310
it brings us all together,
doesn't it?
In the form of one loss.
Glover or mitten.

444
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:58.850
Thank you for resolving the mystery.
You Go.

445
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:01.760
<v 7>Okay.</v>

446
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.450
<v 4>Hi,
Mr hangs high.
I'm a super big fan.
Um,</v>

447
00:27:05.451 --> 00:27:09.470
and thank you for having us here all day today.
So I'm a youtube creator.
Um,

448
00:27:09.471 --> 00:27:13.340
my neck,
I'm from India.
Channel Name Is Rick shall volley.
So I don't want to,

449
00:27:13.341 --> 00:27:16.430
I can't talk too much.
I'll say it very quickly.
So do you think,

450
00:27:16.431 --> 00:27:19.610
cause this be all youtube creators here,
do you think,
um,

451
00:27:19.611 --> 00:27:23.450
is it ever a way that there is a bridge that we creators can have a bridge to

452
00:27:23.451 --> 00:27:25.100
traditional cinema?

453
00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.850
Do you think that's ever possible being on youtube or what is your view on that?

454
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:29.950
<v 7>Okay,</v>

455
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:34.240
<v 2>well I think you guys are already creating original cinema.
Um,</v>

456
00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:37.840
I th years go by,
I think we always get this kind of question of how,

457
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.120
how can I get started in show business?
You know,

458
00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.240
and the answer is get started in show business.

459
00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.660
Come up with something and you know,
put it on,
you can use your phone,

460
00:27:46.661 --> 00:27:47.830
you can use something decent.

461
00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:53.040
How many people actually do create original stories as opposed to things that

462
00:27:53.051 --> 00:27:58.030
are going on in their lives?
See,
um,
you guys are the,

463
00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:58.930
the,

464
00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:03.930
the nature of how we are entertained is in flux now and it's not going to land

465
00:28:05.501 --> 00:28:06.760
for quite some time.

466
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:12.300
How we pay for our entertainment is going to be determined.

467
00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:17.100
And the only,
I think the only guarantee is,

468
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.360
or the only this biggest signposts of it is,

469
00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:22.450
is going to be the quality of that entertainment.

470
00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:26.170
I mean we all know people that put on different sweaters and they say,

471
00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:27.580
I don't like the way this sweater,

472
00:28:27.581 --> 00:28:29.380
I just hearing a story about somebody does it like that.

473
00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.500
And it turns out they get paid in order to put on a certain sweater.

474
00:28:32.501 --> 00:28:35.140
What happened?
That's commerce.
It's not art.

475
00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.980
If you're creating original stories out there,
it is art.

476
00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:42.220
And as people discover you,
cause you put anything on youtube,

477
00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:44.410
it's going to be there for the rest of time.

478
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:49.480
It will be part of your library will be part of your historical output and you

479
00:28:49.481 --> 00:28:54.481
will attract people who are anxious to see what you are going to come up with

480
00:28:54.491 --> 00:28:55.324
next.

481
00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:59.410
And as soon as they are that they're willing to pay for that the to a certain

482
00:28:59.411 --> 00:29:02.770
degree.
So,
uh,
I mean you,
you will be able to,

483
00:29:02.771 --> 00:29:07.690
anybody who does it in as good as it and pursues it will be able to attract not

484
00:29:07.691 --> 00:29:08.920
only the audience,

485
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:13.390
but some ways out there seeking to have an alliance with you because they want

486
00:29:13.391 --> 00:29:17.620
good content and they want,
they want to take it up to whatever the next level.

487
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:22.830
So I would say there's no individual path to quote unquote legitimate cinema

488
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.630
because what's,

489
00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.630
what's the difference between someone who never goes to the movies,

490
00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:31.990
but it says watches everything on either their phone or their,
their,

491
00:29:31.991 --> 00:29:34.510
their laptop.
The different,
there is no difference,

492
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.660
are seeking entertainment and they want good entertainment and they want to be

493
00:29:37.661 --> 00:29:42.100
inspired by what you do.
So the answer is just keep doing it and it's going

494
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.170
<v 0>to happen.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Great.</v>

495
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:48.910
Thank you all so much.
We're running out of time,

496
00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:52.520
but a really big round of applause for Tom

497
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.840
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
