1
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.533
Whoa.

2
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.660
<v 1>Switch these at.
This is where we're doing it.</v>

3
00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:28.730
A little more column will sit on a wallet.

4
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.150
<v 2>Uh,
hello everyone.
Welcome t toxic Google today.</v>

5
00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:37.720
It is my pleasure to welcome the cast of Independence Day.
Resurgence.

6
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.850
We have bill Pullman.
We have Jessie usher,

7
00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:42.310
we have Liam Hemsworth and we have Jeff Goldblum.

8
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.903
<v 0>Hello.</v>

9
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.090
<v 2>Thank you all for being here.
Um,
smiley faces,
Smiley faces almost.</v>

10
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.830
So happy.
I'm going to start with Jeff and bill.

11
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.600
What's it like to be back?

12
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.640
<v 1>Yeah.
Oh,
you were looking at him.
Oh Man.
I can hear.
Ah,
fantastic.
Fantastic,</v>

13
00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:11.810
fantastic.
Mm hmm.
Because of the,

14
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.330
because of some of the new,
uh,
fantastic people in the cast,
uh,

15
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:21.230
besides,
um,
and science,
some of the returnees.
Uh,
there is,

16
00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:24.590
Judd Hirsch in the latter category still plays my father.

17
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.360
Those are Charlotte to gardens.
Boy,

18
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.680
do you know that actress Charlotte Gainsbourg?
Do you know her?
Wonderful.

19
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:34.580
She started my love interest and,
uh,
the,
the,
the theme,
the themes are more clear.

20
00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:39.500
It seems to me than ever a strength in cooperative diversity.
Mm.

21
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.990
The foolishness of,
uh,

22
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.250
of an arms race and the futility of it.
And,
um,

23
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.720
and then the triumph of human ingenuity,
intelligence,

24
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.250
courage and science.
And it's all funny here and there,
or are you think of that?

25
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.450
That's why I'm happy to read that

26
00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.940
<v 0>Mk</v>

27
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.990
<v 1>drive safely.
See you later.
But thank you.
I'll be in the green room.
That's it.</v>

28
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.970
See why I said let him go.
That's a torrent of information.
Sorry.

29
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:10.640
I apologize.
It googled the chip.
Yeah.
But,
uh,

30
00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:14.330
it's been a really great thing to come back to this movie.
And,
uh,

31
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.680
I think having the new energy of another younger generation,

32
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:22.460
we have our children basically.
And as we know,

33
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.140
the future we borrow from our children.
And so,
uh,

34
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.200
the fight to preserve what we have and to continue as a race is important,

35
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:36.710
not just for ourselves,
but for the children.
Here they are,

36
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.790
I believe the children.

37
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.033
So

38
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.660
<v 2>speaking of that,
I won't call them children,
but of the new comers to this,
um,</v>

39
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.461
leave.
And Jessie,

40
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:54.780
did you get any valuable advice going into this whole adventure about stepping

41
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:55.614
into this

42
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.100
<v 1>man?
It was,
you know,
a few times from,
from everyone.</v>

43
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.630
<v 3>I kind of just heard in their own way,</v>

44
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:04.090
everyone kind of telling me to just buckle up because it's going to be,
you know,

45
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.871
a roller coaster.

46
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:08.200
It's going to be a whirlwind and just be ready for what's to come,
you know,

47
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:12.250
to try to understand what role and tells you when he's directing you as best as

48
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:13.480
you can and just go from there.

49
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.030
<v 4>Yeah,
I mean it wasn't a thing specifically that I,</v>

50
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.570
that I'm retired from these two individuals,
but,
uh,

51
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.930
just working with them every day was,
you know,

52
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:30.030
I didn't have a lot to do with bill.
We had one or two scenes together.
Um,

53
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.210
but I like him a lot.
He's a really great guy,

54
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.860
very nice guy.
And,
and I've been a huge fan of him ever since.

55
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:43.180
The first one and spice balls was also one of my favorite films.

56
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.490
Let's talk about it.
No,
but I,

57
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:51.850
I do love both of these people and,
and you know,
it's been a,

58
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.530
it's been a great time working with Jeff.
I had a lot of times with Jeff and uh,

59
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.470
yeah,
it's been,
it's been really fun.
I love you too.

60
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.840
<v 3>Uh,
what can you tell us about your characters?</v>

61
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.360
<v 4>Uh,
I play a fighter pilot and,
uh,</v>

62
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.770
my character makes a bad decision early on in this story,
um,

63
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.780
and almost get someone killed.
And,
uh,
he's a,
he's very impulsive guy.

64
00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:21.350
Someone who,
who he lost his parents in the first attack,

65
00:04:21.351 --> 00:04:25.250
so he's an orphan and,
uh,
you know,

66
00:04:25.251 --> 00:04:29.570
he's kind of why did his whole life for these islands to come back and,
and,

67
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.470
you know,
make a difference in this situation.
And,
um,
yeah,

68
00:04:33.471 --> 00:04:34.720
he makes a bad decision and,

69
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:38.930
and gets his wings clipped and is sent to the moon as punishment.

70
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.490
Uh,
is,
is,

71
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.320
is kind of forced to work as somewhat of a forklift driver,

72
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.540
but on the moon driving a moon tug,

73
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.090
which is not very exciting for a fighter pilot,

74
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.570
but that's what my character is doing at this point in the story.
Um,

75
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.970
and then a lot out a lot,

76
00:04:55.971 --> 00:04:59.750
all that stuff happens off to that the aliens come back and,
you know,

77
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.580
a bunch of stuff happens.
Character has to rise to the situation.

78
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:05.683
Very well put.

79
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.330
<v 3>Jesse,
what about you?
Can you,
uh,
yeah,</v>

80
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.290
my character was introduced in the first film.
Um,

81
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.870
and then now he is 20 years older.
He is a Dylan Hiller,

82
00:05:15.871 --> 00:05:17.550
the son of Steven Hiller and Jasmine,

83
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.990
which is played by will Smith and Vivica Fox.
Um,
so now,
you know,

84
00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:25.770
my character has come up and he's sort of following in dad's footsteps.

85
00:05:25.771 --> 00:05:27.690
He's also a fighter pilot.
Uh,

86
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:32.550
he had a very heated encounter with this young man right to my left.

87
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:33.571
Um,
you know,

88
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:37.050
and it creates a very interesting dynamic between these two characters that

89
00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:40.050
Kinda just gets worked out throughout the story.
And you know,

90
00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:41.580
like it says a whole lot happens,

91
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.920
<v 4>the,
you know,</v>

92
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.130
that

93
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.330
<v 3>kind of stuff.
You know what I mean to that?
Yeah.</v>

94
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.330
I'm really excited for the subtitles to have to translate what I was going to be

95
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:57.100
great.
They let me do it.
It's gonna be great.
Um,
so this movie,

96
00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.310
the,
the events

97
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.230
<v 2>of the first film are a huge spectacle and the events surrounding the film and</v>

98
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:05.390
making the film seemed to be a huge spectacle as well.

99
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.370
And I'd imagine filmmaking itself has changed a lot in the last 20 years.
Um,

100
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.140
for those of you returning,
what was it like to sort of step,

101
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.860
did things change or was it just sort of like stepping into,
you know,

102
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:18.920
easy old role and we're rolling again or,

103
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.470
<v 5>or was it a whole new experience?
I was expecting a lot more toys,</v>

104
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:29.360
but uh,
and things that you would,
uh,
have never seen before.
But uh,

105
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.200
you know,
when we did the first one,
it was kind of old technology.

106
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:38.060
We made a lot of things happen with the Rowan's visual effects guide who was

107
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:43.030
from Germany and they were using a lot of old style,
uh,
uh,

108
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.640
all the fighting things were shot with a dye Arama that was on hydraulic lifts

109
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:51.300
that would move the desert up,
the pictures of the desert.

110
00:06:51.301 --> 00:06:53.640
So a year and a fighter plane new,
you're not moving,
but the,

111
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.780
the whole big 90 feet is going up and down.

112
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.730
This time we go to the largest sound stage in North America in Albuquerque,

113
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:03.350
48,000 square feet.

114
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.700
And you go into this big huge room and it's just an empty room with blue walls

115
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:11.300
and blue ceiling and so that they could put it all in later.

116
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.830
And so suddenly the coolest thing you see is a Humvee jeep that's coming up the

117
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:20.600
tarmac to a fragment of a plane.
That's just the door.
Cause that's all you need.

118
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:25.220
They're going to do the rest later.
So in a way it's a little less but a lot,

119
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.110
a lot more.
Once you say Jeff,
a little less for us,

120
00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:34.190
but later on it looks great for us.
It's not at all right.
Then you go,

121
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:37.490
you walk around or you were watching the monitors and they have the instant

122
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.940
ability to put in all the background and they're feeding all the plate shots in

123
00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:42.820
there and suddenly you realize,
oh wait.

124
00:07:42.821 --> 00:07:47.690
And they'd asked me to duck my head is because there is a 70 foot airplane above

125
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:48.680
my head,
you know?

126
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:53.681
So in a way it's more intimate I found because it's a lot more like theater when

127
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.600
somebody comes walking up to you,

128
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.430
there's not a lot of information visually around them.
It's just the person.

129
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:06.330
And for this movie,
I think,
uh,
everybody thinks their own movies,

130
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.100
the most special movie,
but for us that were part of the first one,

131
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.200
it was like a family experience.

132
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.190
There's a lot of soul in the movie that's about popcorn movie.

133
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.200
And I think when Rowan went to cast the next generation,

134
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:25.490
he looked for people that were not only good actors but had some soul.
So,

135
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.670
you know,
it's a great thing for the story,

136
00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:32.930
I think to be having that kind of intimacy in the way that you relate to each

137
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:36.380
other.
And so the,
all the special effects actually that could put in later,

138
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:39.350
you know,
don't,
don't get it in a way of making a human story.

139
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.170
Well put.
Well I stopped the show.
Yeah.
Yeah.

140
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.030
<v 2>All right.
We're done.
Great.
Thanks guys.
Um,</v>

141
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.120
I mean none of you are sort of strangers to that special effects,

142
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:55.740
big blockbuster world,
but was there,
you know,
you've,
you've on it a little bit.

143
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:59.220
Was there anything for you guys that you were surprised about filming this,

144
00:08:59.221 --> 00:08:59.790
that you were like,

145
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.750
I did not think it was going to be this either taxing or physically demanding,

146
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:04.973
you know,

147
00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.790
<v 4>um,
these guys are vets.</v>

148
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.450
This was like my first time dealing with a lot of what we did on,
you know,

149
00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:15.050
on this set.
And I think the day that we kind of went,

150
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.910
I don't want to give away too much,
but you know,
we,

151
00:09:16.911 --> 00:09:19.910
we go to an outer worldly place and it's,

152
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.300
it's almost like a jungle gym that's been covered in like blue paint in like

153
00:09:23.301 --> 00:09:24.260
blue tape and stuff.

154
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.560
And the activities that took place in that area was way more exhausting than I

155
00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:34.820
thought.
It was.
Like I felt like I was training to be a seal or like,
I dunno,

156
00:09:34.821 --> 00:09:38.840
something,
it was crazy.
Like,
and then of course Roldan wants to do 500 takes.

157
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.920
I was in the best shape of my life by the time we finished that scene.

158
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.800
Man,
he knows what I'm talking about.

159
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:54.700
Roland likes to do a lot of takes.
Um,
I,
uh,
I,

160
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:59.450
I,
you know,
uh,
he's,
I love Roland.
He's easy,
great guy,
really nice guy.
And,

161
00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:03.800
and someone who I've been a big fan on for a long time,
but um,

162
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.770
does more takes than anyone I've worked with,
which is a good,

163
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.940
is a great thing because it,
it,
you know,
for,
for actors,

164
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:15.410
you get this huge playground too.
Just trying to think you want,
you know,

165
00:10:15.411 --> 00:10:16.670
and you get the time and,

166
00:10:16.671 --> 00:10:21.110
and you know the takes to do it again and then because you get the freedom to do

167
00:10:21.111 --> 00:10:25.580
that,
you know,
you really have just,
you know,
you can try anything.

168
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.080
And now that was what,
that's what's great about rolling.

169
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.510
He really gives you the freedom,
you know,

170
00:10:29.511 --> 00:10:33.980
and a lot of the time you do five or six takes and he doesn't actually come up

171
00:10:33.981 --> 00:10:37.260
and really give you any direction.
So you kind of like,
we're doing another one.

172
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.050
Alright,
cool.
Any notes?
I just do another one.
All right.

173
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.690
I'll just do it a completely different way,
I guess.
You know,

174
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.570
you kind of give your own direction,
but you know,
every now and then if he,

175
00:10:47.571 --> 00:10:49.370
if he feels like there's something that's missing,

176
00:10:49.371 --> 00:10:53.060
he'll come up and tell you something.
But he really gives the act of the,
the,
the,

177
00:10:53.061 --> 00:10:56.820
the freedom to try what they want to do and explore different ideas.
And,

178
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.360
and that's that,
that,
that was what,

179
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.840
what was great about this process or sometimes you remember that day that we

180
00:11:02.841 --> 00:11:06.110
were,
we have a scene,
I don't want to give it away,
but you've,

181
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.680
you've talked about it.
We're on the,
we go to the moon together,
the Earth's moon.

182
00:11:09.681 --> 00:11:12.800
We go to the moon and we're on the moon.
In the sound stage.

183
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.670
We're pretending to be on the moon in these,
in these very expensive,
uh,

184
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.270
as it turns out,
the moonshine go suits.
You know,
we're in Windsor.
You've,

185
00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:23.840
we've seen it.
If you've seen the trailer,
you see us in those suits.

186
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.320
And so we were doing these takes.
That's right.
And we would work sometimes 16,

187
00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:31.700
17 hour day is not the,
finally,
it's a peevish to complain.
But you know,
I did,

188
00:11:31.701 --> 00:11:33.020
can feel strenuous sometimes,

189
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.710
but I like to get a direction and I would ask you for direction.
Yes,
I'll hammer.

190
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.160
He would,
he would just say,
yeah,
do another one.
And I would say,
Hey,

191
00:11:40.161 --> 00:11:43.180
you tell me before we do another one,
what should I do on this one?

192
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:44.090
I'll do anything you say.

193
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.900
I directed Jeff Goldbloom and has felt it was very good at acting.

194
00:11:47.901 --> 00:11:50.360
So if you think he's a really good actor in this,

195
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.500
particularly better than anything else,
you've seen him.
It's because me,

196
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.860
he pulled that performance out of me.
I did it.
Yeah,
he's a,
yeah.
I said,
uh,

197
00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.640
Sharlto gardens borrow it gives in the thing.
He says,

198
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:04.750
turn around and you're supposed to do something.
Find gesture to maybe Jeff.

199
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:09.700
He said,
uh,
yeah,
this one turned around and go,
hm.
I like that.

200
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:14.710
I said,
okay,
watch this.
Let's go.
Rolling.
I'm ready.
Right.
And a action.
Okay.

201
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.910
And we did.
Then we did a few more and then Roland came back.
He said,
well,

202
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.540
what was that one where you did that?
No,
know.
Yeah,
no,

203
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.250
I didn't bust him.
And I didn't say,
well that was his idea.

204
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:26.340
<v 2>Yeah,
no,</v>

205
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:32.230
it seems like you guys had a lot of fun going into this.
Uh,
did,

206
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:36.220
did you guys do anything in sort of the prep leading up to starting filming to

207
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:38.770
sort of get to know each other?
Or is it just sort of let's dive in.

208
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.150
We're all in this together.

209
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.061
<v 4>You know,
we did,
we,</v>

210
00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:45.720
we didn't have a lot of time before this that we shot together.
I mean,
it's,

211
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.270
every project is different and sometimes you have a lot of time to rehearse

212
00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:51.760
things and get to know people.
This wasn't one of those,

213
00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:56.600
we kind of jumped right into it.
Yeah,
I think.
Um,
but,
but you know,

214
00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:00.520
I,
like I said,
I didn't,
I didn't have a lot to do with,
with bill in this film,

215
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:05.450
but I still love him just as much.
I don't want to exclude him in any way,
but,

216
00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:09.940
but I worked with Jeff a lot and um,
yeah,
no,
we had a great time together.

217
00:13:09.941 --> 00:13:13.920
I was just thrilled to,
to watch someone like Jeff Goldblum and,

218
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.770
and see how he works and how he does things.
Just charged your,
your fantastic.

219
00:13:17.771 --> 00:13:18.760
He's really fantastic.

220
00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:22.720
And those are not just show business now let me embarrass you.
But uh,
yeah.

221
00:13:22.721 --> 00:13:27.190
Fantastic.
So gifted and sweet as you can tell.
You know,

222
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.710
which I Johnny,
lovely man.

223
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:35.220
<v 2>Yeah.
Bill my card.</v>

224
00:13:35.221 --> 00:13:38.460
I'm going to assume that term limits still apply in the universe.

225
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.280
This takes place in so that you are no longer president.

226
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.180
<v 4>But uh,
you know when you're well,
you know one in calls,
Bill Clinton,</v>

227
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.650
Ex President Bill Clinton.

228
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:51.380
<v 2>This is true,
but does this mean zero?
That's true.</v>

229
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.400
<v 4>Oh,
I'm still president Whitmore yes to the world.
But I,
uh,
I,</v>

230
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.410
I think all of us,

231
00:13:58.411 --> 00:14:03.120
we're really glad that the only pre shooting thing that I did was with the

232
00:14:03.121 --> 00:14:05.040
writers and Roland and we all did that.

233
00:14:05.041 --> 00:14:08.340
It was very unusual for a big blockbuster movie to him.

234
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.570
But it's because Rowan's position in the industry that he's got a lot of
control.

235
00:14:12.571 --> 00:14:16.050
So he invites us all because he is willing,
he has no fear.

236
00:14:16.051 --> 00:14:20.550
So he is no actor's going to say something that's going to disrupt the best

237
00:14:20.551 --> 00:14:24.000
movie that he wants to make.
So we all went in there and he asked us,

238
00:14:24.001 --> 00:14:28.470
what do you think this character is or what would juice you up?
And,
uh,
so,

239
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.940
you know,
and I thought I had,
uh,
uh,

240
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.590
all of us feel like we got a chance to kind of take the characters in a

241
00:14:34.591 --> 00:14:38.130
different way.
So even though we're coming back,
you know,
for me,

242
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.520
I was the one that had the most intense contact with aliens in the first one in

243
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:47.010
the we mind melded,

244
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.430
which I know you do that at Google a lot,

245
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.140
but it was hard on me with an alien.
And,
uh,

246
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:59.090
it ended up being a little bit like PTSD where you function for awhile when

247
00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:02.870
you're back and then the symptoms start to come in.
By the time 20 years later,

248
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:07.820
I'm an embarrassment and shuttled away and taken care of by my daughter.

249
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.870
And so my thing is that I've,
you know,

250
00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:14.260
I get accused of being paranoid in it at,

251
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.130
because I view him having premonitions they're coming back.

252
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.440
And these people don't think so.

253
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.540
It was an interesting character and very different than the first one.

254
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.471
<v 2>Jeff,</v>

255
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:30.830
did your character with somebody very immersed in technology and sort of at the

256
00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:32.900
forefront of it at the time,
do you think?

257
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.880
Or can you tell us if the events of it either led him to engage more in trying

258
00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:41.870
to,
you know,
keep a lookout or just kind of abandoned ship and be like,

259
00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:44.840
I don't want to deal with this anymore.
I don't want to,
you know,

260
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.190
you get to live in a hut in the desert.

261
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.480
<v 4>Very interesting question.
Yeah.
Um,
the,</v>

262
00:15:48.481 --> 00:15:51.700
and I'm glad you mentioned that about those writers.
I,
that,
that,
that's right.

263
00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:53.790
That is a nice word.
Was a lovely part of this.
Felt,

264
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.280
felt very creative and independent film me or something or very trusting and,
uh,

265
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.220
we were able to make a contribution.
We met with,

266
00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:05.200
I had long meetings with Nick Wright and James A.
Woods,
the other James A.
Woods,

267
00:16:05.201 --> 00:16:07.480
but they're both actors also when they act parts in the movie,

268
00:16:07.481 --> 00:16:09.430
you'll see them in the movie.
But anyway,
they had,

269
00:16:09.431 --> 00:16:13.930
those were wonderful sessions with the writers are my character.
Uh,

270
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:19.090
um,
was,
was a,
is asked to and takes on the task of,
uh,

271
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:24.080
being a,
uh,
in a leadership position,
uh,

272
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.700
for the earth space defense in case they come back.
Uh,

273
00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:31.270
and so technology is,

274
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.150
is what I know and a,
and I have a lot to do with rebuilding,
uh,

275
00:16:37.151 --> 00:16:40.330
over these 20 years,
you know,
much was destroyed,
many people were lost,

276
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.430
but also in building a weaponry,
uh,

277
00:16:44.431 --> 00:16:49.431
and war strategies that might anticipate what we could be faced with if and when

278
00:16:50.081 --> 00:16:54.460
they come back.
So,
uh,
even though you're right,
it's not my,

279
00:16:54.461 --> 00:16:59.140
it's not what I imagined myself David Levinson doing.

280
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:04.470
I was a person not of self glory or spotlight or a,

281
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.830
um,
or war.
I think I,

282
00:17:08.831 --> 00:17:12.240
my character probably would have been environmental.
Uh,

283
00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:17.020
they're very green in one way or another and uh,
anti a war.

284
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.150
But the events happened,

285
00:17:19.151 --> 00:17:23.650
has happened 20 years ago and here I am in this position and that kind of tees

286
00:17:23.651 --> 00:17:27.520
up and sets up what's about to happen when it's probably no surprise.

287
00:17:27.521 --> 00:17:31.670
They do come back.
Spoiler alert.
Yeah.

288
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:38.010
<v 2>So Jesse,
Jesse,
Jessie,
Atlanta.
I'm curious if Jesse,</v>

289
00:17:38.011 --> 00:17:41.520
your character is sort of exists in the first film and you know,

290
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.230
it's not quite a developed character but,

291
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.880
but were you at all intimidated by the opportunity to kind of create a part of

292
00:17:47.881 --> 00:17:52.500
this legacy?
I mean,
the film is huge.
We were having another one in,
it's like,

293
00:17:52.501 --> 00:17:54.630
people want it to another one.
We're getting it other way.
It took a little while,

294
00:17:54.631 --> 00:17:58.820
but we're getting it.
We move.
Uh,
what,
uh,
you know,

295
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:59.970
how did you feel going into it?

296
00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:06.190
<v 3>Ah,
it's static.
You know,
I wasn't necessarily intimidated.
Um,
the way that,</v>

297
00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.710
you know,
these guys are so supportive of us,

298
00:18:08.711 --> 00:18:11.260
like coming in and being a part of this film,
you know,
and,

299
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:15.000
and that was more uplifting and it,
it gave us,
you know,

300
00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.500
a sense of comfortability and,
you know,

301
00:18:17.501 --> 00:18:21.640
we felt like we could bring something new in the aisle.
You know,

302
00:18:21.641 --> 00:18:25.270
we're very open to any ideas that we had and Roland and the writers and

303
00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.051
everybody's,
well you know,

304
00:18:26.051 --> 00:18:28.720
like they were saying before that we had these sessions would be sit down and

305
00:18:28.721 --> 00:18:31.690
just talk to them and they would listen to us.
Which you know,

306
00:18:31.691 --> 00:18:35.680
it just makes you feel like okay you guys have this thing that's on this,

307
00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:39.370
you know its pedestal and you're trusting my opinion with it.

308
00:18:39.371 --> 00:18:43.420
So it makes you feel,
you know,
comfortable,
you feel good.

309
00:18:43.421 --> 00:18:47.560
So it wasn't necessarily intimidating at all.
It was,

310
00:18:47.561 --> 00:18:50.740
it was just more of a,
you know,
the appreciation to be

311
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:55.920
<v 4>a part of.
Yeah.
I mean I look,</v>

312
00:18:55.921 --> 00:18:59.490
I coming in to the hunger games for instance,
right,

313
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.570
where you have a huge fan base,
which is the equivalent of something like this.

314
00:19:03.571 --> 00:19:05.040
We've already got a huge fan base.

315
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.730
As an actor I don't feel like you worry about the sorts of things.

316
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:10.560
Like is it going to be a good movie?
I mean you,

317
00:19:10.561 --> 00:19:13.880
you focused on the work you have to do there and,
and you know,

318
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.410
hopefully you have a great director,

319
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.410
someone who can lead the whole cast in the right direction.

320
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.650
And I think that takes a lot of the pressure off and you don't,

321
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.620
you don't so much think about those sort of things.
You know,

322
00:19:25.621 --> 00:19:28.760
you get to set and you're doing your job and,
and for me,
I,
I,

323
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:33.450
I love that part of this world.
I love making movies.

324
00:19:33.451 --> 00:19:37.830
I love the whole collaboration of people coming together to make something

325
00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:41.280
special.
And,
and like I said,
hopefully you have a great leader that,
that,

326
00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:44.250
that you know,
can steer you in the right direction and a,

327
00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:47.730
and you don't need to worry about the,
the sort of,
you know,

328
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.170
the grand a picture of it all.

329
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.710
<v 2>Would it be fair to say it's more about taking a,</v>

330
00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.660
a great role and not worrying about you because you already know what's going to

331
00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:57.510
be a great movie like picking based on it.
Yeah.

332
00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.540
I think also we're going to take audience questions in a second.

333
00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:04.340
If anyone wants to line up Mike's back there.
Um,
but my,

334
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:09.000
my question to you is if,
if aliens actually came to the universe we live in,
uh,

335
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.950
what,
what would your reaction be?

336
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:18.380
<v 3>Nowhere near what Dylan's reaction was.
I mean,
he was ready to go.</v>

337
00:20:18.381 --> 00:20:22.250
A Jesse personally,
I would need to think about it.
You know,

338
00:20:22.251 --> 00:20:25.100
I need to evaluate the situation.
I need to see what's happening.

339
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.770
I need to know if they're bigger than I am.
And then you know,

340
00:20:27.771 --> 00:20:28.750
we can go from there.
Okay.

341
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.390
<v 2>We like that to Google evaluating the</v>

342
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.500
<v 3>part about these things.
You can't just go in.
I don't know what they know.</v>

343
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.980
<v 2>That's true.
That's true.
Anybody else prepared for extraterrestrial contact or</v>

344
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:47.740
<v 3>shoot?
Now ask questions later.
Smart way to go.
Yeah.</v>

345
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.100
<v 1>I think we'll take our first audience question.
All right.
This is for everyone.</v>

346
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.370
Uh,
if you can work at Google,
what team would you want to work on?

347
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:59.860
What are the options?
I mean,
I don't know.
Search,

348
00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:04.120
maths,
chrome,
g-mail,
android,
self driving cars.

349
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.233
I been,

350
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.320
I don't know if this is a rival thing and I might be saying the wrong thing.

351
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:12.820
Right.
I've been to the other side of town.
Where the face,

352
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:16.000
is it the Facebook?
Nope.
Nope,
nope.

353
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.080
I got a great outdoor situation.
I don't know if it's the same here.

354
00:21:20.081 --> 00:21:25.000
I haven't explored this area,
but I would love to do any job if,

355
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.500
if it's like Facebook.

356
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.180
This talk is over.
Thanks so much for joining.

357
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.950
We have outdoor space too.

358
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.900
I don't know what position,
what position do you take part in?
Uh,

359
00:21:43.901 --> 00:21:47.690
I'm a software engineer on Youtube.
That sounds complicated.
How do you,

360
00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.090
do you guys have all the really cool cafes and stuff that Facebook has sleep.

361
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.020
You got that?
I'm there.
I'll do anything.
I'll be a Janet.

362
00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.100
I'll do anything you want.

363
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:01.020
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

364
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:05.370
<v 1>so they do use youtube.
Youtube is all you guys,
right?
Call us.
Yeah.
Wow.</v>

365
00:22:05.371 --> 00:22:09.750
Well I go on the youtube alive.
I love it.

366
00:22:09.751 --> 00:22:13.710
That's one of the one,
one of my preferred learning tools.
Ooh.

367
00:22:13.711 --> 00:22:17.150
One to another and then this suggests that and I'm lost in there for awhile.

368
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.160
Yeah,
I love it.
We are always delighted to hear user story.

369
00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:23.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

370
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.700
<v 2>So,
uh,
Jeff,
this one's actually for you.
Yes ma'am.</v>

371
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:28.890
So speaking of Youtube,

372
00:22:28.891 --> 00:22:33.510
have you seen the youtube clips of you would making ads where like they slow you

373
00:22:33.511 --> 00:22:35.060
down really?
And you just sound really weird.
Yeah.

374
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:39.760
<v 1>Hilarious.
Yes,
I have.
And it said Drunk Jeff Goldblum right.</v>

375
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.073
Goals.

376
00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:42.140
<v 2>What do you think of those?</v>

377
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.360
<v 1>I like him.
I like him.
That's perfect.</v>

378
00:22:45.361 --> 00:22:48.600
So it's not hard cause I'm like drunk anyway.
I'm not,
I'm straight,

379
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.480
I'm straight as an arrow.
I don't,
I don't drink.

380
00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:55.710
But we did this thing and I was looking on TV yesterday and saw as played back

381
00:22:55.711 --> 00:22:59.340
on the NFL.
We were outside doing something and I don't know what got into me.

382
00:22:59.341 --> 00:23:03.060
I was listening to the music and I had the music going on in me and I looked at

383
00:23:03.061 --> 00:23:05.640
it,
I thought you goofball what?
You look entirely dry.

384
00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.970
And sure enough people said,
is he drunk?
Oh yeah,
he's on something.

385
00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:13.971
So it doesn't take much a post production to make me look like an idiot,

386
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.590
you know?
And then,
yes.

387
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.050
<v 2>So then stemming off of that,
you do like,</v>

388
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.800
you play a lot of really like weird characters like Tim and Eric and Portlandia.

389
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.950
Have you ever played one that like just made you feel uncomfortable like that it

390
00:23:25.951 --> 00:23:26.880
was just too strange?

391
00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:30.203
<v 0>Nope.</v>

392
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:32.830
<v 1>Yeah.
Yes,
yes,</v>

393
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.200
<v 2>yes.
Define.</v>

394
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:43.030
<v 1>Yeah,
like why you're like,
why?</v>

395
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.060
Well,
I mean,

396
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.680
I gave him a big invitation.
It's going to take some time.

397
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.770
Yeah.
I mean I,
if something is,
if somebody says,
oh yeah,

398
00:23:54.771 --> 00:23:58.130
you're strange and we're looking for a strange guy and here's a part and we want

399
00:23:58.131 --> 00:24:01.250
you to be strange or do another take and make it really strange and weird.

400
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.910
It might depending on the situation or the care,
but mostly I'm like,

401
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:09.020
I don't think you've understood my,
at least what I enjoy about my own,

402
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.810
imagined what I do.

403
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.160
I wouldn't say that I'm strange or weird,

404
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.850
but now that I'm tear myself talking,
I'm probably,

405
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:24.080
I'm not exactly regular either.
Emma,
you're never mind.
You're unique.

406
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.010
You don't do that.

407
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.080
You do things in it different way and it's unique and it comes from the most

408
00:24:28.081 --> 00:24:32.210
loving place you do.
It's true.
It's a great guy.

409
00:24:32.211 --> 00:24:34.990
He's a really great,
great Greg.
Thank you.
Very,
very.

410
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:40.680
Hi,
this is for all of you.
If you were in a superhero movie,

411
00:24:40.681 --> 00:24:43.290
what character or superpower would you want to have?

412
00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:46.630
<v 0>Don't know.</v>

413
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:51.150
<v 5>I used to say teleportation like instantly,
but I don't know,</v>

414
00:24:51.151 --> 00:24:54.720
a lot of the new superhero movies kind of make superpowers that I never really

415
00:24:54.721 --> 00:24:57.630
thought were that cool.
Seemed way cooler these days.
So I don't,

416
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.220
I don't know that,
I mean,

417
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.060
I think the time in my life when I felt most like a superhero,

418
00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:11.360
and I'd like to get back to that time was when you're younger is when you have

419
00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:17.511
most of your levitation dreams and all of you are probably still having them,

420
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.520
but it's a phenomena that you lose it.

421
00:25:20.521 --> 00:25:23.580
But one of the greatest thing isn't a very fast action thing,

422
00:25:23.581 --> 00:25:27.690
but it's when you just start floating up through the staircase of your house and

423
00:25:27.691 --> 00:25:31.800
then you've float through the windows and you float into the tree that's next

424
00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.310
year house.
And uh,
I come on,
you've all

425
00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.093
<v 1>out of the house.</v>

426
00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:43.240
<v 5>Well,
it's a very unsexy thing to float,
but a,</v>

427
00:25:43.241 --> 00:25:47.760
and I don't know whether I'd make the marvel superheroes as a floater,
but,
uh,

428
00:25:47.761 --> 00:25:51.160
that's what I'd like to do.
The floater.
A floating man.
Yeah.

429
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:54.533
<v 0>Thank you.</v>

430
00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.090
<v 1>Hi.
Um,
my questions for Jeff.
Um,</v>

431
00:25:59.091 --> 00:26:03.620
so growing up I watched Jurassic Park and had lots of nightmares.
Um,
I'm sorry,

432
00:26:03.621 --> 00:26:05.810
I'm sorry.
So I just wanted to know,

433
00:26:05.811 --> 00:26:09.290
like what are your thoughts on the new drastic world and would doctor Malcolm

434
00:26:09.291 --> 00:26:13.110
ever go back?
I didn't see them too.

435
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:18.010
I haven't seen the new,
I,
I know,
I'm waiting to see.
I had a baby.

436
00:26:18.011 --> 00:26:19.510
We had,
you know,
we had a,

437
00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:22.330
we've been working on the movies 60 to 79 and then in the middle of it on

438
00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:26.460
Independence Day,
July 4th,
I had my first child,
Maddie's baby on independence,

439
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.880
independence day,
and Forrester.
I think it just came naturally.
We,

440
00:26:30.881 --> 00:26:33.820
so just yesterday was the fourth,
right?
Where he was just seventh month,

441
00:26:33.821 --> 00:26:37.420
the birthday in any case.
What was I saying?
Oh yeah.
So no,
I haven't seen it.

442
00:26:37.421 --> 00:26:42.340
I want to see it.
Is it good?
You'll love it.
I want to go see it.
Yeah,
let's not,

443
00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.930
let's talk about the fact that you had your baby on independence day.

444
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.790
I seen sign.
What about that?
I know that the chances of that actually happened.

445
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:49.920
Well,

446
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.190
I'd never been through it before noon and my wife Emily and the doctor said,
Oh,

447
00:26:53.191 --> 00:26:54.420
here's the due date,

448
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.950
July 4th and it was the drug but make no mistake and that's kind of a couple of

449
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:03.420
weeks here or there either side.
That's what usually happens.
But sure enough,
she,

450
00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:07.950
you know,
midnight happened on the third turning into the fourth and she said,

451
00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:10.590
I think,
uh,
I think something's happening.

452
00:27:10.591 --> 00:27:14.100
And I had made sure and the production very generously made sure I was home,

453
00:27:14.101 --> 00:27:16.920
you know,
back from Albuquerque and that I had a.
Dot.
And she,

454
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.410
she started to do the thing

455
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.600
and he slipped.
He popped out.
Yeah.
There are about six that morning,

456
00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:26.880
make a speech at it.
Was it about this day and

457
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.960
this day
you will come.
You will.

458
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.390
We'll make it out there.

459
00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:44.120
Hey guys,
this question is also for Jeff Mine

460
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:50.340
on behalf of a couple of friends,
Steve and Gary,
that they asked the question,

461
00:27:50.341 --> 00:27:53.700
if you could get the whole cast of Buckaroo Banzai back together,

462
00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:57.420
would there be part two and perhaps another dimension?

463
00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:00.820
Thank you.
Well,
eight dimensions was the one in that.

464
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.750
I have a fondness for that movie and I know there's other,

465
00:28:03.751 --> 00:28:07.690
some devoted followers to it.
They had some ideas about it.
It,
you know,

466
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:11.940
in any way.
Yes,
I would.
Peter Weller,
uh,
I've stayed in touch with,

467
00:28:11.941 --> 00:28:14.880
he started the band that I'm in.
I'm going to,
I haven't,
I'm gonna Bet Jesus.

468
00:28:14.881 --> 00:28:16.680
What happened?
I'm getting too excited.

469
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.750
I'm in a band called the Mildred Snitzer orchestra.

470
00:28:18.751 --> 00:28:21.330
If you come down to la where it will Rockwell every Wednesday,

471
00:28:21.331 --> 00:28:25.890
but he started that band.
We started it together anyway.
Uh,
yeah,

472
00:28:25.891 --> 00:28:27.780
if we got together,
maybe we'd make another one of those.

473
00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:32.700
You like that you liked that movie?
You've never seen it?
Oh,

474
00:28:32.701 --> 00:28:36.660
this is just Steven Gary talking there.
Okay.
I will tell him how I tell him.

475
00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:40.950
All right.
Hey guys,
I'm gonna bring us back to independence day

476
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:43.980
as much as I love you Jeff Goldbloom.

477
00:28:43.981 --> 00:28:46.050
And this question actually comes from a big fan of yours.

478
00:28:46.051 --> 00:28:49.020
She has a shirt with your face on it that's also shirtless switch.

479
00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:53.520
It's very interesting.
Uh,
but my question for each of you is,

480
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.340
um,
if you were stranded on an alien planet,

481
00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.620
which of your cast mates would you bring with you and why?

482
00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.300
From this moving.
Okay,
wait,
I have a followup question.
Is it,

483
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.520
is it the character or is it like that the real,
like the real person.

484
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.060
Okay.
Like present time.
Cause Liam as an injured back.

485
00:29:12.061 --> 00:29:16.140
So like that I'm a Hamam disabled.
Disabled,
right.

486
00:29:16.141 --> 00:29:17.520
They're changing so much.
I want to,

487
00:29:17.521 --> 00:29:20.640
I wanted to tell everyone before I sat down and then if I move a lot,

488
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:21.960
it's because of my back.

489
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.290
I've got a pretty serious back injury right now and that's why I'm moving.

490
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.680
We don't need to talk about it.
Let's move on.
It's boring.

491
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.980
You're rugged.
You were surfing extreme.

492
00:29:31.981 --> 00:29:34.710
He's an extreme sportsmen and you were doing extreme.

493
00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.590
I hurt my back.
I'm like a,
an old man,
the sample back.

494
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:46.090
<v 4>It's okay.
Uh,
I don't,
don't bring me to that,</v>

495
00:29:46.091 --> 00:29:48.140
to that planet because I'm not gonna do anything.

496
00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:51.740
But you could bring Brent spiner then,
you know,

497
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:56.080
be a good kind of smart guy to get a beer of your bank,
right person to bring,

498
00:29:56.081 --> 00:30:00.400
cause he's really,
really smart.
Can probably figure out.

499
00:30:00.401 --> 00:30:04.380
And it does your high desert plain or view on your planet like an Alien Planet,

500
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.900
alien planets,
uncharted territory.
We really like aliens here apparently.

501
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:13.120
I don't know Brent.
Brent spiner would be a great person at Bragg.
Um,

502
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:15.850
well yeah,

503
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:19.270
I mean if there were scientific challenges and environmental challenges,

504
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:22.720
you'd want somebody that could help you last a day or two.
But if there aren't,

505
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.820
then we're just talking about the dirty game,
you know,

506
00:30:24.821 --> 00:30:28.060
a who would you rather then?
It's,
and I can't play that.

507
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:29.500
I'm not allowed to play it.
Our conversation.

508
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:33.240
<v 0>No.
Who would you rather be?
Desert Island.</v>

509
00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.860
<v 4>I can think of something.
I'm not saying.</v>

510
00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:41.723
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

511
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.350
<v 2>Hi.
Uh,
so independence day has a,</v>

512
00:30:46.351 --> 00:30:48.360
I guess a strong Scifi component.

513
00:30:48.361 --> 00:30:52.020
There've been a lot of Scifi movies coming out lately.
Uh,

514
00:30:52.021 --> 00:30:56.290
so just wondering if sort of anything in the film jumped out as,
as you,
uh,

515
00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:00.840
in terms of being like creative or novel around how like the aliens are,

516
00:31:00.841 --> 00:31:04.380
the alien technology or just the human relationship with the aliens were

517
00:31:04.381 --> 00:31:05.214
portrayed.

518
00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.350
<v 6>Very interesting question,
Huh?</v>

519
00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:12.220
<v 4>Oh,
his birthday.
I think it is.
That's really interesting.
Yeah.</v>

520
00:31:12.221 --> 00:31:15.710
What's original and fresh about the A,
yeah,
it's a very wide open,
uh,

521
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:20.350
issue and probably we can't,
so there are some interesting,
fresh,

522
00:31:20.351 --> 00:31:23.800
unexpected,
the things about how we relate to them about them,

523
00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:27.640
about stuff we find out about who they were 20 years ago.

524
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.270
We get revelations about what they were up to,
who they were,
where they're from,

525
00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:36.070
but we proud.
That's all we can say.
You probably shouldn't tell you.

526
00:31:36.071 --> 00:31:39.280
You'll see the movie and you'll see.
You'll see.

527
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.630
<v 0>All right.</v>

528
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.470
<v 2>Very intriguing.
I was going to see it anyway,
but now I'm really cool.</v>

529
00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:47.110
<v 0>Hell yeah.
Finger.</v>

530
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:53.720
Thank you.
Yeah,

531
00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.700
<v 4>it's an interesting question.
I think we were just talking about it.</v>

532
00:31:56.701 --> 00:32:01.701
I think one could construe a Cody and far from the visitation that we find out

533
00:32:04.051 --> 00:32:04.950
things about them.

534
00:32:04.951 --> 00:32:09.951
And then these current visitors that shed light on our own.

535
00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:12.020
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

536
00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:16.460
<v 4>Situation and identities,
uh,
and uh,</v>

537
00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:21.620
and uh,
ignorances and things we need to work on.
What do you think about that?

538
00:32:21.621 --> 00:32:24.140
Almost like a young Ian Dream,
you know,

539
00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:27.770
I can say no more.

540
00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.253
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

541
00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:35.800
<v 2>Actually that's a good segue to my question.
I was just wondering,</v>

542
00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:40.550
um,
if while you're filming or after the movie's been made,

543
00:32:40.551 --> 00:32:45.551
if I'm Independence Day permeates into your dreams or aliens infiltrate your

544
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:48.320
sleep time.

545
00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:54.850
<v 4>No,
I think,
um,
for me when we were doing the film,</v>

546
00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:00.220
we spent so many hours doing the film that the sleep is like,
you know,

547
00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:01.533
it's so deep.

548
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.110
We're making up on the hours that we lost so that I don't think anything is

549
00:33:05.111 --> 00:33:08.860
infiltrating my dreams at this point is just,
it's just out cold.

550
00:33:08.861 --> 00:33:12.070
And I don't think I've had a dream about an alien since we,
since we've left,

551
00:33:12.071 --> 00:33:14.350
we saw enough of that.
I would say the complete opposite.

552
00:33:14.351 --> 00:33:18.490
I have horrific nightmares often.
Um,

553
00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.670
and during this filming I had terrible nightmares,

554
00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:26.170
particularly about you and I running from aliens.
I swear to God,
I'm not kidding.

555
00:33:26.171 --> 00:33:27.490
I honestly,
I have,

556
00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.540
I have night terrors and it's something that I should probably see a doctor

557
00:33:31.541 --> 00:33:35.680
about.
But I get sleep paralysis.
I wake up and I can't breathe.

558
00:33:35.681 --> 00:33:40.360
Sometimes man,
Jeff are running from aliens.
It's all kinds of stuff in my dreams.

559
00:33:40.361 --> 00:33:42.820
I think I have serious problems and I should say someone about it.

560
00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.630
That's the honest truth.
Oh,
those aren't problems.
No.

561
00:33:46.631 --> 00:33:48.520
We know about dreams that they give you a chance.

562
00:33:48.521 --> 00:33:53.380
Some people think to live out and siphoned off and uh,
you know,

563
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:56.710
hidden dogs in the basement,
you know,
psychologically.

564
00:33:56.711 --> 00:34:01.711
So they come to some kind of conscious light and the opportunities to see how

565
00:34:01.901 --> 00:34:03.100
they're useful,
you know?

566
00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:07.290
<v 5>Yeah.
I think,
cause we've been talking about how sometimes,
you know,
these,</v>

567
00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.350
these movies are about empirical,
you know,

568
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:14.160
chronological gathering information.
It's,
you know,

569
00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:18.630
we're sometimes in,
you know,
dream mythology is to culture,

570
00:34:18.631 --> 00:34:23.610
like dreams are to the psyche and there's certain things that get healed and are

571
00:34:23.611 --> 00:34:27.780
exposed in dreams that we can't deal with and empirically.

572
00:34:27.781 --> 00:34:32.781
So some of the best stuff I think in science fiction is stuff that really tricks

573
00:34:32.881 --> 00:34:36.040
that,
you know,
to that level of,
uh,

574
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.790
of dream awareness so that,
you know,

575
00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:43.530
probably everybody in a dream is some version of yourself.

576
00:34:43.531 --> 00:34:47.790
And there's different aspects of aliens that are,
are aspects of ourselves.

577
00:34:47.791 --> 00:34:51.330
And sometimes you can only see that in an instant,
in a dream.

578
00:34:51.331 --> 00:34:53.070
And you wake up and you had some knowledge,

579
00:34:53.071 --> 00:34:54.780
you can't quite remember what that was.

580
00:34:54.781 --> 00:34:59.070
And I hope this movie kind of has that with a little bit.
Uh,

581
00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:03.090
we,
we were saying that might be good and result.

582
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:06.070
<v 4>I like to be scared by movies.
I liked the feeling of,
you know,</v>

583
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.450
can't figure it out.
It's,
it's night.
And then I dream.
I dream a lot.

584
00:35:10.451 --> 00:35:13.540
I have recurring things of all kinds.
I'm being chased.
I'm be there,

585
00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:14.740
I'd have bad bedroom.

586
00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:19.770
<v 2>We'll take our last two questions from the audience.
First of all,</v>

587
00:35:19.771 --> 00:35:23.100
thank you so much for coming out here to Google and by the way,

588
00:35:23.101 --> 00:35:25.640
having those days.
So I'm taking as a birthday present,
right?

589
00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:26.853
<v 4>Happy Birthday.</v>

590
00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.760
<v 2>I said this is for Jeff and Phil and over the years had you been presented with</v>

591
00:35:34.191 --> 00:35:38.850
any scripts for a type of,
and if so,

592
00:35:38.851 --> 00:35:43.590
like what made this one special to make you want to be a part of it and if not,

593
00:35:43.591 --> 00:35:47.040
then again,
what?
What made it special for you to want to move forward with it?

594
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:48.230
<v 4>Right.</v>

595
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:51.430
W we weren't presented with sequels to this alternative sequels to this movie

596
00:35:51.431 --> 00:35:54.510
before this script,
do you mean,
is that what you're asking?
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh yeah,
no,

597
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.710
no.
This is the first time they said,
you know,
we've been working on it.

598
00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:59.950
Or Dean Devlin is the other creator.
They've been cooking it up and they said we,

599
00:35:59.951 --> 00:36:02.170
I think we got something a couple of years ago now.

600
00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.070
I think we got something that we couldn't show you talk to you about and that

601
00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:08.350
this was the first one,
you know,
and I was thrilled about yet and

602
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.670
<v 5>them and everything.
Yeah,
there was,
there's uh,
you know,</v>

603
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:15.810
this was always a personal project for Roland,
you know,
uh,

604
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.000
he's done a lot of big movies and uh,

605
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.650
but on this one we all noticed and many people who work around him said he's

606
00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:27.180
working in a different level on this movie.
This is really personal for him.

607
00:36:27.181 --> 00:36:30.570
And that's partly why the long hours and the many takes,

608
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:34.470
there was some monkey inside him.
That really one end he did that.

609
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:39.090
He waited 20 years because not because they couldn't make a deal or something

610
00:36:39.091 --> 00:36:42.510
like that.
He never really felt comfortable that he had the script right.

611
00:36:42.511 --> 00:36:46.560
In about four years ago,
he thought he almost had it right.
And so we all got,

612
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.600
you know,
I got to call a,

613
00:36:48.601 --> 00:36:52.620
the bands getting back together again and we're going to going on the road,

614
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.240
but it didn't.

615
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:58.240
And then reverse engines and then he cracked it with a,

616
00:36:58.241 --> 00:37:00.390
about a year ago in November.

617
00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.870
And I'm in about a three week writing session with these two writers.

618
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:07.410
And so that's what started us back on that.
We're going to do it.

619
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.360
<v 2>I think we'll take our last audience question.
Um,
so bell,</v>

620
00:37:11.361 --> 00:37:14.510
I just wanted to let you know that I really liked you in sleepless in Seattle,

621
00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:19.010
but I'm also,
I guess as the last question,
um,

622
00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:23.780
what was the turning point in each of your careers that made you decide to

623
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:26.960
continue with acting and not something else

624
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:32.000
<v 6>wants to go first on that one,</v>

625
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.770
<v 4>I once had a conversation with Harrison Ford,
uh,</v>

626
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.190
sitting on set with him and I said,

627
00:37:40.191 --> 00:37:42.710
did you ever have a point in your career where you questioned what you were

628
00:37:42.711 --> 00:37:44.090
doing and why you were doing it?

629
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:49.340
And he looked at me like I was a complete stupid idiot.

630
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:54.440
It's like,
no,
no,
this is you guys,

631
00:37:54.441 --> 00:37:58.280
you guys limb.
This is the best job on the planet.
No,
I never had that.
I'm like,

632
00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.360
absolutely.
Me Neither.
I'm just kidding.
I'm just gossiping.

633
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:08.690
A great job.
It is for me.

634
00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:13.250
Um,
I moved from the East Coast to Los Angeles to pursue acting.
And then,

635
00:38:13.251 --> 00:38:17.540
I guess right around the time that I finished high school and started going to

636
00:38:17.541 --> 00:38:21.620
college,
I started studying culinary arts and I like,
I fell in love.

637
00:38:21.621 --> 00:38:23.690
I mean I was already in love with culinary arts,

638
00:38:23.691 --> 00:38:27.140
but like being like in the kitchen all the time with like these incredible
chefs,

639
00:38:27.141 --> 00:38:29.630
like guys from France and all over the place.
And like,

640
00:38:29.631 --> 00:38:33.950
I started to love that more than I'm the acting world.

641
00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.980
And I kind of got drawn into that.
And

642
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.190
<v 3>I think I even had a conversation like with the agents and my parents and</v>

643
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:41.290
everybody and I'm like,
all right guys,
you know,

644
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:45.580
we had a good run but I think this is what I want to do.
And um,

645
00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:49.960
they pulled back a lot and they kind of convinced me to just,

646
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:54.640
you know,
take the selective ones,
like maybe like,
you know,
read something.

647
00:38:54.641 --> 00:38:55.471
If you really like it,

648
00:38:55.471 --> 00:38:57.790
if you feel like it can work and if it works with your school schedule,

649
00:38:57.791 --> 00:39:01.660
then do the audition or,
you know,
try to do the project.

650
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:05.290
And I booked a show and the show was incredible.

651
00:39:05.291 --> 00:39:07.210
A lot of phones called level up on cartoon network.

652
00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:12.600
And I mean we just had like the best time and every time I would enroll to go

653
00:39:12.971 --> 00:39:15.850
back to school,
we would get picked up for like something else.

654
00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:19.960
It started as a movie for a movie for television and then on to a series.

655
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.130
So I had to drop out I think three or four semesters in a row.

656
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:28.690
And then I kinda just went to the chefs at the school and I said,
look,
you know,

657
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:30.430
you guys know this is what I want to do.

658
00:39:30.431 --> 00:39:32.860
I was already taking internships and all kinds of stuff.
And they're like,
yeah,

659
00:39:32.861 --> 00:39:35.950
yeah,
yeah.
So we made this agreement,
like when it slows down,

660
00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:39.370
I will go back and like finish the culinary degree and like opened the

661
00:39:39.371 --> 00:39:43.720
restaurant I've always wanted and it just hasn't slowed down yet to that point.

662
00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:48.010
Um,
but you know,
that was turning 24 this year.

663
00:39:48.011 --> 00:39:52.210
That was seven years ago.
It's seven,
something like that.
Um,

664
00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:57.370
you know,
being involved in this industry and getting to do what we do,

665
00:39:57.371 --> 00:39:57.701
like I said,

666
00:39:57.701 --> 00:40:00.100
it's the best job in the world and it only takes a little bit of time for you to

667
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:04.150
realize that,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's hard not to love.

668
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.610
So I'm very happy with where I am now.

669
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.113
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

670
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.160
<v 4>Anybody else?
Yeah,
if I could show you.
Yes.
The um,</v>

671
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:18.790
I,
you know,
I admire,

672
00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:23.140
uh,
you know,
doubt and,
uh,
the,
the,
the uh,

673
00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:28.000
asking,
you know,
you're so smart and wise asking constantly along the way,

674
00:40:28.001 --> 00:40:31.940
is this the best use of,
you know,
life?
Oh,

675
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:36.940
this precious opportunity.
Is this the best use of my energy?
Um,
me,

676
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:41.950
I had this idea,
I wanted to be an actor since I was in like fifth grade.

677
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:44.780
I saw children's theater that I did not,

678
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:48.400
I got this idea and I just stuck with it.
And by the time I was in high school,

679
00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:51.820
I was obsessed and it would go,
we'd write on the shower,

680
00:40:51.821 --> 00:40:55.000
I take a shower every morning and in high school and the shower door would get

681
00:40:55.001 --> 00:40:58.570
steaming.
It was a glass shower.
And I would write every day,
I please God,

682
00:40:58.571 --> 00:41:02.310
let me be an actor and then I would erase it.
So nobody saw.

683
00:41:02.311 --> 00:41:06.460
It was just a secret of mine and for many years and then a thing.

684
00:41:06.461 --> 00:41:08.920
And then the luckily,
and I'm still grateful that it's,
you know,

685
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.940
so I was very passionate about it here.
I'm still thrilled I'm doing it,
but I,

686
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.160
I still all the time do try to get clear about what it was that,

687
00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:21.700
what was that seed and what is it that I'm trying to accomplish?

688
00:41:21.701 --> 00:41:25.420
Is that the best use of my life and time,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

689
00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.230
<v 3>I think it's,
uh,
yeah,
it's,
uh,</v>

690
00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:38.870
<v 5>it is,
uh,
there are times just feels very important to,</v>

691
00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:43.830
uh,
to do.
And you don't know exactly why sometimes.
I think there's,
it's,

692
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:44.810
I think there has to be,

693
00:41:44.811 --> 00:41:48.830
especially if you're starting out and you don't have a lot easy breaks,
uh,

694
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:53.620
you gotta tell yourself,
you know,
is this what I have to do to be healthy?

695
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.460
Is this is what I have to do to stay alive and engaged in the world.

696
00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:03.770
And,
uh,
even if I don't get to do everything,
uh,

697
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:08.630
what do I do?
Uh,
will,
I,
will I be all right just going at it,

698
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:13.490
trying to pursue it.
And I think of that because,
you know,
it's so interesting,

699
00:42:13.491 --> 00:42:18.050
you know,
you're a child of someone who's a also acted.
And so,
you know,

700
00:42:18.051 --> 00:42:20.900
my son has just gotten into it and he had a lucky,

701
00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:25.740
lucky thing happen where he got cast in a pilot,
uh,
uh,

702
00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.390
just the end the last year and now he's going to be,

703
00:42:29.391 --> 00:42:33.740
he did his first movie rule last month,
who has seen with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

704
00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:38.740
And I'm looking at him and wondering does he have it that,

705
00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:42.880
you know,
it's,
it's like,
uh,
uh,
in Macbeth thesis,

706
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:46.610
I'm not without ambition,
but without the illness that should attend it.

707
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.780
And you have to have a little illness to attend.
I think,

708
00:42:50.781 --> 00:42:52.340
cause it's a lot of reasons where,

709
00:42:52.341 --> 00:42:54.830
I mean we're saying it's a great thing when you get the jobs,

710
00:42:54.831 --> 00:42:58.040
but there's many months where you aren't doing the job and you're wondering why

711
00:42:58.041 --> 00:43:01.010
the other guy got the job and are vaguely,
you know.

712
00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:05.420
And so I think that got that kind of thing is always a question.

713
00:43:05.421 --> 00:43:08.810
But I think the fact that I think I don't really have a choice.

714
00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:13.220
That's what makes me keep interested in pursuing it.

715
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.200
<v 2>I think it's lovely.
I mean you guys have said,</v>

716
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:18.570
I have to think applies to anything that somebody is passionate about,

717
00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:20.520
be it software engineering or acting.

718
00:43:20.521 --> 00:43:25.080
And if you guys bring half as much hilarity and insightfulness to this movie as

719
00:43:25.081 --> 00:43:28.120
you did this conversation,
I think we're all going to have an amazing time.
Uh,

720
00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:31.170
so thank you so much for joining us today.
Thank you.

721
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:34.220
<v 0>Thank you.</v>
