WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.100
We are going to welcome now to the stage who I feel like with this is like a

2
00:00:10.101 --> 00:00:10.881
Lakers game.

3
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:15.200
You guys are going to run down and like they got let but let's do it.

4
00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.930
Maybe if we're going to do it that way in order.
Um,
of course.

5
00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:19.640
Let's bring up first Frank Miller,

6
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.073
<v 1>creator</v>

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.970
<v 0>commander of the Dark Knight returns.
We're going to go in a different order.</v>

8
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.010
Tony Patrick who is just done Batman and the signal.

9
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.713
<v 1>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.190
<v 0>Sean Murphy who is a just dropped Batman White Knight.</v>

11
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.770
Frank Miller,
the creator of dark knight returns.

12
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.830
<v 1>Huh?</v>

13
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.830
<v 0>Getting the current writer of Batman and James Chaney and the fourth,</v>

14
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.590
the current writer of detective comics.

15
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.390
No,
no,
you're welcome.
Thank you for coming out.
We are super,
super excited.
So,

16
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.663
um,

17
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.850
I want to jump out and there's throw some questions out that are for all of you.

18
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.890
Um,
Batman is one of the most well known,

19
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.920
well loved characters in the world across literature and yet dark,

20
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.030
brooding,
tortured,
broken kick,
Sadik,

21
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.810
ridiculously wealthy,
um,

22
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.830
basically unrelatable in almost every aspect.

23
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.440
How do you account for this popularity of the character?

24
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.570
I thought he was a bundle of joy.
Right?
Maybe,

25
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.860
Hey,
look,
he's having a good time.
Maybe the Crook Siren,

26
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.630
but he's all right.
He ain't so gloomy.
Yeah.

27
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.730
He,
he'd come in,
he comes from a,
from a very dark beginning,
but,
but uh,

28
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.980
you don't keep doing something for that long and,
uh,

29
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.050
because you're depressed.
Okay.

30
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.790
So it's just me that keeps doing the depressing.
No,

31
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.550
you just keep doing what you're doing.
Uh,
I,
I'd say,

32
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.870
<v 2>um,
what,</v>

33
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.800
what I relate to is he sort of a machine for turning pain into hope.
Like,

34
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.870
Ooh,
he's a super power.

35
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:27.140
The one power he has the stand next to Batman and wonder woman is that his

36
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:29.570
parents were killed.
Like that's an odd superpower to have.

37
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.440
But what makes him powerful?
Is it the worst moment in his life?

38
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:36.080
He turns that moment into strength.
And I think a lot of people,

39
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.330
when they look at their lives,
they sort of come to realize that,

40
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.090
that the pain and the worst parts of you become like the greatest parts of you.

41
00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:46.640
That becomes sort of what you rely on in the,
in the bad moments.
He's like,

42
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:47.510
I've been through something,

43
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:50.090
I've done something horrible or I've been through something horrible,

44
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:53.780
now I can handle the horrible,
it's coming at me.
Like Friedrich Nietzsche.
Yeah.

45
00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:55.880
Like Frederick Nietzsche,
Ana.
Okay.

46
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.890
Batman's looked into the abyss and as we all have,
and this was afraid.

47
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.120
<v 0>It's the one time that's happened.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
and so that's all right.</v>

48
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.880
I guess that's a take I had not seen on that.

49
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:14.710
Do you in terms of hold it all right.
Um,
all right.

50
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:17.320
I happy and hopeful Batman.
Um,

51
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.030
some of that seems to revolve around the family and each of you is taken,

52
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.860
um,
a different approach to giving Batman a family of sorts.

53
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.810
What,
how have you come at that?
What did,

54
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.350
what does a successful back family look like?
Um,

55
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.790
lots of,
lots of like pointy ears

56
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.180
and lots of Robin's bags and Robin

57
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.240
short shorts and I wasn't,

58
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.570
I can I even cut the Antony infant Tino cupboard that I've always wanted to see

59
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.170
that never existed was,
was to have Batman on the bat phone in the bat cave.

60
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.160
I'm sitting next to the Batmobile,
um,

61
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.150
talking onto the bat phone saying,
Oh,
commissioner,
this is a tough job.

62
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:06.130
This may cost me six,
seven robins.

63
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.750
<v 3>Huh?</v>

64
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.210
<v 4>Once they started killing one,
then they killed another effort.
Here.</v>

65
00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:15.200
It's open season.

66
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.590
<v 0>We don't even bother with the 900 number anymore.</v>

67
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.390
<v 4>Yes.
Oh God.
I mean,</v>

68
00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:27.990
I think one of the,
one of the things about that like,

69
00:04:27.991 --> 00:04:32.910
cause family is built into the entire concept of Batman,
uh,

70
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.140
Bruce lost family.
And that is,
that's the sort of,

71
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.700
that is the founding trauma that led him on this path.

72
00:04:41.701 --> 00:04:46.590
So that story ultimately goes to building family.

73
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.540
That's what he,
that that's really the only way out of,

74
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:55.590
of where of where he started.
And,
uh,
and it's,
you know,

75
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:59.940
it's everything that you,
that you lose when you experience that kind of trauma.

76
00:04:59.941 --> 00:05:04.020
He can find,
he can't find through himself necessarily any more,

77
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:05.700
but he can find it through these other people,

78
00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:10.350
these other sources of light around him.
Um,
and that's the,

79
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.980
I mean,
that's been sort of one of the driving principles.
Uh,

80
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.390
my detective comics run is sort of a Batman teen book with a lot of the,

81
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.751
you know,

82
00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:22.440
now there are a million like people who have been sidekicks to Batman at

83
00:05:22.441 --> 00:05:22.951
different points.

84
00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:27.210
And I just brought up a bunch of my favorites and stuck them in one book.
Uh,

85
00:05:27.211 --> 00:05:28.980
but this one like it,

86
00:05:28.981 --> 00:05:33.981
it allows each one sort of taps into a different core aspect of Bruce r that

87
00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:40.170
allows him to kind of a approach the,
the light,
uh,
again,

88
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.150
and that's why you get the incredible bright colored costumes and all of that

89
00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:49.140
compared to the blacks and grays.
Um,
but

90
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.850
<v 0>interesting.
All right.
Um,
well on that note,</v>

91
00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:56.630
so we have now the,

92
00:05:56.631 --> 00:06:01.080
the robins are the new proteges keep increasing.
Um,

93
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.870
we have the signal a lot of a lot of people with guns up there.
Yeah.

94
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.980
Well that also need a good soccer.

95
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.450
Robin's brightly colored Robinson 20 of them.
Yeah.

96
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.920
I mean the Batmobile is permanently parked outside the going to the orphanage.

97
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:20.810
I mean,
it's
kids love cars.

98
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.943
It's true.

99
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.890
Getting back to the newest protege.

100
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.840
So we have the signal who is joining this pedigree of,

101
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.460
of sort of bat like heroes,

102
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.240
cannon fodder.
Um,
we hope not.
And I use three,
right.

103
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.800
Give him a little time for us.
What makes the signal different?
I mean,
I'm,

104
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.250
<v 5>and this is a compensation you Scott and I had originally in,
which was,
you know,</v>

105
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.480
what's going to be the distinction between Duke Thomas,
let's say,

106
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.900
and a a Dick Grayson or,
uh,
uh,

107
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.290
Kate who's bat woman.
And I think there's a opportunity with Duke since he is,

108
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.340
um,
we can say a potential metahuman we'll just say potential at the moment,

109
00:07:11.341 --> 00:07:15.360
but since he has these burgeoning powers,
it's,

110
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.720
it's kind of the first time Batman has a chance to kind of get in early on the

111
00:07:18.721 --> 00:07:23.280
ground floor on a new hero.
So I think Duke,
um,

112
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.180
and I think to kind of go back here,
I think,

113
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:32.310
I think because of the loss of so many Robbins,
um,
I think,

114
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.360
you know,
Batman has an opportunity to do it differently this time and maybe,

115
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.360
maybe discovers he doesn't,
he needs the robins that he already has,

116
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.490
hopefully intact.
But you know,

117
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.700
Duke Thomas is a what the heck?
If they aren't,
I mean,
you can only have what,

118
00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:51.210
five or 10 disposable Robbins at a time.
I'm not sure.
Um,

119
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.260
but I think do Thomas is,
is an opportunity and the seagull in particular,

120
00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.720
it's for Batman to,
to operate in a different kind of mentorship role.
You know,

121
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.730
if it's almost like,
um,
if,
um,
you know,

122
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.170
Batman had had met a superman,
I'm sorry.
Now I feel like I'm in middle school.

123
00:08:10.171 --> 00:08:13.140
Like if Batman and Superman,
this is what I don't like.

124
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.580
I know,
I know,
but,
um,
but it's,

125
00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:22.581
it's almost like the ground floor element of maybe even preventing,

126
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:24.960
you know,
um,

127
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.990
of another future rogues gallery from,
from emerging,
right.

128
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.890
Another set of many humans who will destroy Gotham.
If,

129
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.920
if he can mentor Duke in way under his particular philosophy,

130
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.140
perhaps,
you know,
we'll see a different gospel.
Here's hoping

131
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.850
<v 0>the robins that don't die keep turning out to be very evil.
So</v>

132
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.830
absolutely.
Go Jason side,
Jerry,

133
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.050
go fine.
Um,

134
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.080
in,
in terms of the,
you mentioned that the darkness,

135
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:08.760
that Batman's ultimately happy.
Um,
it is,

136
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.340
it sort of brings into question though,

137
00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:16.341
this opposite 75 years of Batman is also 75 years of the joker is and saw on

138
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.440
your,
your book just dropped yesterday,
um,
the white nights.

139
00:09:24.441 --> 00:09:28.110
So we see a not only rehabilitated joker,
but a,

140
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:32.310
a sane and heroic aspiring heroic joker.
Yeah.

141
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.390
And potentially a more insane or perceived in St.
Yeah.

142
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.500
<v 6>Like if you took away the insanity,
then he can be a true genius,</v>

143
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:45.180
a true a machiavellian enemy.
And he be even worse because his,
uh,

144
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.270
his craziness,
there's imbalances handicapped him.

145
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:53.550
If he took that away and now he's just like a smooth don draper who he's,

146
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.090
he talks,
he gets his record expunged,

147
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.290
he shows that the cops just fudge,

148
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.830
saw all the paperwork and my version of Gotham joker,

149
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.610
it's never proven that he ever did anything super bad.
Um,
it's a big attic.

150
00:10:06.611 --> 00:10:11.250
That cotton candy was really nasty.
Um,

151
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.220
but yeah,
I've always,
that's,
that's kind of where I went with mine.
It's like,

152
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.740
how do you do anything new with the joker anymore?

153
00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:19.620
I know a few operators have tackled a cure joker before,

154
00:10:19.621 --> 00:10:21.960
but I really wanted to see it done,
uh,
to,

155
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.390
to really follow that all the way down the road.
You know?

156
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.720
<v 0>So there's,
you're saying that within,
if frank is,
if I'm hearing is,
um,</v>

157
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:34.580
within Batman's brooding,
vigilante violence is an actual,

158
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.230
um,
uh,
a happiness and a hopefulness,
and you're saying that within the

159
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.570
really psychotic,
um,
yeah,
there's a sane man saying,

160
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.020
is this just a sane man?
But,
uh,
yeah.
Uh,

161
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.820
very in control and respectable,

162
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.650
<v 6>right?
Yeah.
I mean,
even somebody,
yeah.</v>

163
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.450
Even though we'd all love to toss the joker out of Gotham,

164
00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.880
as soon as the security starts creating these amazing arguments about why Batman

165
00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:02.170
is causing the problem.
And you know,

166
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.340
we know a lot about sociology now white crime exists and we know that punching

167
00:11:06.341 --> 00:11:09.130
back doesn't make sense.
You know,
like in the forties,

168
00:11:09.131 --> 00:11:12.490
that comic mostly made sense.
But we know now that that doesn't work.

169
00:11:12.491 --> 00:11:14.280
So what would Gotham be and if it was right,

170
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.080
<v 0>I guess,
who should retire the police department altogether?</v>

171
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.450
It's a great question that's asked you three as,

172
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.660
as we've come to know more sociologically psychologically,

173
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.790
what challenge does that create for you as writers?

174
00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:32.130
You've been hitting that to me,
you're mistaking whatever the current trend in,

175
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.140
in,
in thought is for knowing more.

176
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.070
Sometimes people are wrong for millennia,
but you know,

177
00:11:39.071 --> 00:11:41.800
during Spanish inquisition they thought they were doing the right thing.

178
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.670
So this is that your take,
is that Batman?
We,

179
00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:53.980
we keep,
we can't stay the course.
He stays,
he,
he will throwing fists.

180
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.740
<v 7>Oh,
I know.
I was just talking,
I was just talking to response to what he said.</v>

181
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:59.960
But no,
in terms of,
in terms of what Batman is his,
he's,
he's,

182
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.920
he's just a wonderful,
very versatile myth.
It could be anything.

183
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.800
It can be anything from death wish to Robin Hood.
Mm.

184
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.360
<v 0>Yeah.
Well.
Well wait,
what you're saying is the interesting part is that yeah,</v>

185
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:14.270
he's,
he's uh,
people ask,
you know,
it could Batman beat,

186
00:12:14.271 --> 00:12:18.590
do better for the world and be less guilt if he just was a billionaire and turn

187
00:12:18.591 --> 00:12:22.120
it all into charity and,
and,
and help.
I mean,
he probably could save more people,

188
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.740
um,
as a scientists discovering cures than you could ever save punching.
Well,

189
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.070
two things about that.
One is he wouldn't

190
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.100
<v 7>do that because,
because,
because he's,
he's,</v>

191
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.960
<v 0>it was a myth.
We can do it way wrong with them.</v>

192
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.720
That would make for one rotten comics,

193
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.610
it's a second one that really clicked.

194
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.880
<v 6>Men fixes the just the educational system.
I don't think I'd want to draw that.</v>

195
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.460
<v 0>They tried that during the late seventies.
Oh yeah.</v>

196
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:58.060
They called it social relevance.
Yeah.
Interesting.
So,
well,

197
00:12:58.061 --> 00:13:01.630
if all of all the things he could be,
there are certain things that he has to be,

198
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.670
he has to be the world's greatest detective.
Yeah.

199
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.210
How hard is it to be anything more than that?

200
00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:10.330
He's got to be the smartest guy in the room under new circumstances.

201
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:14.650
But that means that you all have to be the smartest people in the room,

202
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.130
especially in this room,
swam.

203
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.400
Um,
but it really,
is there a challenge in,
it's like you've,
you've,

204
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.600
it's gotta be foolproof.

205
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:35.140
It's got to be the world's greatest detective level story all the time.
No,

206
00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:36.610
because you're,
you're,
you are the smartest person,

207
00:13:36.611 --> 00:13:39.390
but you're also the stupidest person in the room.
You're everybody in the room.

208
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.870
Your,
your unity,
your,
the collective consciousness of his entire economy.

209
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.770
<v 7>Oh,
so he's a,
he's a rich and broad enough characters,
so control,</v>

210
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.490
perform different functions.
Um,

211
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.640
he's also part terrorist in that day strike terror into the hearts of criminals.

212
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.140
You know,
he,
he,
he,
uh,

213
00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:00.370
his first night out in dark knight is a rampage of terror to,
to,

214
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.230
to make all the criminal scared.
Um,

215
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.130
and it continues it to the series in any day.
Now he does,

216
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.640
he dresses up like a giant bat.
This guy isn't around a reassuring.
Yeah.

217
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.630
<v 0>What would you say for each of you is,</v>

218
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.680
what is your fingerprint on the character?
And though it is the thing he say,

219
00:14:19.681 --> 00:14:21.900
like I gave Batman that

220
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.630
I gave them a really high color.

221
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.630
<v 6>I have his Batmobile to exhausted on the front,
so it's always shooting flames.</v>

222
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:38.250
And I made a Arkham look like Castlevania attract Transylvania castle.

223
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.850
So Batman's become like the devil in the city.

224
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.420
I sort of a storytelling element.
So I,
I mean,
cause I draw,

225
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.400
people can actually see the hard work I do

226
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.430
<v 2>surrounded by artists.
I'm in trouble here.
Oh wait,
no thanks for,</v>

227
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.670
I'm with frank on this too.
I forgot.
Yeah,
I forgot that you got the frame.

228
00:14:58.671 --> 00:14:59.350
We and your husband

229
00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:00.183
<v 3>forgot.</v>

230
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.610
We have some books we can get.

231
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:12.080
<v 2>I add to that.
The only,
the Batmans been around for 78 years.</v>

232
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.050
He's been written in every medium.
Um,

233
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.520
a guy named Frank Miller wrote the best Batman story ever and I,

234
00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.470
you can't write better than that.
Did he draw that to

235
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.770
the collars were really low and see what,

236
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.970
like shorty or so second smartest guy in the room.
Um,

237
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.410
so the only thing you can,
it,
I just,
I,
you can't add new ideas to them.

238
00:15:33.411 --> 00:15:36.410
And what you can add is yourself,
you put yourself into Batman.
Um,

239
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.410
cause it's the only thing original you can bring is sort of your own

240
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:43.850
consciousness and experience or whatever.
Um,
yeah.
So what would I add?
It's a bad,

241
00:15:43.851 --> 00:15:48.760
but I don't know.
He's a little more emo.
He stares out windows and sadly,
um,
uh,
I,

242
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.753
I think,

243
00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:53.390
I think I added to Batman or what I'm trying to add to Batman is his happiness

244
00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:56.290
and,
and him trying to be happy,
which,
I mean,

245
00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:01.330
I can't make Batman darker than you made him and I can't make him a more of a

246
00:16:02.241 --> 00:16:05.840
family man.
And you made him James or uh,
as high collar does,
you made him.

247
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.260
Um,
but I can make,

248
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.080
that's the one place that I think we can go with Batman that'll create a lot of

249
00:16:12.081 --> 00:16:12.471
conflict,

250
00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:15.560
is giving him a little happiness and seeing how that mixes with his bitter.

251
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.920
<v 3>Hmm.
All right.
What about you?
What did you do as your fingerprint?</v>

252
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.470
I'm working on it.
A book's not out yet,

253
00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:27.600
but a little bit more a sunlight since I'm dealing with a daytime Gotham.

254
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.900
Yeah.
I'm giving,
I'm giving him a little bit more Bruce.
A little bit more.

255
00:16:30.901 --> 00:16:34.220
Bruce Wayne,
a little bit more a r and r during the daytime,

256
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.870
maybe about 15 minutes.
Yeah.

257
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:43.830
All right.
James Packer.
Okay.
Well,
I,
I,
uh,
I,
uh,

258
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:51.930
Frederick Wortham when he wrote seduction of the innocent and proved to comic

259
00:16:52.951 --> 00:16:57.090
books where we're the source of all juvenile crime.
Um,

260
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.310
he claimed that,
that,
that,
that um,

261
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:04.360
Batman and Robin had the perfect homosexual relationship.

262
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.350
I Made Robin a girl,
so they are well done.

263
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.570
<v 4>Well,
I,
um,
I mean in detect,</v>

264
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.630
honestly I don't feel like I have put my fingerprint on Batman himself.

265
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:32.790
I've been focused much more on his relationship with,
uh,
with,

266
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.000
with each existing characters,

267
00:17:35.001 --> 00:17:38.930
ones that have been playing into the mythos for,
uh,

268
00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.350
like the,
throughout its history.
And,
uh,

269
00:17:42.351 --> 00:17:47.351
I've tried to sort of sort of hit a iconic moments between him and each of the

270
00:17:48.081 --> 00:17:50.250
characters that sum up,

271
00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.610
sum up their dynamics in each of those ways.

272
00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:58.320
And I've been trying to create a Bruce that rather than immediate,

273
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.210
uh,
Bruce that says yes to like,
cause it so many times.

274
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:06.840
There are these store like when they would introduce a new,
uh,

275
00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.200
a new character coming up in a new young vigilante and Gotham,

276
00:18:10.201 --> 00:18:13.680
there are so many stories of Batman just saying no like Batman,

277
00:18:13.681 --> 00:18:17.130
just like trying to shut them down out the gate.

278
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:22.430
And this is the Batman who I think is more like the idea that Batman's a loner

279
00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:28.251
when Robin showed up like one year in like if just a few years into the creation

280
00:18:28.531 --> 00:18:32.370
of Batman,
like Batman has been about family for the whole time.

281
00:18:32.371 --> 00:18:36.270
So the idea of him,
how do I make this work?
How do I bring these people in?

282
00:18:36.271 --> 00:18:39.540
How do I create,
uh,
something,

283
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:43.650
something bigger and can it work?
Is that,
is that end?

284
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:47.430
Is it actually a good thing to actually say yes to all of these young people at

285
00:18:47.431 --> 00:18:52.260
the same time who are trying to work out their issues by bring them all in?

286
00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.190
Yeah,
but like 30 Robbins.
Yeah.
I mean that's basically a detective.

287
00:18:56.191 --> 00:18:59.490
We got a major bank robbery with machine guns being used 10 me,

288
00:18:59.491 --> 00:19:02.520
10 Robbins over there.
I'm too busy over here.
Yeah.
You know,

289
00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.090
one is bound to get through.
Yeah.

290
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.880
Basically taking the approach of the 300 and just applying it here to Robin's.

291
00:19:09.881 --> 00:19:14.700
Yeah,
I like it.
Fodder.
Sorry.
100 naked.
Robin's

292
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.440
there we go.
It would sell.
If you've got it,

293
00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.920
there's a market for everything.

294
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:29.250
You're talking about putting yourself into the character,
your,
um,

295
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:34.110
your background is in the CIA.
How does that,

296
00:19:34.111 --> 00:19:37.990
how has that influenced,
uh,
your,
your creation?
Uh,

297
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.210
<v 2>I mean it,
it influences everything I write.
I just,</v>

298
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:45.320
I mean that's how I spent my twenties.
If I was to write about my current life,

299
00:19:45.321 --> 00:19:48.500
I just be writing about a guy who writes Batman and grant Morrison already did

300
00:19:48.501 --> 00:19:53.170
that.
So,
uh,
so,
so yeah.
So it,
that,

301
00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.060
that sort of experience of,
you know,

302
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.690
having seen people really be brave and having seen people really be afraid and

303
00:19:59.691 --> 00:20:02.080
having been both of those two people,
I,
I,

304
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:06.020
I can't talk about directly cause it's all I'll get arrested.
Yeah.
We get that.

305
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.480
And a,
I mean,
I care,
I don't want to leave the secrets,

306
00:20:08.481 --> 00:20:10.400
but also the arresting is big.
Um,

307
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.240
so I put the emotions in it and,
and,
and,
and,

308
00:20:14.241 --> 00:20:17.420
and I sort of draw from that experience.
I mean,
my standard line is like,

309
00:20:17.421 --> 00:20:21.200
it helps,
um,
writing about getting shot at if you've been shot at.

310
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:22.570
But I think that's kind of BS.

311
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.550
I'll probably just say that it doesn't help at all.
Does sound cool?
Yeah.

312
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.060
Cause if I wrote it stinks because you can't write realistic,

313
00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:31.340
like Batman's famous thing.
Frank,

314
00:20:31.341 --> 00:20:33.920
you do this better than anyone is to date when he's interrogating someone as a

315
00:20:33.921 --> 00:20:38.390
dangle them off a building and then,
you know,
open his hands up and be like,
ah,

316
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:41.150
and then they just start confessing.
That doesn't actually work.

317
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.383
<v 4>MMM.</v>

318
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.050
The time I do

319
00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:50.030
<v 0>hurt.
So</v>

320
00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.400
you don't steal a realism too much.
Um,

321
00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:01.150
you all hold on,
hold on.
Are we going on the roof right now?

322
00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.940
No,
no,
no.
Not at all.
No.

323
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.430
<v 7>It's just,
he just said the dreaded word realism.</v>

324
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.420
We're talking about a guy who dresses up like a bat and drives in a car that's

325
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:15.370
30,
30 feet long,
puts a child in danger every time he goes out into action.

326
00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:16.600
And we're talking about realism,

327
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.380
<v 0>think,
give,
you gotta go,
you gotta lean on,</v>

328
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.840
you have to lean away from the realism that you can't lean so far away that it

329
00:21:22.841 --> 00:21:25.860
breaks.
Right,
right.
Absolutely.
Right.
But that's,

330
00:21:25.861 --> 00:21:29.740
it brings up an interesting point because you do bring realism frank into your

331
00:21:29.741 --> 00:21:33.780
work into dark night.
Um,
has these constant,

332
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:38.260
very real political themes and through all three installments from Reaganism to

333
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.840
nationalism,
run a muck media,

334
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.940
dark knight master race as the last one is particularly poignant right now.

335
00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:50.140
So do you come from a political perspective when you're writing these stories or

336
00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:52.140
is that just what happens to fall in?

337
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:56.640
<v 7>Yeah,
we've,
I mean,
obviously there's a political perspective in,
you know,</v>

338
00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.950
in life if you're,
if you're,
if you're awake and,
but I'm also,

339
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:05.520
when I started the very first dark knight,
I,
uh,

340
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.390
it just struck me as odd that comics were so divorced from,

341
00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:13.980
from everything else in the world and that,
and that,
uh,

342
00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.560
here we have all this cartooning talent.

343
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.950
We're not using it to do what cartoonists are most known for,

344
00:22:19.951 --> 00:22:23.070
which is political cartoons.
And,
and,
uh,

345
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:27.450
so to me it was just a natural marriage and I also gave the series of Greek

346
00:22:27.451 --> 00:22:32.280
chorus that is a way for the rest of the world to react to Batman being out

347
00:22:32.281 --> 00:22:36.390
there.
Um,
and that's just been a device that's continued throughout.

348
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.580
One thing we mentioned backstage and this was,
um,

349
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:46.140
<v 0>every installment of the dark knight returns as now happen during a Republican</v>

350
00:22:46.141 --> 00:22:48.960
administration.
Coincidence,

351
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.010
just that's when the story came to you fail.
I don't know.

352
00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.950
It's diplomatic and answer as we could hope and all is

353
00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:02.970
<v 7>direct.
It's just,
you know,
I've got no idea dude.
The,</v>

354
00:23:02.971 --> 00:23:06.710
the,
uh,
I mean you'd think they'd,
I don't know.

355
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:12.630
<v 0>All right.
Let me pal
something.
I want to come back,
Tony,</v>

356
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.570
to something you said earlier about you're bringing Batman a little more into

357
00:23:15.571 --> 00:23:19.560
the light and doing this and you said that,
you know,
Scott them by day.

358
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:20.820
Um,

359
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.820
Gotham itself is as much a character in the myth os as any as,

360
00:23:27.121 --> 00:23:28.590
as Robin or the joker.

361
00:23:28.591 --> 00:23:32.490
And more so then any other setting,
uh,

362
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:37.230
certainly more than metropolis.
Um,
how,
how has that influenced you?

363
00:23:37.231 --> 00:23:40.860
Have you played with that?
How do you guys think of that as a character?

364
00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.980
It's a big,
it's a big sandbox to play in,
um,

365
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.130
especially daytime Gotham because

366
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.090
<v 5>even now it's were working on it.
It's,
we're figuring out what,
what the,
the,</v>

367
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.290
the distinction between nighttime Gotham,

368
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.130
which is what mostly we've seen in,

369
00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.500
in the majority of the books and then a new day time ecosystem.

370
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:04.070
So is that where,
you know,

371
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:08.990
new heroes and new and new villains actually test out there,

372
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.090
you know,
skill sets plans.
Is this where,
uh,
I,
you know,

373
00:24:14.091 --> 00:24:14.751
I actually,

374
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:18.110
I imagined that daytime Gotham is a little bit more corrupt than nighttime.
God.

375
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.060
And if we start looking at,

376
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.380
one of the things that we're investigating is kind of the,
the,
the systems,
uh,

377
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.780
that run during daytime.
Uh,
also if we talk,
if we get into,

378
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:33.640
not to say that we are getting into politics in Goffman,

379
00:24:33.641 --> 00:24:35.900
but I mean this is when,
you know,

380
00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:40.880
a lot of these corrupt politicians in Gotham or are working during the daytime.

381
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.250
So,
I mean,
there's a lot of different opportunities.

382
00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:46.690
I feel that that got them by date,
gives us,
um,

383
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.730
does he have like a special costume that he wears somebody.
Okay.

384
00:24:49.731 --> 00:24:54.600
He allowed his usual camouflage.
Well,
signal does,
so signal has,
um,
is,

385
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.100
uh,
the signal is,
you know,
so he's,
uh,
to,
to give you guys,

386
00:24:58.101 --> 00:25:01.830
if you don't know who took Thomas's over the last,
uh,

387
00:25:01.831 --> 00:25:06.160
about five years,
he's gone from a,
just a,

388
00:25:06.161 --> 00:25:11.000
a teenage kid who helped Batman out in the jam to being part of a,

389
00:25:11.001 --> 00:25:14.940
an autonomous group of Robin's.
They lived most of them,
frankly.
Um,

390
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.210
how many Robbins?
Yeah,
yeah,
that's right.
Sorry.
Sorry.

391
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.430
Would you like to talk about to know,
because I,

392
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.500
so it was a few years ago and I mean,

393
00:25:24.501 --> 00:25:27.740
and this is what got me invested in do Thomas,

394
00:25:27.741 --> 00:25:32.741
is I was at New York comicon and I walked by a table and I saw black Robin on a

395
00:25:33.561 --> 00:25:34.394
tee shirt and I was like,

396
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.410
<v 3>it's African American Robin,
man,
it's a narrows,
rotting off.</v>

397
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:44.350
And so,
um,
but I saw the t shirt and I was like,
I gotta get this.

398
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.180
<v 5>Yeah.
Like,
and so then,
and I knew nothing about Duke Thomas at that point.</v>

399
00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:53.130
So then I went back and we had a red,
uh,
we are Robin and,
you know,

400
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:54.960
filled in the gaps in.

401
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.840
<v 3>So here I am,
man.
We'd be sitting here actually using him in my book.</v>

402
00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:02.910
Which one?
Duke.
Thomas woop.

403
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.810
And I look,
I used to Thomas and so I have him as like,
as,
uh,
um,

404
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:15.500
some marvel character.
A guy.
Miles Morales.
Sure.
Sorry.

405
00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:20.110
Oh,
the Netflix show.
What's it called?
What's his name?
Luke Harris.

406
00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:25.010
Dare Devil.
Okay.
Yeah.
Sorry,
I'm looking out here.
Uh,
smartest guy in the room.

407
00:26:25.011 --> 00:26:26.090
We don't know what marvel characters.

408
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.370
Luke cage guy.
He's defending his neighborhood.

409
00:26:31.371 --> 00:26:34.700
It's like he's in Bedstuy or like a rough neighborhood where Batman or the

410
00:26:34.701 --> 00:26:37.610
police don't go.
So he's just sort of taking matters into his own hands.

411
00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:41.510
So that's sort of what I'm,
when I'm working with,
I don't know how that fits.

412
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:44.100
<v 5>I mean,
well,
so much else world.
It's not</v>

413
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.430
<v 3>even Canada.
It's not even,
okay.
So elsewhere.
It's no,
someone said else world,
Eh,</v>

414
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:51.930
they still know they should.
They don't stamp it like that.

415
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:55.110
Oh else old.
Yeah,
they,
they,
they,

416
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.990
they beat up else worlds in reacting to dark night cause they wanted to say this

417
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:03.780
didn't happen
then he works so much of it into cannon.

418
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.340
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
So that's kind of an I'm following in your footsteps here.

419
00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:11.400
I was like,
let me just tick off them,
mess with it.

420
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.160
I'm going to just tear it up and whatever you guys like at the end,

421
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.280
you can just use that just like the way you did with dark knight yet.

422
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.180
And they thought like,
okay.
They were convinced like,
well it worked with frank.

423
00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:24.300
Maybe this,
this kid can do something like that too.
I don't know.

424
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.610
Not that I would ever expect to fill your shoes,

425
00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:31.350
but I had you as an example to throw in there facing the idea.
Right.

426
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.040
Do it now.
The idea is each,
each guy had bat kicks.

427
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:39.570
Things kicks the bounds as far out as possible.
The next guy can can do it.

428
00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:42.590
I'm kicking it really hard and filling anybody's shoes will,

429
00:27:42.591 --> 00:27:46.600
in terms of diversity,
you've created a bat team that is like,

430
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:48.690
not just largely,
it's a majority of women?

431
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.250
<v 4>Well,
I mean there's a lot of great like,</v>

432
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:55.310
I mean right now we've like bat woman,

433
00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.730
the bat woman that Greg Rucka created with,
uh,

434
00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:03.410
or developed with a judge Williams was one of the,

435
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:07.160
I think the best additions to the mythos and uh,

436
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.440
a long time and the,

437
00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.310
but that character had kind of existed standalone.
Uh,

438
00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.900
she had not really interacted with the bat family itself and,
uh,

439
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.530
there were,
had been little mentions before that they are,

440
00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:25.490
that there is a familial relationship.
So it was like bringing in,

441
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:30.740
uh,
Batwoman as a,
as a kind of mirror to Bruce as his cousin,

442
00:28:30.741 --> 00:28:33.350
as someone who,
uh,
you know,

443
00:28:33.351 --> 00:28:36.830
comes with a more military background and how,

444
00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.670
how the two of them play off of each other.
It became sort of core to the team.

445
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:43.640
Um,
but honestly,
in building the team,

446
00:28:43.641 --> 00:28:48.380
and a lot of it was just me like asking to use my favorite characters and them

447
00:28:48.381 --> 00:28:49.214
saying yes.

448
00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:52.810
<v 3>So this begs the question,</v>

449
00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:57.130
how much freedom do you have on this iconic character?
Can you do,

450
00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:01.930
how do you decide like,
all right,
he's going to be married now,

451
00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:07.050
which that that is now you start doing it and you see when they say none the

452
00:29:07.301 --> 00:29:11.710
best that the best bet is to come in when,
when,
when the sales are really low.

453
00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.900
That's,
that's,
that's what it does when you get to help me pitch products here.

454
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.200
Um,
yeah,

455
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.240
the being sales low is really helpful.

456
00:29:28.241 --> 00:29:30.980
That's why I tried crash every project and then raise it back up.
Uh,

457
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.030
I mean I got daredevil when it was,
they was,

458
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.290
they were just getting set to cancel it.
So I got to do anything I want it to.
Oh,

459
00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:41.350
the best thing happen in common cause you get of nobody cares about it all it

460
00:29:41.351 --> 00:29:42.160
all around the block.

461
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.640
<v 2>Yeah.
That's the best.
Um,
but I mean the,</v>

462
00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.890
the company in the editors want a story that will capture the public.

463
00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:54.550
They don't want you to be a cover band.
They don't want you to just be like,
okay,

464
00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:56.780
here's the hits.
They won't play them over and over again

465
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:04.510
sometimes.
But sometimes you know,
they,
they,
they don't,
if you get a good editor,

466
00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:06.910
if they don't,
that's where you got to find the right editor.
Yeah,
that's,

467
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.140
that's 100% of the shoe I bought any,

468
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:13.660
it's one of those things where I think maybe in the safe,
the safe options,

469
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:15.910
what they want,
cause you know,
that's the easiest way not to get fired,

470
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:19.330
but in their heart and their dreams,
they want to do something radical.

471
00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:20.920
They want to be the editor of dark knight returns.

472
00:30:20.921 --> 00:30:22.960
They want to be the publisher who publishes the next thing.

473
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:26.170
And if you can trick them into thinking you're doing that,
then you're cool.

474
00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.770
All right.
Uh,
so that's the whole thing if you,

475
00:30:30.771 --> 00:30:32.620
if to push a story for it.
But you have to,

476
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.400
I mean the whole point of working with the Batman character is there is a

477
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.440
quarter of that character.
There is a core and you can't,

478
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.020
and you're responsible to the,
to the fans.

479
00:30:41.021 --> 00:30:44.440
You're responsible to the people who came before you not to destroy that core.

480
00:30:44.441 --> 00:30:47.050
And if you do,
then your story loses its stakes.

481
00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.760
If I'm writing a Batman that doesn't mold to that point of that,

482
00:30:50.761 --> 00:30:53.670
and then I'm just writing sort of bad fan fiction,
um,

483
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.650
and having written some bad fan fiction and my left in that ready to go back to

484
00:30:56.651 --> 00:30:59.890
it yet.
So,
so,
um,

485
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.400
so as long as you stick to that core,
you can move that character forward.

486
00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:07.020
And it's a,
it's amazing.
I'll well conceived the,
the,

487
00:31:07.021 --> 00:31:09.340
the best characters are that,
that there's,

488
00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:13.220
there's not much you can really wreck about Batman that is,

489
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:17.930
unless you just,
unless you just completely trashed it,
you know,
and,

490
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:21.900
and betrayed it.
He's like Superman.
He's just,
he's such,

491
00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.350
such a good idea or wonder woman.

492
00:31:23.351 --> 00:31:26.200
They're all such good ideas that does so much better than superman.

493
00:31:26.201 --> 00:31:29.030
What are you talking about?
Superman is a boring care.

494
00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:33.690
He's superman is the one I want to do next.
Okay.
No,
but don't,

495
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:34.790
you're lucky if the sales are low.

496
00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.420
I don't know if that's true.
Actually.
That's true.
Okay.

497
00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.020
Superman is not boring characters.

498
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:49.920
Just go read some of the stuff that and Schuster did.
Yeah.
But means nevermind.

499
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.790
Bizarros
you don't like to,

500
00:31:53.791 --> 00:31:57.270
like the more wising are going crazy about,
but to me,
Bam in is,

501
00:31:57.271 --> 00:31:59.740
is talking about this stuff where he could push planets around.
No,

502
00:31:59.741 --> 00:32:03.160
that's not real interesting.
You know,
once he got more powerful than God,

503
00:32:03.161 --> 00:32:07.570
he stopped being a really interesting character.
But,
but uh,
but the,
but he was,

504
00:32:07.571 --> 00:32:10.170
he,
but he started out as a character with a,
I'm using,

505
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.410
he was in great idea that begat all the rest of them.
This is the problem to me.

506
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:20.290
It's the motivational problem.
You,
you,
you do a Spiderman.
Oh my,
I left.

507
00:32:20.291 --> 00:32:23.080
The guy killed my uncle.
He's like,
that is that guilt for the rest of his life.

508
00:32:23.081 --> 00:32:25.270
And you can always go,
we did Batman.
My parents died.

509
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:29.680
Like there's just a fundamental flaw.
Superman is just,
that's not there.
It's not,

510
00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:32.110
there's no,
that's simple explanation of why he does what he does.
He's,

511
00:32:32.111 --> 00:32:34.310
he's a mentally healthy hero.
Yeah.

512
00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:39.493
<v 3>I can't,</v>

513
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:46.490
<v 4>at least for a little while,
longer
superman.
Mentally healthy.</v>

514
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:54.340
All right.
So geeking out a little bit.
Frank,
your daredevil

515
00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.810
<v 7>versus your Batman who would win Batman.
Yeah,</v>

516
00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:03.450
no radar.
No white.
Just he beat up superman.

517
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:09.870
All right.
Tom,
you were Batman versus your mister miracle.

518
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:13.840
<v 4>Well,
Mister miracle is not as superhero.
All he does is escape from things.
It's,</v>

519
00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:18.010
it's fairly useless in a fight unless you want to escape from the fight.

520
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:22.310
What do he escape from the fire?
Yeah.

521
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:26.260
Banner would have trouble holding him.
But I think beyond that in the who would,

522
00:33:26.261 --> 00:33:29.490
when Batman is always the,
when where,
who does he lose?

523
00:33:29.491 --> 00:33:31.720
He the only person he loses against this as writers.
Right.

524
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.980
That's why we have the power or his heart.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Oh,

525
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.880
it's like the only person Batman loses against his Batman.

526
00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:42.010
Like that's the,

527
00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.400
that's really the only only way to do it because he,

528
00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:50.390
he represents like this core idea of overcoming things like,
oh,

529
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:52.210
over co coming the worst thing.

530
00:33:52.211 --> 00:33:56.080
So no matter what the worst thing is you throw at them to make it a Batman
story.

531
00:33:56.081 --> 00:33:58.090
He overcomes it.
Yeah.
My,
my first draft

532
00:33:58.270 --> 00:33:58.690
<v 7>of,</v>

533
00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:03.010
of the first dark knight ended up with him dying in a hail of police gun fire.

534
00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:08.340
Um,
and I did,
but it did not become a useful end it because,

535
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.070
no,
I just didn't,
it didn't,

536
00:34:11.071 --> 00:34:14.820
it didn't work the magically or emotionally or anything else.

537
00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:19.140
It wouldn't have been good ending.
So what challenges does that create for you?

538
00:34:19.141 --> 00:34:21.000
Is,
I mean,
when you know going in,

539
00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:26.070
this is the character that is undefeatable that only Batman can be Batman.

540
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:29.810
How do you keep that fresh?
Oh,
I think the bank could die.
Sure.
It's just the,

541
00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:33.450
just the,
the,
the uh,
um,
but no,
keeping it fresh.
Well that's,

542
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:36.300
that's why they have to keep replaying soon as I guess,
you know,

543
00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:39.660
now it's just too much good stuff to do with them.

544
00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:42.060
I mean I think that the,

545
00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:46.030
<v 4>for me it was always trying to find his greatest weakness.</v>

546
00:34:46.031 --> 00:34:49.360
And for me its greatest weakness is that extended family we're talking about.

547
00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:54.070
So I think each writer probably has the challenge of figuring out,
you know,

548
00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.580
what is your interpretation of his biggest flaw

549
00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:59.670
<v 7>one ended.
And these characters are,</v>

550
00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:04.770
these characters that have been around for so long are subject to each writers

551
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.930
interpretation,
each cartoonists interpretation too.
Cause they,

552
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:13.870
they look different,
they and they feel different and they read different.
Um,
and,

553
00:35:13.871 --> 00:35:18.730
and uh,
that keeps them going more than anything.
It's just,

554
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:23.650
I,
I can't imagine,
you know,
people just sticking to one,

555
00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.450
one heroin for 40 years

556
00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:31.960
before we are annual to audience questions one more.
Um,

557
00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.370
well Sean and frank,
you draw the works that you're writing.

558
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:39.660
Does the story influence your art?

559
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:42.390
Do you find that it changes and for the rest of you,

560
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:46.110
does the artist you're working with change how you tell a story?

561
00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:53.300
In my case I'd say yes,
yes,
yes and yes.
Um,
the,
the,
uh,

562
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:58.220
I adapt my art style to the story I want to do.
Um,

563
00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:00.560
and,
and uh,
you know,
with,
with uh,

564
00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.860
switching from Sin City to 300 for instance,

565
00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:07.520
was a switch to a much more linear style because it's going to be a color book,

566
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:12.140
but also big.
Also because color was such an important factor in the story.

567
00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:17.350
The Red Capes were a big part of the story and the Persian enemies,

568
00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.740
the,
the Persians were,
you know,

569
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:24.890
notoriously wealthy and flamboyant and in their costumes and such.

570
00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.840
So it's,
it's you,

571
00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:31.850
you have to adapt to each project you're working on or it becomes boring for

572
00:36:31.851 --> 00:36:33.200
you.
And therefore the audience.

573
00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:39.200
<v 6>I think the secret weapon for me is if I'm writing and drawing my own stuff.</v>

574
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:42.860
Like these guys are a level writers,
a lot of the things that they talk about,

575
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:45.770
I haven't even thought about that yet.
I'm kind of,
I can,

576
00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.610
I can,
he's faking.

577
00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:56.420
I can kind of crank together a plot,
but I only do one a year.
I have to draw it.

578
00:36:56.421 --> 00:37:00.500
And if there's any holes I can just try to draw my way out of them,
you know?

579
00:37:00.501 --> 00:37:03.930
So by,
cause a lot of times when I worked with a different writer is always meets

580
00:37:03.931 --> 00:37:07.970
communications and uh,
it does add up.
Hopefully most readers don't notice it.

581
00:37:07.971 --> 00:37:11.570
But when you're drawing your own,
like you know exactly what the dialogue is,

582
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:16.280
exactly why that facial expression works and that clean connection is something,

583
00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.460
as much as I love working with Scott,
it's never going to be 100%.

584
00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.730
So my failures as a writer,

585
00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:26.600
I think I can make up for them by my connection to myself being the artist.

586
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:30.440
There's stuff I've done in pages where you know Batman's,

587
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:31.810
the lights are out as an ENP.

588
00:37:31.811 --> 00:37:34.310
The hits got them some doing all these crazy things with the art.

589
00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:38.110
Scott doesn't know how to write that panel because you need to visualize it

590
00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.600
first and work backwards like frank can do that.

591
00:37:41.601 --> 00:37:44.240
Cause you know he knows that his artist who was,

592
00:37:44.241 --> 00:37:45.860
who was himself knows how to do that.

593
00:37:45.861 --> 00:37:50.300
But most writers just generally don't think like moment to moment storytelling

594
00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:54.080
or using an illustration that turns into sequential panels.
Like it's tough.

595
00:37:54.081 --> 00:37:56.540
Like you need to talk to your artists to make sure it'll work,

596
00:37:56.541 --> 00:37:58.280
but when you're the same guy all and one,

597
00:37:58.281 --> 00:38:00.800
you can do that stuff more and more effortlessly.
[inaudible]

598
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:03.893
<v 1>so there.</v>

599
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:09.100
<v 7>All right.
We have questions from many of them.
Mike,
set up.</v>

600
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:12.370
<v 1>All right.</v>

601
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:16.590
<v 8>All right.
Thanks so much for coming today.
Thanks for having me.</v>

602
00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.650
This is a question I,
and I've had it.
I've had a lot of art forms,

603
00:38:19.651 --> 00:38:23.020
but I think it's particularly pertinent to you or is it the that Dan,
uh,

604
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.620
when you sit down to write something new,

605
00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.350
do something that has such a long cannon,

606
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.240
do you ever have an idea and say to yourself,
well,

607
00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:34.140
I want to check and see if anyone else has done that before or are you not

608
00:38:34.141 --> 00:38:37.390
deterred by the concept of someone else having tried something and you just want

609
00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:41.800
to make it your own and give it your shot at if you ever walked away from ideas

610
00:38:41.801 --> 00:38:44.140
because they weren't necessarily brand new.

611
00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.380
<v 3>Yeah.
Did I use this program on this?
This is called Google and</v>

612
00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:56.630
miss dope.
It's 100% sure.
I'll have an idea and I'll be like,
this has been done.

613
00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:58.400
Your check is ready.
I will literally,

614
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:01.190
I will literally use Google just to suck up a little bit.
Uh,

615
00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:05.660
I use Google every day,
uh,
to,
to check ideas and to look at the past history.

616
00:39:05.661 --> 00:39:10.150
Cause a second check is ready.
This is Google.
We can do a five checks.

617
00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.890
Is there anything else nice you'd like to say about Google?

618
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:20.330
We don't like to just simply mention its name,
about five.

619
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:26.890
He's told me like Google the crap.
I also,
I have two nerds that are my friends.

620
00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:31.430
They run a podcast called comic Geek speak.
Uh,
um,
that was a plug for my buddies.

621
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.650
That's actually not the name of it.
It's called Gotham by today anyways,

622
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.870
for Geeks anyways.
And I use them as a,

623
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.240
as a brain trust and they just their beer nerds than I am,

624
00:39:41.241 --> 00:39:46.200
which is saying something because they use Google.
No,
they used Yahoo.
Their

625
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:53.130
guts
are my head up.

626
00:39:55.910 --> 00:40:00.590
So yes,
that's a long nerdy suck up question to answer.
I use Google a lot to

627
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:06.200
me.
Three got the checks.
All right.
All right.
Sorry.
I've got a

628
00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:11.300
<v 4>like a full bookshelf of pretty much like every major Batman story that like I,</v>

629
00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:17.400
that meant something to me going up,
uh,
growing up and uh,

630
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:22.530
I spend a lot of time revisiting those stories.
A lot of it is,
uh,

631
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:27.040
is to make sure that I'm not retouch it,
like touching on beats,
uh,

632
00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:27.871
from before.

633
00:40:27.871 --> 00:40:32.871
But it's a lot also me finding the moments that moved me the most in try not to,

634
00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.890
not to recreate them,
but to get into that,

635
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:42.010
that mindset of where I was when I was reading it and how to express what I'm

636
00:40:42.121 --> 00:40:42.990
feeling now.

637
00:40:42.991 --> 00:40:47.940
I think Tom said earlier that it's about putting yourself into it and that's the

638
00:40:47.941 --> 00:40:52.860
thing that's never been,
uh,
been in the comic before.
It's,
it's my perspective.

639
00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:57.890
My Batman is different than everyone else's Batman are because they're,

640
00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:01.200
the stories that matter the most to me.

641
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.670
It's a different constellation are than any of the other writers up here.

642
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.240
Uh,
so that,
like that Batman,

643
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:14.220
how that Batman reacts in this scenario.
Like yeah,
there might be a story,

644
00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:18.630
uh,
from 20 years ago that might touch on some of the same themes and obviously I

645
00:41:18.631 --> 00:41:21.780
don't want to,
I want to be aware of that.
And I don't want to like,
just,

646
00:41:21.781 --> 00:41:26.320
I don't want to make it boring for the reader.
Uh,
but bringing,

647
00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:31.020
like if I,
if I feel like I'm saying something,
uh,

648
00:41:31.021 --> 00:41:34.640
with the story I'm trying to tell and I'm bringing these characters in and we

649
00:41:34.641 --> 00:41:38.290
using like my Batman,
my,
like the,

650
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:42.740
the version of Batman that I hear in my head when I,
when I write like that,

651
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:47.840
that is different.
Um,
so I,
I don't,
I don't concern myself too much with it,

652
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:50.690
but I like,
I am conscious of it.

653
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:52.483
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

654
00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.550
<v 9>Sort of a followup on that to the rest of the people I said,</v>

655
00:41:56.551 --> 00:41:59.130
it sounds like you've kind of grew up in Batman was always three of your

656
00:41:59.131 --> 00:42:02.910
favorite part of the comic universe.
Uh,
but for everyone else,

657
00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:05.100
is that the same for you?
Like you were always,

658
00:42:05.101 --> 00:42:08.550
that was your favorite growing up and you're most drawn to it or were you more

659
00:42:08.551 --> 00:42:12.330
just sort of drawn to comics generally?
Any sort of ended up doing Batman stuff?

660
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.970
<v 3>I was big on super boy and the Legion of superheroes when I was a kid.</v>

661
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:19.270
A great character.
Batman came a lot later,

662
00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:23.350
like the Jim shooter Britain by a 13 year old.
Yeah.

663
00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:26.420
It turns out that I ended up working for that guy.

664
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:30.890
<v 4>For me,
it was Batman in the X.
Men.</v>

665
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:36.220
Like those were the stories that I just gravitated to over and over and over

666
00:42:36.501 --> 00:42:40.700
again,
which is why I'm writing the x men starring the bat family right now.

667
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.200
So I even just,
I stole the danger room because marvel is not using it.
So

668
00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:51.960
<v 3>yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
I started with a</v>

669
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.680
<v 5>x men first and then I was lucky enough to read and this is not,
uh,</v>

670
00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.130
Frank's not going to send me a check.

671
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:03.280
So then I read dark knight returns and that kind of was a game changer for me.

672
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.280
Um,
and then watch men also.

673
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:08.960
And uh,

674
00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:13.310
and then since then I've just wanted to write comics milestone,

675
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:17.780
a lot of the milestones stuff as well.
And um,
so here I am,

676
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:23.970
<v 3>I've came from watching a lot of Batman,
the animated series.
All right.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

677
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:28.370
And yeah,
I feel very,
I did stuff I don't know about comics is scary.

678
00:43:28.371 --> 00:43:29.400
I don't know how I got this bar.

679
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:36.140
I usually check with Scott or her or you or anybody who will listen and I think

680
00:43:36.141 --> 00:43:39.410
I have this great idea and Scott will say,
yeah,
that's a great idea.

681
00:43:39.411 --> 00:43:43.880
I did it last year.
I'm about to do that.
Or I did it years and years ago,

682
00:43:43.881 --> 00:43:46.210
so I just stopped talking about to do that.
That's a horrible answer.

683
00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:52.760
That exact idea is mine.
I'm about to do that.

684
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.863
Great idea.

685
00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:02.540
Yeah.
But then my friend's like,
no,
no,

686
00:44:02.541 --> 00:44:05.240
you can't get into comics without reading the milestone stuff.

687
00:44:05.241 --> 00:44:08.520
So that's when they gave me dark knight and watchman and you know,

688
00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:12.320
some called Baker stuff.
Um,
you know,
a lot of indie stuff too.

689
00:44:12.321 --> 00:44:16.070
You know that since it,
he wanted to all of them,

690
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.530
obviously I'll take that check.

691
00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:23.450
Clean Black and white comics don't give checks.

692
00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:28.190
Do you know when you're writing?
Well,
as opposed to when you were,

693
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.480
are the things you're like,
man,
this is really rolling for me.
This is on the,

694
00:44:31.481 --> 00:44:32.370
this has problems

695
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.470
<v 7>or times when I'm sure it's really good.
Um,</v>

696
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:37.680
and they may be terrible or maybe really good.

697
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:40.890
There are times when I think this isn't really a good when it's certainly not

698
00:44:40.891 --> 00:44:41.724
good

699
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:46.350
<v 3>for me when Scott Snyder heals my ideas.</v>

700
00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:50.390
[inaudible] you made it.

701
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.240
All right.
Thanks guys.
You guys all great.
Thank you.

702
00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:58.350
We have one more quick question we can do.
All right.
Awesome.
Hey guys,

703
00:44:58.351 --> 00:45:02.170
former DC ensuring here.
So thank you.
Let's do meets it.
Thank.
Thank you man.

704
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.233
We got to get to here.

705
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.930
<v 10>Awesome.
Uh,
so it seems like,
you know,</v>

706
00:45:05.931 --> 00:45:10.550
over the last decade or so Batman has become Bruce's like fulltime identity or

707
00:45:10.551 --> 00:45:14.480
job.
I'd love to hear how you guys approach writing like the Batman Persona and

708
00:45:14.481 --> 00:45:16.970
writing the Bruce Wayne Persona and how you balanced that.

709
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.560
<v 7>I mean,
isn't Bruce Wayne actually the mask?</v>

710
00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:27.540
I mean that's,
that's one interpretation.
Maybe it might,

711
00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:32.270
my feeling was always stepped when when Batman retired,

712
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:36.620
Bruce Wayne started dying and Bruce Wayne actually started steadily getting

713
00:45:36.621 --> 00:45:41.540
younger and healthier when he,
when he put the cow back on.
So he,

714
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:44.130
he doesn't feel comfortable and straight cloths.
I don't think

715
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:50.160
<v 4>there's a,
like I forget who described this first,</v>

716
00:45:50.161 --> 00:45:54.600
it may have been mark Waid,
but there's a night like an idea that for both,

717
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.790
uh,
like Batman and superman that had,

718
00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:00.180
cause there's a lot of talk of dual identities,

719
00:46:00.181 --> 00:46:01.860
but that there's actually a kind of,

720
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.890
it's actually a three part system that there is,

721
00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.560
there's Batman or the,

722
00:46:07.561 --> 00:46:10.410
the persona he puts onto frightened criminals in the street.

723
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:12.540
And there's Bruce Wayne,

724
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:16.740
the persona he puts on to mask the fact that he's Batman.

725
00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:21.330
And then there is the strange man in the cave.

726
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:26.480
There's this figure in the cave who was speaking to Alfred who is still

727
00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:31.740
connected to that eight year old boy who is still that eight year old boy,

728
00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:34.530
uh,
that he was before.
But he,

729
00:46:34.531 --> 00:46:38.730
he's driven to be this thing and he's driven to eat.
He's,

730
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:42.010
he's never going to really be able to grow up because he,

731
00:46:42.011 --> 00:46:46.800
he will always be in that moment.
Uh,
and that when he,

732
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:51.330
when he succumbs fully one way or the other,
uh,

733
00:46:51.331 --> 00:46:52.560
it doesn't quite work.

734
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:55.890
He so it's like he needs to stay in touch with that person in the cave,

735
00:46:55.891 --> 00:46:59.490
which is why I think that his relationship with Alfred is so powerful.

736
00:46:59.491 --> 00:47:01.890
Why is relationship with the Robbins is so powerful?

737
00:47:01.891 --> 00:47:05.550
Because they actually know that person and there are very few people who do.

738
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:11.350
<v 3>What about baton might,
where does he fit in?
He's just as big as fan.</v>

739
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:16.020
Don't you find it kind of spooky about how we now casually referred to that?

740
00:47:16.021 --> 00:47:19.780
The robins?
Oh yeah.
I mean,

741
00:47:19.781 --> 00:47:23.470
how many Robbins can do what you added and Robin,
you're not innocent,

742
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:26.220
but I didn't kill her.

743
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:34.480
<v 0>Well,
that's what we have time for.
Thank you very much.
This has been amazing.</v>
