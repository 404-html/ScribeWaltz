1
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.900
Where you're from.

I'm not really,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.910

Beautiful boy.

3
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.020
We're very proud of yourself.
Life.
I'd forgotten

4
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.950
I had another family,
my mother,
my brother.

5
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.350
How can you still see that faces?

6
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.100
I have to find my way back home.
Oh No,

7
00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:14.120
me on the team a couple of days.
Couple of days.

8
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.330
Take a lifetime to search all the stations in India.

9
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.193
Yeah.

10
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.270
Idea what it's like how every day my real brother screams nay

11
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.330
hood that I could take this family together need to survive.

12
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.920
But if you do find

13
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.980
I don't have a choice.

14
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.103
Beautiful.

15
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.770
Every night I imagine that I'm walking those streets and I every single step of

16
00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:07.604
the way.

17
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.740
Whisker and airy.

18
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.870
<v 1>Hi everyone and thanks for joining us here today.</v>

19
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.450
So to celebrate the release of lion on Google play,
uh wait.

20
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.140
I like tee it up in there.
I have to say,

21
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.320
even even watching the trailer gets me even now to,

22
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.290
to to celebrate the launch of lion on Google play.
We have Saru Brierley here,
uh,

23
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.060
to a fireside chat.
So welcome sir.

24
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.410
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

25
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.280
<v 2>Saru Story and work.</v>

26
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.650
We're going to hear a lot more about serious story I think is particularly

27
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:10.630
special for us,
uh,
here at Google Australia.
Um,
and so for a couple of reasons,
uh,

28
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:15.320
you know,
so those surgeries story is a,
is set for a large pot in Tasmania.
A,

29
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.220
so it's a very Australian story.
Uh,
and,
uh,

30
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.770
also as a Google in Australia,

31
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:24.970
we've been working on Google maps for many years now.
Uh,
and so seeing,
you know,

32
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.370
the kind of things that we've contributed to in the world,

33
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.800
I think it's really special for us.
Um,
I think it's also,
it,

34
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.850
it's an amazing kind of representation of what Google's mission has done in the

35
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:39.870
world.
So,
you know,
sort of,
uh,
Google's mission is,
uh,
to,
you know,

36
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.880
to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible.

37
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.110
And through that,
these amazing stories such as surgery story,
uh,
you've,
you know,

38
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:51.130
become possible through things like that.
Things like Google Earth.
Uh,
so,
uh,

39
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:52.810
so we've got Sarah here today.
Uh,

40
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.010
I've got some questions here for Saroo and once some that we've collected from

41
00:03:57.011 --> 00:04:00.550
the dory that was open yesterday and earlier today.
And also later on,

42
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:02.790
we're going to open it up for questions from the floor.
So please,
uh,

43
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.180
have your questions ready for Saru as well.
So welcome through.

44
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.180
And I think just to start,
we sold the trailer just now,

45
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:12.100
but maybe you'd like to give everybody,

46
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.270
especially those people who haven't seen the movie a bit more of an explanation

47
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:20.530
of your story.
Um,
yeah,
that was,
that was really quick,

48
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:25.230
but it's a 10 hour story that's been compressed into two hours.
And um,

49
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.080
now it's probably even more.
Uh,
but,
um,

50
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.710
I lived in the slums of India,
it's 29 years ago,

51
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.830
and I was only about foggies of agents stool over about a meter in hotch.

52
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.280
And One night I went with my brother from my hometown and caught a train to a

53
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.070
like a neighboring station,
uh,
which was a couple of hours,
um,

54
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.890
just down the road.
And,
um,
and um,
and so,

55
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.110
uh,
we got there about nine at o'clock.
Uh,
so I had a nine o'clock and,

56
00:04:56.111 --> 00:05:00.820
um,
and I was quite Todd and sort of weary and sleepy.
I was the money,

57
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.530
sort of five years of age.
And,
and it's past my bedtime.
And,
um,

58
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.950
and so I grabbed my brother's hand and we stepped off the train and onto the,

59
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.790
the station platform and a saw a chair in front of me.

60
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.960
And so a pooled or by other towards it.
And what my feet are doing,

61
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:20.490
the talking is,
is they sort of do when you're tired and,
uh,

62
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.160
and I sat down and roboticists stay here for a minute,
I'll come back to get you.

63
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.720
Um,
I went to sleep and,
um,
and when I wake up,

64
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.210
not knowing whether I was asleep for like,
you know,
two hours,

65
00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:36.100
three hours or more,
but,
uh,
when I wake up,
my brother was nowhere to be seen.

66
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.930
And so,
uh,

67
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.400
I thought he's on the train to just standing there with a wrist of same one that

68
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:46.870
I sort of came from a home town or a different one.
I wasn't,
I wasn't sure of,

69
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.040
but I made that impulse decision,
uh,

70
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.710
groggy impulse decision,
um,

71
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.070
to board the train thinking is on the sort of bordered it went to sleep in a

72
00:05:58.071 --> 00:05:58.760
cubic court,

73
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.760
not knowing that I'm going on a train that has a destination unknown.

74
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.960
So I ended up 32 hours,
um,

75
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.130
1600 kilometers from a safe zone,
um,

76
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.240
to a place called Calcutta where I survive for months.

77
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.250
Going through trials and tribulations of,
uh,
um,
you know,
some of the things of,

78
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.710
uh,
sort of Kemi cross people that said that helped me,
that,

79
00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:27.620
that helped me try and form a hometown,
but the had an ulterior motive.
Um,

80
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.010
and then running away from them and then almost drowning in the Hughley river

81
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:35.270
twice,
um,
thing to sort of coming across boy gangs,

82
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.190
um,
and then going to work a local prison to a juvenile prison to adoption home.

83
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:44.420
And then from there being adopted out to Australia,
Tasmania.

84
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.950
Um,
where I was,
looked after,
loved,
um,

85
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.820
showing the Australian way of life,
the culture and so on.
Um,

86
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.860
but always had that in Australia,

87
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.890
the reminiscing of my past and what an oddity it has been for such a long time,

88
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.030
um,
that I couldn't conceive how a child could sort of get,
uh,

89
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.220
from being with his family to getting on a train and getting lost.
Um,

90
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.170
it just didn't make sense even though it was saddening.
Um,
I had to,

91
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.153
you know,

92
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.200
find the closure of at least giving it a value and a team in trying to form a

93
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:24.950
family,
uh,
whichever ways in the means that I've got at hand.

94
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.210
And so in my later sorta 20 later twenties are found Google Earth.
And,
um,

95
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.610
and you know,
I had that option of looking at atlas,

96
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.850
um,
of trying to find burn poor,

97
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.840
which is the only name that are sort of remembered in the way that articulated.

98
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.100
Um,
but I had a really good visual memories.
Um,
and I thought,
you know,

99
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:49.320
if there's such an application,
um,

100
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.920
that I could use on the Internet that are,

101
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:55.160
could sort of a match what's in my Ma,

102
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.900
in my memories of the landmarks in the architecture of my hometown,
um,

103
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.320
to what I could see on,
you know,
service ways,
Google earth,

104
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.390
then it would make the process so much quicker as opposed to going back to India

105
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.040
and trying to find,
um,

106
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.950
born poor and train station that maybe looks the same,
Eh,
maybe not.

107
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.400
So I went on to Google earth and for years and years or searched from being,

108
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.490
uh,

109
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:27.030
going haphazardly to becoming quite methodical and strategic in the ways that I

110
00:08:27.031 --> 00:08:32.030
thought about,
um,
looking for my hometown.
And in 2011,

111
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.450
I found that needle in a haystack.
Um,

112
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.460
and in 2012 I'm a fan,
my hometown,
um,

113
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.940
as well as my family as well.

114
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.910
So there was a,
there was a quick version,

115
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.120
even though we're going to have,
you know,
20 coffees and,
uh,

116
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.870
and I'll tell you the 10 hour version,
which I'm happy to do so because,
uh,

117
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.290
at Ed Martin Myself.
But,
um,
but yeah,
it's,
uh,
it,

118
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:03.000
it pretty much happened like that.
Um,
so,
but,
um,

119
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.930
I listen to myself but dreams,
um,

120
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.570
my gut feelings and uh,

121
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.880
in my memories as well and the in hope and hope and determination,

122
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.340
um,
I was harness with that.
So,
um,

123
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.650
I think that those sorts of points were quite integral to,

124
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.800
to find what I've been longing for such a long time.

125
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.160
<v 1>It's such an amazing story,
you know,</v>

126
00:09:25.161 --> 00:09:29.870
even even your compressed version like this is just so inspirational.
Um,

127
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.190
it,
the,
the movie has been a huge success worldwide.
What do you think about it?

128
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.030
Uh,
what do you think there is about it that's been,
you know,

129
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.930
so universally acclaimed.

130
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:40.520
<v 2>Um,</v>

131
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.180
there's so many attributes to the movie and people see it in so many different

132
00:09:44.181 --> 00:09:48.860
ways.
It resonates in people with so many different weights.
Um,
from,

133
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.330
I guess,
you know,
political,
just scientific too,
um,

134
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.500
uh,
a,
a movement in the community from,
you know,
um,

135
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:03.350
in regards to adoption from having Ibf,
um,
to having that option,

136
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.220
um,
of adopting as well,
uh,

137
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.720
for couples that want to have children.
Um,
so,
you know,

138
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.570
they're sort of some of the things,
but I mean,

139
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:19.490
people just see it in different ways,
you know,
from hope and determination and,

140
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.770
um,
um,
I guess,
um,

141
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:29.420
that's mainly the two things that I get sort of talked about his adoption,

142
00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:32.940
but other people see it in other ways as well,
you know,
is it,
uh,

143
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.070
do you think nurture or nature kind of thing?
Um,

144
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.810
in regards to him when we bring up children?
Um,
so it,

145
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:46.820
um,
um,
I guess,
you know,
there's so many things.

146
00:10:46.821 --> 00:10:47.654
Where did we start?

147
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.430
<v 1>I wasn't joking when I was saying that watching the trailer,</v>

148
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:52.060
they was tearing me up.
I,
uh,

149
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.770
I have a young son and I found that the beginning of that film,
who's,
who's,

150
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.730
who's seen lion,
I don't know if anybody can him.
Yeah.
Oh,
fabulous.
That's great.

151
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.240
Look everyone at Google and,
uh,
watching,
you know,

152
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:05.790
watching those scenes where you were last on the train and then surviving in

153
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:08.270
Cokato.
We're just heartbreaking.
Just like,
you know,
with,

154
00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:11.240
with my own young son in particular and just couldn't think of anything that was

155
00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:12.240
there was like,

156
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.470
wood is more directly tugging on my heartstrings and seeing somebody go through

157
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:19.130
that.
So I think that is really something very universal,
you know,

158
00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:23.340
and that quest also to,
to try and find your family.
Yeah.
That's,
um,

159
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.410
I guess that particular scene,

160
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.600
<v 2>um,
you could to be a fighter,
you know,</v>

161
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:35.690
and to,
to survive you've got to fight,
um,

162
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:40.920
day by day to live.
And it shocks people when they see a scene like that,

163
00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:42.540
I guess.
And it's like,
you know,

164
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:47.280
we live in a such a lucky world and the country as well that we're not sort of,

165
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.120
uh,
open to what I went through and seeing that kind of scenery.

166
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.500
So it affects people,
you know,
to,
uh,
depths where they've never really gone to.

167
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.450
And,
um,
and I guess,
you know,
we'll probably the whole film does that really,

168
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:06.190
but more particularly a specifically that,
you know,
that scene in Calcutta,

169
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.750
which,
you know,
could have been sort of linkedin as well,
but,
um,

170
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.750
but you saw a glimpse of,
you know,
what it's actually like,

171
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.930
thank you for not making it even.

172
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:23.770
<v 1>Um,
so,
uh,
one part of the film in particular I wanted to dig into was,</v>

173
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.090
was the search saved myself from,
from when you started,
uh,
you know,

174
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.000
thinking that you really wanted to find your hometown and using technology to do

175
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:35.620
so.
I'd love to know more about your process.
You know,
we saw some of this in the,

176
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.200
in the film and I don't know how accurately that's representing it.
You know,

177
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.130
we had maps and these search Radii I,
and,
and,
and so forth.

178
00:12:42.131 --> 00:12:45.820
Can you tell us what was your mindset going in and then what did you,

179
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.890
what did you do?
What,
how did that search work look?

180
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.680
<v 2>Um,
well initially I thought,
you know,</v>

181
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.760
you've got youtube and um,

182
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.630
and you've got access to information as opposed to going to the,

183
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.850
to the library and if you wanted to play the guitar,
why,

184
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.290
why pay a tuition when you can go on to youtube and learn yourself.

185
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.460
And so it all sort of,
you know,
it started from there and I thought,
you know,

186
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:14.280
the Internet has got so much information and one of its Google Earth,
um,

187
00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.870
that are,
could use this application,
um,

188
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.470
as opposed to sort of,
you know,

189
00:13:21.471 --> 00:13:26.300
going to India in paying thousands and thousands of dollars and maybe getting

190
00:13:26.301 --> 00:13:29.120
nowhere ever.
And,
um,

191
00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.470
and so when Google Earth came about,
I thought,
you know,

192
00:13:33.471 --> 00:13:37.280
not knowing what I'm really getting into because once I started using it,

193
00:13:37.281 --> 00:13:41.900
I became quite obsessed and regimented,
uh,

194
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:46.700
finishing work,
coming home at five 30,
um,
putting the laptop,

195
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.860
which my girlfriend at the time called and a fat top,

196
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:53.810
cause I said sat on the couch and there of was,
um,

197
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.770
Dylan was in cook.
Nothing.
So,
um,
until,
you know,

198
00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.390
midnight and early hours of the mornings as well,
uh,

199
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:03.651
to,
you know,

200
00:14:03.651 --> 00:14:07.280
five o'clock and six o'clock in the morning and then get to go to work,

201
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:10.940
even though it was my family business and rob light,
five to five,

202
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:16.070
five o'clock was finishing time.
Um,
and um,
and so,

203
00:14:16.071 --> 00:14:19.650
you know,
you became quite obsessed and um,

204
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:23.940
and not realizing that you shutting the world and a,

205
00:14:23.941 --> 00:14:28.941
a y in concentrating in Toronto find something that she'd been longing for such

206
00:14:29.151 --> 00:14:30.860
a long time.
And,
um,

207
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:35.980
and so from being haphazard relooking looking to becoming methodical,

208
00:14:36.171 --> 00:14:39.680
it's like,
will you know,
you,
you've got to take things a step at a time.

209
00:14:39.681 --> 00:14:43.820
You've got to use what you know and not what you don't know.
And so I knew that,

210
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:48.440
you know,
the trains,
um,
when you know,
ran 70,

211
00:14:48.441 --> 00:14:51.050
60 kilometers an hour roughly,

212
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.660
and then I sorta had a rough guesstimate of that.

213
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:58.910
I was on the train for about 12 hours,
but knowing now it was 32 hours.

214
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.960
So I sort of,
you know,
I didn't really have a lot to go on,

215
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:06.890
but at least a head something to start,
which is better than nothing.

216
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.480
And,
uh,
and so,
you know,
this,

217
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.850
that's the way the radius line that sort of came about.
It seems like,
you know,

218
00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:17.140
point B but you don't know,
point a and,

219
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.490
and I ended up in Calcutta as we all know it.

220
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:25.210
And so perhaps these radius like can help in creating a search to conference.

221
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.473
If,
so,
you know,

222
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.720
I'd put a line out from Calcutta and rod down from north to south and that

223
00:15:33.171 --> 00:15:37.100
created that sort of a hemisphere.
And,
uh,
and I knew that,
you know,

224
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.120
the,
the hometown is not going to be straight on the radius line date,

225
00:15:41.121 --> 00:15:43.730
but it's going to be in an hour roughly.

226
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.100
So they gave a bit of a guidance and so you segregated the north of India,

227
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.100
segregated the south of India.
And,
um,

228
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:57.650
and you know,
you will lift with the sort of a rectangular piece of,
um,

229
00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:01.220
after you know,
years and years of searching and in sort of pushing things apart,

230
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.990
um,
that,
you know,
this is all you're left with.
It's an end.

231
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.180
That radius lawn was almost sort of telling you that,
you know,

232
00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:12.650
this is where he should be looking after segregating those two points north and

233
00:16:12.651 --> 00:16:16.760
south and,
um,
you know,
sort of calling a providence or,

234
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.340
or serendipity,
it's a,

235
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.750
I ended up sort of not that I was ever conceive that I could possibly believe

236
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:29.180
you could have ended up from the west side of India to the east.
Um,

237
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.510
but let's not have any stones unturned and um,

238
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:37.460
and take a shot at looking at the west side of media hits.
So I did.
And,
uh,

239
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:41.840
and I found that needle in a haystack,
which a lot of people thought I couldn't,

240
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:46.580
um,
in 2011 at around two o'clock in the morning.

241
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.640
So,
um,
you know,

242
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:55.130
back when I was a teenager,
I thought to myself,
sort in my later teens that,

243
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.710
um,
atlas is no good for me,

244
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:02.740
but I hope one day that there would be a program not knowing that it's embryonic

245
00:17:03.081 --> 00:17:07.250
at that point of time.
And then in 2005,
2006,

246
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.120
um,
it was there,
the application of Google Earth,

247
00:17:11.121 --> 00:17:15.500
even though I thought about it back then and it became apparent in reality in

248
00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:16.940
2006 when I used it.

249
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:21.790
And so Google earth is the catalyst of,
um,
you know,

250
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.190
finally my family and I'm sure there are other people out there in the world to

251
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.100
that have,
um,
that have used the program to,

252
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.230
to find what they've been long for such a long time.

253
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.940
<v 1>Most of us,
I think it's usually our,
our rooftop,
you know,</v>

254
00:17:33.941 --> 00:17:37.250
we take it for granted when we,
when we start out,
you know,
we,

255
00:17:37.251 --> 00:17:40.320
the first thing that everybody does,
it turns out this is universal.
You know,

256
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.440
the first thing everybody does,

257
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.980
we thought that what they do is go visit the Grand Canyon or the Eiffel Tower or

258
00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:46.270
something like that.
But in truth,

259
00:17:46.271 --> 00:17:50.060
everybody types in their home address if it goes it.
Yup.
Yup.

260
00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.360
<v 2>That is indeed my house.</v>

261
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.850
And in some ways that was actually exactly what you were doing.
Well I did you,

262
00:17:56.851 --> 00:18:00.720
it was a,
exactly the,
the thing that I did.
Um,
I actually saw my mum,

263
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.890
um,
watering the garden.
You guys took a photo in Tazzie.

264
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.983
Yeah.

265
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.610
Did you know that you can feel the gun that he had to have you here but you had

266
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:14.410
somewhere else to find that was a lot harder for you to find them?
Well,

267
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:19.620
but it was a,
it's a starting point and uh,
and you know,

268
00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.580
it's not,
it wasn't as easy as just getting on Google earth and doing what I did.

269
00:18:23.581 --> 00:18:28.530
You had to sorta arm yourself with information and,
um,

270
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.470
you know,
mom and dad were a major part of my lifestyle,

271
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:36.120
fortified with the knowledge of,
uh,
of within May,

272
00:18:36.121 --> 00:18:39.220
really of my understanding and so on.
But you know,

273
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.470
there was other parts to myself too,
to having that sort of,
uh,

274
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.350
a nurturing and push,
um,

275
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:51.540
in wanting to also,
you know,
keep going as well because a lot of people can,

276
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.120
can become,
um,
you know,
this is,
this is just a waste of time.
It's so futile.

277
00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:01.020
And let's give up.
You said it was five years from,

278
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:06.080
from when you started using earth to try and find it until 2011 when you did.

279
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.790
Yes.
How do you keep,
how do you keep going?
That's,
you know,
our,

280
00:19:10.791 --> 00:19:14.110
until a lot of people about it because,
um,
uh,

281
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.340
as well as there's two things to it.
The other thing was,
uh,

282
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.760
the first was a astral projections and a lot of people would find it really hard

283
00:19:23.071 --> 00:19:27.300
and years and years to ever come to that point of astral projection and astral

284
00:19:27.301 --> 00:19:29.760
projection is where you have that out of body experience.

285
00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:34.440
And I had asked for projections,
um,
when I came to Australia,

286
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:39.780
always had that sort of the outer body experience,
um,
of,
you know,

287
00:19:39.781 --> 00:19:40.411
going to sleep.

288
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:45.300
Hence why I wake up in the morning a bear with a sore head because I never

289
00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:46.720
really slept.
Um,

290
00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:50.520
I had this thing in the subconscious going on and coming into astral projection

291
00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:55.521
of going out body space and then materializing at the door of my house where I

292
00:19:57.901 --> 00:20:02.310
was born in going in and hovering over from our family to tell them that are

293
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:07.410
there are my chi in Monte.
I'll see you.
Um,
so,
you know,

294
00:20:07.411 --> 00:20:10.410
there was that in the reoccurring dreams and,
and someone,

295
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.920
I didn't really know what it meant.

296
00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.770
I really didn't tell people until my parents until sort of later on,

297
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.100
but the other sort of,
uh,
integral part two,

298
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:25.050
which are in really tell many people about as well.
Um,
because I just don't,

299
00:20:25.051 --> 00:20:29.460
I have that understand it much,
but having people that are,

300
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.320
um,
ancient philosophers and mathematicians and,
and uh,

301
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:38.770
like,
you know,
Isaac Newton and Nikola Tesla and,
uh,

302
00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:43.740
Pythagoras and all those people,
um,
these people have left a legacy on the cert.

303
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.610
And I've always looked towards him as in like,
you guys have lean,
um,

304
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:53.980
transcended in finding things as well as,
um,
Martin Luther King,
you know,

305
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.200
that these are great people.
And I thought,
you know,

306
00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:01.560
hope I could be like you guys one day too of trying to fulfill something that

307
00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:06.370
I've been wanting for such a long time and um,
and you know,

308
00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:11.371
read about them in so on and in there a real inspiration to me because when you

309
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:15.670
have Kenya West and Nikola Tesla,

310
00:21:15.671 --> 00:21:17.200
everyone know who's Kenya Wiz,

311
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.530
but no one would really know who this other person is.
Tesla,

312
00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:23.100
it was actually a pretty good rapper.
Oh,
was it?
Yeah.
Yeah.

313
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.680
Um,
um,
but yeah,
it was a great philosopher to,
um,

314
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.900
um,
but yeah,

315
00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:39.400
these people were sort of a quite integral part of my life to,

316
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:40.570
um,

317
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:45.570
they helped in making me want to keep going because they didn't stop.

318
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:51.040
They kept on going and not having much help from other people too.

319
00:21:51.041 --> 00:21:52.930
It's a very autonomously tribe.

320
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.530
And so for you was the autonomous as well?
Like A,

321
00:21:56.531 --> 00:22:00.970
I'm hearing about this amazing internal drive that you had w you know,

322
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.510
did anybody else help you through this,
that,
what you did you get friends to,

323
00:22:04.511 --> 00:22:08.740
you know,
look on earth as well?
Was it was,
it was,
it was all by myself.
You know,

324
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:13.770
I didn't want to tell many people about it because I thought by telling people,

325
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:15.970
even to my parents,

326
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:21.300
they would slow me down and I would go through the phase and stage and the steps

327
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:26.640
that I need to go,
even though sometimes,
or maybe sort of veering away.
Uh,

328
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.390
but it's all a learning curve.
You know,
if I make a mistake,
we'll,

329
00:22:29.391 --> 00:22:33.850
I've learned something that I can sort of realign myself in going the directions

330
00:22:33.851 --> 00:22:34.684
that are need to.

331
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:39.700
So I thought that by telling people that would slow me down by Saru,

332
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.080
look,
that's the past.
This is now,
and it's the future.
Forget about the past.

333
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.580
Um,
you know,
it,
you're in a lucky place with a great family.

334
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.390
Um,
and um,
and you know,

335
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:57.780
I think your past is sort of really putting it down into progressing in your

336
00:22:58.061 --> 00:23:02.980
life.
And,
um,
and,
and,
you know,
if I had listened to them,

337
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:07.900
even though we're just trying to look after me as friends,
would,
um,
maybe,

338
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:11.770
you know,
I wouldn't be here in this story,
would be never,
never come about.

339
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.100
But you know,
I didn't,
I didn't want to listen.
You know,

340
00:23:15.101 --> 00:23:19.330
I wanted to do something that I wanted to do the think outside the square that

341
00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:21.530
you're living and um,
and,

342
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:26.500
and listen to your mind and you've got feelings of that.
Um,
so,

343
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:32.820
so,
so yeah,
it's,
uh,
it's,
it's one of those things that,
you know,

344
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:38.280
you've got to sort of do yourself and I'm not other people have you influence.

345
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.610
Um,
but,
um,
it was,
it was a personal journey,

346
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:47.840
a story like this of a,
of my paths.
He just don't tell to anyone.
You know,
it's,

347
00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.990
it's private.
Um,

348
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.210
and I'm sure we all have private stories that were not want to tell your best

349
00:23:53.211 --> 00:23:56.660
friend or your mom,
but I'm in the,

350
00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.880
this was my private story that,
you know,

351
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:03.500
I wanted to do things myself and I didn't want to shoot too far ahead of myself.

352
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:07.360
It's like,
you know,
hey,
I'm using Google earth and this is,

353
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:10.520
people would come up and say,
oh,
why don't you do these,
why you do that?

354
00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.480
And it becomes very cluttered and you've got to,
you know,

355
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:18.290
sort of defragment you tried to defragment yourself,

356
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.690
let alone have other people's problems coming in and influences,
you know,

357
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.640
I achieved better by myself.
Um,

358
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:31.270
acquiring knowledge from other people but not have other people sort of invest

359
00:24:31.641 --> 00:24:36.140
themselves healthy.
So you were just five when you,

360
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.020
when you left your home or when you,
you,
you're on the train.

361
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.850
What were the memories that you took with you that you used later on?
You know,

362
00:24:43.851 --> 00:24:44.790
what were the things that,

363
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:48.290
that you were able to keep with you that when you were doing your search helped

364
00:24:48.291 --> 00:24:50.940
you,
helped you find your home?
The,

365
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:55.460
the bond between mother and son and,
and my siblings,
especially my sister,

366
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.940
you know,
that there was a,
there was a,

367
00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.610
there was fused pretty well,
you know,

368
00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:06.500
I wasn't a child that was taken and then,
you know,

369
00:25:06.501 --> 00:25:08.900
sort of let go of I was,
I was the last chart.
Not,

370
00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.960
not that was any fault of my own.
Um,

371
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.920
I suppose it would have been a different situation if I was just had been sort

372
00:25:15.921 --> 00:25:17.960
of handed over and said,
you know,
punch it anymore,

373
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.210
it would have been a totally different story.
Um,

374
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.650
but the yearning of wanting to,
you know,

375
00:25:24.651 --> 00:25:27.860
find my mother and especially,
you know,

376
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:32.640
my sister as well because I was her carer.
Um,
the,
you know,

377
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.110
there was a major drive as in when it comes to family,

378
00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.450
will number would ever let go of family.

379
00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:42.350
And I didn't want to be disrespectful to my adoptive family,

380
00:25:42.351 --> 00:25:46.510
but in my letter age,
you know,
I'm sort of coming up to 30 and I'm an adult.

381
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.990
Um,
it's,
I mean,
I didn't tell them about my searching,

382
00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:56.090
um,
but until I sort of,
you know,
sort of later on had,

383
00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.470
um,
achieve what I wanted to achieve.
And then what a toll ideal.
Actually,

384
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:02.690
I told them it's like a farmer high intense.

385
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.220
Is it okay with your permission that I go back and,
you know,

386
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:10.230
and they gave me their permission.
It's,
yes,
we would do that,

387
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:14.390
would want the same thing.
Um,
if were in your position.
So,

388
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.770
um,
so it was all to do with family really,
you know,
and,
um,

389
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.990
and not to give up,
um,

390
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.360
as well as to diffuse those weights on my shoulders that had been there for such

391
00:26:26.361 --> 00:26:30.400
a long time,
which was driven from wanting to,
you know,

392
00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:35.300
find out that my mother's okay.
And she's still alive.
And my sister as well,

393
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:39.880
you know,
she was so tiny,
so little to watch your fingers and if in a fake,

394
00:26:39.881 --> 00:26:43.150
because there,
so Marie and she was waiting charcoal and uh,

395
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.230
because there was no food,
I couldn't provide anything.

396
00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:51.150
I'm just thinking about it,
which is,
you know,
put tears to your eyes.

397
00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.520
So when you did find your hometown on Google Earth,

398
00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.160
how recognizable was it?
Because you know,
the,

399
00:26:59.161 --> 00:27:04.161
the imagery presumably was a lot different from when you had left and you know,

400
00:27:04.441 --> 00:27:07.320
and that your memories of it from what you had left,
you know,
how did,

401
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:11.400
how did you really know that you'd found the right place?
Um,

402
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:18.210
I'm a great person with convincing myself with three things.

403
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:22.890
Um,
so when I saw it for the first time in the subconscious,

404
00:27:22.891 --> 00:27:27.030
I know it's the place,
but also wanted to see it from,

405
00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.760
um,
a video which was youtube.

406
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:34.350
And so I just taught the name and then all of a sudden there was people going

407
00:27:34.351 --> 00:27:39.030
through Canva,
my home town camcorder,
high definition too.

408
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.170
And,
um,
and I was like,
where that's like,

409
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:48.510
he can't be any more convinced.
And additionally to that,

410
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.460
I went onto Facebook and typed in Conway and there was,
um,

411
00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.870
Canva is my hometown,
um,

412
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.100
home homepage or Facebook page.

413
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:03.210
And I wrote to the administrator asking you all these questions and he's coming

414
00:28:03.211 --> 00:28:08.100
back with positive answers.
So there was,
there was Google earth,

415
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:12.960
there was Facebook,
there was youtube and you know,
that consolidated,

416
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:18.360
um,
it really,
everything is in like,
even though I was feeling quite,

417
00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:23.580
this is not right steal,
but hey,
I really love hearing that,
that it's,

418
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.640
you know,
in the,
in the movie it's all very much about,
you know,

419
00:28:26.641 --> 00:28:28.200
you're matching up the imagery and so on.

420
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.300
But the other sources that you're talking about,

421
00:28:30.301 --> 00:28:31.740
things like youtube and Facebook,

422
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:36.580
just point to the way that the Internet has really transformed information these

423
00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.060
days.
Right?

424
00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:41.610
Like we have this expectation that we can go on and find anything,

425
00:28:41.611 --> 00:28:43.680
as you said about,
uh,
you know,
whether it's a,

426
00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.090
a youtube video to help you learn guitar or somebody walking down the streets of

427
00:28:48.091 --> 00:28:52.890
your hometown on the other side of the world.
It's all out there.
Yeah.

428
00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:57.350
Well,
I certainly embraced it,
you know,
um,
I,

429
00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:02.040
I think,
you know,
I mean,
there wasn't any other way really.
And uh,

430
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:06.480
and imagine what the earth could be like if everyone else sort of felt like that

431
00:29:06.481 --> 00:29:10.560
too,
of,
um,
of,
uh,
just using sort of the,
the,

432
00:29:10.561 --> 00:29:15.180
the Internet and whatever they wanted to find.
Um,
yeah.
So,

433
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.440
and to understand something which is different from your own situation too,

434
00:29:19.441 --> 00:29:22.650
to see something,
you know,
that's not just your hometown,
you're not your,

435
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:27.000
where you live yourself,
but something else where in the world.
Yeah.
Um,

436
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:32.550
can you,
um,
can you describe how it felt when you,

437
00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:34.080
when you got there and you know,
when,

438
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.350
when you really knew that you were there standing in your home?

439
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:41.740
I can't fathom what that would,
it would feel like I'd,
I'd love to hear from you.

440
00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:45.560
You know,
it's such a pivotal moment.
And um,

441
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.400
and um,
it was,
uh,
I got to my hometown,
uh,

442
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:55.410
through my bag in the corner of the hotel and it came to a,

443
00:29:56.651 --> 00:29:59.580
a,
a spot where I sort of,
uh,

444
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:04.540
always went to before either going to sort of the city or going back to home.

445
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:08.770
So it was,
it sort of a central spot for everyone really,
um,

446
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.610
going to the city and suburbia.
And this was in your memory from,

447
00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.250
from when you were five?
You can,
you can,
I mean,
pointing,

448
00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:17.140
it's the landmark that I would go to all the time.

449
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:20.860
And so as soon as I got to this landmark,
which is sort of the,
uh,

450
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:23.980
bridge with an underpass,
um,

451
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:29.050
my legs head sort of muscle memory and they just guided me,

452
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.190
you know,
I'm looking around thinking,
you know,
this place looks really different,

453
00:30:33.191 --> 00:30:37.690
but you know,
these legs knew everything amazing.
And,
um,

454
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:43.060
and they were just taking me to,
to the,
the,
the door of my,

455
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:48.010
you know,
my house where I was born and,
um,
and I'm trying to fight,
you know,

456
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:50.200
in a sort of a,
a state of,

457
00:30:50.201 --> 00:30:55.030
in differences in why does everything looks so small and decayed as well.

458
00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.640
Um,
and it's been 25 years and things just don't last forever.

459
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:03.520
And you know,
houses have sort of fallen apart,

460
00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:08.910
crumbled and a new houses on top of the old houses have been built upon.

461
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.130
Um,
and things look small.
It's because,
you know,

462
00:31:12.131 --> 00:31:15.610
when you were so short with small,
um,
everything looks so big,

463
00:31:15.611 --> 00:31:19.770
but now he's so tall,
everything would just look so small and,
um,

464
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.170
it's a,
you know,
you,

465
00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:25.570
you were sort of finding that and it's like I'm extrapolating,
um,

466
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:31.090
in,
in,
in trying to make sense of things.
But when I got to,

467
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.710
you know,
uh,
the front door and it looked a bit sort of,
um,

468
00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.580
there's no one there and worst,

469
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.460
the worst sort of got into you and thought you know,

470
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:44.410
their data and move somewhere else or they're not alive anymore.
Um,
and then,

471
00:31:44.411 --> 00:31:48.970
you know,
a few people came along and asked,
um,
questions about,
you know,

472
00:31:48.971 --> 00:31:51.100
who are you and where you're from and what you're doing and what you're looking

473
00:31:51.101 --> 00:31:53.080
for.
Um,
and then,
you know,

474
00:31:53.081 --> 00:31:57.070
that process of telling them who I am in,
um,

475
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:01.840
where I'm from and who my family members,
um,
uh,
began.

476
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.910
And so,
so that,
that,

477
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:10.780
that point where I was standing in front of the door of my house,

478
00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:13.660
it's the same point where I was,
uh,

479
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.680
before leaving to catch that train 25 years ago.

480
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:22.810
Um,
to burn poor before I went onto their fry for night to Calcutta.

481
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:27.400
So,
uh,
there's a lot of,
um,
uh,

482
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:29.950
recurrences and,
um,
you know,

483
00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.400
but this happened then in 25 years.

484
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:36.780
This happened again at the same spot.
So,
uh,

485
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:41.790
themes always come in that I'm signed to realize from an outsider looking in,

486
00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.560
but amazing.
Um,

487
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:50.710
I'd like to switch now and ask you some questions from Googlers here and also

488
00:32:51.111 --> 00:32:55.010
across a atrium and a in the Pacific.
Uh,

489
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.593
so here's one.

490
00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:00.800
How has the technology changed from when you were on your search and do you

491
00:33:00.801 --> 00:33:05.530
think it would be any easier for you today?
Yes.
You know,

492
00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:09.770
be a d the high definition I guess.
Um,

493
00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.830
or plus the in regards to Google earth or movies out,

494
00:33:12.831 --> 00:33:15.770
you can just watch the movie and he had no,
yeah,
that's,
that's,

495
00:33:15.771 --> 00:33:20.650
that's the other piece I didn't think about,
but um,
but it Gusta Google Earth,

496
00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:25.540
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good analogy overall.
Um,
I mean it is,

497
00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:30.080
it's just so much out there really.
And then where do you start?
Um,
but I think,

498
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:35.150
you know,
it's up to the person really the wants to know,
um,

499
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.260
it's up to them to press that button and wanted to search for things and so on.

500
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:43.070
Um,
it's at the touch of your fingers,
everything that we want,

501
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:47.150
but it's really up to you really if you want it to,
um,

502
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:50.980
venture into that journey of,
um,
I don't know,

503
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:55.540
expanding your mind.
Yeah.
Um,

504
00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:59.330
people in this office are working on apps for what's described as the next

505
00:33:59.331 --> 00:34:00.164
billion users.

506
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:04.010
So this is people in developing nations such as India who starting to access the

507
00:34:04.011 --> 00:34:05.720
internet mostly on mobile phones.

508
00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:10.130
What services or features do you think would be useful if you were a young

509
00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:14.830
person living in India today?
Ooh,
I love these brands.

510
00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.710
Brian bursting question.
Um,

511
00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:23.650
as a young person,
I mean there's this,
uh,
you know,

512
00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:28.170
such a different degree of,
you know,
from poverty to people,
um,

513
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.890
in the sectors of society and their availability to access,

514
00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.690
um,
even if even a phone,

515
00:34:35.691 --> 00:34:39.710
I guess starters before even going into applications.

516
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:43.070
Um,
so,
but I mean,

517
00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:47.950
the cost is everything isn't it these days.
Um,
and the,
the,

518
00:34:47.951 --> 00:34:52.490
the availability of
having that sort of,
um,

519
00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.200
something that is cost effective and attainable for a kid,
I guess?
Um,

520
00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.420
it is a big question.
So,
um,

521
00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:05.540
if I was in the situation as my nieces and nephews are,
um,

522
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:11.750
I guess I'm not too sure,
just it'd be a cost factor.
Yeah.
Yeah.

523
00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:13.310
Because not everyone can afford it.

524
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:18.170
Have you spent much time back there since you've found your original family?

525
00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:23.090
15 times.
I've been back within the four years,
um,
which has been great because,

526
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:27.680
you know,
the,
the big tent event in Delhi,
you know,
went back,
um,

527
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:28.970
to do a talk there,

528
00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:34.340
which allowed me to go and see my family and then also with the book and going

529
00:35:34.341 --> 00:35:38.280
back and we tracing everything with Marcos rider,
um,

530
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.890
which allowed me again to see my family and then,
um,
the movie as well.
Um,

531
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:48.690
as well as,
you know,
literally fests and other events.
So it's been,

532
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:53.500
it's been really good to,
um,
to have all these things.
And uh,

533
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.860
on the side I've always gone to see my family.
But,
um,
additionally to that too,

534
00:35:57.861 --> 00:36:01.100
I've,
I've seen the orphanage as well,
quite a lot.
Um,

535
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.840
there has to be harmony and um,

536
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:07.990
and I've been quite sort of grateful for um,

537
00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:11.490
what's happened to me but there are children out there,
um,

538
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.760
you know their stories a little bit different and it's what's happened to them

539
00:36:14.761 --> 00:36:17.610
too.
So helping at the orphanage is a major,

540
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:21.170
major thing that I want to do and have been me um,

541
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:22.990
as well as well as seeing my family too.

542
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.870
<v 1>I'm going to open up to the floor here in Sydney as well.</v>

543
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:31.370
I'm sorry for the people in other offices that I can't move it up to you.
Um,

544
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:36.530
there's a couple of microphones and I see a first question up here and then a

545
00:36:37.111 --> 00:36:38.400
second one over on this side.

546
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:45.300
<v 3>Hello.
Thanks for coming.
First of all,
amazing story.
I just wanted to ask,</v>

547
00:36:45.301 --> 00:36:49.050
have you had a chance to try Google earth in there recently?

548
00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:51.210
Recently released a virtual reality?

549
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.510
Reminds me of what you were saying about astral projection.

550
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:57.960
It's quite a powerful experience even for someone who doesn't have the,

551
00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.080
the story that,
that you have.
If you haven't tried it,
we'd be happy to show you.

552
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:06.150
<v 2>Is that the,
uh,
the liquid?
This is the via other VR.
Oh,
no,
no,
I haven't.</v>

553
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.510
I haven't,
but,
um,
but yeah,
sure.

554
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:13.290
I'd love to love to try it as long as not scary is that,
you know what I did,

555
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:16.030
we're sending you home with a daydream view today.
Sorry.

556
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:20.940
We should be getting hung up on Google Earth on Vr soon.
That'd be fun.
Love to,

557
00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:22.410
yeah,
I haven't tried to get butter.

558
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:26.170
<v 3>Okay.
And there was a question just over here as well.</v>

559
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:30.450
Thanks so much for coming here.
Awesome.
Listen to you.
Um,
I,
I,

560
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.020
he went about a lot of people who come into a bet with like bad circumstances or

561
00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:39.070
big sort of setbacks and they almost become fearless afterwards because they

562
00:37:39.071 --> 00:37:41.830
know that they probably won't hit that low again.

563
00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.520
And you talk about your ambition to kind of leave a legacy in the same night as

564
00:37:45.521 --> 00:37:46.510
Tesla and these guys,

565
00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:51.070
I'm wondering if your experience has made you somewhat fearless against the kind

566
00:37:51.071 --> 00:37:54.880
of threats that would,
or that the setbacks that you could face in that pursuit.

567
00:37:56.350 --> 00:38:01.350
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah.
I guess,
you know,
being in,
being in Calcutta,
um,</v>

568
00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:06.310
you had to be fearless and,
um,
now being an adult,
you know,

569
00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:10.300
um,
I guess that's sort of being in a lucky country.
Um,

570
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:14.290
and you become,
I don't know,
it was sort of

571
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:21.070
more fear I guess,
because you're not in the,
um,

572
00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:27.250
you're not in the same world,
in the same realm.
Um,
you know,
there's,

573
00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:31.850
there's India which you,
you know,
you far to serve.
Our thing is Australia.
Um,
it,

574
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:35.740
you know,
it's a westernized world as opposed to,
you know,

575
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:40.750
in a different world.
Um,
and,
and I guess I've become a bit soft.

576
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:45.850
Um,
but it,
that Saru as a child,
you know,

577
00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:50.350
as a five year old,
a contending what he did reminds me of like,

578
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:53.830
you know,
if Saru saw you now kind of thing,

579
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:57.610
I'm getting scared in front of a spotter,
he'd be like,
he'd be shame on you.

580
00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:00.670
You know what I mean?
So he always reminds me,

581
00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:05.390
he's that little guidance to give me strength or the time.
Um,

582
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:10.030
you sometimes we get,
um,
but yeah,
I mean,
um,

583
00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:13.030
I'm very lucky to have them.
So even though it's me,

584
00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:16.780
he reminds me of self is like,
look what you've,
uh,

585
00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:20.440
look what you've done and what look what you've conquered and what you've been

586
00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:23.950
through and so on.
And,
um,
so,

587
00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:28.450
so I always get reminded by him.
Yeah.
I thought,
I see question.

588
00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.940
He's really,
thank you so much for coming in.
I really enjoyed listening to you.

589
00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:37.780
I've got,
I'd love to hear more about what your family are doing now,

590
00:39:37.781 --> 00:39:42.400
your mom and your sister and what they're up to.
Yeah,
look,
Hey,
look,

591
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:47.120
one of the things is I bought my mom house and um,

592
00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:54.430
um,
you know,
before when I was,
uh,
as children,
we couldn't afford anything really.

593
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:59.330
We lived on renting and,
uh,
and having milk,
um,

594
00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.980
pre match the most,
you know,

595
00:40:01.981 --> 00:40:04.060
something's sustainable as opposed to other things as well,

596
00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:07.780
which we couldn't afford.
But I built her a house.
I bought her a house,

597
00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:10.420
which is the same house,
um,
you know,

598
00:40:10.421 --> 00:40:14.410
that she's been living in for the last 25 years.
And,
um,

599
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:18.340
and she didn't want her to move to another house.
She wanted to stay there.

600
00:40:18.341 --> 00:40:23.020
Her friends are close by.
Um,
I helped my sister out,
I helped my brother out.

601
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:28.390
Um,
and they've,
you know,
they've got houses will,
um,
and helping,

602
00:40:28.391 --> 00:40:31.180
you know,
my niece and nephews as well,
um,

603
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:35.770
for sort of school league and someone.
Um,
so,

604
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:40.870
you know,
there,
there are,
there were,
they're doing okay.
So,
um,

605
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.430
I'm happy to do that in term and why wouldn't anyone else do the same thing

606
00:40:45.431 --> 00:40:46.264
anyway?

607
00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:53.370
<v 4>So my question was actually very similar,
um,
about your family.</v>

608
00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:57.440
Obviously this is a very incredible story and a story that the world has

609
00:40:57.441 --> 00:41:00.830
attached itself to and wants to hear in his care that some international

610
00:41:00.831 --> 00:41:02.160
attention,
um,

611
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.990
and your family is very excited now that you found them and you're reconnected.

612
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:08.120
How do they feel about the,

613
00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:11.570
the international exposure of this story?

614
00:41:11.571 --> 00:41:14.540
Is it something that is,
you know,

615
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:18.230
difficult for them or do they really want to share it?

616
00:41:18.231 --> 00:41:20.240
And I imagine that that's a very personal thing.

617
00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.780
<v 2>My biological family.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look.
Um,
I don't,</v>

618
00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:28.820
I don't think they really understood the extent of what this story is globally

619
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:34.430
in the book and the movie.
Um,
um,

620
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:39.230
I think that there's just very conservative people,
um,
and,

621
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:44.060
and,
um,
and I don't think it's sort of hit them,
um,

622
00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:49.070
until sort of now of what it really is and,
and how sort of,
uh,

623
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:53.980
amazing ease to people.
Uh,
it's a unique,
profound story.
And,
um,

624
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:57.380
and I guess they're a bit like me to,
you know,
seeing is believing.
You know,

625
00:41:57.381 --> 00:42:00.380
I heard a lot of things,
but,
you know,
sorry.
It's,
uh,

626
00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:05.760
it made my feelings change and so now it's really hit them in days.

627
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:10.310
They're just,
um,
they're quite sort of a,
you know,
like,
wow,
really,

628
00:42:10.311 --> 00:42:12.790
this is my son.
This is us,
the story about,
um,

629
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:18.860
what has happened.
So,
um,
but you know,
that they're,
they're humbling,
great,

630
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:23.370
full about everything.
And I think the end of the day for them is really,
um,

631
00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.300
that,
you know,
I'm back in their lives.

632
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:31.410
<v 1>I,
how are you sleeping patterns now?
Like,
Oh,</v>

633
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:35.320
where do I start?
I mean,
I just got in from Bahrain last night,

634
00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.980
not building sandcastles,
but,
um,

635
00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:43.780
once you found your home town,
yeah,
it did.

636
00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:45.920
<v 2>Um,
the,
you know,</v>

637
00:42:45.921 --> 00:42:50.921
the weights on much shoulders diffused and those dreams of the astral projection

638
00:42:52.821 --> 00:42:55.910
or that stopped,
I don't have them anymore.

639
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:57.950
I haven't had them for four years.

640
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:03.950
So I mean that,
that gives me a better sleep.

641
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:05.503
I guess.

642
00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:11.270
<v 1>I'm not,
so you sort of moody in the morning,</v>

643
00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:12.613
not wanting to,

644
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:17.340
<v 2>um,
do my sort of chores in the house,</v>

645
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:19.650
um,
back then.

646
00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:24.990
But you know what,
actually just expand on that.

647
00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:29.850
Having those astral projection isn't always a good thing for people,
you know,

648
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.390
having to,
uh,

649
00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:36.660
having flashes come back at you during the night and during the day,

650
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:38.203
um,

651
00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:43.310
it's not having a photographic memory of things isn't always great of being

652
00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.450
retold something that you don't want to see anymore or think about anymore.

653
00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.630
So,
but I'm very fortunate,
lucky that,
you know,

654
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:56.370
those astral projections and dreams were there for a reason,

655
00:43:56.371 --> 00:44:00.990
a guidance from our brother there was pushing and pulling the,

656
00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:04.740
the energy of the universe,
you know,

657
00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:09.270
being there to the planets or celebrity or beans aligning in a way,

658
00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:13.320
um,
to,
to find my way back home.

659
00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:19.480
<v 1>I haven't got to quick hypothetical questions.
The first is,</v>

660
00:44:19.481 --> 00:44:19.960
uh,

661
00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:24.520
how long would you have kept on looking at you not found him after five years.

662
00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:27.280
And the second is if you could guide yourself,

663
00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:31.800
your five year old self to get on the right train,
would you have done or

664
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:36.480
<v 2>would you just keep going on the wrong train?</v>

665
00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:42.050
Um,
I would have searched,
you know,
until the dialer died.

666
00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:46.320
So it's not something I would've given up when I,
when I came across something.

667
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.020
Um,
I don't give up,
you know,

668
00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:53.490
I believe that everything is possible in this world.

669
00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:57.320
Um,
it's,
life is just a jigsaw.

670
00:44:57.370 --> 00:45:01.320
What we want to do in finding things,
whatever it may be.

671
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:05.430
As crazy as it sounds,
there's,
there's a way of getting there.

672
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:10.380
It's just takes time to get there.
Um,
so for me,
you know,
oh,

673
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:14.190
I would have,
would have kept on going.
Um,

674
00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:16.230
but in regards to the train,
you know,

675
00:45:16.231 --> 00:45:21.231
sometimes sometimes catching the wrong train can get you to the right station.

676
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:27.200
And that's how,
I guess it was for me,
even though I went through,
uh,

677
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:30.990
so much trials and tribulations that came out at the end,
uh,

678
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:34.290
from my mother's adoptive mother's perspective,

679
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:38.430
traumatized but are disassociated myself,
you know,

680
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:42.930
even though I always had the memories and it,
but I didn't let them overtake me.

681
00:45:42.931 --> 00:45:45.780
So,
um,
uh,
you know,

682
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:51.140
I guess it was just my destiny to go through what I did and,

683
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:55.170
uh,
and it,
it just happened that way.
You know,

684
00:45:55.171 --> 00:46:00.150
some of it not so sort of a fruitful and nice,
but you know,

685
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:06.090
it just happened that way and let's not sort of cry over spilled milk.

686
00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:10.530
<v 5>So,
um,</v>

687
00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:13.860
one of the soon as it touched me in the film was when you set off the train and

688
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:17.170
spoke a different language to the people who surrounded you.
Um,

689
00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.490
I'm just curious as to,
uh,
do you recall any of it?

690
00:46:20.491 --> 00:46:22.710
I think it was Hindi in the films where it's presented.

691
00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.370
Do you still speak in Hindi?
Do you remember any of you learned 10,

692
00:46:25.371 --> 00:46:27.120
he's since been reconnected with your family?

693
00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:29.450
<v 2>Yeah,
look,
um,</v>

694
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:35.320
I only knew about six to seven words of Hindi.
That's it.
I can't even,

695
00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:39.370
I couldn't even string a sentence together and hence,
you know,

696
00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:44.390
I couldn't articulate,
uh,
being coming to Calcutta was,
uh,

697
00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:49.250
it,
you speak Bengali there.
So I didn't speak Bengali and,
um,

698
00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:52.810
only spoke sort of,
um,
you know,
a few words of helion.
That's it.

699
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:57.310
My best friend was my sister.
She couldn't even talk anything saying,

700
00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:02.890
and,
um,
and so it was,
um,
you know,
that that was against me.

701
00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:05.800
And,
um,
and you know,

702
00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:10.660
the first thing that you learned as a child is what's your mom's names?
Uh,

703
00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:14.140
your last name,
your father's name,
financial and the street that you live in.

704
00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:19.180
But I didn't have that,
you know,
my knowledge was very minimal.
Um,

705
00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:22.240
and I had to use more visual memories,

706
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:26.910
which will Hartness as opposed to my auditorium.
And,
um,

707
00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:31.690
and that's why I have these memories of my past in the hometown and the

708
00:47:31.691 --> 00:47:36.670
architecture of the place and so on.
So,
um,
so yeah,

709
00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.310
a cow.
Carter was,
uh,
was very difficult.
You know,

710
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:43.540
it was a no one would understand what I was saying really.
Um,

711
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:48.490
but when I asked her,
you know,
foreign poor,
no one would know.
It's like,
where,

712
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:53.620
what's next?
It's been fine.

713
00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:58.530
I determination commitment to a cause.
What's Nice,

714
00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:04.360
uh,
well it's a bit crazy,
but I want to get into physics.

715
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.680
So,
um,
space propulsion.
Yeah.

716
00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:12.550
I'm not going to shoot myself what I'm going to do with it,
but you know,
that's,

717
00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:15.850
um,
that's a,
that's a bit ahead of my time,

718
00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.500
but that's next for me.
But,
um,

719
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:23.670
I'm learning the process of writing the Prequel to line,
uh,

720
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.880
which is talking about,
um,
how,
um,

721
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:32.910
from adoptive mother to my biological mother to Serratia sued the lady that,

722
00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:38.530
um,
that helped,
you know,
at the orphanage,
uh,
to get to me,
to Australia.

723
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:41.970
Um,
how they're all sort of related and,
uh,
from,
you know,

724
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.760
states apart to oceans apart and how,
um,

725
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:50.080
their dreams and what they want to do in life in regards to helping children has

726
00:48:50.081 --> 00:48:54.350
come about.
Um,
you know,
from Serratia sued.
He's the,

727
00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:59.250
the owner of the orphanage in India,
Isa.
Um,
how no,

728
00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:02.620
she three went through her trials and tribulations,
um,

729
00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:06.070
with another trailer tracer helping her out and so on.

730
00:49:06.071 --> 00:49:10.390
And then wanting to go out by herself and her family situation as well from

731
00:49:10.391 --> 00:49:13.030
being a lawyer,
um,

732
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:17.860
to wanting to help children in India that are in so much need.
So I think,

733
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:22.180
um,
putting,
you know,
the prequel out the story,

734
00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:27.400
uh,
uh,
a book first and then hopefully,
maybe next,
um,

735
00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:32.320
would really make people understand even more in depth what lines about as well.

736
00:49:32.321 --> 00:49:34.060
Because it,
it goes even deeper.

737
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.740
So there's that aim mol crazy thing as well.

738
00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:43.720
I think that's a really great place for us to wrap up.
So Sarah,

739
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:47.380
thank you so much for your time and coming in.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah.
