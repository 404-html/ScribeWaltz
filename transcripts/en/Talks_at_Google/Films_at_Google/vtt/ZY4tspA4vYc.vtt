So I'll welcome the toxic go guys.
I'm Kevin Valex.
So we have of course,

8
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:39.390
a deck Sheppard and I'm Michael Pena for chips.
So let's walk on it,
right?

9
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.593
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.000
<v 2>Uh,
hello to everyone,
the live stream as well.
Um,
and uh,</v>

11
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:51.680
so welcome guys to Google.
Phenomenal film,
hilarious.
And dex you wrote,

12
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.210
directed,
produced it and you executive and startle and you guys started.
Hey,

13
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.890
executive.
But I think that's a title at this point.
Oh my God.

14
00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:02.410
I really didn't do anything.
You were really good in the movie.
Thank you.

15
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.700
That was great.
Um,
so where'd you come up with the idea for a,

16
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.370
to making this a translation from the TV series for the movie?
Um,

17
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.180
I was googling,
I really was,

18
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.240
I was writing a different screenplay and I made a Poncherello joke and I don't

19
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.250
know how to spell Poncherello.
So as I often do,

20
00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:26.990
I check my spelling by searching the word or they messed up version of the word.

21
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.720
Can you swear on whatever that we're doing?
I don't even know all we can.

22
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.280
I feel like I'm in the Jetsons.
Right.

23
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.350
So I googled Poncherello and it,

24
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.280
this image of Jon and Ponch popped up and they looked really cool,

25
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.160
which normally they look very seventies and a,

26
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.050
they looked kind of tough and I was like,
oh,

27
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:48.740
there's like a bad boy's version of chips waiting to be made.

28
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.030
And I just love motor sports and cars and motorcycles and boats and things.

29
00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:53.770
You put gas in it.

30
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.650
So I'm just always looking for some way to do comedy and car stuff.

31
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.370
And you knew how to ride bikes since you know how to ride a motorcycle.

32
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.590
I trained for four weeks and that's all I needed.

33
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.660
You need it to me 30 years,
30 years of writing.
No,

34
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.820
I basically like I wrote a lot when I wrote in it like in a straight line for

35
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:17.810
most of very well though,
one of the straightest lines have ever seen.

36
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.410
The stunt guys were like,
Whoa,
like got a laser pointer on that right now.

37
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.350
And basically it was just my locked arms and making sure that I don't swerve

38
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.010
into decks.
And you had written and directed a couple of films,

39
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:33.230
but what made you want to write and direct this versus just starting and it was

40
00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:35.510
just,
you had a passion for the series and thought it was great.
Well,

41
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.480
actually did not think I was going to act in it.

42
00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:42.200
I was just there at Warner brothers to sell them the idea of me writing this

43
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:45.790
version and then hopefully then they would let me direct it.
Um,

44
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.700
all I knew is I wanted pain Ya.
And then the studio exec said,
okay,

45
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:52.940
and then you'll play John.
And I was like,
no,
I think you should get a movie star.

46
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:57.830
Like Chris Pratt or somebody.
And he,
he's rightly or wrongly said,

47
00:02:57.831 --> 00:03:01.260
no,
I think you should do it.
So then I did it.
Yeah.
Wow.
And so how,
how,

48
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.550
it's hard for me to concentrate on this.

49
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:07.000
Can I just say this because we don't ever interact with folks like you.

50
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:09.310
I'm actually more interested in you guys then.

51
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:11.470
I think I'm certainly more interested than I am.

52
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.670
What question or questions you got lifestyle,

53
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.750
you
smoking

54
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.900
weed over here.
Are you incubating,

55
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.230
did you always have a high Iq guys take jet packs here to work?
I mean,

56
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:36.410
do people dictated read to you or like what do you,
I dunno,
I just,
I,

57
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.350
this is really fascinating.
I'm from Detroit,

58
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:41.530
which is a very industrial blue collar town,

59
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:45.670
and this is very think tanky and I was very fascinated by this whole thing.

60
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.450
What is the average age?
What does the mean age here at Google?
Do you know?

61
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.060
Lower than I thought it was.
I don't know what the age,
I don't think we ask ages.

62
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:58.590
I have no idea.
30 32 of course I'm,
that's that.

63
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.070
It's gonna be an industry leader.
Regular's Club.
Greg learners.

64
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.360
So we seen a Googler,
so Google Googlers,
our employees,

65
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.740
Googlers and all you have Greg learners if you're the of no Googlers.

66
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.650
Little condescending.
Anyways.
Yeah.

67
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.630
So if you've got gray hair and you're a little bit older,
gray colors,

68
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.950
you're Greg [inaudible].
Oh yeah.
It's unlike Google.

69
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.650
Walmart calls their employees partners,
what do they call him?

70
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.600
Something condescending and bullshit.
Marty's like Walmart

71
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.680
associates.
They're not employees.

72
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:39.550
They're associates as if they own it or something.
I Dunno.

73
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.680
How do you guys go about Googlers?
You're not allowed to say.
That's fantastic.

74
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.280
That makes me feel a lot better because it was an interesting,
not

75
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.010
she loves it because if I had to go by chippies for the rest of it,

76
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.020
no.
Okay.
So we like Googlers,
see this is a good,
again,

77
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:02.290
we're learning something right away.
I'm going to bring the same fall back to la.

78
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.160
I don't think you have to,
if you just go on Google.
Okay,
great.
Forget that.

79
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:09.160
I won't bring it back to La.
There we go.
Sorry.
I just,
you know,

80
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:13.670
help with the segway into the next question.
Um,
oh really?
Yeah,

81
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.110
we,
uh,
so,
uh,
so actually going off that then with Improv,

82
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:24.880
so was that prevalent on the,
on the set guys know,
really stick to the script?

83
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:28.450
No,
I mean we rehearsed like for four weeks and he was basically rewriting it.

84
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:29.980
We exhausted every possibility.

85
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.210
So usually he just wrote what he thought was the best.
And nine times out of 10,

86
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:37.600
that's what it was.
I love Improv in movies that I haven't written.

87
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.880
And then the ones I ride,
I'm like,
this is perfect.
Why would we mess with this?

88
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:43.800
This is like,

89
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.940
so how do you guys know each other before?
Like,

90
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:50.640
did you know that you wanted Michael for this?

91
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.880
It was just so when I went to Warner brothers,
I said,
okay,
how about chips?

92
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:59.390
Reboot.
And it would be like lethal weapon,
uh,
or bad ways.
And he said,
great.

93
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:01.970
Who would be paunch I and it has to be Michael Pena.

94
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:05.900
He's the only guy that I think could play punch.
And they said,
oh,
we love him.

95
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:09.860
Perfect.
Um,
and,
but I,
I did not know Michael,

96
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:14.630
nor did I ask him if he wanted to be in chips,
but I sold it as him starring.

97
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:15.351
So when I left,

98
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:18.940
that mean it was like I have got to become friends with Michael Pena yet asap.

99
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.820
So,
uh,
my TV sister from parenthood,
Erica Christiansen,

100
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:26.510
I knew was really good friends with him.
So I called Eric kind of panic,

101
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:30.170
like you've got to tell Pena,
I'm a good person and a nice guy and all the,

102
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:32.630
and then she did that lovingly.
It was almost like,

103
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.050
but it was kind of an interesting text message cause it was almost verbatim.

104
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:38.300
He's a really good guy to work with.

105
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.180
And we never talked about business ever before,

106
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:44.240
but she did tell me that the one thing that I do know about this is that you're

107
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:47.460
gonna have a blast.
And to me that was worth it.

108
00:06:47.461 --> 00:06:49.670
And like when I met him it was like,
it was a lot of fun.
I was like,

109
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:50.840
and he's like,
and he said,
he's like,

110
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.810
we'll have a lot of fun and a lot of movies you don't have fun.

111
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.180
So I thought it'd be a blessed,

112
00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.300
well this is like the Google experience of film.
Yeah.

113
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.130
So yeah.
Did you guess you would lower on Lex?

114
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:08.620
I know it's Long Beach in there and oh yeah,
it was all right away.
So,
oh,
sorry.

115
00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:12.580
I'm sorry,
go ahead.
I talked too much.
You know,
I said Oh yeah,
okay.

116
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.830
That's pretty much money.
Okay,
great.
Um,

117
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.900
so often they make you make movies in other states even if they're set in

118
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:24.770
California because states offer tax incentives and a rebate,

119
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:27.050
some of your budget back to you.
Um,

120
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.160
and so we had applied for the California tax credit,
which is really,

121
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:31.821
really hard to get.

122
00:07:31.821 --> 00:07:36.440
I think the only gay about like seven or eight of them and it's a jobs ratio

123
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.400
number basically that gets you disincentive.
So,
um,
you know,

124
00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:42.740
we were like waiting fingers crossed to find out,

125
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.590
we don't found out like a few weeks before we started filming.
Uh,

126
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.370
cause the backup plan was to go to Louisiana and then we would add to call them

127
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.700
the lips,
which would be Louisiana highway patrol.

128
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.870
And then sound is tough is chips.

129
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.350
Well it's got some great locations and great chasing.

130
00:07:58.351 --> 00:08:01.070
So was there any location that you wanted to do but they wouldn't allow you to

131
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:02.990
film or do any of your stunts there?

132
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.080
I hadn't written this big action sequence inside of dodger stadium and then we

133
00:08:07.081 --> 00:08:10.490
got the daily rental fee for dodger stadium and we're like,
okay,

134
00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:11.840
we will not be shooting there.

135
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.410
Let's get into a Lesean park and see what we can do there.

136
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.030
That's when you did the bouncy houses and stuff.
If you can't get dodger stadium,

137
00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:24.910
you'd do bouncy house was a no brainer.
Um,
so,

138
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:29.510
uh,
what was the most difficult scene for you guys to shoot?
For me,

139
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:31.250
I,
it was a pretty easy shoot.

140
00:08:31.251 --> 00:08:36.240
I mean use a director probably who was it?
Stunts.

141
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.800
Stunts.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
And if you,
particularly,
there was,

142
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.850
there's one sequence in the little more than halfway through where this scene

143
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:46.550
that starts at the drug house and there,

144
00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:50.510
those are chase on Venice beach and then it goes into the La River and then it

145
00:08:50.511 --> 00:08:51.980
comes out onto the sixth street bridge.

146
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.990
And then there's this motor home that gets driven through,

147
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:58.830
buy a Hummer and then a,
I get hit and then there's an explosion and the,

148
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:00.120
you know,
all this stuff happens.

149
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.570
And that was really challenging me cause we were shooting on this bridge and we

150
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:05.880
only have two days to get everything we need on this bridge.

151
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.100
And the two areas of activity are about,
um,
uh,

152
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.820
eighth of them.
Um,
more than that,
they're probably a quarter mile apart.

153
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.700
And when you're filming things here,
it all needs to be happening back there,

154
00:09:18.701 --> 00:09:21.900
a quarter mile away and you only want to look one direction.

155
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.910
You want to look one direction once,

156
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
shoot everything you need looking that way and then you want to come around and

157
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:30.300
look that way.
You only want to do that once.
So trying to map out,
okay,

158
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.670
if we shoot this,
the motor home would not be destroyed.
It would be destroyed.
No,

159
00:09:33.671 --> 00:09:35.010
it won't be destroyed.
And you know,

160
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.860
this working out the math of all the logistics of that scene was pretty um,

161
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.040
intense.
And uh,
Michael,

162
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:45.690
what's it like carrying a naked deck shepherd that happens by the way?
Oh wait,

163
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:50.620
you guys haven't seen it?
So somehow somehow makes sense.
Um,

164
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.580
so I'm supposed to carry DAX.
It's in,
it's in the,
uh,

165
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.310
the trailer carry him and then,
uh,

166
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.370
cause he has a bad arthritis who needs to be in warm water.

167
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.930
And he calls me out of all people.

168
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.760
So I carry him and then I slept and I face plant into his pubes.

169
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.840
But I put them into the tub.
Um,

170
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.870
and that was pretty tough and actually he's pretty light to be honest with you.

171
00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:15.750
For instance,
three men,
anyone wants to pick me up after this?

172
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.520
I mean physically lift me if anyone wants to offers on the table can also take

173
00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:28.000
my clothes off if you'd like to lift me.
He does like to things gloves.
Um,

174
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.060
if there's a sequel,
where would you take some of these?

175
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:33.780
With these two characters?
I'm somewhere warm and tropical.

176
00:10:33.781 --> 00:10:37.010
My family would enjoy being always shot I think.
Right.

177
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.260
I think there's a big case in Hawaii.
Yeah.

178
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:45.600
There's a huge,
huge racing ring in Bora Bora.
We're going to have to break out.

179
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:50.340
Yeah.
I don't know.
Um,
but yeah,
somewhere,
somewhere exotic.

180
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.470
Did I hear the question right?
If we got to do a second one,

181
00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.590
which location but just [inaudible] sure.
Where they would go.
Yeah,

182
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.890
because in the first one it's like,
um,
Harry met Sally.
I'm motorcycles.

183
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:03.480
So we fall in love in this one.

184
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.630
And then I would really like to explore what it's like after you've been dating

185
00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:10.350
for like a year and a half and you don't leave the house much and you just watch

186
00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:13.650
Netflix and wear sweats and gang 15 pounds.

187
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.670
I think that'd be a fun place to start.
Like the doldrums of a relationship.

188
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.630
Yeah.
Um,
your work.

189
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.830
So do it on this question a little bit because when it hits the mic,
um,

190
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.670
so if you could do one film crossover with like another classic television

191
00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:33.120
series with two characters,
get Starsky and Hutch or whatever,
who would those be?

192
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.430
Those characters being that would be the one.
In fact,

193
00:11:35.431 --> 00:11:38.640
they pitched at the end of this movie that we're chasing somebody and all of a

194
00:11:38.641 --> 00:11:42.360
sudden that Grand Torino blows by us and we're like,
what the fuck is that?

195
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.650
Like I wanted to introduce them in the same world because they were late

196
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.010
seventies la cops,
both of them.
Oh,
almost like the marvel universe.

197
00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:54.600
How some would go back.
He starts getting hodge,
the fall guy,
knight rider,

198
00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.610
and it's the hazard could jump through every now and then.
That's a really good,

199
00:11:58.611 --> 00:12:02.950
yeah.
Well actually,
so since you're in the marvel universe,

200
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:07.450
you play a,
you're,
you're in that man.
And so going off of that,
yeah.

201
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:11.720
Thanks guys.
Bye for him.
What would,

202
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.500
well,
we got one back.

203
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.750
Who would you cast access in the Marvel universe?
In the marvel universe.

204
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:21.250
He'd be like,

205
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.631
<v 3>well we almost,</v>

206
00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:25.900
we almost look like superheroes because of what we have to wear these leather

207
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:30.340
racing outfit for motorcycles.
I think he plays superhero.
Yeah.
Which character?

208
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.580
You know.
Oh I have no,
I'm not well versed in the,
on the marvel.

209
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.470
<v 2>Don't say Amanda Steele.
Who would you want to please?</v>

210
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.470
Man of steel.
Just trying,

211
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.760
making the most arrogant thing you could pick for yourself.
Oh God.

212
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:50.400
He's going to say superman.
Did you have a character you like to play dates?
Um,

213
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.100
well
in full disclosure,

214
00:12:54.101 --> 00:12:57.340
I'm my only awareness of the characters in the marvel universe are the ones I've

215
00:12:57.341 --> 00:12:59.650
already seen in movies.
So,
um,
you know,

216
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:04.180
unless Downey hangs up that suit and invites me to do iron man,
um,

217
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:08.950
I don't know.
The Paul Rudd One's neat cause he's more charactering goofy.

218
00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:13.690
And I certainly couldn't.
I don't think I could play just like square job.

219
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.580
Serious guy.
Yeah.

220
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.120
<v 3>But I would love to play a superhero.
I mean like I'm in that world.
I'm like,</v>

221
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:21.210
it'd be awesome to have to,
you know,

222
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.430
you become some that I'm pitching them and they're like,
yeah,
that's cool man.

223
00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:25.780
Why don't you just keep doing what you're doing?

224
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.140
<v 2>Great.
So you bring the jokes and the jokes,
you don't want me to fly or anything.</v>

225
00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:37.620
Um,
and so you worked a lot with the CHP and so how do they have like a technical

226
00:13:37.621 --> 00:13:41.520
advisor on set or they do and your brother's a cop,
isn't it?
My brother's a cop.

227
00:13:41.521 --> 00:13:46.110
Yeah,
for sure.
But we,
I didn't do too much research into the CSV.
No,

228
00:13:46.111 --> 00:13:49.800
not for this role because he plays an FBI agent undercover as a cop.

229
00:13:49.801 --> 00:13:52.770
So he wouldn't really know a bunch of CHP protocol.

230
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.680
And I play a rookie who's intentionally not supposed to know a lot.

231
00:13:55.681 --> 00:13:59.700
So it didn't make sense for us to get super savvy now to write the screenplay.

232
00:13:59.701 --> 00:14:04.470
I had to learn a lot about the CHP.
But um,
as far as the characters,
they,

233
00:14:04.471 --> 00:14:06.420
it was the best if they didn't know a lot.

234
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:11.460
And in fact when I had meetings with the CHP brass to see if they would help us,

235
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.690
they said they are not following protocol in this movie.
And I said,

236
00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.500
people generally don't pay 14 bucks to watch people follow the rules.

237
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.620
There's a rule of thumb,
they kind of like to see you break the rules.

238
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.890
Was there any push back from them saying you should cut that or anything where

239
00:14:25.891 --> 00:14:28.440
they just kind of letting it be,
they had three really,

240
00:14:28.441 --> 00:14:31.140
really simple requests that were not,

241
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.100
I didn't feel like compromise any artistic integrity.
One was,

242
00:14:35.101 --> 00:14:39.510
I had inadvertently like toe by total coincidence I had named the bad guy,

243
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.140
the name of one of their most esteemed

244
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:49.630
commander,
ray Blackwell.
Apparently there's a famous ray Blackwell.

245
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.620
I just happen to name the bad guy that,
and they go,

246
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.320
we think it's funny like the joke about Ray,

247
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.610
but I think Ray's feelings might be hurt.
And I'm like raise a fictitious.

248
00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.690
And so that was just a weird coincidence.
So I changed his name.

249
00:15:02.691 --> 00:15:03.740
That was no problem.

250
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.240
And then also they really pride themselves on being a very transparent

251
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:08.931
organization.

252
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:12.800
So originally in the movie it was that the FBI decided they had to go undercover

253
00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:15.530
to find out who the dirty cops were and they said,
you know,
we would,

254
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.640
we would ask for their help.
So if you just see,
and I was like,
yeah,

255
00:15:18.641 --> 00:15:20.990
it saves me like a page of dialogue if you ask,

256
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.730
I can't remember what the third one was,
but it was not very cumbersome.

257
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.150
<v 3>Is there anything that you learned as a director or even as just a writer on</v>

258
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:30.160
this film that you're going to take?

259
00:15:30.161 --> 00:15:31.550
Because if you're doing an animated Scooby Doo,

260
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.890
is there anything that you've learned as like a director?
Like,
oh,
well,

261
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.890
like you should remember that for next time,
we're actually not do this.
Right.

262
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:41.320
<v 2>Um,
I learned a lot of hard lessons on the first two movies.</v>

263
00:15:41.321 --> 00:15:44.350
This one went pretty darn smooth.
And when I got to the editing room,

264
00:15:44.351 --> 00:15:47.790
I had pretty much everything I needed.
So,
um,

265
00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.630
this is by no means to say I've liked topped out at the job.
Just,

266
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.010
um,
I,
I,
the last couple of movies I really learned some lessons.

267
00:15:57.011 --> 00:16:00.940
Like don't let people sit down and talk for a long time.

268
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.280
That gets boring no matter what they're saying.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

269
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:11.020
<v 4>I guess I am learned the lesson,
all that well,
um,
audience question guys.
Oh,</v>

270
00:16:11.021 --> 00:16:14.200
look at this dog.
Oh No.

271
00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.530
Now what have you have odd dog allergies and you work at Google.
Tough Shit.

272
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.460
You're fucked.
That's amazing.
She was right there,
dude.

273
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.850
I work with my husband everyday.
I was curious.

274
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.060
<v 2>What is it like to work with your wife?
Oh Wow.
Um,</v>

275
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.840
it is my favorite person to work with.
Um,
we get along really,
really well,

276
00:16:32.841 --> 00:16:37.841
particularly when working together because typically in a marriage you have here

277
00:16:37.881 --> 00:16:38.550
he goes,
good.
Yeah.

278
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:43.080
<v 4>Job
taking care of Mommy.
Okay.</v>

279
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:48.410
<v 2>Oh,
he's tired.
That's cool.
Yeah.
Um,
in real life,</v>

280
00:16:48.411 --> 00:16:52.580
you know,
you,
she probably doesn't want to see the movie.
I want to see.

281
00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:57.020
She would probably rather not go on a vacation that I want to go,
you know?

282
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.640
Then there's like endless compromise,

283
00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:03.170
but on a film set you have the same objective every day,
which is a really,
um,

284
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.860
good,
easy thing for a relationship.
So I like it.

285
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.620
<v 3>This question is for docs.</v>

286
00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:13.110
How does this film compared to other films you've directed and written?

287
00:17:13.111 --> 00:17:15.640
Like in terms of labor processes,
et Cetera?

288
00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.213
<v 2>Um,</v>

289
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:22.380
and then I feel like this dovetails into Google a bit because this time I had

290
00:17:22.381 --> 00:17:27.150
money and I had a really awesome team of people who are super great at their job

291
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.340
and that made things so much easier.
The Guy,
our,

292
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:32.730
our director of photography,

293
00:17:32.731 --> 00:17:37.140
he was a second unit DP on all the Michael Bay movies,

294
00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:41.610
the Bourne identity.
This guy had shot thousands of hours of action.

295
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:46.830
And so the way his brain works was so,
so easy.

296
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.360
She's taking a Selfie of the dog with us.

297
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:49.543
<v 4>Oh,</v>

298
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.800
by the way,
that was amazing.

299
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.520
He's like drunk and breaking it down and you're like,

300
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:08.310
oh,
that was Jane.
I totally met.
So yeah,

301
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.890
no,
I made my point.

302
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.070
And more importantly I made it in his selfie.

303
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.540
Well,
thanks so much guys for being here.
So chips comes out March 24th go.
See,

304
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.413
it's phenomenal.

305
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:26.480
A lot you guys to like ask them why have some mark,

306
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.320
you've got to go to the microphone now.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.

307
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:35.330
But like what's your day like?
Like,
you know,
cup,
a couple hours of work a day.

308
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:40.510
Anybody,
anybody like you.
Okay.
Like,
what is your day like?
Um,

309
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.150
so I think one of the misconceptions about Google is they have,
so we're really,

310
00:18:44.151 --> 00:18:48.800
really hard.
I no longer like that can work really hard.
So you don't work hard,

311
00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.130
you work really hard.
I've been at Google almost seven years.

312
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:59.900
When I first got here,
it was amazing.
Like there's three cafes,

313
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.240
like everywhere you turn there's free food.

314
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.560
People are like shoving food down your pants all day long.

315
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.580
There there was a free massage or almost free massages,

316
00:19:10.581 --> 00:19:13.310
no massages or gyms.

317
00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.410
There's like crazy activities that you get to do like,
um,

318
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:23.630
opportunities
for creativity and married to my husband.

319
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:28.710
No Chamber for you guys here on Spiegler.

320
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:33.110
So when you didn't married your whole Spiegler.
Oh,
okay.
Okay.
Um,
but yeah,

321
00:19:33.111 --> 00:19:36.920
like Google has done crazy things.
Like I think we got an email one day like,

322
00:19:36.921 --> 00:19:37.281
hey guys,

323
00:19:37.281 --> 00:19:41.690
we rented out a theater for you and it's almost like the Michael Jackson Cirque

324
00:19:41.691 --> 00:19:44.720
du Soleil show.
So we're taking you off to Jackson was here.
That's awesome.

325
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:51.110
They took us all to slay,
talk to Michael Jackson.
Oh,
okay.

326
00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:55.070
Um,
and like incredibly generous.

327
00:19:55.071 --> 00:19:58.490
Like they run on another campus down in mountain view.
That's our headquarters.

328
00:19:58.491 --> 00:20:02.420
So they run like 10,000 people on private shuttles to and from work every day.

329
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:07.690
Um,
like trouble.
There's lots of opportunities to travel.
It's like,
wow,

330
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.030
it's a pretty awesome place to work.
But we also work like super,
super hard,

331
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.000
like four or five hours.
It sounds like your ads for you,

332
00:20:14.001 --> 00:20:18.450
so like quite a bit and uh,
eating,
you got to chose an average workday.

333
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.710
When are you expecting to get here and when are you mean?
I think,
well,

334
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.710
speaking on behalf of 30,000 people,
um,

335
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.310
I think it's a pretty flexible place to work.

336
00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:30.920
So that's definitely one of the advantages of Google on people will have

337
00:20:30.921 --> 00:20:32.840
different work schedules.
Some people will get in,

338
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:37.190
like I think the engineering stereotype is people will roll in like 10 to 12 are

339
00:20:37.191 --> 00:20:41.360
you in the Pr Department?
Uh,
no.
I'm in,
I'm in the engineering department.
Oh,
okay.

340
00:20:41.361 --> 00:20:46.361
Just one of them at 10:00 AM to 12:00 AM 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM you might roll

341
00:20:46.521 --> 00:20:48.560
into,
Oh yeah,
window.

342
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.880
You might leave work like 8:00 PM or later,

343
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.000
but where we want you here eight hours a day,
is that the goal?

344
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.560
I think most people probably on average end up working like 10 to 12 hours a
day.

345
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.100
Like when you average all addictive,
like,
you know what I mean?
Like I think,

346
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:09.110
I think [inaudible] very driven type of person.

347
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.090
So people are workaholics,

348
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.190
but we hope you enjoy all of our products and that we're making the world a

349
00:21:21.191 --> 00:21:22.024
better place for you.

350
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.130
[inaudible] engineering.

351
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:32.131
But it was really does anyone to hate this job from someone who wants,

352
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.360
who wants to get fired right now?

353
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:45.560
[inaudible].
