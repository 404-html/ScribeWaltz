1
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.680
We welcome to the stage director,
auto Bathurst and stars,
Ben Mendelsohn,

2
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:12.000
Sarah and Hagar 10 and Jay,

3
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.093
<v 2>fuck</v>

4
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.623
yeah,

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.850
I'm taking a selfie.

6
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.120
<v 1>How are you doing?
No,
was it here?</v>

7
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.610
<v 0>You Rolling?
I am rolling.</v>

8
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.730
<v 1>In case you didn't tell for Pinto,</v>

9
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.750
<v 0>so dead on your pants to grant.</v>

10
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.170
<v 2>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.960
<v 1>Uh,
I actually want to start with auto.
Uh,
the movie.</v>

12
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.800
This movie is actually getting released on the 21st of November here and it's

13
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.660
going to be a released 110 years after the first Robin Hood was ever made,

14
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.250
which was nice.
You know,
eight obviously.
Um,
there've been many,

15
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.050
many different remakes,
many different iterations of this.
Uh,

16
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.650
what made you decide to do a another one eight years now after the last remake?

17
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.760
<v 0>It's a good question.
Um,
and I'll tell you when I was,</v>

18
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.330
when they came to me and said,
do you want to make another Robert Film?
I,

19
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.960
the initial reaction was like,
really?
Do we really need another Robinhood film?

20
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.920
That'd been plenty of them.

21
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.480
And then I kind of sort of dug into it and realize that actually the,

22
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.040
the versions that we all know,

23
00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:35.350
whether it be from Hollywood or from the British film industry,

24
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.850
and that is a very,
very,
very narrow view of the kind of Robin Hood Story.

25
00:01:39.851 --> 00:01:42.190
This is a story that's lasted for like six,

26
00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:45.630
700 years and has been told him so many iterations.
And you,

27
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.340
as you asked the question,
you ask yourself why,
why,

28
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:52.540
why is this story lasted for so long?
You know,
and I guess,
you know,

29
00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:55.120
wherever you've got corruption,
wherever you've got,
you know,

30
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.380
any kind of political organization or king or queen oppressing the people.

31
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.380
Whenever you've got a religion,
you know,
oppressing the people,

32
00:02:02.381 --> 00:02:07.270
then you think we need a Robin hood story,
forward wines.
The 21st century we got,

33
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.480
you know,
why not two political leaders who are a little abusing their power.

34
00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:11.450
We've got,
um,

35
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.940
some religions oppressing people in one or two countries in the world.

36
00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:19.900
We've got the occasional unjust war being fought,
you know,
in some countries.

37
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:23.090
And you kind of go,
you know,
now more than ever do we need,
you know,

38
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.730
a Robin Hood Story.
So then you kind of go,
okay,
but how do we do it?
And you know,

39
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:28.481
I wanted to make,

40
00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:31.990
and we didn't want to make a sort of a little history lesson or dusty British

41
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:34.630
fairy tale.
If this is going to be for the 21st century,

42
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.350
we've got to make a version of it that kind of relates to the 21st century

43
00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:41.620
audience.
And so we jazzed it up a bit.

44
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.350
<v 1>You did.
It's a very different,
I saw it last week.
Um,
and it,
it's,</v>

45
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.330
it's darker.
It's actually a bit darker I think.
What do you mean by that?

46
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.040
<v 0>Solid is racial tension up here,
man.</v>

47
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.170
<v 3>You did look right at me.</v>

48
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.030
It's a bit darker Jamie and I'll just get,

49
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.723
<v 1>mmm.</v>

50
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.600
<v 3>I felt good.
Felt like Dave Chappelle.
There's a knife.
So Pam,
Pam,</v>

51
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.520
I was beside myself.

52
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.440
<v 1>I'm just letting you go,
man.
Do your thing.
Yeah.
Okay.</v>

53
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.860
Uh,
yeah.
So the screenplay and the screenplay is a bit darker.

54
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.640
Did you purposely want to take it in a different direction?
The screenplay.

55
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.830
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah,
of course.
Listen,
I mean,
yeah,
there's no,
yeah,
there's no point.</v>

56
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.210
If anybody wants to see a traditional Robin hood with men and green tights,

57
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.870
don't go and see this film.
You'll be very disappointed.
This is a very,
very,

58
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:48.400
very different take on the whole thing.

59
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.180
<v 1>And uh,
Jamie,
you're obviously a bit of a comedian</v>

60
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.140
started out and I can't see you over there.
You can leave a chair up.

61
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.620
Oh yeah.
A started out in living color when you were always attracted to comedy.

62
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.250
<v 4>Uh,
you know,
I've always been like,
you know,
uh,
growing up,
you know,
as,</v>

63
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.090
as a kid,
you know,
doing,
I used to do standup comedy and my third grade class,

64
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.920
they would give us like,
time.
My teacher was like,
either you're going to,

65
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.910
you're going to end up being in the office every day or I'm going to set aside

66
00:04:25.911 --> 00:04:30.110
some time for you every Friday and just let you tell jokes to the kids.

67
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.350
And so luckily I had a teacher that was looking at,
and then I would take,

68
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.530
you guys are too young to notice,
but Johnny Carson,

69
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.410
hilarious.
Wow.
That's crazy.
Oh wait,
hey Johnny,
Johnny Carson,

70
00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:44.460
the original tonight show.

71
00:04:44.461 --> 00:04:49.140
I would just take jokes from the tonight show and tell them to the kids.
Uh,

72
00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:49.591
you know,

73
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:53.010
they thought I was a brilliant comedian when I was actually stealing from Johnny

74
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.330
Carson and a,
and that's how I,
that's how I started out,
you know,
and then,
uh,

75
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.193
got to,
uh,

76
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.230
got to La and I'm just started doing all of the clubs and a am I suppose to be

77
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:06.390
saying this.

78
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.230
<v 1>Yeah.
Go on</v>

79
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.400
<v 4>in a,
in a,
in,
in got to La and started doing standup in the clubs.</v>

80
00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:16.660
And I remember the first time I went on stage in La and it was a lot of gang

81
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:20.830
members in the,
in the crowd at that time because La was sort of like,
you know,

82
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.900
I didn't know what bloods and crips,
what was,

83
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:24.700
it was a lot of crips in the audience at that time.

84
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.200
And so they were yelling and throwing stuff at people and stuff who was on
stage.

85
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:31.210
And then I just went up,
started doing impersonations,

86
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.100
but I would do them as if I was the crip.

87
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.250
So I would do like Mike Tyson and yet my tie him [inaudible] and so,

88
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.020
and at that time I was the only black guy doing a Ronald Reagan at the time,
so,

89
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.920
well,
well as a matter of fact,
Bill,
there you go again.

90
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.520
And so they sort of jumped off from there and I got on to live in color and the

91
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:53.050
rest was a rest was history

92
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.000
<v 1>and you often very musically musically talented got the Oscar for uh,</v>

93
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.250
for Ray Ray Charles,
right?
Yeah.
Um,
how,

94
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.860
what made you want to do the transition I guess from,
uh,
from comedy to serious?

95
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.040
<v 4>I couldn't get a spot.
Like you got to think about,
well,</v>

96
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.420
we was coming up all of the lands.
It was a like a thousand of them

97
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.513
<v 1>and then it was,</v>

98
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.980
<v 4>you know what I'm saying?
It was Martin Lawrence,
it was Chris Rock.</v>

99
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.760
It was all of those guys that were doing like,

100
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.810
I mean it was crowded.
So every time I tried to jump off,

101
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.900
like especially in movies,
like to try to do something funny,

102
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.360
there was nothing out there,
you know,

103
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:36.450
because all of the sort of the slots was taken up.
And then along came a little,

104
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.210
oh,
this,
this movie called any given Sunday,
which was um,
uh,

105
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:45.920
Oliver stone.
And that sort of changed the trajectory of,

106
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.060
of,
you know,
what,
what I was to be.
And then once we caught that lit,
you know,

107
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:52.520
we always trying to catch the live.
So I caught that.
I was like,
okay,

108
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.710
now I can step into that space.
And then those types of dramatic roles,
uh,

109
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.100
continuing to,
to come along willy,

110
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.010
well when I released my name is Willie Willie Beeman.
Yeah,

111
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.660
Dan.
So that's,
you know,
that's how I,
that's how I jumped off.

112
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.630
<v 1>Right.
And you had obviously a lot of musical background as well,
but Taryn,</v>

113
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.100
you,
you can sing really well by the way,
in case you didn't know,

114
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.070
um,
you are actually Johnny from thing is my son's favorite character.

115
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.930
So really cool.
Thank you.
Where,
where did your history come from?
Cause you,

116
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.730
you have a,
your Welsh,
right?

117
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.490
<v 5>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I,
um,</v>

118
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.820
I grew up in Wales and there's a very strong tradition of choral scene.

119
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.280
<v 1>Hello.
I can't hear you.</v>

120
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.030
<v 5>Um,
uh,
so yes,</v>

121
00:07:43.031 --> 00:07:47.290
I grew up in kind of choir singing and my dad's Fetty musical.

122
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:50.980
I've just always sang of it was left at time.
I don't sing is when I'm not,

123
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.110
when I'm not happy,
you know,
it's,
it's just,
I,
um,
I enjoy it very much.

124
00:07:55.111 --> 00:07:59.140
Are you happy now?
Very happy now,
but I mean I'm mostly trying to do my job now.

125
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.170
<v 1>Me Too.
This is kind of off topic.
Um,</v>

126
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.020
[inaudible] did you move to there?
One plant?

127
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:15.790
How do you say how you say that?
Like 20,
20 letters,

128
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.060
20 letters and three vowels

129
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.340
<v 5>somewhat weak.</v>

130
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.510
<v 1>Uh,
you say a lot better and I did.
Oh yeah.
So you can turn it,</v>

131
00:08:27.511 --> 00:08:29.190
the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

132
00:08:29.191 --> 00:08:30.690
What made you want to start acting in the first?

133
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.860
<v 5>Um,
I think I,
um,</v>

134
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:38.470
I've always like storytelling and I've always been a reader.
Um,

135
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.700
autos are actually,
um,
you know,
we were just discussing also his next project,

136
00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:45.740
which is very,
very exciting.
I probably shouldn't say anything.

137
00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:46.700

145
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:12.890

yes.
Anyway.
Uh,
so,
um,</v>

155
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:54.860
I was like reading,

156
00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:58.190
storytelling and I think acting was just a natural progression from that really,

157
00:09:58.191 --> 00:10:03.191
which started in my mid teens and audition for drama school and got a place at a

158
00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.050
rather,
which was kind of,
you know,

159
00:10:06.051 --> 00:10:09.410
the dream place for me to go and did three years there and then left and then

160
00:10:09.411 --> 00:10:12.470
got Kingsman and now I'm rubbing her.
Did she just really cool?

161
00:10:12.471 --> 00:10:13.304
I'm very lucky guy.

162
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.710
<v 1>Yeah.
Kingspan was phenomenal.
And of course I'd mentioned saying when,</v>

163
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.420
where did you,
when did you factor thinking into your thing?

164
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.430
<v 5>Thanks.</v>

165
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.680
I really wanted to do an animated film and I told my agents I was desperate to

166
00:10:23.681 --> 00:10:25.720
do an animated film and then one came along,

167
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.080
which involved going along and singing for the audition.
They said,

168
00:10:30.081 --> 00:10:34.930
do you want to go on best singing gorilla?
And I was like,
are you kidding?
Yes.
Um,

169
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.540
and um,
and then,
then,
you know,

170
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.750
that movie happened and it just became this monstrous SAS,

171
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.900
you know,
and,
um,

172
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.030
<v 2>yeah,
yeah.</v>

173
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.400
<v 5>We,
I don't think it's the last few seen if Johnny either,</v>

174
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:52.450
which is really exciting.
Yeah,

175
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:57.270
<v 1>yeah.
Spoiler alert.
Hmm.
Um,
Ben,
Ben Mendelsohn.</v>

176
00:10:57.271 --> 00:10:59.030
You're actually Australian.
Yeah.

177
00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:02.180
<v 3>Okay.</v>

178
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.800
<v 1>To right.
Um,
you,</v>

179
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.270
I was reading that you took drama because you thought it was an easy class.
Yeah.

180
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.590
<v 2>All right.</v>

181
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:22.770
<v 1>And,
uh,
so how did you make it from Australian TV,</v>

182
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.670
Australian productions over to,
uh,
to the American television?

183
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.490
<v 7>Uh,
uh,
um,
uh,
oh no.</v>

184
00:11:30.491 --> 00:11:33.930
You know how long time I was a,
you know,

185
00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.350
I know I started out at about 14.
Uh,
I did a film called animal kingdom,

186
00:11:38.351 --> 00:11:42.610
which kind of,
you know,
blew up a little bit.
And then,
uh,

187
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.910
then what happened?
I got an,
you know,
and then I came over here,

188
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.700
I did a bit of this and did a bit of that.
And then,
you know,

189
00:11:48.701 --> 00:11:51.540
the blood line thing and I did about the line,

190
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.750
did a bit of that and you know,
you could just go,
here I am

191
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.910
<v 1>show.</v>

192
00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:03.620
<v 7>Yeah.
We had,
uh,
we had a,
you know,
a game yesterday.</v>

193
00:12:03.621 --> 00:12:07.610
We were on another network,
um,
where we had to do,
you know,
how would you know,

194
00:12:07.611 --> 00:12:11.250
you cast members,
so that's why he's got,
oh,
I forgot the anymore.
It's been,

195
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.220
so it's an uninteresting and saying it doesn't matter.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Go on man.

196
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.840
<v 1>Yeah,
some one line,
dark light,
dark knight rises,
Star Wars,</v>

197
00:12:20.841 --> 00:12:24.920
rogue one now sheriff and Dottie hand.
I mean you play kind of jerks

198
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:31.570
and,
but like in my limited time knowing you,

199
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:33.320
you seem like a really nice guy.

200
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.363
<v 0>He's,
he's lovely.</v>

201
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.930
<v 1>So how,
how do you,
how do you find these characters?</v>

202
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.930
<v 7>Cash,
cash moves everything around me.
Cream.</v>

203
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.990
Get the money.
Don't look,
I labelle's y'all.

204
00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.730
<v 1>So then how did each of the three of you guys get attached to a,
to this project,</v>

205
00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:53.490
to Robin Hood

206
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.040
<v 7>through,
through auto,
you know,
auto look,</v>

207
00:12:56.041 --> 00:12:59.730
auto auto came and he came with a really strong,
he had a foreign,

208
00:12:59.731 --> 00:13:01.380
he's belly about these because you know,

209
00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:05.220
he's the starting point that he was mentioning earlier.
I'm just,
you know,

210
00:13:05.221 --> 00:13:10.140
assuming that it was something similar for the other gentleman,
but um,
you know,

211
00:13:10.141 --> 00:13:14.160
I came here.
Yeah.
But he said,
look,
you know,
why do a Robin Hood?
Well,
this is why.

212
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.290
And you know,
he transmitted,

213
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:20.580
he's directing fire to our little act d receptors.

214
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.200
Boom.
We're off.
It's like scale it tricks,
you know what I mean?

215
00:13:25.201 --> 00:13:28.770
You'd drop it down,
you don't have the power on it and like nothing happens.

216
00:13:28.771 --> 00:13:33.170
But you know,
you get zapped and then fuel off.
You got Bush

217
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.240
<v 1>know you want to and so badly</v>

218
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.850
<v 7>he can't tell the story of how it really,
you're going to tell.
Oh,</v>

219
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.790
<v 1>can you tell a story?
You had to postpone production.
We did.
Yeah.
We waited.
Yeah.</v>

220
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.140
<v 7>The Veneer La.</v>

221
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.260
<v 1>It's a lot going on with this cast.
And</v>

222
00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:01.390
so how,
I guess I want you to expand on that.
Um,

223
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.880
the,
he wants you to say nice things about,

224
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:11.420
I'll say nothing about the best Robin Hood.
You,
you,
you found,

225
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:13.503
<v 7>yeah.</v>

226
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.370
<v 0>Yeah.
Always make it.
I mean,
you listen,</v>

227
00:14:16.371 --> 00:14:19.250
we did wait for them cause we would absolutely passionate to have him

228
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.710
<v 1>Kingsman two at the time.</v>

229
00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.510
<v 0>Yeah.
And he's,
you know,
and he's absolutely perfect for the role.</v>

230
00:14:23.511 --> 00:14:25.760
And when you see the movie,
you'll get why we waited,
you know,

231
00:14:25.761 --> 00:14:29.690
but it's not it as Taran says it,
it does happen.
It does happen quite a lot.

232
00:14:29.691 --> 00:14:33.890
You know,
films,
slide and date slide and other films they're on,
you know,

233
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.440
to go longer or sometimes it will,
sometimes it works the other way.

234
00:14:36.441 --> 00:14:37.920
Sometimes you think you're,
you know,

235
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.390
you think you started in six months and then suddenly or window comes open and

236
00:14:41.391 --> 00:14:45.170
you've got to get going in four weeks.
You know,
so it's,
it's not that unusual,

237
00:14:45.171 --> 00:14:49.490
but that said,
we were very,
very,
very deeply committed to him.

238
00:14:49.491 --> 00:14:51.440
Pain Robin cause awesome.

239
00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.970
<v 1>Thank you.
Yeah,
it was amazing.
And uh,</v>

240
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.920
I mean all of you have such original takes on these characters that we've,

241
00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:03.510
we've seen time and time again,
especially,
uh,
you know,
little John,
uh,
Jamie,

242
00:15:03.511 --> 00:15:08.370
how did you approach this brand new,
the brand new take on that character?

243
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.660
<v 4>Well,
that,
that's the reason we jumped into it because,
you know,</v>

244
00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:12.760
can I say what the original title was?

245
00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.910
The original title of this was called Hood.

246
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.720
So very,
it's a darker tape,

247
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:26.423
if you will.

248
00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.480
But the reason we wanted to fuck with it is because it was like he came with a

249
00:15:30.481 --> 00:15:33.550
brand new bag of funk on how to do it.
Bringing in,
you know,

250
00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.470
young terror in that it's not connected to anything traditional.

251
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.000
And what tripped me out was,

252
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:43.380
I guess I didn't realize that there were a lot of Robin hood movies out there.

253
00:15:43.381 --> 00:15:47.400
I just thought that we was literally like maybe one or two or whatever like
that,

254
00:15:47.401 --> 00:15:52.230
but the fact that he wanted to do it completely different and then do it in a

255
00:15:52.231 --> 00:15:55.470
way to where nothing was,
nothing was attached to the old days.

256
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:56.850
Even the way it looks,
you know,

257
00:15:56.851 --> 00:16:01.851
a lot of times people will sort of married to whatever the old school look was.

258
00:16:02.581 --> 00:16:07.380
But I thought the,
the,
the clothes in this,
the,
the,
the uh,
what do you call it?

259
00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.660
The wardrobe in this is so fly.
I was like,

260
00:16:09.661 --> 00:16:13.710
they should do like a catwalk of the clause because it was so dope.

261
00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:18.360
And so that was the reason that I wanted to jump into it and didn't do my

262
00:16:18.361 --> 00:16:20.910
character in a way to where,
um,

263
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.830
I pattern my character off of,
I don't know how much you know about a cinema,
but,

264
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.000
uh,
when Denzel did Malcolm X,
anybody see that movie?
Uh,

265
00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.460
but when Denzel did Malcolm X,
I sorta patterned,
um,
my character,

266
00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:39.480
the guy,
not Denzel.
All right.
Okay.
Uh,
but,

267
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.710
but the guy who went Denzel went to jail.
Yeah.

268
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.040
Yeah.
That got bad guy.
So I was like,
you know,

269
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:50.960
I mean it was I think back Bertha,
Malcolm.
Yeah.
Oh,
those days.

270
00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:52.410
Oh look at you putting that pocket your hair.

271
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.990
So I was always sorta like channel him.

272
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.140
And so it was just a brand new bag of fun,
you know,

273
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.670
<v 1>have been where you,
uh,
any similar sort of thing in terms of</v>

274
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.030
<v 4>no,
but I,
but I love that.</v>

275
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:10.010
I love that because I actually have a theory that,
you know,
like,
and it's not,

276
00:17:10.011 --> 00:17:13.430
it's not my fucking theory.
It's,
it's just,
you know,
it's well established,

277
00:17:13.431 --> 00:17:17.240
like good artists borrow,
great artists steal.

278
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.650
And that's a genius steel.
That's it to be.

279
00:17:21.651 --> 00:17:25.640
I wouldn't say it is actually true because there's difference,

280
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.780
especially when it comes to movie act and there's little things that you have to

281
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.780
sort of grab,
you know what I mean?

282
00:17:32.781 --> 00:17:37.610
Cause there's some people that great whispers like,
no,

283
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.150
like,
like,
like say like Alec Baldwin.
It was a great whisper.

284
00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:45.550
It tasted great with what's going on.
Of course,
you know,
so,

285
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:50.160
so it's a movie thing.
So I grabbed that movie thing to Sorta sorta channel that

286
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.060
<v 5>stealing,
I guess you were saying stole that.</v>

287
00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:58.000
<v 7>So you're not just to see,
and I know where you're going with this.</v>

288
00:17:58.001 --> 00:18:00.250
So I think I'll jump in and you know,
I'll feed a little bit.

289
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.110
This is why they cast me as villains,
you know,
um,
uh,

290
00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.940
cause they'll do whatever the brewer I want.
Um,

291
00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:16.180
he was really about political speak,
like this sheriff,
he's really,
you know,

292
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.660
nodding him is a kind of state.
It's at war.

293
00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:23.740
We need people to be good,
good citizens.

294
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:27.160
We need a lot of cash and we need you to go off to war and fight.

295
00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.930
And if you can't do that,
then you know,

296
00:18:28.931 --> 00:18:32.560
you can make some cash or you can make some weapons.
And if you can't do that,

297
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.760
no,
you know,
Oh,
if you go,
um,
so yeah,

298
00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.550
that was more of the vibe and an auto really laid that out.

299
00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.480
And there's a plethora of,
um,
you know,

300
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.990
modern political speak are modern examples of that.

301
00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.790
That was what you're going to earn us.
Right?

302
00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:50.730
<v 1>Totally.
100%.
Pushka Karen,
I guess say for you,</v>

303
00:18:50.731 --> 00:18:51.180
did you,

304
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.390
did you watch any of the other previous iterations of Robin Hood or did you just

305
00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:54.880
go out there?

306
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.940
<v 5>No,
I mean,
you know,
it's,
uh,
you know,</v>

307
00:18:57.941 --> 00:19:01.330
we're all here to facilitate autos,
vision for it,

308
00:19:01.331 --> 00:19:06.331
and also doesn't give a flying Koffler about historical accuracy.

309
00:19:06.761 --> 00:19:08.470
It's just not what floats his boat.

310
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.800
And that's part of what our movie is.
It's a reinvention.
And I,
you know,
I,

311
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.260
I,
I didn't,
I wasn't really interested in watching other Robin Hood's.

312
00:19:17.261 --> 00:19:20.800
I think what I was interested in doing was trying to make a Robin Hood that was,

313
00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:25.210
uh,
you know,
the whole thing is very rock and roll and gritty and fun,

314
00:19:25.211 --> 00:19:30.130
but I wanted him to be a three dimensional and,
um,
and vulnerable.

315
00:19:30.131 --> 00:19:34.330
You know,
he's a young guy,
you know,

316
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.880
he's very sort of boyish in a lot of ways,

317
00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:41.790
which is obviously a huge stretch for me as an actor.
Um,
I,
you know,
I'm,
I,
I,
um,

318
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.840
um,
I just,
um,

319
00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:49.250
wanted him to be fluid and um,
and,

320
00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.690
and to not to sort of not really be coping.

321
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.890
I think that's what's interesting about him is he spends a long time not coping

322
00:19:56.891 --> 00:19:59.800
and then becomes later on,
spoiler alert.

323
00:19:59.801 --> 00:20:03.880
Something that we recognize as more heroic.
Alright.
Robin Hood Light.
Yeah.

324
00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.240
<v 1>Um,
there are just there Mike over there.
I know there's a Mike over here.</v>

325
00:20:08.241 --> 00:20:09.800
If you have any questions for anybody,

326
00:20:09.801 --> 00:20:13.010
please start lining up and we'd take probably have time for one or two
questions.

327
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:18.020
But,
uh,
you said historical accuracy is not what auto cares about.
However,

328
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.820
I'm going to talk about Lars Anderson for a second.
You all right?
They're

329
00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.393
getting the water.

330
00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.360
Um,
yeah.

331
00:20:29.361 --> 00:20:34.300
Lars Anderson of Denmark who has been nicknamed the real life leg a loss.
Uh,

332
00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:39.670
<v 5>Ooh,
that's harsh.
That's what he's way better than or loss</v>

333
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.580
<v 1>taught.
Taught you speed shooting.</v>

334
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:48.010
If you guys like go look this up on Youtube,
this amazing you want to

335
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.240
<v 0>talk about Laura's for a second</v>

336
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:54.960
<v 5>is,
um,
uh,
a gentleman from Denmark who is a,</v>

337
00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:00.140
um,
uh,
proponents,
is that the right word?
He's,
he,
he basically,
he is a awesome,

338
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.070
why would this particular proponents at this very specific,
uh,

339
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.750
archery style where you hold all of your errors in one hand and you're

340
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:13.710
essentially able to feed the arrows onto the string of your boat very quickly.

341
00:21:13.711 --> 00:21:17.940
He can do I think nine and four seconds,
can he,
he can do upwards of two second.

342
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.560
And he is,
um,
it's,
it's a bit freakish actually.

343
00:21:22.561 --> 00:21:25.140
And I watched the videos and,
and I,
and I,
I didn't,

344
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:30.030
I didn't buy it to be totally honest.
I didn't think it was real.

345
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.160
And then I met him and it is real.
Um,

346
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:39.200
and it's really quite extraordinary how quick and how accurate he is from a

347
00:21:39.511 --> 00:21:40.890
great distance.
There was a day,

348
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:45.090
part of the training we did was we would run around and try and shoot each other

349
00:21:45.091 --> 00:21:49.020
with arrows with big foam heads on them.
And,
um,
and I was crying.

350
00:21:49.021 --> 00:21:53.920
I was getting paid to do this.
Shit's amazing.
Uh,
and,
um,

351
00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.800
uh,
and there was a day where I remember I,
I hit him and I didn't often hit him.

352
00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:04.160
I hit him probably from probably the length of this room away.

353
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:09.120
And,
um,
it was the first time I'd hit him.
And as I hit him,

354
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:13.640
I made the mistake of laughing.
And,
uh,

355
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:18.300
I think one gofor into that laugh.

356
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.200
He hit me right between the eyes and no life,

357
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.120
right between the eyes.

358
00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:27.050
I didn't even know it had happened until after it happened.
He,

359
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.740
he's extraordinary.
And I,
I mean,

360
00:22:28.741 --> 00:22:33.480
he's got millions and millions of hits on Youtube and in between my eyes.

361
00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:37.380
Um,
but oh yeah.
Here all weeks,
not just Jamie Fox.
You know,

362
00:22:37.381 --> 00:22:38.970
I've got a few of my back pocket.

363
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.670
Anyway,
I spent a lot of time training with him.

364
00:22:44.671 --> 00:22:48.780
And the archery style you see in the movie is what is what he taught me.
Um,

365
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:52.500
and he's very cinematic and very fast paced and was kind of,
uh,

366
00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.460
an inspired move I think on autos parts.
Cause it's,

367
00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:59.380
it's essentially Robin superpower.
That's that.
It's a superhero movie.

368
00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.150
And his archery is his super bar.

369
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.200
<v 0>What we see in the movie you are doing speed shooting.
Yeah.</v>

370
00:23:05.201 --> 00:23:09.230
I mean I think the studio actually released some clips of me training.
No,
I mean,

371
00:23:09.231 --> 00:23:11.330
you know,
one of the things we wanted to do was to,
you know,

372
00:23:11.331 --> 00:23:14.870
to make the movie feel kind of very visceral and you're in it.
And,

373
00:23:14.871 --> 00:23:17.300
and so these guys all had to get in there.

374
00:23:17.301 --> 00:23:21.800
And what you see Robin Hood do on screen Taran adjutant does,

375
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:26.990
I mean was this like a 2030 40 take thing to do all this stuff or would you like

376
00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.420
I got this,
this,
this first track.

377
00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.180
<v 5>I forgot I needed a mic.
Um,</v>

378
00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:37.460
I'm not going to pretend that every hour you see in the film is real because

379
00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.970
come on,
we're all grown ups now.

380
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:43.340
<v 0>You're shooting at Jamie.</v>

381
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.490
<v 5>Yeah.
But I think that's part why we've released these clips.</v>

382
00:23:47.491 --> 00:23:52.130
Because I did the w I did the work,
you know the clips,
you know,

383
00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.830
and I make a very bold claim to to that.

384
00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.480
I want it to be known that I did that work because that's how I think it looks

385
00:24:00.481 --> 00:24:03.450
so realistic in the film is the fact that I had that muscle memory and that

386
00:24:03.451 --> 00:24:05.900
strength from having spent eight weeks doing it in advance of shooting.

387
00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.190
<v 8>I mean Laura's is throwing up targets and turns like,</v>

388
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.490
and it's real.
Yeah,
you're hitting it.
That's great.
But let's got a question here.

389
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.590
Hey,
thanks again for coming guys.
Really appreciate it.
Uh,

390
00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:19.570
this question is for Ben.

391
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.640
I know we've touched on you have some played some really awesome learns

392
00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.970
antagonists,
one that comes to mind.

393
00:24:26.971 --> 00:24:28.950
So we got Daniel Rayburn from borderline.

394
00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.650
You play Robin in place beyond the pines.

395
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.110
I thought it was a really great character.
Thank you.
That,

396
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.670
that does seem like a departure from your personality.

397
00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:43.680
So can you tell us a little bit more about,
uh,
how to use that now?

398
00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:47.160
Can you tell us a little bit more about your creative process to get rid of,

399
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:51.660
get ready for those characters?
Do you have any good whispers that you take from

400
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.540
<v 7>Oh yeah,
no,
there's a lot of,
there's a lot of stealing.
I mean,</v>

401
00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:58.470
I think if you see something,
you,

402
00:24:58.471 --> 00:25:01.820
you want it because what you're trying to do is bring different flavors.

403
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.370
You know what I mean?
I look the way I look.

404
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.400
I have certain things that are kind of inbuilt into me and La,
la,
la,
la.

405
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:12.410
So you just looking for inspiration for,
you know,

406
00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:15.050
this would be a bit nice in here.
This would be a bit nice in there.

407
00:25:15.051 --> 00:25:17.800
So you kind of get a few ideas.
Um,

408
00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.540
you might think about a person's mindset,

409
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.410
but then here's the thing about it though.
I,

410
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.180
I really believe you do all that stuff and you kick it around in your head.

411
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.500
But then game day comes,
you sort of know the story.
You know this,
you know,

412
00:25:33.501 --> 00:25:37.770
you know everything that's going around.
But Game Day is just about,
you know,

413
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.610
frying it up,
flipping it over,
seeing what happens.

414
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.730
So it's really the freedom you allow yourself on game day.

415
00:25:43.731 --> 00:25:47.060
And what happens is this,
it all then gets assembled like,

416
00:25:47.061 --> 00:25:48.890
I would do this or do that,
do this,
do that.

417
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.810
Then it all gets assembled and that you take in as the character,

418
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.400
but there's any number of variations or ship things that I do along the way that

419
00:25:58.401 --> 00:26:00.500
don't make it in or this or that or the other.

420
00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.700
But hopefully the aggregate of all the,

421
00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:08.080
the decent stuff that works in context of the film goes in and you go,
oh,

422
00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:12.500
that's that character.
But it's not really that way when we're making it,

423
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:12.950
you know,

424
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.490
all you're doing is grabbing tiny little bits that they'll have to have their

425
00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:21.130
own kind of their own funk,
their own life to them.
Not at all.

426
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.213
Thank you.

427
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:27.990
How many pounds on the bowser use?
Hmm?

428
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.100
<v 5>For the,
I mean,
it varies.
I think the English Longbow was about,
was about,</v>

429
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.430
or you can use those stuff fast.
So I'm asking for all for the three,

430
00:26:36.431 --> 00:26:38.900
for the good of your,
I mean,
if you ask,

431
00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.610
we have different bows for different purposes when we're filming it.

432
00:26:42.611 --> 00:26:44.010
So some them are,
some

433
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.280
<v 6>are,
some are rubberized if you're using them for fights,
uh,</v>

434
00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:49.140
to Google that,

435
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.470
I was trying to get them off phone

436
00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.190
<v 9>in this big room.</v>

437
00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:00.260
<v 6>Oh yeah.
So what have I like to,
I mean,
I wouldn't know the actual waiting now.</v>

438
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.630
It was two years ago.
I've got far more important factoids

439
00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.393
<v 2>story.</v>

440
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:14.970
<v 6>That's a fair question.
I don't know how many pounds,</v>

441
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.600
fuck all that.
When I go see this,
I need to know how many pounds,

442
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:21.280
<v 2>no</v>

443
00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.090
<v 4>one a piece of popcorn will be bought till I find out how many goddamn pounds</v>

444
00:27:25.091 --> 00:27:26.170
and then his motherfucking move.

445
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.160
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

446
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:33.080
<v 9>Go on with your questions.
This question is actually for Jeremy,</v>

447
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:38.780
so I'm a big fan of your work.
Been around,
you know,
from gold digger.
Oh man,

448
00:27:38.781 --> 00:27:41.360
thanks.
Et cetera.
He was really curious,
you know,

449
00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.430
especially as a black actor in Hollywood,

450
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:48.050
it's really block out all that extra noise that's happening around you and to

451
00:27:48.051 --> 00:27:50.960
keep finding new challenges,
new projects that are going to keep you,
you know,

452
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.943
when we forward,

453
00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:55.380
<v 6>you've got a great voice too.
We've got a great voice,
right?</v>

454
00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:00.720
Like he's on CNN or something,
but here at CNN with Jamie Foxx,

455
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.693
you know what man

456
00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.050
<v 4>it is.
It's just a wonderful time to be.
I've been in the game for a minute now.</v>

457
00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:09.620
It'd be actually to beat,
to be honest.
But,
uh,
it's,
it's,

458
00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.690
it's keeping your light on.
It's like,
uh,

459
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.820
and what I mean by that is sometimes we'll reach certain successes and then

460
00:28:15.821 --> 00:28:20.070
we'll turn our light off,
you know?
Oh,
meaning like we,
we,

461
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:23.870
we forget about why we're here.
And to me I'm always sort of looking ahead.

462
00:28:23.871 --> 00:28:27.290
I feel like I'm just starting,
so when I meet these guys,
you know,

463
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:31.570
Taryn and Ben and see,
you know,
these guys had dreams and they come,

464
00:28:31.571 --> 00:28:34.640
we're in the same room together and we're doing these great projects and auto.

465
00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:38.550
So it's Sorta,
you know,
that keeps you going.
And it was,
as far as the noises,

466
00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:43.380
sorry,
I'm not for sure.
What you,
what you meant by the,
the,
the,
the noise.
Uh,

467
00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.170
<v 9>just like a general,
I mean,
I mean,</v>

468
00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.690
I'm assuming that as an actor there's just always going to be some sort of

469
00:28:49.691 --> 00:28:53.680
negative lifestyle.
The back after trying to find roles.
So more so you know,

470
00:28:53.681 --> 00:28:57.220
for you how you just,
you know,
have like a daily mantra of,
you know,

471
00:28:57.221 --> 00:28:58.440
this is what I'm going to be in the summer.

472
00:28:58.441 --> 00:29:00.190
They'll go after it in order to keep moving forward.

473
00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:03.570
<v 6>It's,
you're so soothing is how much is,</v>

474
00:29:03.571 --> 00:29:06.360
I'm gonna just get you to record like hours.
It just your voice in it.

475
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.620
And that's how I'm gonna get through all this shit and just press play.
Jamie,

476
00:29:10.621 --> 00:29:12.860
you can do it no matter what we do with true.

477
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.220
When you eat your breakfast and after you eat your breakfast,

478
00:29:15.221 --> 00:29:16.880
you're going to eat your lunch and then once you eat your electric,

479
00:29:16.881 --> 00:29:17.714
this is going to be,

480
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:22.770
<v 4>you're great man.
Listen,
to be honest with you,
I'm,
I'm glad,</v>

481
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.320
uh,
as far as being a black actor,

482
00:29:25.321 --> 00:29:28.140
this is a great time for all actors.

483
00:29:28.141 --> 00:29:31.110
But in a sense I've always wanted to be like,
uh,

484
00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.860
hopefully one day we'll be able to say,
uh,
we're eating pizza.

485
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.620
What I mean by that is this.
And then when you eat pizza,
you don't say,

486
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:40.410
this is pizza from Italy.
Italians made it.

487
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.600
So therefore when it comes as far as a black actor thing,

488
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.530
I just want to keep on growing and keep on doing things.
So where we were,

489
00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:51.790
it becomes just regular,
like,
you know,
we just doing art,

490
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.170
we're doing active.

491
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:57.610
And I do understand what you mean because when I do see like,
you know,

492
00:29:57.611 --> 00:30:00.670
John in the,
in this movie and for the kids,
it's in New Orleans,

493
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.440
the road up in a bus and were yelling out,

494
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:08.170
Jamie Foxx daikon see that and have a different perspective and not feel that

495
00:30:08.171 --> 00:30:10.390
there's ever any the stuff that you're talking about.

496
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:13.030
It just like how my daughter,
who's 10 years old,

497
00:30:13.031 --> 00:30:16.390
she doesn't know really that having a black president was a big thing.

498
00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.880
You know what I'm saying?
So we just keep moving and uh,

499
00:30:18.881 --> 00:30:19.980
and that's all you can do.

500
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.090
Keep moving and stay energetic and let me get your phone number so I didn't,

501
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:27.590
I could take your voice and use that in my next film.

502
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.280
<v 6>Great answer.
Thank you.
Thank you.</v>

503
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:32.783
<v 3>Question over here.</v>

504
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.550
<v 10>Great.
So the last quick question.</v>

505
00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:45.640
Are all the people here for Jamie?
When's,
when's her next music release?

506
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.050
<v 4>Oh,

507
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:52.570
well me and Taryn or working on some things right now and got to it.

508
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.320
What was it,
Saturday night and it ain't got nobody,
but would you say again,

509
00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:56.243

510
00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:57.650
<v 10>okay?</v>

511

<v 6>Uh,

Thank you so much.
It gives you a phone.
No,
he gave me an iPod touch.</v>

519
00:31:35.111 --> 00:31:37.590
So the music on this,
right?
It's music on here.

520
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:44.680
<v 3>Oh,
you did great.
I like that.</v>

521
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:49.450
I love the day we go to,
what's your name?

522
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:53.860
<v 4>Elbert.
That's perfect.
I knew it was going to be some high shit on him.</v>

523
00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:54.983
<v 3>Eh?</v>

524
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.500
<v 4>Did he make it happen?
They didn't have and I love it.</v>

525
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.630
<v 6>Okay.
All right.
That guy,
we've got a couple of minutes left.</v>

526
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.900
One minute left here.
What's next for you?
Uh,
Taryn.
What's going on?

527
00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:09.580
<v 10>Okay.</v>

528
00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:13.430
<v 6>Um,
uh,
I'm going to spend the next,</v>

529
00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:17.000
we're going off spreading the word about spreading the word about Robin Hood,

530
00:32:17.001 --> 00:32:19.580
which comes out on the 26th of November.
And I'm very excited about it.

531
00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:23.360
And then I'm going to go and put my feet up for a little while because I've had

532
00:32:23.361 --> 00:32:27.230
a busy summer and I am knackered.
So,
uh,

533
00:32:27.231 --> 00:32:31.880
I'm gonna enjoy Christmas to be with my family and not,
um,

534
00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:35.240
work for a little while.
I think I want to talk about rocket man.
Oh yes,

535
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:39.940
I have that.
Yes.
Okay.
I see what I see.
I see what you're doing.
Oh,
you gave me,

536
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:41.840
<v 7>that was good.
That was good as,
yeah.</v>

537
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.670
<v 5>Uh,
yeah.
My next movie,
I'm playing out in John in a musical about his life.</v>

538
00:32:46.671 --> 00:32:50.490
So that comes out in,
um,
that comes out in May,
um,

539
00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:55.940
and scraped,
you know,
the joy of,
of my job is that there's variety.

540
00:32:55.941 --> 00:33:00.200
And as Ben,
you know,
Ben talks about different flavors.
It's,
um,
a very,

541
00:33:00.201 --> 00:33:04.130
very different sides of my personality and I feel it stretched me in,

542
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:09.140
in ways I haven't been stretched before.
And,
um,
I've loved the,
actually,

543
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.970
I've really loved it and I'm very excited about the film.

544
00:33:10.971 --> 00:33:15.470
I have high hopes for it.
Yeah,
me too.
That's all.
I want more singing.

545
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:19.890
Lots of shouting,
lots of kissing men.
Um,

546
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.930
it's been awesome.
I've loved it.
It's been such a great opportunity.

547
00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.340
<v 1>Ben,
