00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.610
Hi everyone.
Welcome to toxic Google.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.750
My name is Dana and it is my pleasure today to introduce Tim League from the

3
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.340
Alamo Drafthouse.
Great to be here.
Uh,
so Tim,

4
00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:15.460
do you mind telling us just a little bit about how you went from being a

5
00:00:15.461 --> 00:00:17.560
mechanical engineer where they believe in art history,

6
00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:21.940
minor or other major to this kind of movie theater mogul?

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.630
<v 1>Well,
I think in order to answer that,
I have to back up a little bit.</v>

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.010
I went to a high school that didn't have very good college prep,

9
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.120
so I hadn't really even thought about what my life was going to be.
We never did.

10
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:38.700
We didn't have any AP classes and I was good at math.

11
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:40.740
And so that's the only guidance.
I,
God,

12
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:43.020
if you're good at math and you just go into engineering and you sort of fall

13
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:47.910
into it.
So I studied it and then it was only through the course of four years of

14
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.010
education that I realize that the very,

15
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:53.160
very tail end after I'd done all the hard work that I didn't want to do this and

16
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:56.880
it was a horrible mistake.
Yeah.
And,
uh,
in the meantime,

17
00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:59.800
I had been interning at Shell oil for,
and it was,

18
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.390
I was an awesome intern after I was a sophomore.

19
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.110
I had a really meaty project and I dove in and I just,
I didn't have any friends,

20
00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:11.400
so I just was,
I worked all summer.
Um,
and uh,

21
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.250
then the next year I was a passable intern,

22
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.740
but they still remembering how awesome I was the year before.

23
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.500
And then by the time I graduated,
I was probably a worthless employee.
Um,
uh,
uh,

24
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.960
borderline dead weight.
Um,
and,
uh,

25
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:27.390
I knew that there was going to be something else to do.

26
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.770
So on my way to shell,
I was in Bakersfield,
California,
by the way.

27
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.150
I'm in the Central Valley and on my way to work was an abandoned movie theater.

28
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.660
And then one day there was a for lease sign on said movie theater.

29
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.890
And I had always loved movies my entire life,

30
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.200
but I just never thought that there was any possibility.

31
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:49.980
I didn't want to make movies.
I just didn't think there was a career for it.
Um,

32
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.320
but then that for lease sign said to me,
uh,

33
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.530
you could actually have a career or showing your favorite movies to people and a

34
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.420
week later I was in the movie business.
So,
um,
at 23 years old with no,

35
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.240
no real experience made things happen.
Yeah.
Yeah.

36
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:09.190
Just dumb and arrogance and it was

37
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.680
<v 0>powerful.
Combo optimistic.
Yeah.
You can choose better adjectives.
Um,</v>

38
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.760
so I mean you had one theater in Bakersfield and yeah.

39
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:20.980
You have 19 and are growing and you were coming to San Francisco.
Yes.

40
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.780
I eventually figured it out.
We didn't know how to do it in the beginning,

41
00:02:23.781 --> 00:02:27.290
but yeah,
you definitely have figured that out.
Um,
so you guys have now expanded,

42
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.330
you're based in Texas,
but you have,
you know,

43
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.660
you're expanding now you're coming to the west coast and east coast in Brooklyn.

44
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.640
Um,
so can you talk a little bit about the San Francisco Theater?
Yeah,

45
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.460
I

46
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.210
<v 1>was interested in expanding the,
the company at a certain point.</v>

47
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:45.300
We were growing and we're growing and we were always an Austin based company.

48
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.630
And then,
um,
uh,
you know,
a lot of things happen with the company.
And,
uh,

49
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.190
we started this growth trajectory,

50
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.280
but then I started to think if we move nationally,

51
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.710
we could expand what we're doing.

52
00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:03.070
We could like this idea of sharing movies that we love with as many people as

53
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.430
possible becomes more interesting if you look at it nationally.

54
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.950
And so once I made that step,

55
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:12.430
the first thing I wanted to do was to open up in some pretty serious markets

56
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:16.420
like Los Angeles,
New York,
and San Francisco.
But the three that I chose,

57
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.000
and that was five or six years ago.

58
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:22.450
And now we're finally opening up the first one of those here in San Francisco.

59
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.100
Um,
you know,
later on this year.

60
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.830
<v 0>Um,
so you picked the,
I think gets the,
at the time,</v>

61
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.780
the old mission theater not gonna be the new mission theater,

62
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:31.600
which is this kind of his store,
the hidden gem.
Well,

63
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.990
going to be a gem of a theater.
Um,
can you talk about kind of the,

64
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.320
the plans for it?
I know it was when it was once we,

65
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.640
I believe in now it's going to be several.

66
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.620
<v 1>Yeah.
And so it actually made the name chains from the mission theater to the new</v>

67
00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:48.300
mission theater in the 20s.
And so it was a single screen sort of shotgun,

68
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:52.830
very small theater,
uh,
from uh,
with 98 years ago,

69
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.570
whenever that was a,
and then in the 1920s,
it was renovated and it,

70
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.900
they created this a movie palace and the back of the shotgun theater.

71
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.090
So the new mission is actually an 80 year old name,
90 year old name.
But,
um,

72
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.280
uh,
I first got a heads up about it from a,

73
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.720
just a friend of mine that was living in the mission.

74
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.930
So I was looking at other properties around the city looking at possibly new

75
00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:20.700
development.
And this buddy of mine,

76
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.410
I guess went in there when it was a futon shop and you wandered past where

77
00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:28.740
you're supposed to wander cause they just had futon stacked up in the lobby.

78
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.200
And then if you go past the last line of Futons,

79
00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:34.200
you saw this glorious expanse of a grand old theater.

80
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.390
And so he called me and said,
you should think about this.
And um,
uh,
you know,

81
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.470
five years later here we are.

82
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.110
<v 0>Yeah.
I think it's,</v>

83
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.410
it's really great for dusting the area just because like a lot of developments

84
00:04:45.411 --> 00:04:47.030
in San Francisco especially,
you know,

85
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.630
everything becomes something different and new.
And this is nice to be seen,

86
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.910
like see a theater being restored to being a theater,

87
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.730
a instead of a futon shop and serving its original purpose.
Um,

88
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.160
I think a big thing for me,
it seemed like the,
um,
you know,

89
00:05:01.161 --> 00:05:04.130
Alamo Drafthouse community is being a part of the community.

90
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.540
Do you have any plans to kind of integrate into that area?
Yeah.

91
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.150
You bring the vibe of San Francisco to this theater or

92
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.420
<v 1>we're just starting to hire and so that's going to be reflected in our hiring.</v>

93
00:05:14.421 --> 00:05:18.770
So we hired a,
our first creative manager position.
This Guy Mike Keegan,

94
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.940
who used to run the programming at the Roxy for a number of years and then he

95
00:05:22.941 --> 00:05:26.570
left.
Uh,
he had this project he worked on last year,
um,

96
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.310
where he was touring this festival of cat videos across the country.

97
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.430
I don't know.
Uh,
uh,

98
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.460
and so he was looking for a Gig and I really like his experience and his energy

99
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:43.640
and so he's going to be programming a lot of the theater.
Uh,
we've,

100
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.080
we've just made an offer to somebody to be the,
our community liaison.

101
00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:51.920
So it's basically working with the nonprofits and the film festivals in the

102
00:05:51.921 --> 00:05:52.754
neighborhood and uh,

103
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.550
making the space available kind of as a community arts center.

104
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.870
And so that will be soon.
We hired a bar manager,
a sky,

105
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:03.410
Isaac Shumway who,
um,
uh,
was from Bourbon and branch and Tosca.

106
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.970
So we're trying to find people that fit with our aesthetic that are from San

107
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.030
Francisco that you don't know the neighborhood live in the neighborhood.
Mike,

108
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.690
the creative manager lives a block and a quarter from the theater.

109
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:16.760
He lives on mission like in the next block up.
So

110
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.870
<v 0>working,
working out will be very intertwined for him.
Um,</v>

111
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.710
is that something,
you know,

112
00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:26.770
that you guys typically put a level of caring to all of your theaters?

113
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.860
Is that something that as you expand your finding harder to do,
or do you,

114
00:06:29.861 --> 00:06:33.760
is that kind of a core mission of yours to make sure that that quality control

115
00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:36.450
is,
is in every single theater that you opened?

116
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.140
<v 1>Yeah,
it's the only way that the,
um,</v>

117
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.280
that the project is exciting to me.
I mean,
we're,
we are,

118
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.420
we are a chain.

119
00:06:45.421 --> 00:06:48.420
We had to go through all the hoops that you have to go through by opening a

120
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.190
business in San Francisco and being a chain.
And I hate,
I hate chains,
you know,

121
00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:54.260
and so I don't,
I,

122
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.470
I'm in a strange position where I want to make sure that as we expand,

123
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.260
um,
that we do it in a way that feels right.
So in this,

124
00:07:03.261 --> 00:07:07.350
it largely is built upon this idea of hiring,
um,
you know,
the chef,

125
00:07:07.351 --> 00:07:10.220
the bar manager or the creative person in the creative,
uh,

126
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.980
the community liaison that live in the neighborhood know the neighborhood and

127
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.310
just letting go and letting them be,

128
00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:19.650
it'd be a reflection of their personalities and not mine.

129
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.591
<v 0>Is there,</v>

130
00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:24.570
is there kind of room to grow for each of the different sort of markets that
you,

131
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.610
you know,
do you allow them that sort of creative freedom to them or is there

132
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.320
<v 1>absolutely.
Yeah.
I mean the,
the,</v>

133
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.190
the menu is going to be rethought the farm and he was going to be rethought.

134
00:07:33.191 --> 00:07:36.970
The programming's going to be a reflection of Mike's,
you know,

135
00:07:36.971 --> 00:07:40.270
somewhat sick and twisted brain.
I don't know.
Um,
so,
you know,

136
00:07:40.271 --> 00:07:42.550
they'll be some support that we offer from head office,

137
00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:46.030
but really I want them to just kind of take on their own and take it and run

138
00:07:46.031 --> 00:07:46.540
with it.
We,

139
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:51.220
we set some general guidelines and we hire people that we think are reflective

140
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.890
of our brand,
but then,
um,
it's,
it's,

141
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:56.380
there's to excel or screw up.

142
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.670
<v 0>Let's,
speaking of your brain,
you guys have kind of gone from Juniata.
You're a,</v>

143
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.690
you're a chain,
but you're also kind of this growing empire,
uh,

144
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:09.570
very cool things.
You know,
you've got Mondo,
which does amazing art.
Um,

145
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.460
you got to have fantastic best,
which is,
you know,

146
00:08:11.461 --> 00:08:16.260
this amazing film festival and now you're distributing films.
Um,
you know,

147
00:08:16.261 --> 00:08:20.370
how has it been kind of evolving from this single theater into this multiple

148
00:08:20.371 --> 00:08:22.590
theater and this multi-headed kind of entity?

149
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:25.630
<v 1>You know,
I,
it was all,</v>

150
00:08:25.631 --> 00:08:29.930
it's all been fairly organic growth in a way.
I,

151
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.540
uh,
I would love to say that I had a master plan to build at all,
but,
um,

152
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.830
you know,
Mondo for example,
which is the kind of art gallery and,
um,

153
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.970
a boutique posters side of the business.

154
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.450
I had some street facing retail at our first location.

155
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.110
It was about five feet by five feet.
And I said,
I'm not utilizing this.

156
00:08:50.111 --> 00:08:53.050
So we started selling tee shirts and tee shirts,

157
00:08:53.051 --> 00:08:57.750
morphed into posters and posters became an explosive category.

158
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.270
And so it was almost like an accidental business,

159
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:03.990
but we brought in people that were very passionate about,
um,

160
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.330
a very specific thing.
And you know,

161
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:11.010
those people are still not in creative control today.
Yeah.
That's like 10 years,

162
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.863
10,
11 years ago.

163
00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.320
<v 0>Yeah.
It's amazing.
All the Mondo.
Um,</v>

164
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.000
so I'm used to be that.
So you've also got the distribution side.
Yeah.
Um,

165
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.750
can you talk a little bit more about that and kind of where that's headed?

166
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.200
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,</v>

167
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.980
so that was an offshoot of fantastic fest,

168
00:09:27.981 --> 00:09:32.690
which is a genre film festival,
horror science fiction,
fantasy weirdo movies,

169
00:09:32.691 --> 00:09:36.180
which is where my tastes have always kind of been a,

170
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.400
but then we would play these movies at the festival and there'd be incredible

171
00:09:40.401 --> 00:09:42.170
films,
a lot of foreign language films,

172
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.990
and they would never find a home beyond the festival circuit.

173
00:09:44.991 --> 00:09:47.060
And that was frustrating to me.
Um,

174
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.540
and there was one film in particular that I saw,

175
00:09:50.541 --> 00:09:53.360
I got hired out to throw a party at Sundance.

176
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:58.310
And so I went and I watched a few movies and I watched a movie called four
lions,

177
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.320
which is,
um,
uh,
British television director,
producer that,

178
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.540
who this is his first feature.
And I was a huge fan of his TV work.

179
00:10:05.541 --> 00:10:08.600
And I just went in as a fan and I said,
oh,
that'll,
that'll sell.

180
00:10:08.601 --> 00:10:11.230
I'll see that somewhere down the road.
And then seven months later,

181
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.380
the movie hadn't sold and I just got mad.

182
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.510
And so,
uh,

183
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.250
I concocted another half baked idea to start a distribution company to work in

184
00:10:22.251 --> 00:10:25.100
concert with a growing cinema brand.
Um,

185
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.470
and that movie was a jihadi suicide bomber comedy.
Um,

186
00:10:30.471 --> 00:10:35.370
so,
you know,
obviously that's maybe touchy subject material,
but,
um,
yeah,

187
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:36.850
<v 0>or niche audience.</v>

188
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:41.620
<v 1>Uh,
but it did well and,
um,
that spurred us on to,
you know,</v>

189
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.630
try to find challenging,
unique films.

190
00:10:43.631 --> 00:10:48.631
And also the goal really is to try to make sure that there's a young audience

191
00:10:49.511 --> 00:10:53.270
for foreign language film and challenging film like that.
Um,
there,

192
00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.130
there are certainly,

193
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:58.810
it was cool to go to see foreign language films when I was 18 and I don't think

194
00:10:58.811 --> 00:11:01.480
it necessarily is anymore and I don't know why.

195
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.870
So I'm trying to make it palatable to younger people,

196
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.730
<v 0>I think.
I think by kind of adding that experience factor to it,
you know,</v>

197
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:12.510
it does help make it more appealing.
Yeah.
Um,
so,

198
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.250
but speaking of that,
I should have,

199
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.040
that's actually that I was trying to think of it.
Um,

200
00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:23.310
so just speaking of experiences like I think you guys are also known for,

201
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.500
you know,
making these huge experience things a,

202
00:11:26.501 --> 00:11:30.120
I think you just did jaw like 40th anniversary of jaws where people watched it

203
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:33.120
from the water.
Yes.
Um,
is that,

204
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:35.850
is that kind of something that you're thinking about when you're picking films

205
00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:36.391
to distribute?

206
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:40.110
Like how can you make an experience or is that kind of a very separate,
uh,

207
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.110
thought process?
Yeah,

208
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.310
<v 1>uh,
well the process for me is what will go to festivals.</v>

209
00:11:46.311 --> 00:11:50.540
A lot of times it's where we pick up most of the films we acquire.
Um,

210
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.880
we'll watch them at first.
We have to love it.

211
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:57.710
So we really only work on films that we love.
Um,
which strangely is not the,
the,

212
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.310
well,
it's probably not the best financial business model either,

213
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:05.140
but it's not the,
it's not the norm.
Um,
you know,
uh,
so if we love it,

214
00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.390
then we go back to the hotel room and,
um,

215
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.920
we pound out kind of a marketing proposal.

216
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.690
It's like this is all the things we're going to do.

217
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.180
This is how we're going to make build awareness for this film.

218
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.400
And then we put together a financial model based on comparable titles and then

219
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:26.320
we make our offer and we can kind of pitch.
Um,
and sometimes you get it,

220
00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:29.590
sometimes you don't.
Um,
we don't have a huge pocket book,

221
00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:32.920
so usually if we don't get a movie,
it's because we're not willing to pay enough.

222
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.660
But have there been any that you've kind of had to weigh your role as a business

223
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.280
person and it and go like,
oh,

224
00:12:39.281 --> 00:12:42.400
I really like this was kind of on the cusp and we're not sure if it would be

225
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.480
worth it?
Or is it always just kind of artistry first?
Well,
it's accommodated.

226
00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:49.300
Artistry gets us to thinking about it and putting the model together.

227
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.610
The model can blow it up where we say,
you know what,

228
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.900
this doesn't make sense for us.

229
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.770
And so we've walked away from a lot of titles and there's titles that we've lost

230
00:12:56.771 --> 00:12:59.980
because we're not willing to gamble.
I,
you know,

231
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:04.270
an extra couple hundred thousand dollars or whatever it is to buy a movie.
Um,

232
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.540
and if we would've written a bigger check,
we would have gotten it,

233
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:11.500
but it's already,
it's not the profitable side of the business for me.
You know,

234
00:13:11.501 --> 00:13:14.230
I think eventually it may be,
will be if we get to be a bigger company,

235
00:13:14.231 --> 00:13:17.500
but right now it's still,
um,
it's still pretty thin.

236
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.810
Do you have any thoughts to expand this to production?
Sure,
yeah,

237
00:13:22.811 --> 00:13:27.430
we've actually dabbled a little bit.
Um,
I,
uh,
I coproduced,

238
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:31.580
uh,
two movies called the abcs of death.
Uh,

239
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:34.930
and so this also comes out of fantastic fest.

240
00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:39.640
A lot of things come out of the community of fantastic fest.
And so we took 20,

241
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.860
25 directors that we knew from fantastic fest and we gave them a small budget

242
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.450
and a letter of the alphabet.

243
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.770
So every four minutes there's a death by that letter.
So real fast paced.
Um,

244
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.550
and then we did a,
uh,
worldwide contest to become the 26th director.

245
00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:56.770
And the first one was really successful.

246
00:13:56.771 --> 00:13:59.530
It's actually our most successful film we've ever been involved with that.

247
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:03.220
So we did a sequel and we might do a part three.
Um,

248
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:07.230
it was called the abcs of death to
a,

249
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:11.280
and then most recently we just,
um,
uh,

250
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.220
co produced a movie again of fantastic fest veteran.

251
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.300
And so there were four of us that put in a small amount of money,
uh,

252
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.400
under $500,000 budget to produce a horror film and uh,

253
00:14:23.401 --> 00:14:27.070
called the greasy strangler.
Um,
and uh,

254
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.420
but we own worldwide rights on it.

255
00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:33.280
So we're thinking if we cure rate well and I keep the budget tight,

256
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:38.230
um,
and we're basically a backstop for distribution as Drafthouse films,

257
00:14:38.231 --> 00:14:42.810
then we can hopefully make these low budget films work and it becomes a,

258
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:47.860
you know,
uh,
uh,
a way for short film makers to step into the feature world,

259
00:14:47.861 --> 00:14:52.160
for example,
which is this case,
I think you guys are great kind of safe space

260
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.050
<v 0>for this sort of fringe ish.</v>

261
00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.230
Maybe not everybody's interest,

262
00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:00.260
but like there's this huge fan base when these things and you know,

263
00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:01.680
I think a fantastic lesson now this

264
00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.040
<v 1>drag was pretty versus it's going to be wonderful.</v>

265
00:15:05.041 --> 00:15:09.450
It's sort of like this guy makes films that are sort of vaguely reminiscent of a

266
00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:11.520
Wes Anderson world.
But everything is sort of sickened,

267
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.490
decaying around the edges and everybody looks a little bit like a mutant.

268
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.870
So anyway,

269
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:21.380
<v 0>sign me out.
Really funny though.
Um,
I think,
uh,
you know,</v>

270
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.650
what are the other things you guys are great at though is also kind of

271
00:15:23.651 --> 00:15:25.480
pioneering and like standing up for things.

272
00:15:25.481 --> 00:15:28.510
And one of the things that you guys did last year was you screened the interview

273
00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:31.590
when know when a very few people were willing to,
um,

274
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.500
can you talk a little about kind of the decision behind sort of standing up for

275
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:37.910
America?
I don't know.

276
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.920
<v 1>Um,
it was just a funny,
it was a funny month and you know,</v>

277
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.370
I know you guys were in involved in a,
uh,

278
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.010
in a sense in that same debate,
um,

279
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.510
in the same sort of risks I guess becoming forward on that movie.

280
00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.630
But,
um,
you know,
it's,

281
00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.730
it's a straight down the Middle Alamo Drafthouse type of movie.
I mean,

282
00:16:01.731 --> 00:16:05.960
Seth Rogen comedies do well for us.
It's a good movie to drink beer too.

283
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.250
Um,
and I had seen it earlier,
I saw it earlier in the month.

284
00:16:10.251 --> 00:16:13.460
We did a sneak preview with,
um,
uh,

285
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:18.040
with Seth Rogen and Evan Katz that came down.
Um,
and,
uh,

286
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.500
uh,
at the time,
they're like,
yeah,
you know,

287
00:16:20.501 --> 00:16:23.930
it's a little bit challenging with the,
the leak from Sony,

288
00:16:23.931 --> 00:16:25.130
but we're proceeding as normal.

289
00:16:25.131 --> 00:16:29.180
And then the threats came out that any theater that would show it,
you know,

290
00:16:29.181 --> 00:16:33.350
there would be a terrorist attack shown,
you know,
uh,
directed at the theater.

291
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.610
And so within a day,
I think the big majors,

292
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:42.611
the top five majors in us and Canada dropped out and pull the film and then Sony

293
00:16:43.491 --> 00:16:46.970
quickly,
within a few hours of that said,
well,

294
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.510
because there are no theaters that will play the interview,

295
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.910
we're pulling it out of re release entirely.

296
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:58.100
And I think I come to decisions out of anger,
I guess a lot as a,

297
00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:01.640
so that pissed me off a little bit because like,
Hey,
we're here,
you know,
we'll,

298
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.470
we'll do it.
And so this is just a couple of days before Christmas,

299
00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.990
uh,
and I got on the phone with,

300
00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.530
I'm part of this organization called the art house convergence.
You know,

301
00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:14.060
we're not purely an art house,

302
00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:17.380
but we have one foot and commercial in art house spaces and we're,

303
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.830
we love this organization.

304
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:24.110
And it was a great dialogue because the,
um,
it,

305
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.910
the interview became an art film because of the context and because of the

306
00:17:28.911 --> 00:17:32.060
controversy.
And so all of these theaters were,

307
00:17:32.061 --> 00:17:34.390
which are traditional art house theaters.
Uh,

308
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.750
within a day we had gotten commitments from over 300 theaters to say,
yes,

309
00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:42.160
we will play this movie because it is important.
Um,

310
00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.800
and then the next day we went public.
Um,
uh,
and you know,

311
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.680
took some interviews on the subject,
uh,
which made my,

312
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.740
my parents and my inlaws really nervous for,
you know,

313
00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:55.470
just being quoted because it was,
it was really hungry.

314
00:17:55.471 --> 00:17:58.200
They were hungry for anybody to talk about it.
And we were pretty,

315
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:02.790
pretty much the first theater to say,
yes,
we'll definitely do this.

316
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.420
Um,
so there wasn't a terrorist attack called on the theater.
Um,

317
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.740
whether the North Koreans were actually involved in any way,
shape or form,

318
00:18:10.741 --> 00:18:14.430
and there remains to be seen.
I don't know.
Um,

319
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.840
but yeah,
it was great.
It felt great.
Um,
and,

320
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:22.440
and it gave the independent theater is a really strong voice to say.

321
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.920
And,

322
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.920
and that we're a part of exhibition in the U S and I think in the wake of that

323
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.610
like the art house convergence theaters have actually had a bigger seat at the

324
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:37.260
table where before it was dominated by regal AMC Cinemark and states.

325
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.510
<v 0>Yeah.
I think,
um,
you know,</v>

326
00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:43.020
you guys have kind of set this quietly set the standard for it.
Like,
you know,

327
00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:45.450
I see AMCs now have dinner and a movie,

328
00:18:45.451 --> 00:18:48.320
but that was when you guys first like without that,

329
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.360
the hobbit face is like one of the most famous kind of dinner and a movie things

330
00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:54.090
you guys do.
And,
and it's,
um,
you know,

331
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:57.900
it's interesting because like it's this kind of large corporations imitating

332
00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.110
smaller groups.
But do you,

333
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.010
do you still find that like the core of what you guys do is sort of maintained

334
00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:09.840
by this kind of care and loving sort of thing that you put into all of your,

335
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:10.681
like I used to,

336
00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:14.550
I assume everybody who works for Alamo is as passionate as you are about the

337
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:15.780
things that they do for it.

338
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:20.290
<v 1>That's what we aspire to for sure.
Um,
and we,</v>

339
00:19:20.291 --> 00:19:24.840
we invest pretty heavily in creative people.
So,
um,
I'm,

340
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:30.010
I'm not threatened by AMC offering dinner and a movie service and I actually

341
00:19:30.181 --> 00:19:34.320
want,
I want everybody in exhibition tick care about this,

342
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.060
the experience,
as much as I do,

343
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.580
like it doesn't really matter what we do in the grand scheme of things.

344
00:19:38.581 --> 00:19:40.050
We're a tiny little drop in the bucket,

345
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.080
but I want the action of going to the movies to be special forever.

346
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:48.180
And so that means everybody's got to be really good.
So

347
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.150
<v 0>I think this probably comes up a lot,</v>

348
00:19:50.151 --> 00:19:53.000
but the kind of action of going to the movies and that experience being special.

349
00:19:53.001 --> 00:19:53.600
I mean,

350
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.300
in film school we had a saying that there's a special circle in hell reserved

351
00:19:56.301 --> 00:19:57.470
for people who talk during movies.

352
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:02.450
And you guys have kind of been leading this sort of not leading the charge,

353
00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:06.230
but you are very vocal about that sort of sacred movie space.

354
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:11.440
I know that there was a leaked voicemail years ago with a very upset patron who

355
00:20:11.631 --> 00:20:12.680
got kicked out.
Um,

356
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.830
do you find that now that you've kind of set your flag on this and like,

357
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.950
you know,
we don't tolerate this,
that people have kind of fallen into line and,

358
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.160
and treat their space with more respect?

359
00:20:22.161 --> 00:20:24.890
Or do you still find their kind of incidents now because you guys have that

360
00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:27.050
whole great PSA series and,

361
00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.870
<v 1>uh,
there's still incidences?
So like,
um,
uh,</v>

362
00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.330
it still happens that we have to kick people out of the theater and it's,
it's,

363
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.590
it's a pretty dicey proposition a lot of times.
Um,
you know,
uh,

364
00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:43.680
but 99.9% of the time it's fine and we're so clear about what the rules of are

365
00:20:47.891 --> 00:20:52.000
inside the theater and what the penalties and ramifications are for breaking

366
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:56.720
this social contract with us.
That by being absolutely clear,

367
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.220
clear,
and being known for a company that actually does enforce it,

368
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.370
it just kind of solves the problem.
So,
um,

369
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:07.240
we opened up the theater and upstate New York,
not upstate,
but just Westchester,

370
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:12.160
just north of um,
uh,
New York City proper.
And people are like,

371
00:21:12.161 --> 00:21:14.980
oh,
it's,
you know,
it's all well and good in Texas,

372
00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:17.980
but in New York you never going to get people to stop talking during movies and,

373
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.870
you know,
it's been mildly challenging at times,
but in general it's been fine.

374
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.390
We haven't had that much of an issue up there.

375
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:30.400
<v 0>That's great.
Um,
I think,
uh,
I think one of the big things is like,
have you,</v>

376
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:33.760
have you seen the kind of publicity you get from,
you know,
you are,

377
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.420
there are only a couple of,
at the end of the,
there are a good number of them,

378
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:40.810
but they're not necessarily,
you know,
there's not like a Alamo in every city.

379
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.460
Right.
But you do get a lot of kind of internet,
um,

380
00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.850
Preston and there's an awareness.
Um,
do you find that,
um,

381
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:52.330
that's kind of helped you as a brand or do you find it challenging and that you

382
00:21:52.331 --> 00:21:55.300
want to kind of go to maybe all of these cities but can't because there is that

383
00:21:55.301 --> 00:21:59.560
kind of extra care needed to,
to open a new location?

384
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:01.320
<v 1>Uh,</v>

385
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:06.180
it certainly helped us to have some level of awareness going to into a new city.

386
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:06.721
Uh,

387
00:22:06.721 --> 00:22:11.610
I think San Francisco has been great because there's a decent pipeline of people

388
00:22:11.611 --> 00:22:13.920
to go back and forth between Austin and San Francisco.

389
00:22:13.921 --> 00:22:17.330
And so some people have had exposure in Austin.
Um,
you,
we have a,

390
00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:21.420
he's not quite the same level of tech industry in Austin,
but you know,
it's,

391
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.400
it's not bad.
Uh,
and that's,

392
00:22:23.401 --> 00:22:26.610
that's helped to have it be sort of seated with people who know the experience

393
00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:30.410
and,
and we try.
We've,
yeah,
we've,
we've put together a,
um,

394
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:35.790
a website called,
well,
we just changed the name recently,
but birth movies,
death.

395
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:40.890
And so that's a national site where we talk about movies.
Um,
and to see it,

396
00:22:40.891 --> 00:22:41.581
to my knowledge,

397
00:22:41.581 --> 00:22:46.581
it's the only movie review a news website run by an exhibitor where all movies

398
00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.520
are not awesome,
you know,
so it'll be,
in fact,
you know,

399
00:22:53.521 --> 00:22:54.930
Devin for Archie who runs it,

400
00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:59.260
he's kind of a curmudgeon and he hates a lot of movies.
Um,

401
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:04.230
but for me it's the only way to have any sort of integrity in that space is to

402
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:09.980
be present negative reviews of movies alongside positive reviews.
And

403
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:14.330
<v 0>it's offering you an honest opinion as opposed.
Yeah,
yeah.
Filtered one.
Um,</v>

404
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.890
is there any space that you haven't touched upon yet that you want to expand

405
00:23:17.891 --> 00:23:18.724
into?

406
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:24.020
<v 1>I'm,
I think I'm strictly forbidden from starting any new businesses,</v>

407
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:28.100
so I have the correct answer is no.
Um,

408
00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:33.260
uh,
on the Mondo side,
we're going to probably do next year,

409
00:23:33.261 --> 00:23:36.080
we're planning to do some more apparel.
Like we have a,

410
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:40.850
we have a big line of holiday sweaters coming out,
uh,
uh,

411
00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.970
guess to start doing twice as well.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
yeah,

412
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.310
finally shipped.
This is a funny business with,
with those kind of boutique toys,

413
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:50.331
uh,
you know,

414
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:55.331
you take preorders and then it's so expensive to do that and it's so intricate

415
00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.920
that the product doesn't ship for 16 months,
which that's alien to me.

416
00:24:00.921 --> 00:24:04.070
That's not how I buy things.
I want it in two hours.
So

417
00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:09.100
<v 0>when you came in the mail,
it was so exciting.
Yeah.
Um,
do,</v>

418
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:10.690
do you kind of find that,
you know,

419
00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:14.080
you're having to apply different sort of expectations of the different parts of

420
00:24:14.081 --> 00:24:17.470
the business?
Um,
you know,
as you said,
it takes like 16 months to make a toy,

421
00:24:17.471 --> 00:24:19.810
but it takes years to build a theater.
Yeah.

422
00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.220
<v 1>And I think in the early days when we were building new theaters,
um,
uh,</v>

423
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.780
we,
it was a lot faster for us and it was in our own backyard.

424
00:24:28.781 --> 00:24:32.070
And actually Texas,
at least back then.
Um,

425
00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.080
it's not that it was the wild west,
but it was a lot easier,

426
00:24:35.081 --> 00:24:39.370
a lot fewer constraints in terms of the development process.

427
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.020
And so,
you know,

428
00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:46.050
doing a full interior exterior historic renovation project in San Francisco,

429
00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:47.800
um,

430
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.970
is about the most radically different ends of the spectrum to what I used to do.

431
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:57.280
Um,
so I,
south Lamar,
which is our kind of flagship theater in Austin,

432
00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:02.560
I had the idea to open that theater and from idea to opening day with six

433
00:25:02.561 --> 00:25:07.360
months,
and we had,
we built the whole theater.
Um,
it was just fast and it was no,

434
00:25:07.361 --> 00:25:10.870
nobody standing in my way.
Uh,
and here it's,
you know,

435
00:25:10.871 --> 00:25:15.760
this is more of a five year project and so,
um,
but that's fine.

436
00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.370
Um,
and some other things to keep you busy.
Yeah,
it's all good.

437
00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:20.920
And San Francisco did something really interesting.

438
00:25:20.921 --> 00:25:25.921
And then the reason why we're able to have the mission as a project is that that

439
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:30.460
historic theater spaces are generally really well protected.

440
00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:34.870
So there's only a couple of things that that space could be remodeled into.

441
00:25:34.871 --> 00:25:37.300
It could be like a live music space or it could be a theater space.

442
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:40.780
I'm not sure how the futon shop worked,
but um,
but they didn't read the,
you know,

443
00:25:40.781 --> 00:25:43.960
they,
I don't hit yeah,
everything we want to think about that.
But uh,
uh,

444
00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:44.853
but it was,

445
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.780
they couldn't massively redevelop that into something else because it's an

446
00:25:49.781 --> 00:25:50.860
important historic structure.

447
00:25:50.861 --> 00:25:54.640
It's the same architects that built the backside that built the Castro and it's,

448
00:25:54.641 --> 00:25:58.150
you know,
San Francisco architects.
It's,
it's worthy of preservation.

449
00:25:58.900 --> 00:25:59.960
Thank you for presenting it.
Yeah,

450
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.410
<v 0>no problem.
Bringing new life to it.</v>

451
00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.330
I think we're going to open up to audience questions.
Sure.

452
00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.000
<v 1>Must've been considered to,</v>

453
00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.560
allows others to come in and not interrupt their viewing experience.

454
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:09.390
I don't know.

455
00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:13.080
I just felt like there was a lot of the wedding and you seen something like that

456
00:26:13.081 --> 00:26:17.180
before or how,
how did that come up that conceit?
Sure,
sure.

457
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:18.770
The question is basically the,

458
00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:24.210
the specifics about the Alamo Drafthouse from the table configuration to the

459
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:28.100
service model.
How much of that was preconceived?
Um,

460
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.550
and if there are any inspirations,
uh,

461
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:34.820
there's definitely a one big inspiration and,
uh,

462
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.670
go back to the first theater in Bakersfield,
which by the way,
was it,

463
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:43.350
I didn't mention that it's a total unmitigated disaster.
It was a horrible,
uh,

464
00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.460
horrible,
that's me,
sorry.
Horrible experience in a lot of ways.

465
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:51.300
Great experience because I learned the business,
but we,
we,
it just failed.

466
00:26:51.301 --> 00:26:56.110
It was a failed business in every possible way.
Uh,
but during that,
um,

467
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.870
my girlfriend and I,
we got married in the middle of it.

468
00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.760
It was this courtship trial by fire.
You know,
we,
we lived in the theater,

469
00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.820
uh,
and we worked every single day.

470
00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.690
And so we never left the theater and it was incredibly stressful because we

471
00:27:10.691 --> 00:27:14.890
weren't making any money and we figured we still love each other.
And,
uh,
uh,

472
00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.470
so that's,
uh,
I highly recommend that.

473
00:27:17.471 --> 00:27:20.110
Did like work through a failed business together and see if you still want to

474
00:27:20.111 --> 00:27:22.810
get married.
Um,
but our honeymoon,

475
00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.220
we went up to Portland to go spy on a McMenamins theater,

476
00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:29.800
which has kind of a food and beer model.

477
00:27:29.801 --> 00:27:31.980
It's a little bit different than what we do.
Um,

478
00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:36.490
but we had heard about it and we're already making plans knowing that

479
00:27:36.491 --> 00:27:41.470
Bakersfield,
we could sense the Bakersfield was going to eventually truly fail,

480
00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.700
um,
that we were gonna try to rise from the ashes and do things a little bit

481
00:27:45.701 --> 00:27:47.990
differently.
And so,
um,

482
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:51.900
we checked out what they did on it was a working honeymoon.
Um,
well we,

483
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.320
we visited a bunch of their theaters and then we,
uh,
uh,

484
00:27:56.321 --> 00:27:59.650
when we finally shut down Bakersfield and moved on to Austin,

485
00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:05.130
we spent about six months workshopping the menu and,

486
00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:08.200
uh,
the table configuration and the service model,

487
00:28:08.201 --> 00:28:09.310
how it was all going to work in it.

488
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.550
That really hasn't changed too much since the very early days,

489
00:28:12.551 --> 00:28:16.060
so that I can actually say we,
um,

490
00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:19.450
did plan ahead and that it worked too for the most part.

491
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:23.710
<v 2>I had a question how you encouraged to be different sizes of the theaters.</v>

492
00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.510
I guess the mission,

493
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:29.890
there's only going to be fewer screens then in the mini and Austin,

494
00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.600
like event impact,

495
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:35.900
the types of shows do you film or that you'd scream?
How'd,

496
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.820
how do you sort of approach the different venue space configuration?

497
00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:44.920
<v 1>I think the question is how do we approach the different venue spaces in terms</v>

498
00:28:44.921 --> 00:28:46.240
of the sizes of the theaters,

499
00:28:46.241 --> 00:28:50.300
the number of different auditoriums in each project.
For the mission,

500
00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:54.230
we,
we can't change too much.

501
00:28:54.231 --> 00:28:58.070
I mean the mission was configured to have a main room and then two balconies.

502
00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:03.320
So we kept the main room in tact and we subdivided the first balcony into three

503
00:29:03.321 --> 00:29:06.020
little tiny micro theaters that are like 35 seats each.

504
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:11.210
And then the second balcony is about,
it's a larger room with about 120 seats.

505
00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.620
And then the main room has about 300 seats.
Um,
so,

506
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:19.460
uh,
then we have to pass that by historic,
um,

507
00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:24.050
to get their approval for our plans.
And so they approved that design.

508
00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.740
And then we'll build a financial model to see,
you know,

509
00:29:27.741 --> 00:29:31.370
based on our fill rates for various sizes of rooms,

510
00:29:31.371 --> 00:29:34.640
how much top line revenue are we going to generate and how much net profit are

511
00:29:34.641 --> 00:29:37.430
we going to theoretically have with those types of rooms.

512
00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:42.040
I wish we had more seats at the mission when we're building from scratch,

513
00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:44.560
like we're building from scratch and um,
Brooklyn.

514
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:50.100
And so that has more like 850 seats as opposed to 550 and the mission and we

515
00:29:51.431 --> 00:29:55.470
have eight or nine theaters.
Uh,
but what the mission does have is,

516
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.480
is what I like is having this range of,
of rooms.

517
00:29:58.481 --> 00:30:03.481
So having 35 seat theaters allows me to be able to program some pretty esoteric

518
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.950
films.
So if you play something,
you get 25 people in a 300 seat room,

519
00:30:08.951 --> 00:30:10.990
it's a complete disaster failure.

520
00:30:10.991 --> 00:30:15.580
But if you have 25 people in a 35 seat room,
it's a total win.

521
00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:16.443
And you can,

522
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.630
those are the type of movies that you can build if we're word of mouth.

523
00:30:19.631 --> 00:30:21.940
And those are the type of movies that we buy.
Two.

524
00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:25.580
So we'll play some Drafthouse films,
titles in the smaller rooms,
um,

525
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:30.340
and we play a mix of independent and a commercial.
So,
you know,

526
00:30:30.341 --> 00:30:33.580
we're going to open up,
right.
You know,
hopefully.
Uh,

527
00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:37.660
and then on the short horizon will be Star Wars.
So we'll play star wars and,
um,

528
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:41.050
I think I went on the black this people are excited about that movie and the

529
00:30:41.051 --> 00:30:42.940
people are going to go,
but I don't know what do I know?

530
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.270
<v 2>Big Fan of one,
two,</v>

531
00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:53.890
three in Austin and convince me go there every time and I let him walk away from

532
00:30:55.711 --> 00:30:56.710
the original one.

533
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:05.670
So I think my friends,
honestly,
that was in the,
they're always saying,
okay,

534
00:31:05.671 --> 00:31:06.700
when is it going to open

535
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:13.500
and keep up on the website so they turn to home that he think that this year

536
00:31:14.221 --> 00:31:15.400
it's going to happen.

537
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.120
<v 1>So the question is,
when are we open up the dam,
San Francisco theater,</v>

538
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:28.180
four words to that effect.
Uh,

539
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:33.970
it is a work in progress.
It,
it,
it better be this year,
um,

540
00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:39.220
you know,
out in the 2016,
yeah,

541
00:31:39.221 --> 00:31:44.080
I think,
um,
we,
there's word here,
so knock wood is this word.

542
00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.320
I,
they might have drinks at this plastic.
Um,

543
00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.550
if we pass a lot of the hurdles that were really holding us up.
So,
um,

544
00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:56.860
and honestly I make it sound like it's been arduous.

545
00:31:56.861 --> 00:31:59.590
I mean it's been challenging for sure,
but it's,

546
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.170
we went into it with eyes wide open.

547
00:32:02.171 --> 00:32:07.120
It's a historic renovation project and there's a lot of,
um,
forces at play.
So,
uh,

548
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:10.930
it's not that much more arduous than we thought it was going to be.

549
00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:14.590
And it should be arduous,
right.
To,
um,
uh,

550
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:18.490
to bring in a project like this.
Uh,
but yeah,

551
00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:21.080
it should be open before the end of the year.
Uh,
I don't know.

552
00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.310
I don't have a firm date.
Um,
but there was,
um,

553
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.840
they're also doing construction on a Bartlett street right behind it,
a major,

554
00:32:28.841 --> 00:32:30.160
major road construction.

555
00:32:30.161 --> 00:32:33.490
And so there were utility tie-ins that had to happen to which we did.

556
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.920
There was her beyond our control.
Those are all happens.

557
00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:41.240
There was a storm water runoff issues on the front legs digging above the bar

558
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:46.430
line.
We,
which,
uh,
you know,
it took us about nine months or so to get the permits,

559
00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:49.070
but those have been issued.
So we can do that.

560
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:52.610
And those were the two things that were keeping me up at night and we're past

561
00:32:52.611 --> 00:32:54.980
those.
Um,
and uh,

562
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.620
the progress is much more rapid.

563
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.540
How it actually get depressed if I would go maybe a year ago or nine months ago

564
00:33:02.541 --> 00:33:04.460
and I go onsite and it's just not,

565
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.180
not much happening because nothing much could happen.
Uh,
uh,

566
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.840
but now it's moving fast as lots of people there and it's,
you know,

567
00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:14.210
we're putting up sheet rock of all things and that's usually a sign that

568
00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:18.500
everything in the walls is done usually.
Um,
so I'm very,

569
00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:21.680
I'm very optimistic and I'm not going to give you a date

570
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:34.580
<v 2>as well.
And I'm just curious that the genesis of the publications</v>

571
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:39.980
I got it looks like
to be part of.

572
00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.140
<v 1>So question is how did the,</v>

573
00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:48.310
how did it come about both the website and the magazine?
Birth,
movies,
death.
Um,

574
00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:53.580
so it's run by Devin for Archie who used to be with chuck [inaudible] who was a,

575
00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:57.940
he's a great writer.
I've always liked him and I became friendly with him.
Uh,

576
00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.390
sometimes it's dangerous to become friends with journalists,
but I,
I,

577
00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:04.200
I do it regularly.
I like to talk about film.

578
00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:08.140
I like to debate film and he's one of the best people to have a post movie

579
00:34:08.141 --> 00:34:09.820
conversation with.
Uh,

580
00:34:09.821 --> 00:34:13.780
he was staying at my house for a 24 hour movie marathon.

581
00:34:13.781 --> 00:34:16.810
We do every year called button number thun.
Um,

582
00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:21.010
and so we were actually sitting on the roof,
uh,

583
00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.970
late at night,
probably drinking something,
beer or scotch,
I don't know.

584
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:28.360
And um,
I asked him,
I was like,
well,
how much do you make?

585
00:34:28.361 --> 00:34:31.430
Which is a completely inappropriate question to ask him about it.

586
00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:36.430
It was really curious and he told me it was like,
oh,
I think this is doable.

587
00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:41.310
Um,
uh,
and so they really,
that's it.
That's the genesis is,
um,
I really,

588
00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:43.360
I respect it as writing.

589
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:48.100
And that was at the time when we had made the decision to build out the brand

590
00:34:48.101 --> 00:34:51.520
and to expand beyond our own backyard in Austin.

591
00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:56.970
And it was a plan at that time to put together a movie discussion sites that

592
00:35:00.101 --> 00:35:04.180
would help spread the word about who we are.
Um,
and,
um,

593
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.240
I didn't interview anybody.

594
00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.960
I just asked Devin if he wanted to quit Judd and start this with us.

595
00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:15.700
And he said,
yes,
I am ready right now.
Let's do it.
Um,

596
00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:17.770
and the magazine,
um,

597
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:22.960
it seems somewhat silly to start a magazine in this day and age,

598
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:27.730
uh,
but we were also a brick and mortar restaurant,
or not restaurant,

599
00:35:27.731 --> 00:35:30.070
but a business that has a restaurant.

600
00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.740
And right now with a 19 theaters,

601
00:35:32.741 --> 00:35:35.680
we have about 700,000 people that come through our doors every month.

602
00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.360
And so that's just a,
that's a pretty nice stream of people.

603
00:35:39.361 --> 00:35:43.350
So we can sell ads to pay for the cost of the magazine.
Um,
you know,

604
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:44.710
maybe we'll get that.

605
00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:48.900
There's goals to make it a little fancier for digital consumption.
Um,

606
00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:54.000
but that's,
uh,
yeah,
I like a lot of things.
We,

607
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:55.710
we budgeted it and said,

608
00:35:55.711 --> 00:35:59.490
we can afford this and it makes sense and it helps the awareness of the brand.

609
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:00.324
So let's do it.

610
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:05.940
<v 2>Who doesn't staff,
it's some the best.
Thank</v>

611
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.863
you.

612
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:18.721
<v 0>Mediocre.</v>

613
00:36:18.721 --> 00:36:23.610
But he didn't find his calling until,
you know,

614
00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:26.540
he didn't he go through like a couple of roles and then,

615
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:30.350
<v 1>yeah.
Yeah.
Justin,
um,
uh,
he was,</v>

616
00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:32.190
I knew him from the film collecting world.

617
00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:37.220
Another sort of strange little facet of the business is we have,

618
00:36:38.031 --> 00:36:40.170
we have a nonprofit film archive.

619
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:44.490
So in the digital transition film is just being discarded.

620
00:36:44.491 --> 00:36:48.780
So I am,
I know I should have probably a support group,

621
00:36:48.781 --> 00:36:52.260
but I'm a compulsive collector.
I always have been.
I've always had collections.

622
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.570
And then once I got into this business,

623
00:36:54.571 --> 00:36:56.820
I started collecting the heaviest thing you could find,

624
00:36:56.821 --> 00:36:59.040
which is all 35 millimeter film.

625
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.480
So we have about 4,000 prints.
Um,

626
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:06.030
and we loan them out to universities and theaters all over the country,

627
00:37:06.031 --> 00:37:07.470
all over the world.
Um,

628
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.540
Justin was probably 24 years old and he was living in Kansas City,

629
00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:17.490
which was the central hub of the film distribution.

630
00:37:17.491 --> 00:37:20.400
So it was like you had New York,
Los Angeles and Kansas City,

631
00:37:20.401 --> 00:37:24.770
Kansas City sent film out to the heartland.
And,
um,

632
00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:28.860
so all of the best film collectors are right at Kansas City.
Um,

633
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.840
because the guys that are in charge of cutting the films in half and destroying

634
00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:33.920
them or putting them in the dumpster,

635
00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:38.610
there's this little legion of leeches that would sort of pull a few covertly out

636
00:37:38.611 --> 00:37:42.390
of the,
out of the dumpsters.
Um,
so,
uh,

637
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:45.140
he was a film collector.
We traded,
um,

638
00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:49.800
he came down for events and then eventually,
uh,
asked for a job.
So,
but yeah,

639
00:37:49.801 --> 00:37:54.180
he started out as,
um,
bartender and there was a projectionist.

640
00:37:54.181 --> 00:37:55.180
He worked in,
uh,

641
00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.200
our outdoor screening company and he worked in venue rental sales and wasn't

642
00:38:00.691 --> 00:38:03.300
really awesome at any of them,

643
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:07.870
but he really loved,
um,
uh,

644
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.060
uh,
the,

645
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:13.530
what was starting to happen at Mondo with posters and artwork and collectibles

646
00:38:13.531 --> 00:38:17.130
and toys.
And once he found that spot,
he really flourished there.

647
00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.513
Kudos for kind of

648
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:23.490
<v 0>building this space for people who are passionate about film and going to see</v>

649
00:38:23.491 --> 00:38:27.660
films and you know,
for them to go.
And check out awesome movies.
Uh,
well,

650
00:38:27.661 --> 00:38:29.940
thank you so much for joining us today.
It's my pleasure

651
