1
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.530
Please join me in welcoming Justin Baldoni.

2
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.083
<v 1>Okay,</v>

3
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.130
<v 2>thank you Courtney.
Oh,</v>

4
00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:22.620
it's so awkward when you read all that stuff about you don't want any,
are there?

5
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.120
Hi.

6
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.320
<v 0>Hi everyone.</v>

7
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.340
Can we just take a moment together to just breathe and just have,

8
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.790
I don't know how I'm going to moderate this panel and I'm a wreck.

9
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.710
I was sitting out there,
that's why we just watched it.

10
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.260
Oh,
and I just want to have just,
just,
yeah,
we just,

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.480
I just wanna have a quick moment of silence just for those who are dealing with

12
00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:48.410
cystic fibrosis and other illnesses,
those who have lost their lives,

13
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.440
those who are fighting the fight right now.
I'm a mess.

14
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.850
I'm just take a moment with me and let's just breathe in the space.

15
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.083
<v 2>Okay.</v>

16
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.410
Okay.
That was beautiful.
That was beautiful.

17
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.540
Thank you for that.
We're honoring everyone just like that.
It's so funny.

18
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:14.510
I came in,
I,
you know,
cause I've been doing press all day for the movie,

19
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.780
so I came in with a totally different energy and this whole room.

20
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.430
<v 0>I see.
So sorry.
I was like racing to get here and I was like,</v>

21
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.360
oh wait,
you just watched the movie?
So I just wanted to,
yeah,

22
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:28.310
just have that feeling.

23
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.920
<v 2>That was deep.
Did you like it?
Oh,
thank God.</v>

24
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.530
<v 0>It was,
it was really good.
And congratulations on the movie.
Um,</v>

25
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.860
hi everyone again.
My name is Daria like Daria Sunshine.

26
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.660
I'm trying to bring the sunshine back.
Um,
it was beautiful and you,

27
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:52.680
and I don't know if you,
how much you saw,
but it was amazing.

28
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:55.740
We were oohing and aahing and crying and laughing and they were just so many

29
00:01:55.741 --> 00:02:00.060
emotions and it was really incredible.
Um,
so you know,

30
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:03.510
we all know you probably as Rafael from Jane the Virgin,

31
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.240
and so I just want to congratulate you on directing your first major feature

32
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:12.810
film.
And I just want you to kind of tell us here,
Justin,

33
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.450
kind of what that was like and,

34
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:17.670
and what is it about this film and this story in particular that made you want

35
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:19.920
to make that jump and come behind the scenes?

36
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.910
<v 2>Oh,
uh,
that's a multiple part question.</v>

37
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.570
I'll get into the,
the reasons we made the movie.
So,

38
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.210
uh,
believe it or not,

39
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.800
we have in one way or another,
Google the thank for all of it.

40
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.830
So I,

41
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.730
I gave up acting and this career that I thought I wanted when I was in,
you know,

42
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.140
about seven or eight years ago to start a documentary series that was paid for

43
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:54.410
by Youtube,
uh,

44
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.320
via soul pancake called my last days.
And,
uh,

45
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.250
and I basically traveled the country and I told the stories of incredible

46
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.190
individuals who were living with a terminal illness.

47
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.640
And my prayer was that by doing this show and by spending time with these

48
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.690
amazing people who were choosing love and hope and happiness in the face of

49
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:17.800
tremendous adversity,

50
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:22.801
that maybe we could all learn how to live and learn how to live from people who

51
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.350
were literally dying,
even though technically,

52
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:30.100
of course we all know there's a clock.
This was,
this was,

53
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.720
it's in your face.

54
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.400
And of course it ended up becoming one of the most watched documentary series

55
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:41.050
ever on Youtube.
And then we ended up selling that to CW and,

56
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.540
and season two of my last days,

57
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:47.860
I met a young woman named Claire Wineland who was a youtuber and Claire
Wineland,

58
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.530
um,
had cystic fibrosis.

59
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.980
And I told her story in the second season of my last days.

60
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.760
And her and I became very dear friends and she kind of became like a little

61
00:03:57.761 --> 00:03:59.920
sister to me.
And,
uh,

62
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.190
and it was in a conversation with her when she told me that two people with CF

63
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.880
can't touch me because I had actually,
I had asked her afterwards,
I was like,

64
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:12.070
all right,
let's now that,
that what the cameras are not rolling.

65
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:15.880
Tell me about boys.
Like,
tell me some boy stories in the hospital,

66
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:18.580
like if you ever dated a CFR.
And she was like,
what?
No.

67
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.120
And that's how I learned that this was a real thing.

68
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.040
And I just knew that it was a film.
Um,
and I had also,
interestingly enough,

69
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.570
back to the youtube thing,

70
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:31.690
I had set up another movie based on another documentary that I had made on this

71
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:34.830
young boy named Zach Sylvia,
who had also,
um,

72
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.980
had terminal cancer and wrote a song called clouds,
right.

73
00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:40.360
Which ended up going very viral.

74
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:43.180
And there was a time when I didn't know which movie was going to happen first,

75
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.010
but we develop this,
um,
with Claire and,
uh,

76
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.100
and injected a lot of her soul into the spirit because as you know,

77
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.200
I don't know if you knew who she was,

78
00:04:56.201 --> 00:05:00.670
but she used her platform on youtube that Google gave her,
uh,

79
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.080
to have conversations that were uncomfortable about life and about death and

80
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:09.790
about happiness and not being defined by the,
the,
the,

81
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.140
the,

82
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.410
what the world puts on you and not being defined by her illness and having her

83
00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:15.490
illness be a part of her story,

84
00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:18.100
but not all of our story and making her life a beautiful piece of art,

85
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:19.900
which is something that I think we can all relate to,

86
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.090
which I really tried to infuse into the film.

87
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.360
And as to why I chose to go behind the camera,
I was always,

88
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:29.110
I felt meant to be behind the camera.
But as you know,
when you come to Hollywood,

89
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:33.570
they put you in the box that they want to put you in.
Um,
so,
uh,

90
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:34.690
I was putting the,

91
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.880
the acting box first and then did everything I can to use that platform to then

92
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:42.750
transition to tell the stories that I feel like I was put on earth to tell.

93
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.170
<v 0>Thank you and bless you for that.
Uh,
I follow you on Instagram.</v>

94
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:50.380
You're just a light a light.
And because of that,

95
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:54.400
I also followed Claire and I remember watching her stories and her videos and

96
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.480
sitting here watching this,
uh,
character reminded me a lot of Claire how she,

97
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.520
you know,
documented her time.
And so it's funny to hear you kind of say how,

98
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.490
you know,
helped us develop the movie,
which is beautiful.

99
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:10.340
And Claire is no longer with us.
Claire,

100
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.340
I'm going to try to not get too emotional,

101
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.260
but we lost Clara just before I finished my director's cut of the movie.
Yeah,

102
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.850
thank you.
So this was beautiful.

103
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:24.851
And I think that one of the most special and beautiful parts about this movie is

104
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:28.940
that we have an element of computer science and that's how we were able to

105
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:33.560
partner together.
And still,
his character is actually the one who codes the APP.

106
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.270
Yes,
that Rachel a Co created that we'll get to in a moment.

107
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.440
Um,
but yeah,

108
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:43.370
wanting to ask you like how did that come about it and bringing Google the CS

109
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.960
media.
Tell us more.

110
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.630
<v 2>Um,
so partly through you and Courtney.
Um,</v>

111
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.650
so,
uh,
we had through my company,

112
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:59.651
Wayfair created a show that we had been working on for quite a while called

113
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:04.090
project upgrade,
which was basically giving,
uh,

114
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.210
trying to make stem sexy essentially and cool for your young woman.

115
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:10.730
And so my good friends,
the Merrill twins,

116
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:14.990
we brought them on and we created the show with deray and Courtney.
And,
uh,

117
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.340
and,

118
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.900
and through that conversation I was having a chat with Courtney and I sent her

119
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:25.640
the script and,
um,
just for some thoughts of ways that we could all collaborate.

120
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.920
And she wrote me back and said,
hey,
I'm,
there is,
because originally when we,

121
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.010
when we had first written the script,
we hadn't made her,
um,

122
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.390
that she was of course obsessive compulsive,
but she,
she did everything on paper.

123
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.800
And so it was,
it was like in spreadsheets and it was on paper.
And,

124
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.430
and Courtney had the idea of like asking if I would be open to doing it as an

125
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:49.850
APP.
And I said that's hell yeah.
I said that's even better.

126
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:53.330
And it was fun because then we got to like adjust the character a little bit.

127
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.370
And that just goes to show you how important these initiatives are.

128
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.020
Right.
And your,

129
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.430
and what you guys were literally hired to do is to consult and to work with

130
00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:07.400
people like me and say,
hey would you be open to this?

131
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:11.210
This is an initiative we want to get more young women and girls into stem.

132
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.190
Let's create a character that does it and not make it a big thing.

133
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.820
Make it like she just happens to do it right.
Cause that's how you change things.

134
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:22.580
You need to be able to see yourself on the damn screen if you can't see yourself

135
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:25.820
on the damn screen and then you don't know that it's really possible unless you

136
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:30.080
know you,
it's just in bedded in you that that's an option.
I can do that.

137
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.420
And I just said that's,
yeah.
So we just,

138
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.530
we changed it immediately and worked on it and got some even fun moments like

139
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:40.160
when she's coding and will says like,
wait,
you built an APP?

140
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.380
And then a little bit of that like,
Oh yeah,
I built it up kind of moment.
Um,

141
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.700
and then the next fun part was I was like,
let's really build an APP.

142
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.680
Let's not just say it,
but let's do it.

143
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.940
Because it's so important for me that we're marrying what we say,
right?

144
00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:57.721
It's one thing to say,

145
00:08:57.721 --> 00:09:00.120
we all know these companies and all these people that are like,
oh,

146
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:01.260
we'll do this and we'll do this.

147
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:04.620
And you see these advertising campaigns and you name it,
right?

148
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.880
But it's like who's doing it?

149
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.060
And I think that's how change really starts in our businesses.
We have to do it.

150
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.290
So we said,

151
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.640
let's really build an APP and make something that people can actually use that

152
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:18.330
have chronic illnesses.
And so we were connected with these amazing young women,

153
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.780
um,
who dove in and designed it and built it.

154
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.750
And now there's going to be an APP,
right?

155
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:28.740
Hey and it's just an that's so cool and hopefully it will be useful.

156
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.230
That's all right.
Rachel,
why don't you tell us a little bit more about that.

157
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:35.250
And I know you were able to build and design an APP that made it into a feature

158
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:38.490
film,
which is incredible.
You did that with your partner Lavanya saying,

159
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.920
just tell us a little bit about what that experience was like.

160
00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:43.130
<v 3>It was amazing.
Um,</v>

161
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.200
so Google reached out to Lavanya and I,
um,

162
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.550
in October and asked us,
how would you feel about building an APP for a movie?

163
00:09:51.551 --> 00:09:54.820
And we were like,
that would be amazing.
Um,

164
00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:00.570
so basically we got to talk to Justin and we got to talk to Courtney and what we

165
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.690
determined was the design for the APP through that.
And then we built the,

166
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.090
what you see in the movie first,

167
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.710
and we're continuing to build the APP right now and it should be released by the

168
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.040
end of March,
which is really exciting.
Okay.

169
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.100
<v 2>It's amazing.
And this is the Vanya Lavanya is here in spirit.</v>

170
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:20.720
She is caught up in midterms right now at Harvard.
No big deal.
So,
uh,

171
00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:23.150
so the high Lavanya if you're watching on the livestream,

172
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:27.070
hi everyone on livestream,
but let's just show a quick clip,
uh,
about,
uh,

173
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.930
the APP that shook though show was showcased in the movie.

174
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.630
<v 4>What's
their real code?</v>

175
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.153
That's my favorite.

176
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

177
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.300
<v 2>Awesome.
Yeah.
And I think we have some stills of the APP to correct.</v>

178
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.390
Can I just say that?
I love that she gets frustrated by a bug.

179
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.370
Thank you for making it real.
Really.
Very cool.
So,
so tell us like,

180
00:11:15.371 --> 00:11:18.020
what inspired you to want to get involved in,

181
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.140
in the film and in creating this APP with your friend?

182
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.223
<v 3>Um,</v>

183
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:26.590
so I was first exposed to computer science in sixth grade and middle school and

184
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.790
I,
uh,
was interested,

185
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:32.360
but I wasn't super interested because I didn't really feel like it was pertinent

186
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.350
to my life that much.

187
00:11:33.351 --> 00:11:36.350
I was just coding something where like bunnies running around on a hill.

188
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.500
It was very silly.
And then when I was in eighth grade,

189
00:11:39.501 --> 00:11:42.710
I discovered a website called Code Academy where you can teach yourself how to

190
00:11:42.711 --> 00:11:46.760
code through tutorials.
So I decided to do the build a website tutorial.

191
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.290
And,
um,

192
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.460
basically it was blown away by the possibility of being able to create something

193
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.550
that could impact a lot of people instantly.
Um,

194
00:11:54.551 --> 00:11:58.600
so I continued teaching myself how to code throughout high school and in terms

195
00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:00.010
of this app,
um,

196
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.170
I think that I actually got to talk to somebody with cystic fibrosis through

197
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:08.560
this process and hear about their experience and all the medications that they

198
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.440
have to take.
And,
um,
setting reminders is one thing,

199
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:14.560
but I also think it's useful to have something that actually reflects your own

200
00:12:14.561 --> 00:12:15.430
experience,

201
00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:19.210
whether that's a film or whether that's an app where it's actually catered to

202
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:22.950
things that you need and they're like really specific details that,
um,

203
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.720
coordinate with your life really well.
Yeah.
Amazing.

204
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.300
<v 0>Yeah.
And I'm just curious here in the audience,</v>

205
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:32.230
how many of you are interested in technology or computer science?

206
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.460
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

207
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.140
<v 0>Oh Wow.
Quite a few people.</v>

208
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.490
How many of you are into tech and computer science are either you're kind of

209
00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:39.911
interested in it,

210
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:42.910
but you feel like you don't belong or you haven't quite made that leap yet?

211
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.940
There's some hesitancy.
Okay.
Well,

212
00:12:47.941 --> 00:12:51.220
hopefully you feel inspired to do it right.
No matter your circumstance,

213
00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:54.960
you can do it right.
Like Courtney was alluding earlier.
I mean,
if you can see it,

214
00:12:54.961 --> 00:12:57.030
you can be it.
And like when I was growing up,

215
00:12:57.031 --> 00:12:59.520
I was really good at math and science.
I was really a tech savvy,

216
00:12:59.521 --> 00:13:02.550
but I was never exposed to anyone who looked like me doing it.

217
00:13:02.551 --> 00:13:03.600
And I shied away from it.

218
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:07.050
And now I'm very fortunate to be able to advocate for it,
right.

219
00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:08.880
For people who want to do it.
And so,
you know,

220
00:13:08.881 --> 00:13:11.970
I think we're all appear today to just encourage you all to continue that.

221
00:13:11.971 --> 00:13:16.650
So thank you,
Rachel for being a pioneer in the space and for creating the APP.

222
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:21.330
That was amazing.
I mean,
I was floored just seeing that in a major film.

223
00:13:21.331 --> 00:13:25.110
So congrats to you and,
uh,
Justin,

224
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:30.060
thank you for highlighting it.
And,
I mean,
you used your platform all the time to,

225
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.490
to,
you know,
showcase these social issues.

226
00:13:32.491 --> 00:13:36.330
And we've seen it with man enough and my last days and project upgrade,

227
00:13:36.331 --> 00:13:37.650
which you talked about,
uh,

228
00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:41.580
with your partner far who'd May Bowtie and you worked with Courtney on that and,

229
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.960
and that's a youtube series.
Um,
that's,
you know,
uh,

230
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:49.050
up on the platform for free that everyone can watch and it stars the Merrill

231
00:13:49.051 --> 00:13:52.800
twins and they're working with a diverse team of female engineers to build a

232
00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:56.310
digital interactive mirror.
Um,

233
00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:01.320
and so you're just phenomenal.
And I want to know ultimately what motivates you,

234
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.550
uh,
to then encourage women to pursue stem and like what,

235
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.070
what motivates you to get behind that cost so deeply?

236
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.280
<v 2>I mean,
it all,</v>

237
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.930
it all stems back from me to faith.
Um,

238
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.530
I think,
uh,
you know,

239
00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:26.790
I was raised in the Bahai faith and I mean,
it all comes to me.

240
00:14:26.791 --> 00:14:31.270
To me it just all comes back down to the female education and the impact.
I mean,

241
00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.440
it literally in my faith it says if you have two children,
a boy and a girl,

242
00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:38.670
but you can only afford to educate when you educate the girl.
And uh,

243
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.620
and because that's how you change the world.
So I mean,

244
00:14:43.621 --> 00:14:45.900
it's not like I grew up thinking stem.

245
00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:47.460
I got to get young women and girls in the stem.

246
00:14:47.461 --> 00:14:52.461
It's when issues are presented to me and my privilege allows me to then amplify

247
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.180
a cause or an issue that I feel is important.

248
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:03.320
And it's tricky because there's so many things that need amplification.
Um,
and I,

249
00:15:03.321 --> 00:15:07.910
you can't take everything on,
but you know,
piece by piece and,
uh,

250
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.180
this was,
I have a guy have a young daughter and you know,

251
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:16.330
I would be so happy and thrilled to see her end up like you and uh,

252
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.350
yeah.
So I don't know,
I guess it,
it all stems down to faith and why are you here?

253
00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:24.080
What are you doing with your time?
And Yeah.

254
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.750
<v 0>Amazing.
Thank you.
Speaking of women in stem,</v>

255
00:15:27.751 --> 00:15:31.760
we have the phenomenal Kim Swindon over here on the end.
Um,

256
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.850
and you actually were featured in project upgrade and you worked really closely

257
00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:40.600
with,
you know,
other amazing women working in tech fields all around.
Um,

258
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:44.420
so just talk to us a little bit more about that experience and kind of explained

259
00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.740
a little bit about your role here at Google.
Slash.
Youtube.

260
00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.210
<v 5>Yeah.
So,
um,
yeah,</v>

261
00:15:49.211 --> 00:15:52.360
I was really grateful to be able to contribute to a project upgrade.

262
00:15:52.361 --> 00:15:54.340
It was an awesome project.
Um,

263
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:59.670
a couple of us were sort of industry mentors for the Merrill twins and the group

264
00:15:59.681 --> 00:16:03.340
of college students that they were working with to build this app,
um,

265
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:08.470
and the filmmakers and,
you know,
fair.
Um,

266
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.550
and uh,
yeah,
so I work on Youtube.
Um,
as Courtney mentioned,

267
00:16:12.551 --> 00:16:15.670
whenever you hit that big red subscribe button,
which was featured in the movie,

268
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.020
um,
some of my code runs somewhere in a data center.
Um,

269
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.960
and uh,
yeah,
I came to computer science kind of security actually.

270
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:28.440
I started out in entertainment.
I was an actor in Hollywood.
Um,
I,

271
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:32.230
I was not placed there.
I was trying very hard to get there.
Um,

272
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.990
but I actually realized that I,
I'm,

273
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.280
I've always been really drawn to math and science and,
uh,

274
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:44.370
this notion that you get to build something and to have people use something you

275
00:16:44.681 --> 00:16:48.700
built and sort of make an impact in their life with that over and over and over

276
00:16:48.701 --> 00:16:53.701
again is just a totally different kind of satisfaction to helping people feel

277
00:16:54.161 --> 00:16:58.060
something or discover something.
So I still love to do both.
Um,

278
00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.540
but that was sort of my trajectory to get to computer science.

279
00:17:01.541 --> 00:17:06.541
And I think it's been really a blessing to be at Google where we have so many

280
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.600
effort to try to encourage girls and young women and underrepresented boys to be

281
00:17:12.821 --> 00:17:14.170
interested in computer science.

282
00:17:14.171 --> 00:17:18.280
Because I empathize with the difference,

283
00:17:18.281 --> 00:17:22.090
the gap between how it's portrayed in the media and how it is in real life

284
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.300
because I was sort of exposed to both sides.
So

285
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.361
<v 0>I love that.</v>

286
00:17:26.361 --> 00:17:28.910
And I want you to speak more about that because when I first met you,

287
00:17:28.911 --> 00:17:32.570
I was so inspired by you because we share an acting background and I was like,

288
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.740
wow,
I'm so glad that she does both,
right?
That they're not mutually exclusive,

289
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.890
exclusive.
And that's something that really try to preach it.
Google is right.

290
00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:43.570
You can do both.
And just can you talk a little bit more about that and,
and,

291
00:17:43.571 --> 00:17:48.080
and what,
what made you say no,
I'm going to do both.
I don't have to split it.

292
00:17:48.081 --> 00:17:50.190
I think a lot of people are right.
They have,

293
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:51.350
<v 5>you know,
the left side of the rent.</v>

294
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.320
They also have the right side and they're creative and they want and they want

295
00:17:54.321 --> 00:17:58.260
to find those intersections.
How do you go about that?
And so to be clear,

296
00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:01.920
I get all the time,
uh,
oh,
you're both right brain and left brain.
How weird.

297
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.790
Why are those split?
I don't know why that's um,
I've also gotten,
oh,

298
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:10.490
you're too pretty to be a software engineer,
which is a weird combo salt.
Um,

299
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.970
that's awesome.
Yes.

300
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.650
Backhanded compliment,
complex all them.
Um,

301
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.720
so,
so yes,
it is.
It is absolutely possible to do both.

302
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:29.770
And to be really clear,
I was terrified.
Um,

303
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:34.160
seriously.
And I think it's important to like make that be known,
right?
This,

304
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:39.030
it's not,
it's not an easy field,
but it's also not,

305
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.700
it's hilarious to say this,
but it's also not rocket science.

306
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.780
When my joke with my friends that like space x,
they crack up with that.
Um,

307
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.510
so like I say that because I think a lot of,

308
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.270
a lot of,
not just girls,

309
00:18:54.271 --> 00:18:59.010
but young people sort of try out tech and computer science and science and they

310
00:18:59.011 --> 00:19:03.570
find it hard.
And the first thing you think is,
I must just not be good at this.

311
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.470
Right.
And unless you have those people,
and in my case,

312
00:19:07.471 --> 00:19:09.510
it was my ex boyfriend who was a software engineer,

313
00:19:09.511 --> 00:19:12.720
when I started thinking about what else could I do in my life besides acting,

314
00:19:12.721 --> 00:19:16.470
could I actually do this for real?
I'm way too old to get into computer science.

315
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.950
I was in my thirties when I decided to go back to school.
Um,

316
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:25.110
it takes that one person being like,
no,
no,
you got this.
This is not,

317
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.410
this is not as hard as you think.
Like,
just push through,
try to understand it,

318
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:34.500
get the help you need,
get the support.
Um,
it's totally doable.

319
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.660
But I think we get so many of those messages that,

320
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.760
that this is intimidating and it's computers or hard and confusing.
And,

321
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:46.560
and we kind of take that in and assume that that's the limiting factor.
Yeah.

322
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.270
So thank you.
And what about you Rachel?
What are some of this,
you know,

323
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:55.140
miscommunications misconcepts that you've heard about stem and you know,

324
00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:58.490
did you ever fair or did you have a fear to,
to pursue it?

325
00:19:58.491 --> 00:20:00.420
And what are some things that you had to push against?

326
00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:06.270
<v 3>I was never really afraid to code,
are afraid to do math and science.
Um,</v>

327
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.410
I feel like I was raised in an environment where that was like,

328
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.440
there was no question as to whether that was something I could do.
It was,

329
00:20:12.441 --> 00:20:14.270
I could do it if I wanted.
However,

330
00:20:14.271 --> 00:20:18.380
I did naturally gravitate towards reading and storytelling,
um,
when I was little.

331
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:23.060
So for me,
um,
coding is not something that I'm naturally good at.

332
00:20:23.061 --> 00:20:24.170
I work really hard at it,

333
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.010
but I also think that nobody's really naturally good at it and everybody has to

334
00:20:28.011 --> 00:20:32.720
work really hard at it.
So I think knowing that like you do have to,
um,

335
00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.410
keep going,
even if it's difficult and you might be confused for a while,

336
00:20:36.411 --> 00:20:38.840
but then you'll figure it out I think is really important.

337
00:20:38.841 --> 00:20:40.760
It's important in life tail.
Um,

338
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:44.450
I also think there's a huge misconception that you have to be good at math to be

339
00:20:44.451 --> 00:20:48.450
good at coding.
Um,
I like math,
I don't love it.
Um,

340
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.470
but I don't really use that much math and coding.

341
00:20:50.471 --> 00:20:55.120
I think coding is really logical and it's based off of principles like loops and

342
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:59.190
recursion and um,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

343
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.590
<v 0>Thank you.
Thank you.
I mean it's so true.</v>

344
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.110
We all get these misconceptions about tech and computer science,
right?
Like,

345
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:05.561
you know,

346
00:21:05.561 --> 00:21:09.130
Courtney and I have worked on shows like the fosters in Silicon Valley and miles

347
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:11.500
from tomorrow land in East Los High.
And you know,

348
00:21:11.501 --> 00:21:15.020
Kim has been an amazing engineer who actually,
you know,
uh,

349
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.870
helps us write the codes for a lot of those shows.
Right?

350
00:21:17.871 --> 00:21:20.560
And now we have Rachel and Justin and we are getting all these partners to

351
00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:24.820
really change the culture and perception around tech so that once people do come

352
00:21:24.821 --> 00:21:28.540
to places like Google,
we can retain them once they get here.
Right?

353
00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.850
Is Not a pipeline issue.
The pipeline is there,

354
00:21:30.851 --> 00:21:35.590
but what are the messages that we are,
uh,
you know,
sharing with,
with the world.

355
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:38.830
And that's why I think media is just so important,
right?

356
00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:42.350
Because right now if we were to look at TV,
uh,

357
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.030
and I think we're making some progress,
but you know,
we think it's only for,

358
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.391
you know,

359
00:21:46.391 --> 00:21:51.391
cis straight white men or Asian men with glasses and acne and no personality and

360
00:21:52.181 --> 00:21:52.870
no friends.

361
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.930
And they sit in closets and eat doughnuts all day and type on their computer.

362
00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:59.800
And it's like,
no,
the computer sciences aren't generic,
can be anyone,
right?

363
00:21:59.801 --> 00:22:02.950
It can be everyone and we need to think more inclusively.

364
00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:05.290
And so I just commend you both,
uh,

365
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:09.610
have for kind of going the distance and pushing its obstacles and for you,

366
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.430
you know,
just to be such an incredible ally in the space.

367
00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:15.930
It means so much and I think that you are encouraging,
you know,

368
00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.200
the next generation,
you know,

369
00:22:17.201 --> 00:22:20.170
to to think differently and to be man enough and you know,

370
00:22:20.171 --> 00:22:22.240
to stand up for what's right.
So I just,

371
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:26.560
you don't want to thank all of you for that.
And I'm just wondering what advice,

372
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:30.400
what advice would you give,
um,
you know,
looking back on your,

373
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:34.550
on your journeys and your experiences,
what advice would you give to those,
uh,

374
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.450
here?
Maybe some young women,
uh,

375
00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:41.080
or just anyone who's underrepresented in the space,
those on live stream,

376
00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.750
you know,
what,
what would you tell them Rachel,
start with you.

377
00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:45.323
<v 3>Um,</v>

378
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:50.260
I would tell them that you don't need to feel like it's something that is not

379
00:22:50.261 --> 00:22:51.940
for you because it is for you,

380
00:22:51.941 --> 00:22:56.620
but it's how you apply it to your life in terms of it being,
um,
related to you.

381
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.630
Um,
for example,

382
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:03.690
like I developed this app related specifically to cystic fibrosis and other

383
00:23:04.961 --> 00:23:08.380
illnesses,
but like the fun part of it was not the coding,

384
00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:11.980
the fun part of it was the impact in the fun and what was going to be created at

385
00:23:11.981 --> 00:23:15.760
the end.
Um,
for me coding is about the process.

386
00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:18.100
It's not about the processes if it's about what's being created,

387
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:20.560
but the process is needed in order to create something.

388
00:23:20.561 --> 00:23:23.800
It's Kinda like if you're directing a film,

389
00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:28.390
you will have to know about cinematography,
but the camera is not the thing.

390
00:23:28.391 --> 00:23:32.680
The film is the thing that you're watching and coding is similar in that way.
Um,

391
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.340
I would also say that there are other girls who do it.

392
00:23:36.341 --> 00:23:37.750
They might not be around you.

393
00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:42.490
There are a lot of programs that connect girls who are interested in coding like

394
00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.130
NC wit,
um,
girl up.
Uh,
there's a camp called

395
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.340
<v 5>why side,
which has applications out right now Kode with Klossy.
Um,</v>

396
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.010
they are just a lot of opportunities for girls to get involved in stem.
Amazing.

397
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.720
Thank you.
What about you Kim?
What would you add?
I actually taught at why.
So I,

398
00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:04.090
last year I went to [inaudible],
which one?
In Malawi.
Oh,
okay.

399
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.210
I taught at the one in Namibia.

400
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:10.240
So for those who don't know why I say is a partnership between the United States

401
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.850
at the US State Department and an organization called girl up,

402
00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:18.830
which is a campaign of the United Nations Foundation and it brings a girls from

403
00:24:18.831 --> 00:24:20.600
different countries together to learn stem,

404
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:24.920
not in the u s so when I attended it was in Malawi and there were 20 girls from

405
00:24:24.921 --> 00:24:29.330
the u s and 80 girls from six different African countries.
It was amazing.

406
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:34.610
Um,
yeah.
Yeah,
no,
it was teaching.
There was phenomenal.
I mean the range was,

407
00:24:34.611 --> 00:24:38.330
some girls had already learned some code and some girls had never touched a

408
00:24:38.331 --> 00:24:41.120
mouse and they were all helping each other to learn.

409
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:45.290
It was like one of the most inspiring,
awesome experiences.
And by the end of it,

410
00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:49.760
they all had an APP that they'd built.
Wow.
So like again,
not rocket science,

411
00:24:49.761 --> 00:24:50.930
right?
Like you get,

412
00:24:50.931 --> 00:24:53.960
you get a group of people together and inspire them and like it's,
it's,

413
00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.730
it's just trying it out,
see what works.
Yeah.
Um,

414
00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:01.130
the only thing I would add would be,
um,
don't be afraid to break things.

415
00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:06.050
I know that sounds kind of interesting.
Um,
be a little afraid if it's youtube.

416
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.790
Um,
but,
but even that,
like,
I,
I mean,
honestly that's,

417
00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.013
it's something I,

418
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.500
I kind of had to learn the hard way and I was never really taught to tinker as a

419
00:25:15.501 --> 00:25:19.850
kid and in my,
as my education was very much about like,

420
00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:21.470
memorize the right answer and spit it out.

421
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.250
So I kind of never got that experience of like see what works and try it.

422
00:25:25.251 --> 00:25:27.440
And if it breaks,
oops,
well at least I learned something.

423
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.270
It is such an invaluable thing to be willing to do in engineering because you

424
00:25:32.271 --> 00:25:36.350
learn so much about something by breaking it.
Um,
so,

425
00:25:36.351 --> 00:25:38.390
so it's just part of the process.
If you break it,

426
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.150
it's not that big a deal unless it's youtube.

427
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:48.580
Yeah.
But what about you,
Justin?
Like good.
Anything that you would share?
Um,

428
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.310
just in terms of those who might want to pursue stem or coding or anything.

429
00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:52.611
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

430
00:25:52.611 --> 00:25:57.611
when I graduated from Harvard with a degree in rocket science,

431
00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:01.650
by the way,
I love that.
My,

432
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.420
one of my favorite parts of your stories when you're like,

433
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:05.670
when I joke with my friends at space x,

434
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.910
because I just kind of was like imagining you talking about things with your

435
00:26:11.911 --> 00:26:13.830
friends at space x and me on the outside.

436
00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.290
Just having no clue what you're talking about.

437
00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.300
Trying to follow the conversation often.

438
00:26:18.301 --> 00:26:19.950
Probably not talking about anything that,
that,

439
00:26:19.951 --> 00:26:24.930
that's that high level to be honest.
Well,
in my mind you are,
I'll take it.

440
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.170
Um,
uh,
I was so in,

441
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:31.650
I was so entrenched in their questions.
What,
what was my question again?

442
00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:36.090
Like I was like with them and I was thinking about how do I translate that into

443
00:26:36.091 --> 00:26:39.270
talking to my daughter about,
yeah.
What would you tell Maya?
I would,

444
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:42.120
I would connect her with them and the one I knew.

445
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.270
<v 0>I do have a question for you though.
What do you want people to take away from,</v>

446
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.410
from your film?
I mean,
watching that,
I was just like,
wow,
I need to live more.

447
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.110
I need to get out of my phone,
I need to be in the moment.

448
00:26:55.111 --> 00:26:58.690
I need to go home and cuddle with my boob,
Aaron and,
and,

449
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:03.510
and just live and dive more into art.
I love just how much,
you know,

450
00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:08.370
how much art was in that and just how much living they did.
And it,
even though,

451
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:08.910
you know,

452
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:13.140
they have a terminal disease and it was beautiful and I just want to know what,

453
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.370
what do you want us to take away from that?

454
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:17.400
<v 2>Yeah,
that,</v>

455
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.190
<v 0>sorry,
say more.</v>

456
00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:26.220
<v 2>Look,
I think when you make anything,
you build anything,</v>

457
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:31.550
you hope that it has impact and you always want to design or build or create

458
00:27:32.611 --> 00:27:36.570
something with an intention.
Right?
And um,

459
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:42.530
for me the intention was as simple as if people leave this film and feel an urge

460
00:27:42.991 --> 00:27:45.660
to call someone they love and just tell them they love them,

461
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.310
then I will have succeeded.

462
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:52.910
Or if maybe they can reexamine their relationship and realize that,

463
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.630
wow,
it's not all about physical touch.
There's more to it.
You know,

464
00:27:57.631 --> 00:28:00.270
we live in this shiny,

465
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:05.330
glossy on demand society where we constantly like project out to the world the

466
00:28:08.371 --> 00:28:12.600
way that we want to be seen instead of really who we are.

467
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.540
We swipe for love.
We,
we,

468
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.790
if it's not working immediately,

469
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:22.820
there's so many different options and we can just choose.

470
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.920
And I think that I just wanted to create a grounded love story that just kind of

471
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:34.820
reminded us that there's so much more an appreciation for life because I think,

472
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:40.020
you know,
if you don't have a chronic illness,
okay,
everybody suffers.

473
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.500
Everybody has things that are uncomfortable,
you know,

474
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.870
knee injuries for me and muscles things.

475
00:28:45.871 --> 00:28:50.430
And there's always something that's life,
right?
But I think that in general,

476
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.950
what so many of us take for granted,

477
00:28:52.951 --> 00:28:57.810
others are fighting for and it isn't like,
Oh,
poor them at all.

478
00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.760
Because from my experience,

479
00:28:59.761 --> 00:29:04.440
they're the ones that teach the rest of us how to live and be joyful.

480
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:09.630
And,
uh,
and so,
yeah,
I think it's just perspective.

481
00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:13.710
Yes.
If there's a word,
it would be perspective.
And,

482
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:18.250
and I hope that it does that.
Please tell all your friends,
uh,

483
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.720
cause movies like this need support,

484
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:25.650
especially on opening weekend or the studios won't trust the people like me to

485
00:29:25.651 --> 00:29:28.740
make them anymore.
Um,
so yeah.

486
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.420
<v 0>What do you think?
Did Justin succeed Y'all?
Yeah,</v>

487
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.040
<v 6>so good.
So good.</v>

488
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:39.890
<v 0>Well,
we have a few minutes.</v>

489
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:44.830
I do want to open up the audience right now for questions.
Uh,
take a minute.

490
00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:49.540
Uh,
Courtney here has a mic that she's going to throw at you.

491
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.930
It won't hurt the braveness.
Who's going to ask the question?

492
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:57.230
If anyone has a question for our panel?
Wait,
that's a literal Mike.
You can throw.

493
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.680
Yeah,

494
00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.520
<v 2>we have one right over here was saying you can drop the mic.</v>

495
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:06.460
<v 7>That's called the dad joke.
Everybody.
Okay,</v>

496
00:30:06.461 --> 00:30:10.150
I'm going to stand up.
Okay.
Hi,
I'm Kavita.
Um,

497
00:30:10.151 --> 00:30:14.380
and I guess I have a question for all of the panel,
but I guess,
um,

498
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.630
Justin's specifically,
um,

499
00:30:16.631 --> 00:30:20.560
when you were making this film and he really had to think about the difficult

500
00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:22.370
discussions within it,
um,

501
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:26.950
what struggles and what hurdles did you have to go through in order to make sure

502
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:30.880
that this movie wasn't patronizing?
It wasn't about Oh poor them.

503
00:30:30.881 --> 00:30:35.050
It was empowering and its message was both effectual and impactful.

504
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.830
<v 2>Yes.
Is it really?
It's a,</v>

505
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.700
it's a really fine line and a tricky balance in one that I thought I was failing

506
00:30:41.701 --> 00:30:45.660
out the entire movie.
Um,
you know,
again,

507
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.350
because it was because my friend inspired me to make it

508
00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:53.250
her soul.

509
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.820
Claire's soul I feel is a huge part of this film and her whole purpose when she

510
00:31:00.421 --> 00:31:05.421
was alive was to redefine what illness looked like.

511
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:07.620
So for me,

512
00:31:07.621 --> 00:31:11.670
this was not a movie about sick kids and that's kind of unfortunately the way

513
00:31:11.671 --> 00:31:14.760
the world projects their view of it.

514
00:31:14.761 --> 00:31:19.761
This is a movie about regular teenagers who just happened to be sick and I think

515
00:31:19.951 --> 00:31:21.050
that is the,

516
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:25.800
the most important like perspective of the film is that like this,

517
00:31:25.801 --> 00:31:29.670
there's no romanticizing of an illness here.
This is just who they are.

518
00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.470
That's right.
And it's as natural.

519
00:31:31.471 --> 00:31:35.280
It's is why the first 10 minutes is just seeing them in their environment so

520
00:31:35.281 --> 00:31:38.190
that you never have to go back and see it again.
And that was another thing,

521
00:31:38.191 --> 00:31:41.820
like I wanted to show it up top and then never reference it again.

522
00:31:41.821 --> 00:31:46.020
And you just know then that that's part of their life.
So even if you move on,

523
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:47.880
you know that she's got to do her treatments,

524
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.550
she's got to do that thing because no one wants to see that the whole time.

525
00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:52.380
And in terms of the difficult conversations,

526
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:58.590
I have found that the people that I'm the closest to in my life,

527
00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.110
I've had very difficult conversations with.

528
00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:05.640
And I've also noticed how afraid our culture is of having difficult

529
00:32:05.641 --> 00:32:06.660
conversations.

530
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.910
So I intentionally designed this film to be uncomfortable and it's certain areas

531
00:32:11.911 --> 00:32:16.911
to hopefully inspire people to get comfortable having difficult conversations.

532
00:32:17.581 --> 00:32:22.581
And if you notice the scene in the movie where they connect the most starts in

533
00:32:26.041 --> 00:32:28.860
the worst way,
which is the,

534
00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:33.930
the confession of the death of her sister and how it happened and the guilt that

535
00:32:33.931 --> 00:32:37.440
she feels with it.
And if you think about like the,

536
00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.650
the line that the scene takes,

537
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:45.010
it was very intentional that it started off that way and that it ends in the

538
00:32:45.081 --> 00:32:46.370
most romantic,
intimate way.

539
00:32:46.371 --> 00:32:51.371
You could ever have it end because those two things are not mutually exclusive.

540
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.240
But yet I think as a culture we say that they are.
Yeah.
And it was,

541
00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.300
it was honestly,
it was hard for the studio.
It was hard.
I mean,
this,

542
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:00.740
you got to remember this studio,

543
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:05.890
like they are ballsy to let me go make this movie and to have like this

544
00:33:06.381 --> 00:33:11.381
conversation in the romance scene and I had to explain why.

545
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.100
And that's why it's so deep.
That's why it's like you watch it and,
and,

546
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.890
and there's no sex scene in that movie,

547
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:21.430
but it's far more intimate than if there were.
That's right.

548
00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:26.510
And that scene and that scene starts with the death of her sister.

549
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.420
And then it lightens up and then they connect and lighten this up.

550
00:33:29.421 --> 00:33:33.560
And then I get closer.
And that's life.
And that's just what I've noticed.

551
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:36.230
And that's what I've learned from a lot of people that are in this situation.

552
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:37.760
My wife and I,
the closest,

553
00:33:37.761 --> 00:33:41.240
some of the closest times we've ever had have started with pain.

554
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.240
And there's just not things that you see in these movies.

555
00:33:44.241 --> 00:33:47.270
And I just wanted to make something that's like real and like,
no,

556
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.930
it's like we're like this.
It's okay.
You can just,
because your conference,

557
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:55.430
like on a date,
if the conversation it gets heavy,
your deeper,
darker,
depressing,

558
00:33:55.431 --> 00:33:59.300
does it mean that date is bad or the person's not right for you?
Keep going.

559
00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:02.060
What's on the other side of that uncomfortability?
Right.

560
00:34:02.061 --> 00:34:06.380
And we so often like we're so quick to write things off and I don't know,

561
00:34:06.381 --> 00:34:10.520
I just want us to like fight for things a little bit.
So anyways,

562
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:16.550
yeah,
great question.
Thank you.
Someone was in the back.
I saw him.
There she is.

563
00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:20.430
You can just throw it,
just throw it.
Go for it.
I got to get one.

564
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:21.890
I need one of those.

565
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.920
<v 8>Can you hear me?
Hi everyone.
My name's Joey.</v>

566
00:34:30.921 --> 00:34:34.010
I'm a computer science and theater double major at Middlebury College.

567
00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.380
My question is for Kim.
Um,
yes.

568
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:41.690
So you said that you were in the film industry for a long time.

569
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.980
My question is twofold.

570
00:34:42.981 --> 00:34:47.660
How did you transition from the entertainment industry to the tech industry and

571
00:34:47.661 --> 00:34:51.230
how did you find an intersect intersectionality between them?

572
00:34:51.231 --> 00:34:52.910
Because it's something that I'm struggling to do,

573
00:34:52.911 --> 00:34:55.160
but I want to do in the future once I graduate.

574
00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:00.450
<v 5>Awesome.
I love that.
Um,
I will,
I'll give you two answers.
So,</v>

575
00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.180
um,
in terms of transitioning to,
to be,

576
00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:07.590
to be fair because it's more dramatic if I'm like I had no math background,

577
00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.750
I actually was a huge math person growing up,

578
00:35:09.751 --> 00:35:13.500
so I did have a lot of exposure to it,
to math and science.
Um,

579
00:35:13.501 --> 00:35:18.210
I didn't major in it in college.
I did take a couple computer science classes.
Um,

580
00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:22.980
so 10 years later when I decided to get into the field,
um,

581
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:27.090
I knew I probably needed to get a master's degree or at least a second bachelors

582
00:35:27.091 --> 00:35:31.230
to convince people to hire me cause just a theater studies degree might not cut

583
00:35:31.231 --> 00:35:35.550
it.
Um,
and uh,
to be totally honest,

584
00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.090
I convinced UCLA let me in.
And,

585
00:35:39.091 --> 00:35:43.860
and by that I mean I got a ton of nos and being an actress in Hollywood,

586
00:35:43.861 --> 00:35:46.580
I said,
forget that I'm doing it anyway.
Um,

587
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:51.390
so I followed up with the vice chair and said,
take a meeting with me.

588
00:35:51.391 --> 00:35:54.780
And I sat down with him and I showed him my transcript from Undergrad and I
said,

589
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:59.450
you tell me what I needed to be to be competitive and I'll do it.
Um,

590
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.750
and so he basically said,
okay,
ace your math,

591
00:36:02.751 --> 00:36:07.080
juries take these classes,
audit them,
ace them,

592
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:10.290
proof to us that you can handle the material and we'll go from there.

593
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:16.230
And what it took was basically just the,
you know,
help me make this happen,

594
00:36:16.231 --> 00:36:17.400
but I'm going to make this happen.

595
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:21.960
So I audited classes for a year and then I got accepted into the master's degree

596
00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.080
and that was a two year program and then Google hired me out of the gate,

597
00:36:25.081 --> 00:36:29.680
which is awesome.
Um,
and thank God.
Um,

598
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.550
so then in terms of intersectionality,
I will tell you one of my,
sorry,

599
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:37.290
that was a misuse of that term in terms of the,

600
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:42.680
forgive me terms of the intersection of computer science and theater.
Um,
uh,

601
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:47.340
one,
one anecdote that made me feel really at home at Google very fast was a

602
00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.390
orientation.

603
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:53.420
You go up to mountain view and you do a week of sort of preparing on classes on

604
00:36:53.851 --> 00:36:54.690
the infrastructure.

605
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:59.990
And the lesson they had us do was I kid you not indexing the complete works of

606
00:37:00.691 --> 00:37:04.140
Shakespeare.
And I was like,
I'm home.

607
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:09.470
Um,
and in terms of how I've tried to like carry that forwards,
um,

608
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.510
part of it was working on youtube to be totally honest cause that was like a

609
00:37:12.511 --> 00:37:17.160
neat way to combine.
Um,
and what I'm doing right now,

610
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.020
like getting to,

611
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:23.670
to be on stage and use my performance skills to try to encourage other people to

612
00:37:23.671 --> 00:37:25.620
get interested in science and,

613
00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:30.780
and show them that can be fun is actually one of the ways that I've gotten to,

614
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.673
to do both.

615
00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:36.180
And I've worked with the CSN media team for awhile and I got to be on a PBS kids

616
00:37:36.181 --> 00:37:39.880
show for example,
or there was a,

617
00:37:39.881 --> 00:37:42.060
the La Olympics Promo.
They were like,
Hey,

618
00:37:42.061 --> 00:37:45.030
we need a female software engineer on camera.
Do you know of anyone?

619
00:37:45.031 --> 00:37:48.840
And they're like,
actually we have one at Ge as a sag card and an agent.
So,

620
00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.970
um,
awesome.
Um,

621
00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:55.200
so there are definitely ways and I'm still looking for all the new ways.

622
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:59.910
I would be delighted if you went out and found the thing that that hit that

623
00:37:59.911 --> 00:38:02.600
sweet spot for you and I'm sure it exists.
Yeah.

624
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.100
<v 0>And keep using your influence right.</v>

625
00:38:05.101 --> 00:38:08.490
To to keep spreading the knowledge and go to production studios and talk to them

626
00:38:08.491 --> 00:38:12.210
about what you want to see on TV or like Courtney and I also have a web series

627
00:38:12.211 --> 00:38:15.150
called God complex and our executive producers in the house,

628
00:38:15.151 --> 00:38:18.180
Claire Brown in the back.
And you know,
that's something that we,

629
00:38:18.181 --> 00:38:21.840
that we did and we got engineers like Kim to advise on it and make the coating

630
00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.110
like authentic and accurate and I also got to act in it.
Right.

631
00:38:25.111 --> 00:38:28.800
So it's like really cool to kind of see those worlds intersect.
So keep,

632
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.260
keep creating,
right.
If it doesn't exist,

633
00:38:31.261 --> 00:38:34.380
create it and like find your own lane and do what makes you happy.

634
00:38:34.381 --> 00:38:36.910
You don't have to choose.
Thank you for being here.

635
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:40.240
I want to be like you when I grow up.
You won't be like you.

636
00:38:40.241 --> 00:38:44.740
What are you double major in?
Computer Science and theater?
Yes.

637
00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:51.020
You have a question right here.
Okay.

638
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:55.990
<v 9>Um,
hi,
I'm Danny.
Um,
I'm a junior in high school and I'm not sure.</v>

639
00:38:55.991 --> 00:38:57.840
I think other other people in

640
00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.380
<v 0>cool.
Any other high schoolers,
don't leave her alone.
Leave her hanging.
All right.</v>

641
00:39:00.381 --> 00:39:01.214
Yeah.
Okay.

642
00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:02.093
<v 9>Um,</v>

643
00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:07.130
and I'm sure we're all thinking about colleges and I'm very interested in a wide

644
00:39:07.801 --> 00:39:10.010
range of topics and it's,

645
00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:15.070
it's hard to kind of distinguish what you want to do as 16 year old and it's

646
00:39:15.991 --> 00:39:18.240
kind of hard to make that decision,

647
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:21.810
especially what topic you want to go into.

648
00:39:21.811 --> 00:39:25.920
Do you think it's more important to focus on your community that you're going

649
00:39:25.921 --> 00:39:26.754
into or the,

650
00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:31.940
the value of the education system that is going to,

651
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:34.340
<v 0>what do you saying Madam Harvard,</v>

652
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.550
<v 3>I would say,
so I went to the,
I'm a freshmen,</v>

653
00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:45.170
I went into this year saying I want to possibly major in either computer
science,

654
00:39:45.171 --> 00:39:48.830
sociology or gender studies because those are the three things I'm interested
in.

655
00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:53.630
Um,
and right now I feel like I want to eat,
either create my own major,

656
00:39:53.631 --> 00:39:57.740
which specifically focuses on the impact of technology and media on society,

657
00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.370
or I'm going to be a gender studies or sociology major with the computer science

658
00:40:01.371 --> 00:40:02.204
secondary.

659
00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.000
So I'm taking two computer science classes right now and I took a computer

660
00:40:05.001 --> 00:40:06.200
science class last semester.

661
00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.920
But I think you don't have to choose between things you're interested in.

662
00:40:09.921 --> 00:40:12.030
There is a way to work everything together.

663
00:40:12.031 --> 00:40:14.940
It just might not be the most traditional route.
Um,

664
00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:18.140
but I think there's a lot of power in that as well because I think when you're

665
00:40:18.141 --> 00:40:19.610
really specific and intentional,

666
00:40:19.611 --> 00:40:23.060
you're going to a get the most out of it and then be,
um,

667
00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.540
that's where the magic happens and that's where special things will happen.

668
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:31.790
<v 5>And let me throw in that you're not going to get trapped by your major.
Right.</v>

669
00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:36.500
Cause same thing for theater studies major.
I'm now a software engineer.
Like,

670
00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.060
so you get to change your mind.

671
00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.570
And I think it's really common for people with multiple types of careers now.

672
00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.430
<v 0>It's so true.
When I first went to Dartmouth,</v>

673
00:40:44.431 --> 00:40:48.780
I was a biochemistry major and I wanted to be an obstetrician and deliver babies

674
00:40:48.781 --> 00:40:52.770
and then I would go,
you know,
go to the Nicu and I'd cry every time.
I was like,

675
00:40:52.771 --> 00:40:55.140
you are not Meredith grey abort mission.

676
00:40:56.390 --> 00:41:01.320
And I switched my major from biochemistry to sociology and theater and I work at

677
00:41:01.321 --> 00:41:02.520
Google.
It doesn't matter.

678
00:41:02.521 --> 00:41:06.840
Do what makes you happy and then everything comes naturally and you can find

679
00:41:06.841 --> 00:41:09.900
ways to work your passion and with your studies and your degree.

680
00:41:09.901 --> 00:41:12.480
But no one's like,
what did you major?
And no one really cares.

681
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:15.870
Just do what makes you happy.
I don't care cause I didn't even graduate college.

682
00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.540
There you go.
Don't take that route.
It's so much harder.

683
00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:28.350
But he makes feature films.
Okay.
Any other questions?
Two more.

684
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:32.950
Yeah,
have one right here and then one right here.

685
00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:39.730
<v 9>All right.
Hello?
Um,
my name is Maya.
I'm also in high school.
I'm a here.</v>

686
00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:44.640
Um,
anyways,
so I'm taking comp side this year.
Come say hey,

687
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:46.770
I really like it.
Uh,
anyways,

688
00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:48.600
<v 3>what is that?
For those who might not know.</v>

689
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:50.750
<v 9>It's,
it's an AP computer science class.</v>

690
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:55.010
It's one of two that's offered I think generally.
But there's,

691
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.010
there's a really competitive stigma with computer science.

692
00:41:58.011 --> 00:42:02.690
Like everyone I know who codes is also very competitive and coding and um,

693
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:07.130
there's kind of a push to get straight A's and to do what you're good at so that

694
00:42:07.131 --> 00:42:08.490
you can get straight A's.
Um,

695
00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:12.170
and so how do you suggest kind of reverting from that stigma?

696
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.620
Because I like computer science but I'm not fantastic at it yet.

697
00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.190
I'm not saying I'm not going to be,
I'm just saying I'm not fantastic at it yet.

698
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:20.323
But how,
how,

699
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:24.740
like how do you suggest pursuing something that you enjoy and being able to

700
00:42:24.741 --> 00:42:28.490
reject that idea that you always have to do something that you're good at?

701
00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:34.130
<v 3>That's a great question.
That is,
you just put it really well yourself.
You just,</v>

702
00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.180
you have to reject the idea that you have to be good at it right now to do it.

703
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:41.360
Like cutting.
Like I said,
coding does not come naturally to me.

704
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:45.290
I'm definitely not the best in my computer science classes.

705
00:42:45.291 --> 00:42:48.050
I'm definitely not getting straight A's,
I can assure you of that.

706
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.140
But I am trying really hard and I am getting better.

707
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:56.320
So I think you do have to trust in the process a little bit and know that you're

708
00:42:56.391 --> 00:43:00.500
not going to be perfect and it's going to feel kind of hard and you're going to

709
00:43:00.501 --> 00:43:05.000
be kind of mad at yourself during the process,
but you will get better.
And also,

710
00:43:05.001 --> 00:43:09.140
um,
I think straight days aren't everything and they also don't prove what you've

711
00:43:09.141 --> 00:43:09.441
made.

712
00:43:09.441 --> 00:43:12.320
And I think something that's been really helpful for me is knowing that like I

713
00:43:12.321 --> 00:43:16.070
can create things that don't have to do with grades that have to do with coding

714
00:43:16.071 --> 00:43:17.410
because um,

715
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:19.850
that's when I feel most empowered is when I'm creating something that will

716
00:43:19.851 --> 00:43:20.990
actually have an impact.

717
00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:23.043
<v 1>Okay.</v>

718
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:26.130
<v 5>I,
I've discovered the hard way.
You don't get an a at your job.</v>

719
00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:30.840
I'm like,
I seriously went out of Grad school being like,
all right,

720
00:43:30.841 --> 00:43:31.674
how do I get nay?

721
00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:35.610
And I almost literally had my first one on one with my manager where I was like,

722
00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.700
okay,
what's the assignment?
And she's like,
no,
no,
this is the problem.

723
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:42.720
You need to go figure it out.
We don't have the answer yet.
And I was like,
oh,

724
00:43:42.721 --> 00:43:43.950
this is a different ball game.

725
00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.450
So like getting an a in school,

726
00:43:48.451 --> 00:43:50.160
you're sort of train that that is the goal.

727
00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:53.670
But like in actual engineering doing side projects,

728
00:43:53.671 --> 00:43:57.690
doing things that inspire you,
like getting your hands dirty,

729
00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:00.270
that's so much more valuable in the long run.
So

730
00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:06.250
<v 1>great.
Good question right here.
Who has the mic?
Yeah,</v>

731
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:08.850
<v 3>good catches.</v>

732
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.130
<v 7>Um,
I'm Delilah.
I'm,</v>

733
00:44:11.131 --> 00:44:16.131
I'm a sophomore in high school and my question is more geared towards Justin and

734
00:44:16.231 --> 00:44:19.530
like the whole like film making process.
And um,

735
00:44:19.531 --> 00:44:24.531
I love all of the talk about intersectionality and how like one thing just

736
00:44:24.871 --> 00:44:25.621
doesn't define you.

737
00:44:25.621 --> 00:44:29.520
It's like so many things that are just meshed together and I mean they're

738
00:44:29.521 --> 00:44:31.740
separate still,
but,
and was wondering,

739
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:36.680
I know that in trying to bring representation to,
um,

740
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.460
different groups,
um,

741
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:43.540
it's kind of hard and like mainstream media to,
um,

742
00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:48.830
to make something and just have it like,
be like an undertone.
Um,

743
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:50.670
and I was wondering if you got,

744
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:54.990
well if you got pushed back and like how you deal,
you dealt with that.

745
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:56.080
Um,

746
00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.470
<v 2>is there a specific pushback that you're asking about?</v>

747
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:04.800
<v 7>Not really.
I think it's just like general more open for you.</v>

748
00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:09.250
<v 2>I think,
you know,
look,
we are,
we are living again,</v>

749
00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.950
I go back to the Times that we're living in,
right?

750
00:45:11.951 --> 00:45:14.560
And you're living at a time when there's keyboard courage and the everybody has

751
00:45:14.561 --> 00:45:18.930
an opinion and I come from the belief where there is an,

752
00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:22.260
there you cannot make everybody happy.
And there,

753
00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:27.190
there are people that don't want to be made happy and there are opinions that

754
00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:32.170
aren't just the existing for the sake of opinions and,

755
00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:33.540
and uh,

756
00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:38.230
and there's always going to be pushed back about anything and everything.

757
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:40.720
I mean,
the perfect example is

758
00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:47.140
like how could one of Claire's videos ever get a dislike?
But there is,

759
00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:52.780
there's a hundred people out there that click that dislike button.
You know,

760
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:53.110
I'm,

761
00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:58.110
I'll never forget Zach's mom when I made the documentary about Zach Sobeck who

762
00:45:58.361 --> 00:46:01.780
died right before the documentary came out.
Or right after the doc American,

763
00:46:01.781 --> 00:46:02.614
like within a day.

764
00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:08.340
And like there was negative comments and,
and had,

765
00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:13.360
and it just made me realize that there was nothing that anybody can make that

766
00:46:14.441 --> 00:46:18.850
someone will have only positive opinions about.
And again,

767
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:22.960
then you look at film critics,
what is critic,
right?

768
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.850
It's not like there's a job for film supporters or you know,

769
00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.370
it's just they're critiquing,
right?

770
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.450
So it's just the culture we live in and also everything is so instant that it's

771
00:46:34.451 --> 00:46:35.050
like,
well,

772
00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:38.530
I can just get my thoughts and opinions out into the world without thinking

773
00:46:38.531 --> 00:46:43.210
about them now and just ruin somebody's day and then go on with mine.
Um,

774
00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.190
so there,
there was absolutely,

775
00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:51.220
there was pushback in the CF community by a couple people,
right?

776
00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:55.420
And again,
it's up to me then to go and say,
well,
why is there push back?

777
00:46:55.421 --> 00:46:59.350
And what I have to remember is like,
this is life and death for a lot of people.

778
00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.450
That's it.
Right?
And so representing,
there's never been a film about CF before.

779
00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:08.320
So the CF community needs to own it because it really,

780
00:47:08.321 --> 00:47:10.720
it was made inspired by them and for them.

781
00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:15.460
But I won't be able to please everybody.
But at the same time,
I have to remember,

782
00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:16.600
and you know,

783
00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.660
my friend gray here in the studio and my publicist and my assistant,

784
00:47:19.661 --> 00:47:23.800
like I know I am a people pleaser.
I want to please everybody all the time.

785
00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:28.240
And my mom always told me,
you'll never please everybody all the time.
Um,

786
00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.600
you just need to worry having me be pleased that I was like,
okay,

787
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:36.160
you're taking it too far with the Jewish guilt mom.
Uh,
but,

788
00:47:36.161 --> 00:47:41.020
but really so,
so yeah,
we strive for representation.
You know,
you,
you know,

789
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:42.560
and you,
you,

790
00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:46.900
you try to be inclusive and come up with these ideas and create a film that

791
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:50.560
isn't just over the top,
you know,
like even down to,
you know,

792
00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:55.680
I struggled for awhile because I just wanted to have diversity and be inclusive

793
00:47:57.851 --> 00:48:02.140
in the way that I cast the movie.
And I found myself in certain times like,
like,

794
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:04.930
do I just find like,
you know,
cause I didn't,

795
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:09.110
you don't have the options to just cast whoever you want and then like,
you know,

796
00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:12.610
you're not alone.
There's times that you can't go.
It's not PC to say like,

797
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:18.030
I would like to bring in only African American people for this role because then

798
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.560
you're thinking,
well crap,

799
00:48:20.561 --> 00:48:23.740
I'm not thinking about the Asian community or the Middle Eastern community.

800
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:25.780
You're,
and then you realize like,
oh my God,

801
00:48:25.781 --> 00:48:29.200
now I'm now I'm discriminated against.
And it's like,
oh shit.

802
00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:32.950
And if you go down that rabbit hole,
it'll,

803
00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:36.010
it will actually prevent you from doing anything.

804
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:39.400
And that's what I had to learn was,
was like,
I'm,

805
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:42.700
I know I'm going to disappoint somebody.
Um,

806
00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:47.290
but I tried and we took baby steps and you know,

807
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:50.320
um,
yeah,
that's kind of like the,

808
00:48:50.321 --> 00:48:55.060
how I approached the whole thing of that.
So we're at a time,

809
00:48:55.061 --> 00:48:57.900
that's a great note to end on.
Just keep trying your hand.
I feel bad.
Oh,

810
00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:02.320
you have a question?
No,
it's fine.
It was like a quarter raise real quick.

811
00:49:02.321 --> 00:49:05.440
One last one.
Go for it real quick.

812
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:09.070
<v 7>Okay.
Um,
my name is Sophia.
I'm a senior in high school.
Um,</v>

813
00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:12.370
and my question was one of the most interesting parts of the film for me,

814
00:49:12.371 --> 00:49:17.210
it was the conversation that was had about like how to pay for the healthcare

815
00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:21.370
and what you do,
um,
when you're over 18 and it's not covered.

816
00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:24.380
So I was wondering,
um,
like what was for adjusting,

817
00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.540
what was your intention in putting that in the film and what,

818
00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:29.870
<v 2>yeah,
thank you guys.
I'm so happy you actually noticed that.
Uh,</v>

819
00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:31.600
because nobody's seen the movie yet.

820
00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:33.610
I don't know what people are going to respond to where,

821
00:49:33.611 --> 00:49:36.280
like with what things are going to be put in there.

822
00:49:36.281 --> 00:49:40.990
So originally Po had a whole backstory that I wasn't able to include in the film

823
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:44.470
because I wanted,
first of all,
I wanted I,

824
00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:49.310
and again,
skating on this line and like on the razor's edge.

825
00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:53.530
Like I wanted there to be a character that was a representation for an entire

826
00:49:53.531 --> 00:49:58.390
class of people that are currently struggling with the medical system in
America.

827
00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.720
And so,
um,
without getting too deep into politics,

828
00:50:01.721 --> 00:50:06.280
I wanted to be a dreamer because we wrote the movie at a time when dreamers were

829
00:50:06.281 --> 00:50:08.380
being attacked and um,

830
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:13.210
and I wanted people to be able to empathize with somebody that was a dreamer.

831
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:18.360
Now it's very hard to do that when you have a secondary character who's also a

832
00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:21.820
marginalized group on a couple of different sides.
And then he's literally like,

833
00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:26.320
he's just checking every box.
And I was like,
I can't just like,
that doesn't work,

834
00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.370
right?
Just becomes too much.

835
00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:33.940
And it's my desperate attempt to try to like make like make this film more than

836
00:50:34.581 --> 00:50:36.500
just it.
Look,
it's already doing a lot,

837
00:50:36.501 --> 00:50:39.410
but it's like how I always go like how can I do more?
Right.

838
00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:40.221
And then you realize like,

839
00:50:40.221 --> 00:50:42.230
I can't do more cause then I'm just going to push people and then it's just

840
00:50:42.231 --> 00:50:43.064
going to be like,

841
00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:45.290
it's going to be a whole group of people that they just think I'm pushing like a

842
00:50:45.291 --> 00:50:48.080
liberal agenda and I'm not.
And it just,
the whole thing.

843
00:50:48.081 --> 00:50:52.970
So Po was originally a dreamer and his mom had a,

844
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:56.480
his mom had brought him here for medical care,
um,

845
00:50:56.510 --> 00:51:00.110
because it was better than where he was from.
And then she was deported.

846
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.420
That was the backstory that was cut.

847
00:51:02.421 --> 00:51:05.000
And there was a scene that's in the deleted scenes of the movie.

848
00:51:05.001 --> 00:51:08.400
When it comes out on Itunes,
you'll be able to watch it between,
uh,

849
00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:12.950
that takes place in a chapel between Cole Sprouse is character will and Po.

850
00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:13.790
Um,

851
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:18.440
that gets into a little bit more of the fact that his mom is no longer here and

852
00:51:18.441 --> 00:51:22.520
he's got to pay for like his medical care himself and then will was rich.

853
00:51:22.521 --> 00:51:26.250
So he made a joke about like,
well,
maybe I can help you.
Um,

854
00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:28.010
and it was just a way of saying,
okay,

855
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.520
there's more to this character and there's,

856
00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:36.190
there's consequences to being a sick in the current medical,
um,

857
00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.650
world that,
that we're not really paying attention to.

858
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:42.020
So that's why I put it in there.

859
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.660
And then we did little things like he had a different oxygen tank.

860
00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:47.660
Then the other two,
you might not notice it.
You might notice it.

861
00:51:47.661 --> 00:51:50.330
That was important to me.
He had an older iPhone,
right?

862
00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.910
Like little things that you may notice or may not with that.

863
00:51:52.911 --> 00:51:55.730
Those were the things that were important to me because what nobody knows is the

864
00:51:55.731 --> 00:51:59.900
oxygen tanks that will and stellar caring or $15,000 right?

865
00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:03.770
And you can't get those if you don't have insurance.
And this could,
you know,

866
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.710
he's being paid for by the state and that's why it's a real thing.

867
00:52:06.711 --> 00:52:09.650
And he does guilt and he doesn't want people to pay for him.
And it's a,
you know,

868
00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:13.130
and those were all the things that they have to deal with on a daily basis and

869
00:52:13.131 --> 00:52:15.710
that millions of Americans have to deal with that we never talk about.

870
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:17.630
So it was a,
it was an attempt.

871
00:52:17.631 --> 00:52:20.270
So it makes me really happy that you noticed it cause I did.

872
00:52:20.271 --> 00:52:23.240
Unfortunately I have to cut a lot of that storyline to make room for things.

873
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:29.300
<v 0>Okay.
So everyone go see the movie 15 please.</v>

874
00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:33.950
Friday,
bring your friends,
tell people about it.
This is so important.

875
00:52:33.951 --> 00:52:34.970
I can't stress it enough.

876
00:52:34.971 --> 00:52:39.530
This type of film with this much diversity and inclusion and acceptance and love

877
00:52:39.531 --> 00:52:42.470
and respect.
It's epic and we don't get it enough.

878
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:47.420
So let's give our panel one more round of applause.
Thank you all so much.

879
00:52:47.421 --> 00:52:51.680
Cam,

all of our volunteers,
all of you for showing up and staying late.

881
00:52:55.581 --> 00:52:58.190
I know you will have homework.
Go home,
do your homework,

882
00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.050
get ready for work tomorrow we're going to take a quick photo and if you will,

883
00:53:01.051 --> 00:53:04.070
could kindly pick up your trash and find your way out to the lobby.

884
00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.770
I'm sure some of us will stick around to answer some more questions.
