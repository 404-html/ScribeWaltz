00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.820
Uh,
hey everyone.
Welcome to Tosca.
Google.
My name is Dana Hind Klein.

2
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:08.100
And today it is my pleasure to introduce Jack Horner,

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.160
paleontologist and professor at Montana State University.
Uh,

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.260
he is a consultant on the Jurassic Park Franchise and was a consultant on this

5
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:18.460
latest one drastic world.
Welcome.
Thank you.

6
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.120
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.240
<v 1>so you've been with the series from the beginning.
In fact,</v>

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.710
part of your works inspired the series,
correct?
That's what they say.

9
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.620
Um,
so what's it been like to be sort of evolved from this role of being an

10
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:38.790
inspiration for it?
You know,

11
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:42.120
they say that part of the character of Alan Grant is based on your work,
um,

12
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.300
to becoming this sort of influencing factor on the science behind it.

13
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.920
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.480
<v 1>Okay.
I don't know what to say about it.
Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.040
I'm glad my character hasn't been eaten.

16
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.020
Survival is good.
Survival.
It's definitely good.
Um,

17
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.480
well let you know it's been the,

18
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.130
the novel came out in 1990 and the first film came out in 1993 and we've seen a

19
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:08.190
lot of developments in the field of paleontology since then.
You know,
we've,

20
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:11.940
we've learned a lot about dinosaurs since then.
Um,
what are some of the things,

21
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:14.550
you know,
there's,
with a respect for the fact that it is science fiction,

22
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.870
what are some of the things that you do,

23
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:18.450
wish they'd been able to incorporate that we've discovered since then?

24
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.980
<v 2>Um,
I actually,
nothing really,
I mean,</v>

25
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.153
<v 0>when,</v>

26
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.140
<v 2>when I was,
when I was working on Jurassic Park one,</v>

27
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.680
Steven and I had a lot of arguments about whether the velociraptors should have

28
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:41.430
feathers on be colorful,
and he won all of those arguments.

29
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.410
He said a technicolor feathered dinosaurs not going to scare anyone.

30
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.030
It's a fair concession.
So they're gray and,
you know,

31
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.010
featherless Gary,

32
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.700
<v 1>I guess.
Um,
well,
were there times that you were able to say like,
all right,</v>

33
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.690
that's not gonna be scary,

34
00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:00.780
but let me tell you about this and this is going to terrify people.

35
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.720
<v 2>Um,
no.</v>

36
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.960
<v 1>No.
Okay.
All right then.
Um,</v>

37
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.250
so obviously you're a wealth of information for the filmmakers to come to.
Um,

38
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.761
what were,

39
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:14.400
what were some of the questions that they asked you that you were able to advise

40
00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:15.234
them on?

41
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.600
<v 2>Well,
there's a lot of,
well,
first off,</v>

42
00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:22.601
my job really was to make sure that the dinosaurs looked as good as they could

43
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.030
without feathers and you know,
color,
um,

44
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.860
but looked as accurate as they could based on the science of the time.

45
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.110
Now remember that was 1992 and then I think we did a pretty good job of that.

46
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.000
But then,
you know,
Steven took him and made him act actors out of them and they,

47
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.920
everything they do is fictional.
I mean,
they run too fast or in many cases,

48
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:50.870
you know,
a little bigger than they should be,

49
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.730
which is not a bad thing because we actually know that dinosaurs grew through

50
00:02:55.731 --> 00:03:00.160
most of their lives.
And so people are always going to find bigger,

51
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.870
bigger t rexes and you know,
bigger everything.
So that's not a big deal.
But,

52
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.940
but my job was to make sure that the dinosaurs looked good and then,
and then

53
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.300
mostly just,
you know,
make sure that there were,
that things were accurate,

54
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.980
as accurate as they could be.

55
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.970
So that basically what he said is you didn't want third graders to send him

56
00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:25.290
nasty letters.
And so,
so there was a,

57
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.410
there was a time when we were doing the kitchen scene and there was some raptors

58
00:03:31.741 --> 00:03:35.130
that came in the kitchen and then you,
you,
you all know that.

59
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.780
And originally they were going to come in and flick their fork tongue around and

60
00:03:39.781 --> 00:03:43.260
I said,
you know,
you,
you cannot do that because they didn't have four times.

61
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.940
We know that for sure,
because if they did,
they had,

62
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.890
would have had Jacobson's organ and they don't have that.

63
00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:53.910
So we know that for sure.
And so he said,
all right,
but we need that.

64
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.080
We need something for that space.
We need,
you know,
we've got that time limit,

65
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.740
that time in the,
in the movie.
And so we have to have something.

66
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.970
So we,
uh,
that's when we changed the,
uh,

67
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.010
the scene to them.

68
00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:12.150
It's coming to the door and snorting and fogging up the window.

69
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.150
And that took them the basically,
you know,
that,

70
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.960
that's the one thing that really sort of moved them away from being very

71
00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:21.690
reptilian lucking to being warm blooded.

72
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.770
It's the only warm blooded animals can do that.
So that was,

73
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.840
that was one thing I got in there that I was very happy about because he kept,

74
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.160
he told me when we first started,
he didn't want monsters,

75
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.830
but I had to keep moving him away from monsters because that's,

76
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:43.330
he has really what he wanted

77
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.250
<v 1>monsters.
But that's it.
Yeah.
Um,
so I mean that's a great example,</v>

78
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:51.830
but what are some of the other sort of characteristics that we've,

79
00:04:51.831 --> 00:04:55.170
we can discover based on dinosaurs,
sort of the,

80
00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:58.690
the discovery of their remains?
Um,
you know,

81
00:04:58.691 --> 00:05:01.660
we can tell just on a basic level that like,
oh,
uh,

82
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.460
herbivores and carnivores have different teeth.

83
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.090
How do we kind of extrapolate their behavior patterns based on that?
And what,

84
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.350
what were you able to sort of,

85
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.490
<v 2>well,
you know,
the first off the Alan Grant character,
the reason that's</v>

86
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.490
the sort of the park that is based on me is his,

87
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.210
you know,
he's in his,
in the book and in the,
in the movie he's,

88
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.570
he's this guy who studies dinosaur behavior in Montana.
And then,

89
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.210
so that's what,
you know,
Michael Crighton took from my books and,

90
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.790
and the behavior that we do,

91
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:37.420
we actually were able to determine that dinosaurs cared for their young,

92
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:39.700
brought food to the babies.
You know,

93
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.140
and we did it all from looking at the geological evidence.
I mean,

94
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:47.680
we found baby dinosaur skeletons in nus like structures,

95
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:51.970
and it was the first time that had ever been seen.
So,

96
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.620
so you can do behavioral science on dinosaurs,

97
00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.680
even though they're all dead and the latest stuff we've been working on,

98
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.080
and we,
you can see it in the new movie,
but it's very subtle.
Um,

99
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.360
a baby try Sarah to,
there's some baby triceratops in the new,

100
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.700
in the new movie and,
and kids are riding him,

101
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.180
but you'll notice the horns actually curve backward,

102
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.560
the horns of the baby's curve backward.
And,
um,

103
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.640
and then so what we know is that baby dinosaurs,

104
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:33.641
actually baby triceratops actually look different than adult triceratops.

105
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.850
Uh,
babies grew and as they grew their horns,

106
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.160
curt actually arc backwards.

107
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.930
And then when they read this start to reach sexual maturity actually grew

108
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:47.900
forward.
And when they're sexually mature,

109
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.120
their horns are straightforward.
And so,
uh,
and that's how,

110
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.500
that's one of the ways we know that they're very social animals because we see

111
00:06:57.501 --> 00:07:01.850
the same thing in mammal in mammals and birds.
We see it in us,
right?

112
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.910
We can always tell a juvenile from an adult and we know that when they lose

113
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:11.620
those juvenile characteristics right out the door,

114
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.220
they go and they have to get a job.
So,
so,

115
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.200
so,
you know,
um,
skeletal maturity,

116
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:22.520
sexual maturity,

117
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.820
these are all things that we can actually tell in the fossil record.

118
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.950
So we get a few of those things we could stick in the movie

119
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.560
<v 1>that's going to say,
I think a,</v>

120
00:07:32.561 --> 00:07:36.790
is it a Paki Sefo source appears in one of the films and it's another one of the

121
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.690
creatures that the dome headed shifting kind of.

122
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.280
<v 2>They talk about them crashing your heads together and we've actually proved that</v>

123
00:07:45.281 --> 00:07:46.600
they could only do that once,

124
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.200
<v 1>lay on there.
Just remember they,
that was their first time.
Um,</v>

125
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.930
but it's great that sort of,
there's this,

126
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.590
this element in that they do want to respect the kind of as much of the

127
00:07:59.591 --> 00:08:02.500
scientific integrity that they can.
Um,

128
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.480
so you mentioned the nesting sort of habits and like maternal paternal instinct.

129
00:08:07.481 --> 00:08:11.410
That's definitely also something that appears with the t rexes and the previous

130
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:15.830
films.
Um,
were you,
were you ever upset that the Maiasaura didn't get to appear?

131
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:21.200
It was in the book.
That's all right.
Um,
so can you,
can you,

132
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.340
can you talk about some of the other sort of contributions where you kind of got

133
00:08:24.341 --> 00:08:27.820
to say,
like you mentioned the raptor as you mentioned,
the triceratops.

134
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.080
What are some of the other ones where you just said like,
he,
you have to,
well,

135
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.080
let's respect the,

136
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:37.450
<v 2>oh,
there's not,
there's not a lot of them because,
you know,
as we all know,</v>

137
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:41.110
there's not a lot of science actually shown.
I mean,

138
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:46.400
the dinosaurs basically are chasing somebody.
I mean,

139
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.220
the plant theaters are eating plants or,

140
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.610
or standing around waiting to get eaten by something.

141
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.610
<v 1>I,
since they are getting eaten.
Yes,
true.
I was just dirt,</v>

142
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.860
<v 2>you know,
we just don't see it.
A lot of the behavioral stuff up.
Um,</v>

143
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.680
there was one interesting thing in the first movie.

144
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.730
I think it was the first one.
I might've been the second one.
Anyway.
Um,

145
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.320
we have a dinosaur pie,
right?

146
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.170
I'll dinosaur he both done and,

147
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.310
and it looked like elephant dung and I said,
you know,

148
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.110
we can't look like Elephant Dung.
It's gotta look like bird poop.
Right?

149
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.400
So it can't be just a bunch of ball and looking at things that actually has to

150
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:33.360
be a big white thing.

151
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.500
<v 1>We went round and round about that.</v>

152
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.270
I don't know if it's necessarily always want to pick.
Um,
well,
you know,

153
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.290
that dinosaurs that,
you know,
as long as you don't have to handle it,

154
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.940
it defies the dumb law.
Hello?
The one that's in the movie,
you know,

155
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.390
a pile of Dung should never be any higher than the place it came from.

156
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.600
Good to remember.
Um,

157
00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.680
sort of speaking of the actual remains and not,

158
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.860
not that type of her remains,
but,
um,
they're,
they're,
you know,

159
00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:13.850
there's not a ton of science mentioned the movie,
but the originals,
you know,
we,

160
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.310
he extracted the DNA from a mosquito,

161
00:10:16.311 --> 00:10:19.910
but we know that like if the biomaterial when actually hold up,

162
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.800
but you guys have actually been able to extract material from fossils.

163
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.840
Um,
could you talk a little bit maybe about be rex

164
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.050
<v 2>be rex is,
well,</v>

165
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:35.260
it used to be a very special dinosaur until just very recently.
Um,

166
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.630
it was a dinosaur.

167
00:10:38.631 --> 00:10:42.950
It's a tyrannosaurus rex and it was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock

168
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:48.350
and it produced soft tissues,
clear,

169
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:53.410
flexible blood vessels that we were able to etch out of the internal structure

170
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.420
and internal parts of the bone.

171
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.730
And we also were able to get Collagen,
the protein Collagen.

172
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:07.510
And we were able to get cells with Nuclei and unfortunately,

173
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.390
no DNA,
the DNA had broken down.

174
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.890
But what we've learned since then is that,

175
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.960
that these soft tissues we'll preserve and there they're fixing agent is iron.

176
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.840
Uh,
but what's interesting is,
you know,

177
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.370
when we think about a fossil dinosaur,

178
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.760
any animal that dies and when it dies,

179
00:11:31.761 --> 00:11:36.110
it begins to rot and it rots because bacteria gets in there and start speeding

180
00:11:36.111 --> 00:11:36.944
on it.

181
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.520
But if bacteria can't get into it and you're fixing agent is quick enough,

182
00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:43.880
which is iron,
of course,

183
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.780
iron is heme is the,

184
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:53.060
is the basis of hemoglobin and it's already in the vessels.

185
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.410
And so you're fixing agent is already there.

186
00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:01.270
And what we've discovered is that these tissues,

187
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:04.300
as long as they don't get broken down by bacteria right away,

188
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.500
we'll actually last forever clear and flexible,

189
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.270
which is pretty cool.

190
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:15.271
And it's changed our whole notion of what fossilization is because be fossilized

191
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.960
and still be flexible.
And yeah,
it just chemistry.

192
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.390
That's what you have to remember.
You have to adjust to camera.

193
00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.000
<v 1>Strangely,
the easy Kevin.
No,
no,
but it's great.
I mean,</v>

194
00:12:29.001 --> 00:12:31.700
I suppose theoretically if you'd written the book today,
you know,
he could,

195
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.100
instead of a mosquito would be a femur bone,

196
00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.460
which I know Dna,
but no DNA.
Um,

197
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.870
but it does bring us to kind of another thing that you're working on that kind

198
00:12:41.871 --> 00:12:45.660
of is taking the fiction part of out of science fiction.
Um,

199
00:12:45.661 --> 00:12:50.240
and that's the chicken a source and drilling a dinosaur.
Um,
you know,
it's,

200
00:12:50.241 --> 00:12:53.750
it's definitely something that I could see the fictional John Hammond dreaming

201
00:12:53.751 --> 00:12:56.970
up.
But would you mind telling us about how to build the dinosaur?
Right.

202
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:02.860
<v 2>So the,
the premise behind all of this was,</v>

203
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.341
you know,

204
00:13:03.341 --> 00:13:08.341
Jurassic Park was try to bring dinosaurs back in and we know we can't do that

205
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:08.920
week.

206
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.920
I have tried many times to extract DNA from a dinosaur and we've always failed.

207
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:16.060
And it's probably,

208
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:21.180
we think because the DNA molecule is huge and it just is not very stable,

209
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:26.020
it breaks down very quickly.
And so it just comes apart too easily.

210
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.930
And even the mammoth elephant that's 10,000 years old,

211
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:32.350
they have fragments of DNA,
but they're tiny.

212
00:13:32.351 --> 00:13:34.840
They're just only a few hundred base pair.

213
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:39.340
And that's the only 10,000 years.
And so,
you know,

214
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.760
even if we got DNS,

215
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.640
even if we found some fragments that were still together from a dinosaur,

216
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:49.030
they'd still probably only be in the tens of base pair.

217
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.050
So we're know we're never going to make a dinosaur that way.
So,

218
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.920
you know,
birds are living dinosaurs,

219
00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.190
they are dinosaurs.
And so,

220
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:05.820
and so they carry dinosaur DNA obviously since they are dinosaurs.

221
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.000
And,
but when you look at a bird and you look at a dinosaur,

222
00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:13.700
if you look at specialty at their skeletons,
you know,
the,
the,
uh,

223
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.400
the skeleton of a bird chicken,
um,

224
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.330
has no tail.
It has wings.
It has no teeth.

225
00:14:22.331 --> 00:14:26.390
It's got this beak and you know,
looks like ticking.

226
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.670
But edit is a dinosaur,
you know,

227
00:14:30.671 --> 00:14:34.690
and I keep trying to tell the sixth graders it's an Isr and they just say it's

228
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.640
not cool enough looking.
So,

229
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.880
so to make it cool bird into a diner,
you know,
make a cool dinosaur.

230
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.333
Um,

231
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:48.640
what we're doing now is looking for atavistic genes and other words,

232
00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:53.850
ancestral genes that the birds might still be carrying that are just turned off

233
00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:01.760
right there.
So to lose the tail,
in other words,

234
00:15:01.761 --> 00:15:06.761
when we went from archaeopteryx like animals with long tails to any bird we have

235
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:12.590
now that has a short tail,
there is a genetic pathway that's missing,

236
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.130
right?

237
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:18.130
And so we're looking for those historical genetic pathways to reinstate them.

238
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.980
And so we're going in and actually going into an embryo and determining when

239
00:15:24.321 --> 00:15:25.910
particular genes are turned on,

240
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.980
at what stage of their development they're turned on and when they're turned
off.

241
00:15:30.981 --> 00:15:31.790
And,

242
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:36.740
and trying to adjust those so that we can actually get a bird to hatch out with

243
00:15:36.741 --> 00:15:41.240
a long tail.
Um,
so teeth,

244
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:46.310
so we,
we have these four,
four things.
There's teeth,
the beak,

245
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.520
the snout making it,
changing it,

246
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:54.550
the tail and the arms and hands and teeth were accomplished.

247
00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.660
Back in the 90s,

248
00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:03.080
there was a group at the University of Wisconsin that actually was able to turn

249
00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:06.800
a gene on and without adding anything to a burn,

250
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.460
get chickens to have teeth.

251
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.130
Now they're first generation teeth.

252
00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:17.090
They couldn't actually grow through the Keratin of the beat.

253
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.650
So they're just,
they're implanted in the jaw.
But you know,

254
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.720
we have them.
So we know that all we have to do is knock out the,
uh,

255
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.790
the,
uh,
uh,
Keratin to get it to come through.

256
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.150
Just a few weeks ago,

257
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:40.570
a group at Harvard and Yale were able to transform the beak into a mouth that

258
00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:44.870
looks like a dinosaur.
And that,
you know,

259
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.270
that actually is proof of concept.

260
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:52.990
That was a atavistic gene that they actually turned on and change the form of

261
00:16:54.561 --> 00:16:57.620
its mouth.
We are working on the tail,

262
00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.640
which is the hardest part because we actually,
in order to,

263
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.250
in order to get a tail to grow,

264
00:17:04.251 --> 00:17:07.250
we actually aren't going to have to add vertebrae.

265
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.670
We can,
we,
we have,

266
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.970
we have gone in and found the atavistic gene.

267
00:17:13.971 --> 00:17:17.690
We can get it to produce about 14 vertebrae,

268
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.560
um,
which is sort of an ancestral state,

269
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:25.880
but is basically what a bird already has,

270
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.900
except they fused the end of it together to make what they call,

271
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.720
what we call a [inaudible] style.
We can,

272
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.380
we can sort of sort those out right now,

273
00:17:36.381 --> 00:17:39.470
but it's still not a long tail.
So what we're,

274
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.360
we're working on now is actually trying to figure out how to put basically an

275
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.310
alligator like tail on a bird and,

276
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.990
and we're making good progress.
We've,

277
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.020
we've actually done it a couple of times,
but we can't really,

278
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.030
we had some problems.
We can't,
we,

279
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:02.160
we can't tell whether we've added tail or change the position of the pelvis.

280
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.680
So in the embryo,
you know,

281
00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:08.490
everything's done at very small states and so it's just hard to tell where we

282
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:13.410
are right now.
But then the hand actually going back to,

283
00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.310
uh,
a hand transforming it back from a wing,

284
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.420
we don't think I'll be too much difficulty because it really is just a matter
of,

285
00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.180
it's,

286
00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:27.000
it's a gene that fuses the three digits together and we just have to infuse
them.

287
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.510
And we think that'll be a relatively easy process.

288
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:33.180
But the tail is the big,
the big thing.

289
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.090
Because as soon as we can add vertebrae,
I mean,

290
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:41.220
it has just tremendous application to the medical field.
And I mean,

291
00:18:41.221 --> 00:18:43.590
there's just so many things that we'll be able to do,

292
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:48.480
but it is the most complex.
But right now,

293
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.860
figure teeth and the mouth,
that's 50%.

294
00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.120
We're halfway there,

295
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.920
<v 1>hopefully halfway,
not to the rafters running around,
but,
and you,</v>

296
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.800
but we make them one at a time.

297
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:07.520
I think they'd have a hard time out in the wild,
trying to find another chicken,

298
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:09.900
a source to meet with.
And if they did make good,

299
00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:14.590
just going to have chickens and they're only gonna like chicken food.
Jamie.

300
00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.780
Um,
but you,
you do sort of mentioned in your book,
you know,

301
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.840
it's not going to be drastic partner in this as much as some of us might want

302
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.580
our own pet raptor.
Um,
but it's version one,
right?
Right.

303
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.080
It's the first version.
So

304
00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:31.330
<v 2>what did we make up Donald Chicken?
I mean,
that is the first version.</v>

305
00:19:31.331 --> 00:19:34.300
And then we,
you know,
by then we will know,

306
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:39.940
I know enough about different genes that
we might be able to,

307
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.060
you know,
version two could look an awful lot,

308
00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.170
an awful lot closer to a velociraptor.
Here we go.

309
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.060
<v 1>Um,
but it,
but it was an interesting thing.
Um,
you know,
it's still,</v>

310
00:19:51.061 --> 00:19:52.080
it's never going to be,

311
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.530
we're never going to have a velociraptor whenever we're going to have a version

312
00:19:55.531 --> 00:20:00.000
of the ancestral,
you know,
qualities of it.
But that's something I think they,

313
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.640
after you of the characters actually expressing Jurassic parks,
they go,
no,

314
00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:04.110
these aren't dinosaurs.

315
00:20:04.111 --> 00:20:07.860
These are whatever things you've mixed with them to bring dinosaurs to life.

316
00:20:07.861 --> 00:20:08.694
So it's a,

317
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.500
<v 2>it's why we have in dominance rex,
the</v>

318
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.520
<v 1>super amazing Badass and Tom Finisterre definitely,
which we want,</v>

319
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.410
which to me

320
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:24.080
<v 2>it's actually the most plausible thing that we've made in Jurassic Park so far.</v>

321
00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.950
I think about that.
It is,

322
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.760
we know that we can't get dinosaurs back from DNA,
right?

323
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:37.070
But we can make a hybrid.
I mean,
we make transgenic animals right now.

324
00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.210
Um,
we definitely change,
you know,
we,

325
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.490
we genetically engineer all sorts of things.

326
00:20:43.491 --> 00:20:47.280
I mean if you all these funny little dog Chihuahuas,
you know,

327
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:52.120
I mean they are genetically modified wolves.
That's what they are.

328
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:57.870
And so breeding is one of the biological modification tools that we use to

329
00:20:59.141 --> 00:21:03.850
change how an animal looks already.
And then transgenic engineering,

330
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.150
which an example is making glow fish.

331
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.850
So we take genes out of,
uh,

332
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:15.460
a jellyfish and stick them in a zebra fish and make them glow.

333
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.830
And now we know that we can do that with anything.
I mean,
you can,

334
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:19.670
<v 0>yeah,</v>

335
00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:23.300
<v 2>you could do it with a human if you want it to do you mean seriously?</v>

336
00:21:23.301 --> 00:21:27.770
You just stick it in the embryo.
And so we've got glowing,

337
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.910
we've got glow in the dark cats,
rabbits,
you name it.

338
00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.170
You can make anything glow in the dark by doing transgenic engineering.

339
00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.940
And that's the whole idea of in dominance Rex's is to make it,

340
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:45.440
it's just basically genetic transgenic hybrid,

341
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:50.420
which we already know how to do.
So if we could get dinosaurs back,

342
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:51.830
we could make a dominance rex,

343
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:57.900
<v 1>I think I would have a lot more consequences then you want to happen.
But,
um,</v>

344
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.560
no,
it's,
I don't spoil it for people haven't seen it yet.
Um,
you know,
it's,

345
00:22:02.561 --> 00:22:05.850
it is sort of this thing,
you know,
they say in the book,

346
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.130
the mix it with tree frogs.
You're,
uh,
the DNA with tree frogs.
You know,

347
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.840
we're talking about engineering a chicken dinosaur,
like non Avian.
Um,

348
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.140
so what's,
where do you see the future of the field going?

349
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:17.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

350
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.710
<v 1>Like feature of a Paleontology Ology?
Only because,
you know,
it's,</v>

351
00:22:22.711 --> 00:22:25.570
it's evolved in the sense that like,
it used to be,
oh preserve,
you know,

352
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.310
we want things for museums now it's like,

353
00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:29.500
let's cut it open and let's see what's inside.
That's right.

354
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.770
<v 2>That's what we do.
Yes.
Um,</v>

355
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:36.830
so we will continue to cut things open and learn all sorts of new things as far

356
00:22:36.991 --> 00:22:41.510
as,
you know,
our genetic engineering efforts.

357
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:45.950
You know,
I as wacky and wild as it sounds.
I mean,

358
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.020
we could start making some,
no,
I keep,
you know,

359
00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.460
I throw this out.
So since we can make glow in the dark animals,

360
00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.780
we could actually make it glow in the dark unicorn.

361
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:01.443
<v 0>Okay.</v>

362
00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.710
<v 2>Why not?
Right.
Fine.
The Unicorn,</v>

363
00:23:03.711 --> 00:23:07.400
it actual idea Unicorn would actually be easier than the dyno check in.
I mean,

364
00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:12.850
it's just a horse with a thing on his head right then and it turns out there's

365
00:23:14.211 --> 00:23:15.770
actually,
they're actually

366
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.273
<v 0>mmm</v>

367
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:22.280
<v 2>ossicones on or even drafts if you ever look at a draft really.</v>

368
00:23:22.281 --> 00:23:26.810
Plus it actually has a horn in the mill.
It's a horny structure and,

369
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.360
and modifiable.

370
00:23:29.361 --> 00:23:33.320
So I actually think we could make a unicorn pretty easily.

371
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.310
<v 1>Yeah.
Make a lot of navy wanted art</v>

372
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.070
as if one feature wasn't good enough.
Let's make it glow in the dark.

373
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.810
So the chicken to stores,
like you mentioned before,

374
00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.670
it's not just about the discovery in especially like the tail thing.

375
00:23:46.671 --> 00:23:49.730
It involves a lot of,
the spine involves a lot of,
um,

376
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:54.850
sort of discovering at what points in development do these things happen.
Um,

377
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.120
could you talk a little bit about the Applique,

378
00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:59.560
more about the applications to as bipeds.

379
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.063
<v 0>I don't know.</v>

380
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.430
<v 2>Everyone's worried about the applicant.
You know,
why going,</v>

381
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:10.900
why make it dynamite chicken?

382
00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.293
<v 0>Well,
you know,</v>

383
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.980
<v 2>I don't think I have to say that to anybody in here.
Actually.</v>

384
00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:18.830
I think all of you know why we want a dial chicken,
right?

385
00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.630
Because this is going to be fun.
I mean that's just so,

386
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.410
it's all there is to it and all the kids are going to like it.

387
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.210
But there's a lot of,
you know,

388
00:24:26.211 --> 00:24:29.690
people who are grownups that always say what good is it?

389
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.400
What would you do it for?
Well,
you know,
as I was saying,
you know,

390
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:39.020
learning how learning what different genes do and how to turn them on and how to

391
00:24:39.021 --> 00:24:43.400
turn them off as huge application in the medical field.
And so,
you know,

392
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.790
and quite frankly,
you know,

393
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:51.870
genetics is extremely boring and nobody wants,
you know,

394
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.090
nobody ever goes to college studied genetics that I can,
I can imagine.

395
00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.550
I mean it's just awful.
So,

396
00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.970
so at least if you thought you could make a dyno check in,
you know,
had to be,

397
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.040
it sounds like it'd be pretty interesting.
So you know,

398
00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:08.840
and if you can think and start thinking about making new kinds of animals be,

399
00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:11.060
rather than,
you know,
bigger tomatoes,

400
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:18.420
it's at least a good way to get kids interested in a pretty boring science.

401
00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.330
<v 1>I'm not going to go so far as call it boring.
I do think it gives,
you know,</v>

402
00:25:25.331 --> 00:25:26.710
it's an interesting tangible,

403
00:25:26.711 --> 00:25:30.010
visible presentation of these are some applications of it.

404
00:25:30.011 --> 00:25:31.270
Think of what you could think of.

405
00:25:31.271 --> 00:25:35.910
You can have your uncle and the dark unicorn that's right on the dark Donald

406
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.280
chicken.
Even better.
Do we have any questions?

407
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.110
I'm going to come into the mic.

408
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.260
<v 3>Hello.
I'm Alex.
I'm kind,</v>

409
00:25:48.261 --> 00:25:53.261
kinda curious to know your thoughts on the usage of this genetic research in

410
00:25:53.361 --> 00:25:54.290
animal conservation.

411
00:25:54.291 --> 00:25:58.800
Considering the northern black rhino just last week when extinct,
um,
do,

412
00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:02.570
has there been any kind of like conference between your research groups and

413
00:26:02.571 --> 00:26:05.940
other research groups in the animal conservation to,
to use this,
uh,

414
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.930
developing technology to preserve these jeans and,
uh,
a very,
uh,

415
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.820
precise manner so that maybe in the future with technology technological

416
00:26:13.821 --> 00:26:18.200
increased,
we can bring these animals that we had alive back from extinction

417
00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:23.530
<v 2>and kill de extinction is a wholly different thing.
Um,</v>

418
00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:25.470
de Extinction,
the Da,

419
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.740
then there are a lot of de extinction projects going on right now.

420
00:26:28.741 --> 00:26:33.030
They're trying to get the passenger pigeon back it,
trying to get the,
um,

421
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.330
the,
uh,
Tasmanian Wolf back.
Um,

422
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:39.330
we're trying to get the mammoth elephant back,

423
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.180
all of which were probably wiped out by humans.

424
00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:49.360
The Dodo bird who know,
I don't know if we need a Dodo but,
but,

425
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.733
but uh,

426
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:59.330
de extinction in order to get them back does require DNA and it requires enough

427
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.010
to put it to inject in the cell and,

428
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:09.980
and make an animal such as,
uh,

429
00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.470
as,
as a mammoth elephant,

430
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.400
which is pretty plausible and it's pretty plausible because we have elephants.

431
00:27:19.901 --> 00:27:22.500
So,
so chances are pretty good if we have a

432
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.020
chunk of DNA,
at least a pretty good chunk of one,

433
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:30.330
and then we add it to elephant DNA,

434
00:27:30.331 --> 00:27:33.840
we're going to get some kind of a hairy elephant of,
I'm sorry,

435
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:36.420
with the Rhino,

436
00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:42.050
actually we have their complete DNA and we have it preserved.

437
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:47.330
So as soon as we figure out how to clone DNA,

438
00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:49.740
we can do that.

439
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:54.990
But right now what we would end up doing is taking that complete strand of DNA

440
00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:59.310
and sticking it in one of the non extinct rhinos.

441
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.780
And it still would be some kind of combination.
And that's the problem.

442
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:08.610
We don't,
we,
we rely right now on,

443
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:13.910
on a cloning technology that involves a particular kind of cell from a

444
00:28:15.241 --> 00:28:16.560
particular kind of animal.

445
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:22.500
And we don't know how to take an individual strand of DNA and make it make

446
00:28:22.501 --> 00:28:26.490
something.
We don't know how to do that yet,
but one weekend and then we can,

447
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.360
we could probably bring back a number of things that are going extinct,

448
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:32.070
but it breaks down too quick.

449
00:28:32.071 --> 00:28:36.930
So going back and sort of bringing things back from very deep time is going to

450
00:28:36.931 --> 00:28:40.140
be impossible and I mean impossible.

451
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:45.320
Not maybe someday it's just because you're never going to get us complete strand

452
00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:54.140
of DNA from anything much older than even probably a few hundred years.

453
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.400
<v 4>Hi,
thanks for coming in.
Um,
I just wanted to add a comment first about,</v>

454
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:07.760
um,
glowing unicorns going in the dark unicorns.

455
00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:12.230
We have the same kind of problem in computer science where it can seem really

456
00:29:12.231 --> 00:29:16.340
dull to get people interested in it,
especially in ads.

457
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:21.590
So we have,
um,
so we have machine learning to kind of,

458
00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.100
you know,
excite people,
artificial intelligence,
the thought of potentially,

459
00:29:25.101 --> 00:29:27.230
you know,
robots in the future.

460
00:29:27.231 --> 00:29:31.040
So that's our glowing unicorn equivalent in our field.
Um,

461
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:34.560
I was wondering,
so when I was growing up,
um,
the,

462
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:38.810
the science at the time was saying that there was a big extinction event

463
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.190
involving dinosaurs,

464
00:29:40.191 --> 00:29:43.660
but I've heard more recently that maybe it wasn't extinction at all.

465
00:29:43.661 --> 00:29:46.990
Maybe it was just evolution.
Um,
what's the,

466
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.260
like what's the,
what's the consensus now?

467
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:55.370
<v 2>Okay.
Extinction event.
Okay.
I downplay it myself</v>

468
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:59.870
at the end of most museum exhibits.
There's,
you know,

469
00:29:59.871 --> 00:30:04.700
a big thing about the media are coming down in Gel and everything off.

470
00:30:04.701 --> 00:30:08.550
And I just have a burden because of it.
You know,
I,

471
00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.310
I just basically don't think about extinction because,

472
00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:18.110
you know,
we,
we're,
we classify animals,
right?

473
00:30:18.111 --> 00:30:21.620
So we put them in the categories and then we say,
Oh,

474
00:30:21.621 --> 00:30:26.160
look at that category goes extinct.
And you know,
it's just,

475
00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:31.700
birds are just fine and birds are dinosaurs.
So it seems kind of weird.

476
00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:35.990
But,
but uh,
but no,
the all,

477
00:30:35.991 --> 00:30:40.670
so we separate them now into non avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs.

478
00:30:40.671 --> 00:30:45.470
So all birds are avian dinosaurs and all the ones that went extinct or non avian

479
00:30:45.471 --> 00:30:50.471
dinosaurs and non avian dinosaurs didn't go extinct by some catastrophic event

480
00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:52.413
probably,

481
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:54.843
<v 0>although</v>

482
00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.610
<v 2>it might be some heightened out in Africa.</v>

483
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.120
<v 4>Um,
with this kind of research,</v>

484
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:10.680
always have people who have ethical quandaries regarding this kind of,
um,

485
00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:13.340
development over time.

486
00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.670
What would you say to people who have these kind of ethical quandaries about how

487
00:31:16.671 --> 00:31:21.671
this could be applied medically or two people or bad science kind of thing?

488
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:23.490
Yeah,

489
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:24.330
<v 2>yeah.
I,</v>

490
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:30.030
I was just in London a few days ago and there was someone who stood up and was

491
00:31:30.031 --> 00:31:33.960
very adamant about talking about where you draw a line.

492
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.920
And I was thinking,
you know,
that that's a,

493
00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:41.850
it's an odd question and that's an odd question to a scientist because we have

494
00:31:41.851 --> 00:31:44.490
no way of figuring out where I draw a line.
I mean,

495
00:31:44.491 --> 00:31:48.210
it's lines are personal preference.
I mean,
I,

496
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.070
I think science,

497
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:55.050
I think scientists need to discover everything that's possible to discover.

498
00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:00.300
Now,
a lot of it might have bad consequences,
but if,

499
00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:05.160
if we draw a line and say,
okay,
we're not going to study this particular thing,

500
00:32:05.161 --> 00:32:06.690
but somebody in some other country,

501
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.720
it doesn't have that same line and they make something that's dangerous to us,

502
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:15.750
but we've never figured out a way to deal with it or done.

503
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:20.670
So you know,
we need,
I think we need to learn how to do everything.

504
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:24.090
And then when it comes to these animals,
I mean again,

505
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.700
nobody drew a line and said,
whoa,
we shouldn't make it Chihuahua.
But you know,

506
00:32:29.701 --> 00:32:33.330
somebody could have,
I mean it's just,
I,

507
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.800
I just don't think there's,

508
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:39.350
I don't think there's any particular reason to draw any kind of align that.

509
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:43.360
But that's my personal preference.
Also.
It doesn't,

510
00:32:43.361 --> 00:32:46.540
a lot of it gets sort of sensationalized.
Like we,
we test on mice,
we test,

511
00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:50.020
we test it on fruit flies,
fruit flies and Mites nurse that same thing.

512
00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.840
But we are doing sort of experimentation on all of ways.

513
00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:57.280
It's beer ranting on animals and plants.
I mean everything or

514
00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:04.500
drawing aligners.
It's just a,
it's an interesting concept.

515
00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:11.670
<v 5>So you mentioned that a,
if you took two dyno checkins and made them,</v>

516
00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:12.750
you would get a chicken.

517
00:33:12.751 --> 00:33:17.160
So I'm guessing that you are altering just the expression of genes by chemicals

518
00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:20.880
in the MRI.
I'm not their DNA.
That's not their DNA.
Have you considered,
okay,

519
00:33:20.881 --> 00:33:24.420
what we're going to take the DNA that we know in an alligator makes the tail

520
00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:26.130
splice it in and then hey,

521
00:33:26.131 --> 00:33:29.520
we'd actually have to die no chickens that would make dyno check ins or whatever

522
00:33:29.521 --> 00:33:30.350
else.

523
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.530
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

524
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.810
<v 2>yeah.
No,
I,
um,
I would,</v>

525
00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:38.090
once we sort of have some idea how to make a dental checkup,

526
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:43.460
um,
I,
it's kind of a pain in the butt,
the,
you know,

527
00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:47.070
to make one at a time.
So if we could change their DNA,
that'd be good.

528
00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.590
So we're good.
Make them go.
So they make themselves,

529
00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:58.080
<v 3>so I guess as a consultant on the Jurassic Park films,</v>

530
00:33:58.081 --> 00:34:03.040
you have a lot of insight into how the movie portrays dinosaurs.
Uh,

531
00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:04.320
do you think in general,

532
00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:09.210
movies have been good for the paleontology industry and getting people excited

533
00:34:09.211 --> 00:34:09.930
about it?

534
00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:13.950
Or do you think it's had a lot of negative consequences by the way that it

535
00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:15.720
portrays and maybe wrongly?

536
00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:20.420
<v 2>Yeah,
I don't think it has any negative at all.
I mean,
when I,</v>

537
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:25.860
in 1993 when Jurassic Park came out and before Jurassic Park one came out,

538
00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:31.080
I had,
I dunno,
three graduate students,

539
00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.230
guys,
three graduate student guys.

540
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:39.950
When Jurassic Park came out just after it.
Yeah.
Came out,
I had an,

541
00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:40.993
I had,

542
00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:45.520
I had incredible numbers of people trying to get into the program.

543
00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:50.290
I ended up with 18 almost instantly and it was 50,

544
00:34:50.291 --> 00:34:52.730
50 women and guys,

545
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:58.020
so I know what that,
what that movie did and it,
you know,

546
00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:02.030
no one was talking about,
you know,
the dinosaurs not having feathers.

547
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:05.740
We have time for one more question.

548
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:12.430
<v 3>Do you have any sense of how small the population of dinosaurs survive the</v>

549
00:35:13.371 --> 00:35:15.740
potential extinction event that led to modern birds?

550
00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:16.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

551
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:21.530
<v 2>Actually the animals that led to modern birds,
we're doing very well.</v>

552
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.770
Early on it wasn't the extinct one.

553
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:27.020
It wasn't a group of extinct dinosaurs.

554
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:33.750
That's not the right way to put it in.
Uh,
birds evolved back in the,

555
00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.890
in the Jurassic period long before the,

556
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.190
and so they were actually doing pretty well and a lot of,

557
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.760
obviously a lot of birds went extinct as well.
Um,
but,

558
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:50.780
but,
um,
obviously the,
the ones that made it through the,

559
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:54.840
the little what they were all little birds,
probably Robin's lies,

560
00:35:54.841 --> 00:35:58.850
things that we have very little fossil record of,
um,

561
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:03.720
are the ones that gave rise to basically all of the burdens that we have now.

562
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:10.430
Great.
But they had,
they were very far along.

563
00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:16.120
One of the things that's really hard to imagine is just the amount of time

564
00:36:16.341 --> 00:36:17.630
that's involved,
you know,

565
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:22.990
from the late Jurassic to the extinction period of time is,

566
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:29.650
is more time than has existed since the extinction of dinosaurs and til now.

567
00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.140
So,
I mean,
we just have these,
you know,

568
00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.710
huge spans of time to evolve all sorts of things.

569
00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.750
I have a new dinosaur I'm trying to name right now and that's,

570
00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.970
that's something weird characteristics.
I think it's,

571
00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:47.660
its head is full of these incredible,
um,

572
00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:53.860
nerve bundles and there's no animal on this earth that looks anything like this.

573
00:36:56.451 --> 00:36:58.040
I,
so,
I mean,

574
00:36:58.041 --> 00:37:02.120
there's not even a good way to guess what this animal was doing unless I was

575
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.130
telepathic.
I mean,

576
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:07.730
it's just really odd characteristics.

577
00:37:07.731 --> 00:37:10.550
And we see this in a lot of these dinosaurs.
I mean,
there's just,

578
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:14.440
they just had so long to evolve.
They've got these things that,

579
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.860
these characteristics that are so different than animals alive today.

580
00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.860
That's why,
you know,
you could make all kinds of stuff for Jurassic Park.
I mean,

581
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:28.580
we could just come up with wild,
crazy ideas,

582
00:37:28.581 --> 00:37:32.000
even for ones that probably did exist,
let alone the ones that we can.

583
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:36.930
Manufacturer
dinosaurs are cool.

584
00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.700
<v 0>Dancers are very cool.
