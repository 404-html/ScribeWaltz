00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.420
Hello everyone.
Welcome to talks at Google.

2
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.050
It is my pleasure today to welcome Jackie.

3
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.330
<v 0>Okay,</v>

4
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.080
<v 1>thank you.
Thanks for being here.
What?
We're here to talk about the foreigner.
Yes.</v>

5
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.310
Which is a very exciting and,

6
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:38.310
and dark and kind of intense new movie that you're in.

7
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.973
<v 2>But the light,</v>

8
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.060
I just want to change something and let the audience knows,
not regular use.

9
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.880
Jackie Chan.
Uh,

10
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.650
this difference is not comedy action isn't serious.

11
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.520
I want to show the audience and the actor.

12
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.110
<v 0>Yeah.
You see the movie yet?
No,
no answer.</v>

13
00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:04.140
[inaudible] my note to myself was like,
he's never made me so sad.

14
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.623
It's really upsetting.

15
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.380
<v 2>Doing an action comedy for more than 50 years and for the last 10 years I tried</v>

16
00:01:15.191 --> 00:01:18.880
to change you.
Let the audience know I'm the actor,
not the actually stop.

17
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.480
So I try very hard to make car.
The Kid,

18
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.710
the kid,
uh,
dragon blade,
you know,
slowly sort of let the audience know,
uh,

19
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.940
he's not the action star.
He's an active,
but they'll help you fight this off.

20
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.323
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.090
<v 1>And also so your costars Pierce Brosnan,</v>

22
00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:42.020
who is also very intense actor and we're also used to seeing him in a very super

23
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:44.660
swaps by way and I feel like your guys' roles were a little reverse and we

24
00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:45.830
actually had a clip of it.

25
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.950
<v 0>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.480
<v 3>I've been affiliated with the IRS for 30 years.
When I was,</v>

27
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.400
I fought hard against the violence.

28
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.150
I went to prison for what I did and peered my doubt.
No,

29
00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:02.250
I served the politics of both sides,

30
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.900
trying to heal the wounds and bridge the divide again,

31
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.370
my sincere condolences.
There's nothing I can do.

32
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.390
What if your wife and daughter were killed by Paul?

33
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.500
<v 0>Okay.</v>

34
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.870
<v 3>Do everything in my power to get justice.</v>

35
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.560
So I for choosing you,
Mr Hennessy,

36
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.250
you would tell me who kill my child again,

37
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.073
<v 0>I don't know.</v>

38
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.010
<v 3>You will change your mind.</v>

39
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.890
<v 2>Thank you for seeing me.</v>

40
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.860
<v 0>I think we're going to have a great [inaudible].</v>

41
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.750
<v 2>My friends tell me usually what my movie,
everybody</v>

42
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.950
quiet.
Just

43
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.750
<v 4>just like that
brings some tissue.</v>

44
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.220
<v 1>What was your first reaction upon reading the script?</v>

45
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.020
<v 2>There was seven years ago.
It's no,
yeah,
seven years ago.
I read the script,</v>

46
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.920
I like it very much.

47
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:28.921
And also the writer is a Jackie only you can do that character because you

48
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:33.580
should be by the book is called a Chinaman.

49
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.590
Then I loved so much Jen and a writer,

50
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.150
he won't let go.
He wanted to be a director.
And so a lot of studio said,
no,

51
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.820
you're,
you're too new.
We are not rest.

52
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:49.730
This kind of budget you're looking for a director for.

53
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.920
And later on there's so many politic,
you know.

54
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.770
I said,
okay,
forget it.
Then I go back to China,
they make my own film later on.

55
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.920
Then STX bring,
he wanted to work with me and I said,
why didn't you stop him?

56
00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:06.820
It's foreigner and they,

57
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.980
they saw of all the politics and the teams and everybody,

58
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.610
everybody gets a little bit money and okay,
let's make the film.

59
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.180
<v 1>Exactly.
So the things that were,
but Martin Campbell ended up tracking it.</v>

60
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:21.570
It was great when he did go nine with Pierce Brosnan.

61
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.640
<v 2>The first,
I want to be a,</v>

62
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.420
I want to be a direct myself and if I'm direct,

63
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:29.780
I'm not that old.
My younger.
Yeah.

64
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.130
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

65
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.670
<v 2>Yolanda,
big action jumping around.</v>

66
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.940
I was a 40 something years old and they don't just sold too many English and the

67
00:04:44.641 --> 00:04:47.250
filming,
uh,
in,
in,
in London,

68
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.440
I think I might not understand a lot of English.
Why don't I find that?

69
00:04:52.441 --> 00:04:55.150
I read too.
So we,
we,
we find that I read,

70
00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.330
they introduced Mike Martin Campbell.
Then of course I know him and I said,

71
00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:01.440
yeah,
it's good.

72
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.120
You know when we hired him then we do the casting,

73
00:05:06.121 --> 00:05:08.250
we do the makeup,
then

74
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.840
it takes me when they have our makeup checky are not always

75
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.220
<v 4>[inaudible] check it.</v>

76
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.840
Yeah.
Not Jackie Chan,
you are gone.
I said okay.

77
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.020
Sometimes you don't want to move [inaudible]

78
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.890
<v 1>it's interesting because you are playing a slightly older character and centered</v>

79
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.030
versatile choreographer and action star that how do you approach,
you know,

80
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:48.040
choreographing for our character who is supposed to be

81
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.590
<v 2>older?
Yes.
We'd have to because my,
my,</v>

82
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.370
my character is like a special force and like a navy suit and know a lot of

83
00:05:57.711 --> 00:06:00.680
skill and those,
those kind of actions you couldn't,

84
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:05.660
it's not like it used to be checking up fast.
It's more like a killing things

85
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.960
and also you have to watch my age.
Then after use,
uh,

86
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.240
my trick and technique and to,
to,
to win the battery.
Yeah.

87
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.210
<v 1>Speaking of,
we have one of your battles</v>

88
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.830
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

89
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.073
nope.

90
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.163
Huh?

91
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.200
Used to be

92
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.540
<v 2>I'm over it.
I had to pretend boom.
Okay.</v>

93
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.473
<v 0>Uh,</v>

94
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.770
I have a pretender.

95
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.290
<v 2>Pretend.
Oh,</v>

96
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.750
<v 0>every time I pass the camera,
how do</v>

97
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.360
I have to do these kinds of,

98
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.910
<v 2>you make the audience believe I'm,
I'm old.</v>

99
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.220
<v 0>Huh?</v>

100
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.750
<v 1>You did a great job acting it because like you Finna hurt,
you know,</v>

101
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.310
you seem to be hurting stents in choreography before this.
I was like,
is he okay?

102
00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.130
Like you really took a beating in this lot or your character takes a beating in

103
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:03.964
this one

104
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.020
<v 2>and,
and very difficult.</v>

105
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.660
Even the very simple action sequence is so difficult to fight.
Why?

106
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.770
Because the director hired the act to really know how to act,

107
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.300
but they don't know how to fight.
That's the problem.
Um,

108
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.960
when did you d

109
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:26.423
<v 0>relax</v>

110
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:33.440
<v 2>on up on again?
Pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop.
Okay.
Real action.</v>

111
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.210
I have to on this tech,
teach them how,
how to be a action.

112
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.110
Sometime you will know you,
you,
you know how to fight,

113
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.280
but you do this kind of fun.
You get hurt but it doesn't look good.
Yeah.

114
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.450
You'll have to know the rhythm.
The timing is very important.

115
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.330
<v 1>So what's your process like when you are starting to choreograph and you've seen</v>

116
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.940
out,
like where do you,
do you start with the script?
Do you

117
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.830
<v 2>uh,
what kind of like rush hour.
Okay.</v>

118
00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:04.831
Then we know it's a common about happy go lucky and this kind of fighting is a

119
00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:11.730
tough and serious and it's not like Russia fighting.

120
00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:12.760
Yeah,

121
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.910
<v 4>it's very much,
well</v>

122
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:17.431
<v 1>how do you,</v>

123
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:20.520
how do you kind of continue to innovate because you've been onscreen for such an

124
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:23.340
amazing amount of time,
but you always seem to bring something new to the table.

125
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:24.760
Like where do you get your idea?
This round?

126
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.390
<v 4>I'm just thinking every day he might not drive for,
he had 45 minutes.</v>

127
00:09:28.391 --> 00:09:31.750
I'm on a car.
I didn't think about this of idea really.

128
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.700
<v 2>When you go the location of vacation,
you go to the</v>

129
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.430
whatever.
And you take a photo with,
I always can I jump from here?

130
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.040
<v 4>Oh,
come here.
I just where I can shit.</v>

131
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.310
I don't know why he's just,
everything for me is the movies.
Yeah.
That's awesome.

132
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.720
Yeah.
I think that's probably why you continue to,
you know,

133
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.840
push the boundaries of what we watch.

134
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.780
<v 2>No,
I just,
I don't know why.</v>

135
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.700
So all my mind is a script,
script,
script,
Ashland afternoon,
stunned.

136
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.130
How can you use,
uh,
uh,
those kinds of Chia becoming a weapon.

137
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.240
<v 0>I look it up.</v>

138
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.230
<v 2>I never saw doing those kinds of extra,
well what can we do?</v>

139
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.710
These kinds of things.
So you just to hold the guy when grab me,

140
00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:26.910
then I pushed back.
Boom.
The 200.

141
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.350
<v 0>Yeah.
These kinds of things.</v>

142
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.830
I've been looking for everything in my life.

143
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.860
<v 2>I,
my head is a action sequence.</v>

144
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.160
<v 1>So when you,
when you have,
you know,</v>

145
00:10:38.161 --> 00:10:39.630
you have all these amazing ideas in your head,

146
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.490
but then you also are working with,
you know,

147
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.450
a team of people and you have to collaborate.
So how did,

148
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.720
how did you and like Martin work together,
how did,

149
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.840
how did that kind of come together on the same page to start or where your style

150
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.370
<v 2>different showing that in a minute,
which is awesome.
Module.</v>

151
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:56.520
How long has the fight that went from seven time,
you know,
my movie,

152
00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.560
21 half hour.
Keep fighting.

153
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:00.840
<v 0>I never die</v>

154
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.340
when they come to us.
I learned

155
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.070
<v 2>this timing speed.
Uh,
sometime you fight a five minute,</v>

156
00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.980
32nd,
10 minutes,
something like that.

157
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.750
Then we decided on a sequence show marquis then too long,

158
00:11:16.751 --> 00:11:20.680
too short and show the camera man showed a prop props.

159
00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.960
We just for,
for us,
it's so easy.

160
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.820
You know what we've been filming

161
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.200
all my life actually film actually the sequence.

162
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.510
<v 4>When you say you show them,</v>

163
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:36.960
does that mean you actually like block it out and then you'll show it?
Show it?

164
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:37.710
Yeah.

165
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:42.390
<v 2>I have a 17 yeah.
Each team.
Some,
some TV in China.</v>

166
00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:46.050
So I'm keeping Lyndon some team in Hong Kong.

167
00:11:46.051 --> 00:11:49.480
We were choreograph a lot of things you would put together to show Marty.
Yeah,

168
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.520
<v 4>we have one more fight.
Was there last climb?
Oh,
that's a good,</v>

169
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.513
that's a really one.

170
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:28.973
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

171
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.780
<v 1>What was the most challenging scene to film for this one?</v>

172
00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.570
<v 2>I think every time making an American film mode.
Challenges in English,
you know,</v>

173
00:13:11.571 --> 00:13:15.110
it's so difficult.
No action acting for me.

174
00:13:15.111 --> 00:13:18.320
Easy on the set.
The English is so difficult.

175
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.970
No special in some time do you have it have just be

176
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.090
a cup of tea?

177
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.573
<v 0>Perfect.</v>

178
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.373
<v 2>Of course.</v>

179
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.890
<v 0>I think</v>

180
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:36.151
<v 2>yes.</v>

181
00:13:36.151 --> 00:13:41.151
A difficult and also making a American film or the challenge is the timing,

182
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.360
the budget and the schedule.
No,

183
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.460
not making my,
my own feeling when I'm making my own films.

184
00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:57.040
I cannot finish today and puffiness another day we get finish.

185
00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.720
Not that they didn't another day.
Make sure the scene are good,

186
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.830
but making American film,
you've got to finish today.
Otherwise the bomb coming,

187
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.430
she'll rinse.
Coming at that drives me crazy,

188
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.240
so that's why sometime I,

189
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:18.240
okay.
I sometime it just,

190
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:22.530
I just asked that you want him to go film or you,
you want to make a good film?

191
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.480
I want to make a foot film.
Some stuff.

192
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:31.230
Some I see some people they just want the on schedule,
on budget,

193
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.950
make the film.
No,
that's wrong.
That's wrong.

194
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.860
<v 1>Do you think when you work with directors that you kind of bring your work ethic</v>

195
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:40.420
and style and that they adopt that?

196
00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:42.700
Because I feel like you're such a professional that working with you,

197
00:14:42.701 --> 00:14:46.780
like you kind of have to learn to do that.
That's the problem.

198
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:51.440
<v 2>When I'm making a film,
you s you still on the set,
you can,
you do nothing.</v>

199
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.680
Moved.
Uh,
moved the chair.
Stop.

200
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.620
Don't do it.
Props guys.

201
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.530
We have a 20 people on the surrounded.
You just moved to,

202
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.730
no,
you have to wait for the prop guy 20 miles

203
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.770
and bring the,
bring the water away.
There's too many rules,

204
00:15:17.771 --> 00:15:22.210
but sometime you have to follow the rules.
And myself,

205
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.600
we don't have the rules on the set.
I'm the camera man.
I'm the lighting guy.

206
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.150
I'm the prop guy.
I'm the director,
I'm the writer.
I'm stunned.
Connie died,

207
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:33.640
do anything.
Everything.
Even my stunt team,
we do everything on a sec.

208
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:38.290
We are included but in us do like a photo American roots.

209
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.610
So this why when I'm making American food sometime on the set,
I ah,

210
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:48.670
ah,
you know,
this does hold up.
Yeah.

211
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.160
<v 1>I mean I think for a character like this,</v>

212
00:15:51.161 --> 00:15:53.900
does that actually play into your character here?
Right.
Because you,

213
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.610
you're frustrated as a character,
you're building all this tension,
you know,

214
00:15:57.611 --> 00:16:01.840
your character is in a terrible position and like no one's helping him.

215
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.270
Do you kind of channel into that if you're acting in this

216
00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.540
<v 2>exactly the same.</v>

217
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:12.980
And I just follow the,
the actor to too.

218
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:18.670
So you fly in the movie from no tear and do the tear comes up and have to speak

219
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:26.350
English is not my mother language and I have to remember the dialogue and I

220
00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:30.800
remember the,
the,
the,
the,
the actor,
what he's saying,
what,
when is my turn?

221
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.130
I think my tears coming up going,
I pretend prying.

222
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.880
Then I a pretty good actor.

223
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.530
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

224
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.460
<v 1>the most interesting to me about this one is that I don't think there was a</v>

225
00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:46.290
fight till about like 30 minutes in.

226
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.820
And I think we're so used to seeing you jumped into action.

227
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.670
It was such an interesting and you kind of unexpected thing to see you build to

228
00:16:53.671 --> 00:16:56.310
this fight.
And when it made,
when the first bike does come on,

229
00:16:56.311 --> 00:16:57.710
it's so much more intense because of it.

230
00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:01.550
<v 2>This kind of movie,
you cannot fight too much.
Otherwise,
the audience belief,</v>

231
00:17:01.551 --> 00:17:05.920
why can you see my character jumped into Skype up above them.

232
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.370
I told us we had to 17 pounds.
Oh No,

233
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.060
you'd have to my,
exactly my,
my,
my character,

234
00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:18.580
I get hit and even a piece,
somebody I kept bit more then I lie down,

235
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.330
but I just use my tricks.
Uh,
my,
my,
my,
my,

236
00:17:23.331 --> 00:17:27.330
my experience too.
When the,
the,
the fighting,
uh,

237
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:32.360
except Layla parity.
Then you look at the art.
That's the real,
the real movie,

238
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.370
the real things.
Otherwise,
if I can,
uh,
some are sober,

239
00:17:37.371 --> 00:17:42.270
we'll do this summer.
So no,
it's not like these kind of the,
the,
the coronagraph.

240
00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.000
Yup.

241
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.860
<v 1>What do you think you admired most about kwan</v>

242
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.380
<v 2>humble?
Uh,</v>

243
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:58.500
<v 1>[inaudible] she's a little quieter than Mosley.</v>

244
00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:01.983
Empire.

245
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:06.750
<v 5>Yeah.
On this set.
On a set.
I'm an on the,
when they're filming,</v>

246
00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:10.920
I'm on the set and I helping everybody and helping your new talent and helping

247
00:18:10.921 --> 00:18:15.370
my stunt stunt team and,
and helping the home.
Oh Ho,
Ho,
Ho,

248
00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.490
Ho the whom movie.

249
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.470
Everything except in front of the audience.
I know you want to do it.
Say Listen,

250
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.190
a lot of things I try to bring up all the things you,
you,
you,
you,

251
00:18:26.191 --> 00:18:31.050
you like to hear and everything I speed is true.
I never make up the things.

252
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:36.270
Yeah.
All those years.
And that's me exactly like one.
Yeah.

253
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:40.260
<v 1>You,
you also produce it.
So it does that,
like when you aren't producing a film,</v>

254
00:18:40.261 --> 00:18:43.330
do you get as involved in every step of it or is that just kind of built into

255
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:47.460
who you are and you just,
you know,
long story

256
00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:58.010
<v 5>when,
when I'm making a film sometime I know that editing is wrong.</v>

257
00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:04.160
Uh,
I mean editing myself 40 years and I do everything.

258
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.370
It's,
this is not like a American,

259
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.390
they have a director adding direct to

260
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:17.750
camera director,
director,
just so many director.

261
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:21.470
When I'm making a film,
I'm the director and the art director.

262
00:19:21.471 --> 00:19:25.130
I'm editing director and I do everything.
We don't have a money.

263
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.460
People have to do it with my own things.

264
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:33.320
So this is why you see the Chucky and own film.
Terrible Act.

265
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.010
Our directive.
Terrible camera movement.

266
00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:41.590
We don't want more money to fired Crenn and Dodie.
We use a wheelchair.
We use it.

267
00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.120
We use a ladder,

268
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:49.330
but I learned so many things after I went to come do a u s wow.

269
00:19:49.371 --> 00:19:51.080
I see all the camera equipment.

270
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:56.380
Then I learned more so this why sometime like,

271
00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.310
<v 0>oh,
okay,</v>

272
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.790
<v 5>movie like drunken master police story.
Whatever they they,</v>

273
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.670
they bought it.
Come to us.
They have the recap.

274
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:14.350
We dump sound,
everything.
I said,

275
00:20:14.351 --> 00:20:16.300
why I do the best I can.

276
00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.110
Why you have to recut Caribou editing.

277
00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.180
Terrible.

278
00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:27.010
You can compare to to my editing and it's okay.

279
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:32.090
I believe that's American.
Okay.
I trust the,
the,
the,

280
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.000
the,
the editing guy.
I trust the,
the,
the,

281
00:20:35.001 --> 00:20:38.980
the sound guy because that's the way American people like it.

282
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.230
Sometime I asked the American fence,
no,
we don't lie.
American virtue.

283
00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.220
We like tried to virgin my own version.
So later on they find out,

284
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.690
oh they need a job.

285
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:54.680
<v 4>They cannot
bring it.</v>

286
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.760
They cannot bring a police story come to us.
Oh good.

287
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:04.800
<v 5>No depth,
no editing the wrong.
Okay,
you need editing guy.
Musics are wrong,</v>

288
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.260
so you need so many people.
Then you ruined my movie.

289
00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:12.130
So now I want to be a producer,
producer.

290
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.930
Then I said anything wrong.

291
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.210
At least I can say something to tell that directly to duties.
Do that.

292
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:22.690
Otherwise it's an actor.
You just say it.

293
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:28.320
Uh,
yeah.
You have no say I wanted to do this.
No know,
don't worry.
Where would,

294
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.140
if I'm the producer,
okay,
I want to change this.

295
00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.840
I wanted to do because I'm not the master,

296
00:21:34.841 --> 00:21:39.010
but I'd been in the movie industry of 57 years,
all my life,

297
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:44.050
every single day in the film set.
Eh,
if I'm not home,
I'm an editing room.

298
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:48.850
If I'm not in the edit room,
I mean the script meeting,
Eh,

299
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.780
all the time

300
00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:51.573
<v 4>you sleep</v>

301
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.210
<v 5>four hour from anchorage.</v>

302
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.870
I just arrive four o'clock from China,

303
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.700
India this morning and I am,
I'm flying back to la.

304
00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:13.050
<v 4>[inaudible] technology has evolved so much.</v>

305
00:22:13.991 --> 00:22:16.620
And you,
you touched back to it,
like,
look,
you guys use like,

306
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.570
I don't want to say rudimentary,
but use the techniques available to you.

307
00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.340
Has Technology impacted you at all?

308
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.670
<v 5>Really?
In the old day,</v>

309
00:22:29.671 --> 00:22:33.300
I rest of my life because I don't know technology,
I don't know.

310
00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.790
Green screen,
blue,
blue,
those kinds of computer graphics.

311
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.210
I don't know.
I have to risk my life to all,

312
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.130
all a sudden when I watch American movie,
Wow.

313
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:48.830
Then everybody can be a soup.
Superman,
Supergirl,
Damon,

314
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:49.800
they,

315
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.800
even now they do the action secret better than an hour because the user,

316
00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.530
especially with her,
uh,
through,
through screen,
green screen,

317
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.950
computer graphic,
uh,
break,
dance,

318
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:11.370
break,
dance,
uh,
martial arts,

319
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:15.820
all kinds of March or with all the new technologies.

320
00:23:15.821 --> 00:23:20.280
So this is why you see right now American action movies.
So good,

321
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.120
not shorter.
And of course we were,
I want to show the,

322
00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.170
the one shot just like this.
You see the whole thing,
what I'm doing,

323
00:23:28.171 --> 00:23:30.510
but I'm not going to feel me.
They clever.

324
00:23:30.511 --> 00:23:33.270
They can use the camera angle if for some,

325
00:23:33.271 --> 00:23:38.130
some people they don't know how to fight.
They just teach
then audit.

326
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.033
Wow.

327
00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:44.080
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

328
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.200
<v 5>I know how to fight.
I don't need these kinds of things yet.</v>

329
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:55.240
I wanted to 40 or 35 put up the 50 I show you the whole thing.

330
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:03.090
The whole shot.
Difficult.
Very hard to shut.

331
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:07.080
Like your master one shot,
two days,
blah blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

332
00:24:07.081 --> 00:24:07.914
blah,
blah,
blah.

333
00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.960
I'm American things so easy.

334
00:24:13.961 --> 00:24:18.180
One day I can do a 20 shot cut,
boom check pack.

335
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.140
So easy.

336
00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.013
<v 4>But</v>

337
00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.110
<v 5>I think American,
the audience,
they like this car.</v>

338
00:24:26.111 --> 00:24:29.180
The cell you felt with the camera angle is too.

339
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:34.000
How would you know this guy?
The things,
wow.
Just so good.

340
00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:38.650
But now I know this kind of things,
but the Oregon,

341
00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.770
they don't like to see Jackie Chan doing these kinds of things.
They did.

342
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:47.380
They watch American.
A lot of actions.
Okay.
They,

343
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.950
they can do.
They know.
But if I do these kinds of things,

344
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:53.003
why

345
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:55.160
<v 4>do,</v>

346
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.840
<v 5>do we have to show the audience the whole thing?
Jump.
Boom.</v>

347
00:24:59.841 --> 00:25:02.360
I get hurt by Uber.
Go to the hospital.

348
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.170
<v 4>Jackie Chan
pull me.</v>

349
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:13.670
<v 5>Yeah,
when I was young,
we don't have money.
We have,
we don't,</v>

350
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.400
we cannot buy a machine who had duties kind of thing.

351
00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:21.460
Today we have a lot of money but still do the stupid cupid,

352
00:25:22.101 --> 00:25:24.680
the weight because the audience,
the light duty digitize things.

353
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:29.530
And I don't think the audience to see Jackie,
beacon.

354
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:31.180
Spiderman.
Yeah.

355
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:33.043
<v 4>I want to be,</v>

356
00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.500
<v 5>wait,
what?
Oh Wow.
This is so good.
Shoes fighting.</v>

357
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.720
I can use it or they come back

358
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.610
for me.
They want to see no matter how old I am,

359
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.010
you see me doing that action sequence?

360
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.290
<v 4>Well,
just like you,
you know,
you hadn't done a ton,
but I like to do it.
Yeah.</v>

361
00:26:04.291 --> 00:26:05.390
You have an attitude,
senator.

362
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.470
Super serious ones before and this turned out great.
So you could try and,

363
00:26:08.471 --> 00:26:12.400
you know,
you could try for the next spider man.
Nope.
What the I want.

364
00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.460
<v 5>I want to hire me to be coming.
Uh,
uh,
uh,</v>

365
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:21.360
well back managed by the man.
Every time I see those superheroes,

366
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:22.610
I should end there.

367
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.080
<v 4>Nobody hire me.
Your own superhero.
Terrible thing.</v>

368
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:33.000
Okay.
Rush Hour.
Sean had gone

369
00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.120
now the foreigners.
So yeah,
I pick up the script.

370
00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:44.150
<v 5>Otherwise they still going on and I guess y'all had dawn hour and a cup.</v>

371
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:50.550
A S C I m Sukup buddies from China.
From Hong Kong.

372
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:53.813
<v 4>Oh,
police</v>

373
00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.080
<v 5>in China.
I can do a lot of things because I put him a myself.</v>

374
00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.850
So this why you can see I do

375
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:10.360
all kinds of different character.
But in u s so difficult.

376
00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.810
Yeah.
I receive a lot of script,

377
00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.660
police,
police,
CIA,
CIA.
I wanted,
I wanted to change.

378
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.700
<v 1>What do you think you would want to do next if you had like your pick of any</v>

379
00:27:22.701 --> 00:27:23.534
project?

380
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:32.110
<v 0>Lanolin [inaudible]</v>

381
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.230
<v 4>such a good singer.
Like it's not funny</v>

382
00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:41.970
at the end of song

383
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.850
<v 5>somebody's song.
Yes,
yes,
yes.</v>

384
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.800
And if you have a time trends today,
the,
the,
the,

385
00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:52.910
the lyrics.
So good delivery.
So good.

386
00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.920
<v 1>I think that the video is actually already out the music video for it.</v>

387
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.560
<v 4>Yeah.
And we with our agenda number one,</v>

388
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:05.150
not,
not the Chris thing.
Probably my voice is sexy.

389
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.900
Lyric is good.
The music is good.
It's so good.
It's good luck.
It's a great song.

390
00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:14.734
Yeah.

391
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.870
<v 1>We have time for a few audience questions.
If folks on a lineup at the back,</v>

392
00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.690
<v 4>I would love to see you in the La La land.
Yeah,
I would love it.
Like I hope you,</v>

393
00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:27.900
I hope you make it tiny la La land.

394
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.530
<v 1>Hey Jackie,
I'm a huge fan of yours and uh,</v>

395
00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:36.330
please start it with one of my favorite movies of all time.
What movie please.

396
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:36.890
Sorry.

397
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:38.120
<v 4>Oh,
police start it.
Thank you.</v>

398
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:42.020
<v 1>And my favorite part of your movies or when you show the bloopers at the end and</v>

399
00:28:42.021 --> 00:28:43.880
it shows like all the different,

400
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.670
like the outtakes and all the stones that went wrong.

401
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.160
And like in project a,
you fell from the clock tower two or three times.

402
00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.070
So I was wondering,
um,

403
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:59.360
is it hard for you to get the courage to do the stunts over and over again even

404
00:28:59.361 --> 00:29:00.200
after you've been hurt

405
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:05.000
<v 5>doing this?
Done?
I actually went to doing stuff.
I'm scared.</v>

406
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.980
I'm not the superman every time when the [inaudible] [inaudible] boom,
boom,
boom,

407
00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:13.360
boom.
But I just,
I wanted to do it.

408
00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:18.600
I wanted to challenge myself.
Strange when that,

409
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:23.720
anytime when this the the camera rolling speed then Ooh,

410
00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:29.670
wow.
I just,
and that time and that moment of becoming superman.
Boom.

411
00:29:29.671 --> 00:29:34.360
I do.
I never thought then I think probably I'm gonna I know I'm going to die.

412
00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:38.920
I'm,
I,
I'm,
I probably,
I hurt myself.
I don't care at that time.

413
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:45.120
So this way John Building and how the copter or I just every time did like uh,

414
00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:55.750
seeing death penalty.
Yes.
Nice Super Cup.

415
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:59.740
You jumped in the helicopter.
Nothing.
There's no way or not.

416
00:29:59.741 --> 00:30:03.400
And you just watched the helicopter.
I'm going to do it.
Yes.

417
00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:08.420
Then I watched across the street so many Paparazzi with Devin.
The Lens,

418
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:13.250
I got the job.
They would watch you.
I'm dying.
Okay.

419
00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:18.130
[inaudible] next shot.

420
00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:22.710
Yeah,
that's,
but I'm,
I'm,
I,
I'm so happy.

421
00:30:22.711 --> 00:30:25.980
I'm glad when I was young,
I so many energy.

422
00:30:25.981 --> 00:30:30.981
I do so many Stan and I'm so happy this day probably I cannot do anymore.

423
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.120
Yeah.
Jump off the table.
Yes.
But no,

424
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:43.930
and I might use a special effects suits this.
Why I that technology's so good.

425
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.760
[inaudible] I came from,
he jumped from here to here.

426
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:52.080
It's like a 20 story building
and the old day,

427
00:30:52.081 --> 00:30:53.070
I really don't

428
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.810
<v 6>thank you.
Ever since I was a kid,
I always looked up to you.</v>

429
00:30:58.811 --> 00:31:02.530
I always imagine training under you and learning from you.

430
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.630
And because of that I trained Kung Fu ever since I was four.
Um,
now,

431
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:12.670
uh,
I teach lion dancing two kids.
Uh,
I teach at three different places.

432
00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:17.530
Um,
and I have two other come from others and we collaborate together and we do a

433
00:31:17.531 --> 00:31:18.310
lot of things and we,

434
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:21.070
we come up with different tricks for lion dance and we'd do all these,

435
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:25.060
all these tents similar to you but not as amazing as yourself.

436
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.750
Uh,
what I want to get to is um,
working with,
uh,

437
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.370
your Kung Fu brothers Sammo hung and you involve all three of you are amazing.

438
00:31:33.371 --> 00:31:36.340
And I'm wondering what that dynamic was like when you guys were doing your

439
00:31:36.341 --> 00:31:37.930
stunts and your choreography

440
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:43.520
<v 5>when some of whom are me and you and bill together.
Just like a minty things.</v>

441
00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.420
Yeah.
On the,
on the set when we were off,

442
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:50.240
we don't give an to train.

443
00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:53.990
We did put the hand that then it just give me a punch.

444
00:31:53.991 --> 00:31:58.230
Then we just,
those kinds of things just come from natural.

445
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:03.870
Oh good.
You don't have to like a bomb bomb,

446
00:32:03.871 --> 00:32:08.490
bomb bomb.
Some other people we have to.
Okay.
Watch,
watch how punch k.

447
00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:13.260
Okay.
Again,
you forget,
but with young girls,
Emma,
which is very natural,

448
00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:18.310
you put the hemp [inaudible] so good.
Yeah.
Um,

449
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.360
I miss the old day.
Really.

450
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.670
Do you spend a lot of time like actively training and learning new things or do

451
00:32:24.671 --> 00:32:27.040
you spend more time teaching,
teaching,
teaching,
teaching.

452
00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.930
When you're teaching you have so many new things coming up.

453
00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.350
And also when I teaching,

454
00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:36.260
I also learned something from the students because they've,

455
00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.280
they from some other martial art,
they want to learn the movies.

456
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:45.380
Then I can actually,
I didn't say that I in my heart.
Wow.

457
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.970
I learned something from him and I use these things and change and other things.

458
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:55.560
Uh,
actually right now my,
my,

459
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:59.940
when you look Jackie Chan movie,
it's not just one style.

460
00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:05.190
We have like a wing Joan Jett,
you sue judo.

461
00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:10.080
We have all kinds of it kind of like a jumpsuit,
all kinds of things.

462
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:14.910
So it's not alleging a ty g just one style have so many style.

463
00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.780
So Ashley,
you,
you and you watch your junk and Mazda.
You want,

464
00:33:18.781 --> 00:33:22.820
you're a police story.
There's so many style inside.

465
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.710
<v 7>Hello Jackie Chan.
My name is Winnie lamb.</v>

466
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:30.120
And what this audience may not know is that besides you being a famous movie

467
00:33:30.121 --> 00:33:33.630
star,
that you're a passionate advocate for wildlife conservation.

468
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.620
You've done commercials to save tigers,
to save elephants,

469
00:33:37.621 --> 00:33:39.090
to save rhinos and things like that.

470
00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:44.310
What I'm curious is what inspires you to take such passionate action to save

471
00:33:44.311 --> 00:33:47.730
animals and what is your vision for what you would like to see happen

472
00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:52.300
<v 5>doing a charity Saber animal is the people teaching me how to do it.</v>

473
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:56.740
I'm,
I never go to school when they were young.
I just do the motto.

474
00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:01.760
Our school when they were growing up when I was 16 or 15 then all my mind is a

475
00:34:02.841 --> 00:34:07.090
daytime crowd.
The afternoon Kido at night boxing,

476
00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:11.020
middle of the night,
and a gym room nonstop.

477
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.280
When I becoming a movie star,
I wanted to make money.
I wonder if famous,

478
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:20.290
this all laid on,
laid on because the movie's success.

479
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:24.060
I becoming a famous people.
You just tell me do a chart.

480
00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.430
I don't like to toot your charity.
I don't have time to do charity.

481
00:34:27.431 --> 00:34:30.460
I like to play out,
but the ones that I wanted to drink over there with disco,

482
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:37.270

526
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:42.700

528
00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:56.350
every day I was training because I didn't never go to school.
You mean Chinese?

529
00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.130

So a higher the teacher teach me how to read Chinese,

Don't look at these kind of people I have to work hard to fold for,

537
00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:32.010
for next few years.
I want to speak good Chinese.

542
00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:54.610
<v 5>You never,
you never thought it's that important.
This Day.</v>

543
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.920
I'm talking about 20 years ago.
I already know if I can go back,

544
00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.700
I really want to do it over again.
Go to school,

545
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:08.610
pay piano,
speak with English.
Really Chinese.
That's why I'm doing.

546
00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.320
But you never returned.
So these two,
Ay I,

547
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:18.660

I'd be,
it was 26 at school are ready to add.

548
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:23.610
You tell the children,
look,
don't learn from me when you young.

549
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:28.190
But children,
you don't.
If they,
they don't have experience,

550
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:32.150
they don't believe you.
No matter how you tell them.
No.
Go to school.

551
00:39:32.151 --> 00:39:34.880
But they'll pay piano.
No.
No.
When they're going up.
Oh,

552
00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:39.560
I regret I should play piano.
But the time we tell,

553
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:44.730
I tried to tell the children cut out of the shop.

554
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:49.290
The,
the,
the bad things when I'm doing,

555
00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:53.560
I would tell them that's between these back.

556
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:56.640
I want you to directly jump into good things.
Yeah.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:29.500
<v 8>So at that time there was not much pocket money for me to go watch your movies.</v>

566
00:40:29.501 --> 00:40:33.700
But I had my brother who used to take me the few movies,

567
00:40:33.701 --> 00:40:36.940
which are watch was armor of God.
Paul Story.
Oh,

568
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.900
there was an incident in armor of God where you fell down,

569
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:45.010
had a big accident.
Um,
uh,

570
00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.950
you have overcome that particular phase of life.

571
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.130
How did you work on that particular challenge?

572
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:53.860
Goes back to the first question as well.
The fear in anybody said,

573
00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:57.220
we'll come and do these stones,
which you do.

574
00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:01.090
How did you overcome that particular field is what is the question?

575
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:06.600
<v 5>I don't know.
Let's just do it.
And every time I did,</v>

576
00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:11.120
when I do design this done,
you know,
when you sit down with all my stunt team,

577
00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.250
ah,
this,
that,

578
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.720
that's you can we still have a standard stump jump off the tree.
Dot.
Oh,

579
00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:22.940
so exciting.
But when years later by the time is coming,

580
00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.990
you just like a wow at death,
depending on with you.

581
00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.800
I'm gonna really do this.
I'm so stupid.

582
00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:35.630
There's no such clever way to do it.

583
00:41:35.631 --> 00:41:39.470
The only way just risk your life to do these kinds of things.
Let Hammer of God,

584
00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:43.820
I already read it,
John once.
It's okay,

585
00:41:43.821 --> 00:41:46.370
but I think it's not good enough.

586
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:51.410
I do it one more time and the tree break.
I should falling down there.
Yugoslavia.

587
00:41:51.411 --> 00:41:55.800
Camera Man,
look at me.
Suppose he put down the camera pushing me.
I'm saying,

588
00:41:56.330 --> 00:42:00.580
Hey,
look at me.
Kicked the camera.
I'd run away.
You see?

589
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.630
Did you see the okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You see the outtake

590
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:10.590
I falling,
falling up.
Granted every trip,
brick,
brick,
brick,
brick,
boom,

591
00:42:10.591 --> 00:42:15.410
magic 40 hours.
Then nothing happened.
I feel my back's gonna hurt.

592
00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.860
Did like get up and everybody pushing me back.
I don't know what happened.

593
00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.890
And later
southern yet,

594
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:27.160
and I hear my year blips coming with their ears,

595
00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:31.710
Yugoslavia and that time,

596
00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:36.360
uh,
1212 o'clock,

597
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:41.250
they may send me to the hospital at night.
Eight hours,
uh,

598
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:45.120
eight o' clock,
almost a hour.

599
00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:50.940
And it was a waiting.
Not like today.
Everybody can pick a phone call.

600
00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.170
We sit,
sit there to call Hong Kong an hour later,

601
00:42:55.171 --> 00:42:56.520
then come call back.

602
00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:00.930
Just so this why in the room.

603
00:43:00.931 --> 00:43:05.760
I just asked myself what I'm doing.
I'm going to die.

604
00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:11.160
Yeah.
Because all my stunt team,
you know,
all my stunt team,
everybody,

605
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.410
it opened the door.
I did

606
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:21.330
it.
Just see if I hit die dying.
I just,

607
00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:27.080
I do.
I just him by myself,
then myself,
I'm going to die.

608
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:28.910
Yeah.
It's so easy

609
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:35.840
what I'm doing for this world,
what I'm doing for this myself.
Nothing.

610
00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.550
Every day,
every day,
every day.
Just making a moving,
fooling around.

611
00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:43.610
I don't know if I can survive,
I should do more things.

612
00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:48.170
So this was right after you will start to go back and I start checking him from

613
00:43:48.171 --> 00:43:50.980
Beijing.
So this way stop.

614
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.330
I think.
Uh,

615
00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.640
<v 1>it's a wake up call.
Yeah,
we got the call.</v>

616
00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:00.550
Do you think from a purely like stunt perspective,

617
00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:04.330
if it wasn't a little bit scary for you,
between a little bit too,
a lot scary.

618
00:44:04.331 --> 00:44:08.320
Like as an audience,
we need that.
Like,
we need to have that fear of like,

619
00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:12.580
cause the CG stuff,
there's no stakes sometimes,
right?
It's just like,
yeah.
How,

620
00:44:12.581 --> 00:44:16.120
how like they're going to survive.
But for you as a choreographer,

621
00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:19.060
is it ever or are you like,
yeah,
I know we need to be a little bit scary.

622
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:25.000
<v 5>I,
and also I like to challenge myself.
Every movie.</v>

623
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:29.900
That's the problem.
Every movie I want to do some more dangerous than this one.

624
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:35.850
When I see it too,
when I look at the audience,

625
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.780
because when you watch this side,
I over what you do.

626
00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:43.470
So all in the audience,
the reaction,
because I hear the sound,

627
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:48.270
I know what you're seeing because I'd be editing like a six months every

628
00:44:48.271 --> 00:44:51.760
Saturday.
I was just looking at our audience.
If I see the audit,
oh,

629
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:56.000
<v 4>it makes me happy.
Yes.</v>

630
00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:03.620
<v 5>If I can make audient happy,
that makes me a happy,
happy.
Even though,
Bro,</v>

631
00:45:03.621 --> 00:45:06.590
my finger,
I broke it worth.
Yeah.

632
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.540
I just want to make a good action movie.
Good Jackie Chan movie and

633
00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:19.700
you're making art quick.
Like last week.

634
00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.150
<v 9>Jackie,
my name is Ahmed,
uh,
big time fan of yours.
I'm,</v>

635
00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:26.710
I really want to say thanks for you to come here and give me an opportunity to

636
00:45:26.711 --> 00:45:31.270
see you in person.
One of my dream just came true.
Thank you very much.
Um,

637
00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:35.650
my question to you is your recent experience,
um,
being part of Bollywood,

638
00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:39.730
which is Indian version of Hollywood.
If you can talk about that a little bit,

639
00:45:39.731 --> 00:45:42.550
share that experience with me and all of us,
that'd be great.

640
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:46.710
<v 5>I know a Bollywood also is a very big,</v>

641
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:51.090
I've even tried to make a Bollywood movie for a long time.

642
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.110
Yeah.
Seems,
uh,
seems uh,

643
00:45:55.470 --> 00:46:00.440
some argument that myth.
I was uh,
uh,
the,

644
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:05.280
the actor,
what's his Danielle?
Uh,

645
00:46:05.281 --> 00:46:06.114
the,

646
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:11.390
the India actress at the end I asked her Monica money.

647
00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.810
Kaizen,
can I make two versions?

648
00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:19.590
One version is somehow before we fight with death,

649
00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:27.170
<v 4>I really want to do that,
but it doesn't work.
I,
last year</v>

650
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:32.040
<v 5>we make the call for Yoga.
Yeah.
Then I said,
Carla,
we'll do a body was,
so I,</v>

651
00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:35.740
I tend to in the whole whole thing,
you know,
everybody,
you have a dream.

652
00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.820
You had to make my dream come true.
I want to do this.
So why don't we,
yeah.

653
00:46:40.821 --> 00:46:45.610
Well I want to be a police because,
uh,
I,
I think we'll just school.
I,

654
00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:49.420
I,
I can not go to police went up becoming a director.

655
00:46:49.421 --> 00:46:53.610
I ran my old squid or becoming a police.
Yeah.
Because CIA,
I'd be coming,
uh,

656
00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:54.933
uh,

657
00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:00.910
I treasure hunter Bollywood and a writer's group body with it.

658
00:47:00.911 --> 00:47:05.840
Then I think I saw,
uh,
the fun.
Yeah.
I,

659
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:10.950
I'm still looking for some other script with a stun a India acted together.

660
00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.600
Thank you.
All right,
and last audience question.
Thank

661
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.520
<v 10>you very much,
Mr. 10 foot being here today.
And uh,
my name is John Paul.
Lee,</v>

662
00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:25.400
you talked about briefly your frustration with being cast it as,
uh,

663
00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:30.630
being offered a row as police or [inaudible] step several of character.

664
00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:35.440
So I'm wondering what are your thoughts in making the American film industry a

665
00:47:35.441 --> 00:47:40.390
better place for foreign actors to collaborate in different types of roles?

666
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:44.710
And,
uh,
what do you see yourself doing in making this environment better?

667
00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:50.310
<v 5>Well,
I think this,
this depends,
the script depends.</v>

668
00:47:50.311 --> 00:47:51.144
The script

669
00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:58.340
had it had to be an Asian character pretty much.
It's not what defines you.

670
00:47:58.350 --> 00:48:02.280
It could have been any,
you know,
when you find a good script,
then

671
00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:08.970
you find a,
so this why in America,
they have a casting director.
We don't.

672
00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.210
So when in my movie,
if I know

673
00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:18.390
the villain have to find they're not fun,
I find a villain who really can fight,

674
00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:19.680
but they don't have to add.

675
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:24.070
They just but find school acting no good.

676
00:48:24.071 --> 00:48:27.770
So later on when you see like police story is so minimal,

677
00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:31.410
I just find a villain who know,

678
00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.790
but as the people surround him or Becca,

679
00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:39.220
so I fight with all the bad guy,
the villain at the end.
One time

680
00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:45.370
I think,
find out the postscript,
uh,

681
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:50.430
we will introduce more American actor to China and Chinese actor to America.

682
00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.010
Uh,

683
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:59.010
and not just like introduced one shaft for the appearance is not like this,

684
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:03.190
just like dragging blade,
you know,
you find the right script.

685
00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:08.250
Then Adrian Brody and John Cruiser and meet everybody.

686
00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:12.550
The Hey,
the same,
how do you say,
Hey,
fund

687
00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:19.410
the scene.
Ever balance.
There's not just one shot is not like this.

688
00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:22.320
Yeah.
Okay.

689
00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:25.150
My last question is what do you wish you had more time for?

690
00:49:25.151 --> 00:49:29.340
Because it sounds like you're doing so much.
I don't know.

691
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:35.820
I mean
this year I've been what I'm doing,

692
00:49:35.821 --> 00:49:39.960
well,
I mean I've been doing my own record.

693
00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:44.310
Yeah.
I mean three years now and beef.
Nice night.
I,

694
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:49.600
I still recording right after recording.
Then I go to the APP at port.

695
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.150
Yeah.
Come here.
Uh,

696
00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:57.210
released this year then at tapping Ninjago a nutjob wish dragon.

697
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:04.020
Uh,
PBC,

698
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:08.380
the one world war day.
One day of the world.

699
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:13.690
Uh,
to producer for script going on.

700
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:16.100
So what do you do for fun or is this fun?

701
00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:22.490
Like meeting uh,
the fence and uh,

702
00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:26.610
compensation is fun.
Yes.
Otherwise everyday script script.

703
00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:31.340
Sometime you just sit there.
Just led this a half hour.
You just stopped.

704
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:36.970
Boom.
You just,
you don't know,
just like Laney is supposed to have a mood.

705
00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:42.260
I suppose I already start the movie already,
but the script doesn't,

706
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:45.890
it's wrong
to American film.

707
00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.290
Five against Buddha and another nother one

708
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:52.820
dimension the name.
Right.

709
00:50:55.250 --> 00:51:00.250
Because the script is wrong because at the producer so I can stop.

710
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:07.220
I said no,
I'm not going to because as soon as you start the movie,

711
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:12.350
the money you just do do,
do,
do,
do,
do too.
It's like water.
If we use stock,

712
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:17.270
make sure the script is right in the long,
not like the old day.

713
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:21.440
I don't know.
They just start then movie,
you know,

714
00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:26.330
understand this everyday.
Make the phone call.
Then the,

715
00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:30.200
the the fest coming.
The the the script.
Okay.
Do this scene first.

716
00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:35.240
They haven't read yet.
They start the movie because they want to start the movie.

717
00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:40.970
They just want to make movies.
I want to make a good movie is different.

718
00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:46.370
Yeah.
If I cannot finish today,
tomorrow if I spend another,
no,

719
00:51:46.371 --> 00:51:51.350
I put my own money to make sure the movies are good.
Some Eh,

720
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:56.480
so this why right now I'm doing,
that's a good thing.

721
00:51:56.570 --> 00:52:01.130
Otherwise I already start to move.
He already then on the set you,
you will,

722
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:05.640
ah,
why did start the movie?
They have to finish today.

723
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:10.650
You had to finish in two days.
That's America.
American.

The,

724
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.090
the,
the,
the rule

725
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:17.050
schedule sometime makes you angry.

726
00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:21.200
Just they just make movie for schedule,

727
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:25.180
Budget Day.
Uh,

728
00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.350

729
00:52:27.351 --> 00:52:32.300
finished the go within is on budget on day 30 days.
Then,

730
00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:36.710

I just go back to my hotel.

731
00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.860
I know what's going on.
It's not like that.

732
00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.750
If I'm 30 day cannot finish six days,
60th can offense two years,

733
00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:49.400

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.040
That's a so many movie.
Boom.
Gone.

736
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:00.050
People cannot remember.

737
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:07.100
So when you do good things,
stay to the past.
Not for today.

738
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.970
For Future.

739
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:16.460
then gone.
You doesn't make any money.
