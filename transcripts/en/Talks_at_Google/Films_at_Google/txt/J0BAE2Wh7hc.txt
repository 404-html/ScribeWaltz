Speaker 1:          00:06          That's all. I guess I'll sit down. I would just say it's going to be a short introduction to the film. I'm Julie Anderson and this is Bridgette and Josh and the were with the plastic oceans foundation and one of our first missions of plastic oceans was to how do we get the world to recognize the problem of plastics, the new understanding of plastic if and its impact on the oceans and our environment. And that first step was let's create a film that is impactful, educational and meaningful and can be delivered on a global level. And that's, it took seven years to create this film. The film, the full documentary as a hundred minutes, you can watch it on Netflix. And this way we've created different shorts for purposes like this. That's 20 minutes, eight minutes. And the idea is to engage people in conversation, teach what informed people, raise the awareness of this global crisis, but also engage people on in a conversation on what we do next. Not just repeat the problem as much as it is, we now need to do something and encourage people to do those solutions. And it's not a one solution problem, one solution fix, but it's, it's going to take a global community effort.

Speaker 2:          01:21          Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:21          Yeah. Um, you know, I would just to piggyback off what Julie said is, um, we not only on the global side of things, we actually have reached to communities around the world. Um, we have the film now in 15 different languages and we've screened it in over 70 countries and it's really amazing the outpour of people that reached out to us on a daily basis just saying, you know, we, we agree and what can we do to help? So I think there's a lot of interest out there and I'm also curious after we screen it to get your thoughts on, you know, how you see this as well. Um, and I think that there's a willingness, it's also making it more accessible to people. So,

Speaker 4:          02:03          um, thanks y'all for coming out. Um, I'll be curious after you see the film, to hear your thoughts about where plastic lives in your lives here on the Google campus in Los Angeles and Venice. I'm a ways that you can help shift the mindset here. And maybe with your families or on Pasta.

Speaker 1:          02:24          Bring this film to the, again this is the film itself is supposed to be form you onto the get us all onto the same level of understanding and then we discuss afterwards. So I hope you enjoyed the film and we'll discuss afterwards. Thank you. And the, it's how the foundation now what we work on and terms of putting this out. Our goal is to get people to rethink plastic co the problem exists obviously we all see it when we go to the, to the beaches, we see it when we go hiking. You see plastic almost everywhere at this point and we know the problem exists. It's how do we now start to rethink this? How do we now take knowledge, new knowledge that plastic does not go away. It doesn't degrade back into the earth any longer. It simply remains and the very first plastic that was ever created still exists in some form or another.

Speaker 1:          03:18          And so it's taking that knowledge, new knowledge and getting our generation to really comprehend that and start reexamining how we use plastic. Now teaching the young kids that this is not a product that they can grow up with any longer. It's a new, it's a new understanding. And that's what we mean by rethinking plastic. And we go with this film and with other different types of film and media shorts we go to, we educate children on what plastic is to get them to recognize plastic is not, it doesn't go away and it's a new norm to live without it. Um, especially single use plastics. We also go these films to take it to industries, different industries and in spa encourage each industry to examine what they're doing and how they're using plastic and how they can modify, modify their use of plastic and become industry leaders. And the other, and the final third component initiative that we push is working with governments and getting communities to start to work with their governments to start pushing these policy changes. And it really comes in. And with those three, three components from education, industry and policy, that's globally, it's is the way that we think that we have to move forward to get that site psychological shift that we need for social change.

Speaker 1:          04:51          Um, I think

Speaker 3:          04:52          that's exactly right. And just kind of adding onto that, I'm, I'm more involved on, I'm the director of partnerships, so I work a lot with industries that are, you know, companies that are, I mean, you can think about any industry and it's going to have plastic, you know, you've got, um, beauty products, I mean in tons of packaging and plastic. Um, even clothing, a lot of people aren't aware, but most of our clothes nowadays, especially the disposable fast fashion clothes are made of, um, there are oil based or they have plastics in them. Um, and I just don't think we realize how, how much plastic is in our, in our lives really. And I think it's going to take, um, you know, at least a generation. And that's ultimately our goal is to try and be a part of it, um, through those ways that Julie has mentioned.

Speaker 3:          05:44          Um, but in, in the work that I'm trying to push is, is working with into those industries that I've mentioned and try to get them to be a part of it as well because you can't just approach it from one angle. It has to be like multiple levels. Um, but the idea is also to be able to empower consumers or you know, do you want to call it? Some people would call it reducers. Um, meaning you know, you, you're not a consumer. You want to, if you, ironically you want to buy something that will help reduce the amount of, for example, plastic, it's going to be out there taking a single use plastic like a water bottle that has an average life of, you know, 12 minutes and turning it into something that could be nine, 10, 12 years. I mean, there are things like suitcases out there, their um, car seats made out of these plastic bottles.

Speaker 3:          06:38          Um, you know, that, that that's an something that maybe if consumers aren't aware of, right. It actually costs more money to buy a product that's been recycled or repurposed from that perspective. Like call it a suitcase for example. So it's sort of informing consumers that, you know, you guys have an option as well to help, you know, cause if you're looking at two suitcases, they look exactly the same and one's a little bit more expensive, you're going to wonder what am I, you know, why am I going to invest in that? Um, so it's, it's also kind of building that awareness so that there's a shift, um, in behavioral habits and consuming habits to cause. The reality is there is a lot of plastic on the planet right now, especially in, I mean there's just so many layers to it. If you go to, in places like Asia, there's definitely, you know, there's an issue of portability of the water, right? So that, that's why, you know, plastic water bottles, some in some places are, are you still need to be used. But for example, here in the u s why are we still using plastic water bottles? I mean, it's not only that they've done a study recently and they've shown that the water in those bottles have a much higher level of, of chemical activity. Because it's plastic versus like tap water. So anyways, I could go on for a long time but I'm going to stop myself there. Uh, yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:55          you can't, it again, as she touches on you can go on and on and it does become overwhelming. But at the bottom line and brief, we do have the power to change and to create that change individually. Uh, reflecting on what you do, your personal use of single use plastics and if you wanted to go beyond that, even getting your families of your friend groups to start changing each of those changes make a huge difference once you work collectively. And then that's what we're as groups like plastic oceans, we are collectively giving that voice to each individual action and which does create that bigger social change that we're looking for. And you know, every but people we get often, what difference does it make? If I say no to one straw, one straw, it's insignificant. One thing I say is it's white. One Penny. He may not, 1 cent may be insignificant to one person, but if you collected 1 cent from everybody in the United States, that's a three little over $3 million, all of a sudden that those individual changes that change become something significant. And now you add that to on a global scale. You're, we're talking about a movement that actually does create a new work, new future for us and a better positive future.

Speaker 2:          09:15          Okay.

Speaker 4:          09:16          Um, I don't know how much that I have. Uh, y'all are covering it wonderfully. Um, what excites me is the power of this film and the films, the shorter versions that we've circulated to, um, get folks to communicate with one another about what they can do. Cause like we can come up with a bunch of ideas. But, uh, our power is getting this out to folks like yourselves who are connected to different industries and get you all thinking about what you can do, how you can collaborate with your, uh, with your colleagues or with other people who you know about making some kind of change. And even if that's just raising awareness so that you can continue that brainstorming together for that collaboration for change.

Speaker 2:          10:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:02          It's on that note. We'll do questions.

Speaker 5:          10:07          One thing I wanted to add is that, uh, June is going to be go Google serve. Uh, we already have a couple of projects set up that are very much in line with the kind of work that you do. One is with chrome alliance, I was trying to remember the name. They actually changed their name but they're still on our uh, website registered as both sea change foundation and Karma Alliance and we also have the Biota creek cleanup projects. So if you're feeling very motivated, um, I'm sure you are after that. Um, then uh, definitely sign up. We just had an email come out today, um, about Google serve and I know we'll have some internal communication coming from our own lax leads. Um, and the, the website is go Google serve dash lax for you to go look at the projects and sign up for some of these projects. And I hope at least next year we can also set something up with your organization as well. We were a little bit late on the timing this year, but next year we'll do that. Um, if anyone has any questions, I'm, I can throw things at you.

Speaker 6:          11:12          Yes. All right. Um, so I wanted to, one thing including at this office that we're getting, um, presented as an alternative is kind of the plant based plastics. And I was curious what the story is about the breakdown of those. I'm assuming they're not 100%, which means that that whatever part is not plant based, then it's not going to break down. Is that roughly correct or, and, and, and also I have this impression that it requires some sort of industrial process to actually recycle it or break it, make it biodegrade, which means that that makes it that much more likely that it's just going to end up in the same place. So I just wanted to do

Speaker 4:          11:51          just on that. So there's a couple folks

Speaker 1:          11:54          with plant based plastic. There are the two types I think you're also referring to. There's the bio, the ones that are considered biodegradable, which do require a special facility, a special processing to help it degrade. Um, the reason there is a lot of cons to the, this product is simply because it gets mixed with the current plastic. There is no way to separate it and it actually then makes it even more difficult to recycle the plastic that the processing that is in place. And there are very few cities that actually have the biodegradable facilities in place and it costs more. So that's one of the cons in terms of other plant based plastics that um, the problem with those is that as you mentioned, they do break and they break down in the same way in, it can take decades and there is no way and ultimately it does end up in our landfills and ends up in water systems.

Speaker 1:          12:52          And you then have the same problem with animals eating it where it then ends up in their stomach where they can potentially starve to death because of it blocking their systems. So does it at as much chemicals? No, but you, you still have all of the, the microplastic problems and the put the visual waste to the, that ends up to surfacing on our coasts. So that's why we go back to single use plastics. Do we really need to, to create as much waste to begin with? Can we just have a regular cup or a reusable bottle instead of finding a new way, a new material to create the same amount of waste? We're just creating far too much wastes that we can't handle. I mean this for focus on plastic because it is such a ubiquitous substance that's used, but it is, we use a lot of all types of materials that we need to figure out how to handle. Um,

Speaker 7:          13:51          thanks for asking that question Tom, because that was one of my questions too. But uh, I, I just kinda wanted to ask about the actual effectiveness of recycling, right? Cause like, you know, in La we have our blue recycling bins that we can throw all our plastic and metals and paper into. But it's just this sort of magic been that, you know, I don't know exactly what happens on the other side. And you know, I'm often left wondering with some little bit of plastic, like if I put this in the Bin, is it actually going to end up in some new product or is it just going to end up in the landfill? Right

Speaker 1:          14:25          here in Los Angeles, we have the best recycling in the sense that all there are seven grades of plastic for recycling and there is aluminum and paper and glass. So, and it's rare that cities have all forms of recycling. So La is good in terms of having all of these forms of recycling processes, but only approximately 10% is actually recycled of all of our waste and recycled waste, the other 90% does end up in landfill. Um, the problem, it's really, it comes down to economics. It becomes cheaper to make brand new material, brand new plastic materials than it is to recycle it. Find a use for it and repurpose that recycled plastic. So it becomes economics. The second reason is that there is a short, there's a shelf life on recyclability, so your plastic bags or the cheaper plastic, the thinner plastic water bottles, you can only recycle them so many times before they degrade to an unusable material, whereas you don't have that as much with pure substances like glass and aluminum.

Speaker 6:          15:44          Thanks.

Speaker 5:          15:47          Sort of piggybacking on that question. So you mentioned that you work with governments, uh, without opening a gigantic can of worms. Um, um, I'm not gonna, I don't know if you want to comment on the current, um, EPA, any of that stuff. But my question is in California, since we've been kind of at the vanguard of a lot of environmental policy, and you mentioned La has a strong recycling program, even though I didn't realize it was 90%, that is actually not re recycled, which is pretty depressing. Um, what can we do? What can we do as Californians? What do we do? Do we keep pressure on our leaders? Is Does your organization have any efforts to impact legislation? Uh, coming up that we should know about?

Speaker 6:          16:38          Um, maybe I'm not phrasing this correctly, but I think you get what I'm saying. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 1:          16:47          I'll touch on it a little bit. We don't focus a lot on policy. There are definitely or more organizations that focus on policy because there is a lot of, it becomes laborious, but policy is much easier to create change when more people are on board. When more people start to demand it, demand the change or ask, start asking for the change at the policies will change. Um, and here in La we have the new big policy changes in Malibu that is implementing plastic free restaurants. So I think, I can't remember exactly now the number, but it's over 50 restaurants that it will no longer serve you tent, plastic utensils, plastic straws and other plastic materials, which is amazing. The second thing where we have to, where we're going to see where we're going to have to push is the enforcement. And what does one do if a restaurant is serving plastic?

Speaker 1:          17:44          Are we going to call nine one one and have them arrested? Right. Probably not. But, so it really comes down to the consumer to really say, why are you have the straw, why do you have the straw? And it does make one feel like an eco warrior going into a place and saying, why do you have the straw? I demand something else. And that would be, we're always encouraging people to be that ECO warrior and stand up to do it. If not, this is where organizations like us go in and we put the pressure on them to follow up and to use media, social media to put that pressure on them to continue in that direction. And that does tend to follow, you know, trends like that. Follow.

Speaker 3:          18:26          Great. Thanks. Um, can I ask one more thing, um, on the partnerships front? Um, one thing that, well like I feel like the tourism industry and amusement parks and all, yeah, you're all nodding. That's every time I see that. I'm just astounded by the amount of waste in the lack of recycling bins around and that kind of thing and all the single use plastic. So I wonder if there's any, if you work with them at all. And also with companies like Amazon who are doing same day shipping. And you know, there's tons of waste around that, but people seem to be using it more and more all the time. So that's all. I'll stop now. Sorry. Um, so no, that's a great point. And you know, we're sort of slowly tackling it one industry at a time. So, but that is something that's on our radar as far as, you know, just if think about it means when parks or venue spaces in general concerts, um, you know, instead, that's a ton of, of, of things. I know of some venues that have throughout the country that are saying they're taking baby steps and they're saying, okay, no more plastic straws, you know, um, but you know, there's, there's a lot more that can be done and, uh, that's a really valid point and it's definitely on my shortlist, so, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:44          Are there lots of, there is change. I mean, there are people doing things. You can look at events, music events, big music events. You'll go and you'll see more and more often you'll see refill stations and you go to airports, you're starting to see them. So these are the changes that when you start, when people are starting to use them, they're starting to put more of them in there and it may be the problem is overwhelming if you look at all of the different levels of um, problems that there are, but on the, on that change, don't underestimate the power that each of you have in order to create that change. Putting on refill stations in each office makes a huge difference. If they stopped selling, if every office in La would stop buying individual water bottles, plastic water bottles, it makes a huge difference.

Speaker 1:          20:32          Getting rid of the plastic bags and starting to be reasonable. These make big difference. And companies start to recognize these trends and they create the, the new materials, the new products. And that's where the change comes about. And it, the consumer has a, a huge amount of power when it comes to how you spend your dollar and they will make it so they will start delivering what you want. Um, because of the, well they want your money. So I mean don't underestimate each individual problem. And, and this is where we as what we do in terms of finding these partners who are the industry leaders? Where are these individuals, these small community groups, what are they doing? There are people that are in small towns in Chile and Columbia and India that are taking, they're making change within their communities and then that voice becomes a powerful voice within the community next to them.

Speaker 1:          21:26          And this is how change comes about. I use the example of smoking. I'll often, I don't know if anybody remembers, it wasn't that long ago, 2030 years ago, you could smoke on airplanes, you could smoke in hospice. Some hospitals in the u s still like 20 years ago, you could still smoke in almost every restaurant and bar in New York. You today I have a seven year old son who finds it weird when he sees somebody smoke a, it is a new norm. It is not a norm any longer for him. And that was within one generation of creating that. And it was one by one pushing the science, getting people to understand the science of second hand smoke and firsthand smoke and smoking and little by little policy changes. People demanding, I don't want us, I don't want to eat in a restaurant that smokes. I don't want to go to a bar that smokes. And those changes came about. Policy changes came with that. And the same thing can happen with plastic.

Speaker 4:          22:22          Um, I think for myself, one of the most exciting things about this work is communicating with folks who are in waste management, who are in product design, folks who are doing packaging, um, and even folks who hit, who are running programs at schools so that the students can watch the film and then have a brainstorming session, ideation session where they get to talk with the administration. They get to talk with the folks who've managed the facilities and considered all the plastics that are a part of daily life. Um, and then cut out some of it. Make that a big conversation. The Diet. There's a group of folks in Metro Manila, Philippines who have been hosting a few events for folks who are in the industry of waste management of material production there. So that the folks who are at the top who have that knowledge can get together in a room and actually discuss what's happening so that everyone can be abreast of it and then know that there's something that they could affect later that they could call up on another, send out an email, speak to my someone. We don't need that plastic anymore. We can make or recycle this plastic in a more efficient way he's use for some kind of other product. Um, what's amazing is that I don't have to know how any of this works. Um, I could just help people connect one another. Um, and magic happens. I don't know what y'all do here at Google. Um, but

Speaker 1:          23:46          you can make the magic happen as well.

Speaker 5:          23:49          I have a question, um, about, uh, burning trash. So, um, over the years, uh, there's been articles about how, how much, uh, Sweden Burns of their trash, like the burn almost entirely all their trash. And my impression of that was always that that would lead to some pretty toxic, um, off gases. Um, but it's still touted as, as environmentally sound as an approach. Uh, do you have any thoughts about trash burning? I mean I know reducing overall the amount of trash in general is the first step, but it's another step to deal with maybe burning it, I dunno. Is that a possibility?

Speaker 1:          24:29          So we refer, the first solution that we push is to simply refuse, reduce your plastic use, reduce your trash consumption and

Speaker 1:          24:43          producing tress producing there. Then the second one we then called there is all this trash that is in existence. All the plastic that is currently in existence. What do we do with it? We don't know what we'd do with it. So things like waste to energy burning and burning the PLA, burning waste, burning plastic. We can we call these bridge solutions. How do we get from what all this mess that we've created until we can figure out the perfect solution of I'm sure. And people are working on technologies to how do we re, you know, keep the chemicals away from getting into the air. How do we burn it so that it's efficient and it's not perfect, but it does take care of the mass amount of plastic that is in the environment that is not going away, that is degrading. How do we control that before it gets out of even more out of hand?

Speaker 4:          25:34          Right. Yeah. I just want to jump on that. Um, I think that it's easy to see when there is something toxic around burning trash. It's not very sightly often. Um, but when one considers the alternative of putting it into a landfill site, which then leeches, because often landfill sites aren't very well insulated from their surroundings or end up in the oceans. It's really not a bad alternative. And that's not to say that there's like a good one that like if we have a bunch of garbage, we have like a solution that's going to work well for everyone. Um, but I think it's a pretty viable alternative if it creates energy and heat for places that can reduce the need for other fuels and keep stuff from getting into the ocean, getting into food for not just ourselves, but all the other animals.

Speaker 5:          26:17          Yeah. Don't we just send it to space? Isn't that the latest thing?

Speaker 4:          26:20          Yeah. And then it can go through our satellite dishes. Anyone else have a question?

Speaker 1:          26:29          That's an impressive,

Speaker 8:          26:32          do you have any success stories with businesses or industries where you like you

Speaker 5:          26:38          okay.

Speaker 8:          26:38          Like an example of a big change?

Speaker 4:          26:42          Yeah. Um, actually we

Speaker 3:          26:44          worked with the UN a hotel association in Thailand. Um, it was last year. Uh, they reached out to us and they said, listen, we want to work with you guys and we want to basically, it's an island in Thailand called Paquette. And um, islands are always tricky because it's hard to manage all the waste, you know, in terms of logistics and transportation. So they came to us and we worked with them and we help them create like a, a workshop that they used, um, with, I think they're up to about 74 different hotels that are members of the association. So they took the workshop and the 20 minute film that you just saw, um, we, they helped us in getting into a, the subtitles tie, subtitles and those two things. They went around and gave a workshop to the different members of the hotels. Then asking them to, you know, first of all, think about all the plastic that they have in the hotels and how they can go about reducing that.

Speaker 3:          27:43          And that does sort of led to a whole movement where basically they also, we advised them to do a cleanup, um, which every year there's international coastal cleanup day, which is on September, I think this year. It's the 15th. Um, and the, they got so much interest in it. Basically they had that, the local government, the tourism board at the u s embassy, um, and others that all got on board and came out for this huge beach cleanup. And as a result of all of that activity, they actually now have an upcycling program, uh, with a Spanish company. Um, they're called ECO health. And so I would say that was probably the first real big in terms of numbers, in terms of just awareness and really getting entrenched in an industry that really, really a tourism and travel is probably one of the biggest offenders. Right. So I would say that that was our first big home run for me at least. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:42          And it started off small again, we went in there to educate internally. Some often within the industry they don't understand how much waste there can to me. But by educating internally, starting off with a couple of hotels that did expand to the 75 which they are now all part of the UN clean seas program, which is now taking that same education program and bringing it to other hotels and other countries that are part of the UNC Clean Seas Program, which this is, that's that trickle down effect of starting in one small island and Thailand. And now it's being brought globally to where other hotels are starting to listen and how are they, and it makes them question how are they managing their waste internally? How much waste can they really can they know reduced. And a lot of times that it becomes a cost savings to them by just re looking at the, the plastic products that they offer.

Speaker 2:          29:39          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          29:42          We have time for one more question. Um, otherwise we'll just wrap up if everyone is satisfactorily depressed. Um, one what, one thing I wanted to say about the beauty products and how that ties into the hotel industry is, um, I stopped using any of the little freebie containers at hotels. I bring my own, I have my own reusable three ounce containers for hand cream and shampoo and conditioner and I bring those with me. I bring my own soap with me. These are some steps that you can take in your own personal life. Sending a message that says, I'm not using that. I'm not touching it. I'm not taking it home. I'm, I'm going to leave it there because I don't need that. Like, I can, I can take care of myself and I don't need, it's nice if you forget your stuff, but, um, it's just something to keep in mind. And then here, like in our micro kitchens, we have all these drinks that are in plastic containers. Um, it'd be nice if they were all like Snapple in glass bottles with metal lids, but they're not. So just remember the impact you're having when you take one of those. And thanks very much to our guest today was a real pleasure. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          30:53          And just one thing, I too, as we obviously as a collective, we grow. So if you could share plastic oceans, follow us on any of our social media sites, go to plastic oceans.org and you can find more information of things that we're doing around the world and tell your friends, share with people about plastic oceans. Because the bigger we become and the, the further our reach, the more impactful we are collectively.

Speaker 2:          31:20          Thank you. Thank you.
