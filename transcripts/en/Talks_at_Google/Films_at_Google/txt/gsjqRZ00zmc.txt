Speaker 1:          00:06          Hello, it's nice to see all of your phones. Hello everyone. Welcome to talks at Google today. It is my pleasure to welcome Olivia Munn for x men apocalypse. Thank you very much. Thank you for the pronunciation. I tried very hard. We practiced this. She said, uh, it's a toxic Google. And I said, why did you guys name it toxic Google. We're Brittany fans. Um, so huge, huge nerd movie. You are an awesome Geek nerd icon. How does it feel to kind of add this to your, your wall of badges? I, I still feel, um, and I felt at the time, I still feel like, I feel like a, like a nerd mole. I feel like, I think they've let me in and I'm like, Hey guys, I've got some stuff to tell you. I'm like, I get in there and I don't really feel like, like, uh, you know, I think somebody asked me the other day about like, oh, like to be part of this community.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Like how did that feel? Like a, well actually I think in my opinion, you know, that the nerd community or the, especially the expert community, it's, it's, it's not the movies or the biggest platform because that's what Hollywood is the biggest platform for entertainment. But the community started long before the movies and, uh, and so to me it just felt like, uh, it felt like I was able to get in and it kind of see what they're doing from the inside. So I kind of don't, I don't, I still feel like the outsider on the inside. What, what was your sort of first introduction to the world of x nine? Was it the comics was, it was a comic books. Uh, I grew up in Japan and I'm one of five kids and we didn't have a lot of money, so we, my mom would let us buy wine and we'd all share it.

Speaker 1:          01:42          And, uh, but we got into all different kinds of comic books. We just kind of read and, but oexman was way back then I think. Did you have a favorite storyline? Uh, no I don't. I don't think I, it was, um, no, I, I never know all of them. Do you have a favorite storyline from it's, it feels like there's just so many, like how, just so many, it's a great question, but it's a hard answer. I enjoyed house of m. Oh, so you do have an answer. I'm so, I didn't have an answer. Easier question than I thought. So I, uh, you know, you, you are joining this one. There's a, we're getting introduced to a ton of new characters. What, what can you tell us about that luck or your interpretation of her? So I like, um, well this is the introduction of, of Silak.

Speaker 1:          02:26          Well, she was introduced once before. Um, but that was like a, like a little blip of her. Uh, I, when I, I was excited because I've always loved Psylocke when I loved, what I loved about, sorry, I like was that she was, and I was reading it, that she was a villain who didn't have a problem killing. You know, a lot of times people like they have, they hesitate when they, when, when they have to kill. Like, if they have the only killed, they have to. But I liked that silent. She can create anything with their mind so she could create a boulder and just kill everybody and be done. But I always thought that she felt that was all too boring. So she liked to kill up close and personal. I always liked that. I'm like, that's like kind of a cool quality light.

Speaker 1:          03:01          Not only that, she's one of the Mutans who not only has kind of metaphysical powers, but she's physically a bad ass. But yeah, like she's, you know, telekinetic and she's telepathic, but she's also really skilled and she's a really powerful, and that's what when I said to us, so Simon Kinberg, he had, he wanted me to do another role in, um, in Deadpool. Uh, but it just, uh, I don't, wasn't a real, I connected with like, you know, thank you for the opportunity, but I just, you know, uh, I don't connect with us. And it was a little serendipitous because not that long after he called me about Psylocke. And, uh, when I met with him, I did say, you know, I know you guys introduced to once before, but like, you know, it's, I like was the last one added to this whole, to the whole x went apocalypse movie.

Speaker 1:          03:46          They were, they had the horseman already with, with apocalypse and then they felt like they needed a fourth and then, oh yeah. And then there's Psylocke and then they thought of me for it. So when I met with them, I said, you know, he said, it's, we're introducing this character so there's, you know, it builds up into the movies after and there's more stuff, but this one is not going to be, you know, a ton of stuff. And I said, you mean dialogue wise or presence wise? He said, no, no, she just dialogue. Why six? She's there, she's a presence in the whole movie. And I said, well, like I like, I'm not one of those people, I'm not counting lines and I don't, it's dialogue doesn't matter. I go, but if you give her a bad ass fight scene, then I'm in. And he's like, fine, we, we, we got the fight scenes.

Speaker 1:          04:25          So like to me that was the monologue. So for, to me it only made sense to do Psylocke if they were going to make her a really strong and lethal and they give it, you know, all these guys get that ass fight scenes and as the girl you got to like, you know, it's always like really slow and then you're doing something, then you got to come up on him and then he take, you know, I'm like, no, can we just like grapple and fight and, and really get into it. And like I want to get knocked around and I want to knock somebody else around, like actually like do a bad ass fight scene. And thankfully they, they, they were all down for that. So what was the training process like? Um, I started doing, uh, I started working with stunts, like learning wire and um, and how to flip and stuff.

Speaker 1:          05:06          And then I started working with a martial arts couple. They have their own gym and the husband can, he is an expert in martial arts and also sword. So I started doing sword with him and then I would do taekwondo. And so my training and it being six, seven hours a day, pretty much every day for about four, four months leading up into the fight scene. And so by the end, um, uh, I was, you know, I did all of my fight scenes and all of my stunts and that wasn't planned, but in the end, uh, I was able to just do it all. I do have a taekwondo background, so, uh, it's not like, you know, I was like able to learn everything like, so I, but I had that background already. And then just training again with them. Uh, it just, it was just, it was just so much fun and because it was everything for me to do, if I was going to decide, like I really wanted to do this fight scene and so to get really strong and powerful and to learn all these things was very important to me.

Speaker 1:          06:02          And so then we took that time. Then by the time the fight scene came around, um, I was, you know, I felt, I mean, I still feel like it's a weird thing. You do martial arts. I do. You do martial arts. Karate. Okay. Um, do you know which, which kind of a lot of, are you? Oh yeah. What is that? The way of peace and harmony. Really effective in a fight. Just like someone comes at you with a knife and you're like, hey, chill out, chill, dead. Um, uh, yeah. Taekwondo is, it's like when you, when you do, do people here, anybody do martial arts? Oh my, my one security guy who's been assigned to me. Thank you. Um, you feel like really it's a different feeling you feel capable of like there's like, um, like a lot of people get like, you know, like they put on muscle and they know how to like look lean or thin or booked up, but there's a different kind of feeling.

Speaker 1:          06:55          It's like athletic strength is what I feel like I have. So I feel like really capable. It's a good, it's a cool feeling. I've heard it described as sort of like a confidence, you know, I think it's a little bit of knowing that like, yeah, no, that could maybe do something at a fight, maybe. Yeah. If, yeah, I think not. Maybe I like that's it is maybe for me. Oh yeah. Well, no, no, no. I'm saying probably not for your peaceful fighting thing. I'm saying, I'm going to say you have to call me and I'll, I'll come. We should. You should actually, have you ever done your peaceful fighting technique? It didn't work out very well, so it's not, it's not the strong, I mean it's a, it's a very nice choice. Not the most protective choice. No, not at all. Uh, but that's okay.

Speaker 1:          07:38          You seem like a very sweet person as you mentioned before, you know, like is a, I would say the whole x meant universe is kind of a, there's no good and evil necessarily. Everyone just said who has their own motivations, but sidelocks maybe more willing to engage in tactics that fall on evil. But, um, how was it interacting with the other kind of new folks coming in as a horseman? And, um, the new cast of characters. Yeah. It was really fun. Uh, with, you know, everyone is a, it's a, you know, we, there were so many people in this movie and we would all shoot different times, but then at night we'd all get together and we'd like, basically like shut down a, like a restaurant just for us to hang out. I mean, not, we wouldn't go in there and be like, shut down because of us, but with that we just take up so much room that we have to like call ahead to a restaurant and we all hung out.

Speaker 1:          08:24          So it's a really cool group of people. But yeah. But I, it was speaking on the, I'm the villain, the, you know, good guys and been like, no one's really like, you know, most people want to do good. Like, I think that's the, the, um, do you guys know the backstory of Psylocke? They people don't, you tell? Well, well, okay, well, back in third grade, Psylocke was a she, but she came from a good family and she had twin brother and then she, uh, and then when they were killed, you know, she has these amazing powers. And to me that when I was a kid, that's what I love. She is like what I thought were the two most coveted powers, you know, to be telekinetic and telepathic. And so she was like, Wolverine, how he was used by people for them to, you know, use his power is to, to do their bidding.

Speaker 1:          09:10          That's what, you know, Psylocke is alone and she's always different. Leaders have always, uh, you know, taken her in and, um, manipulated her so that, you know, they could use her powers. And I think she's always trying to find her, you know, like, uh, you know, a righteous leader to, to follow. And she just happened to get in with the bad guys. So she's really good. She's really strong. She's really smart. She's very loyal. She's always had the wrong leaders. And so if, you know the stories I like, she wasn't, she's not, you know, I'm bad in this movie, you know, but the hope is that in the next one, I mean, I probably will still be bad, but there will be, there's a switch because Psylocke and the comic books she does, you know, become good, but she just needs the right person to the right leader to guide her, the right group, the right family.

Speaker 1:          09:53          And that actually in the complex happens when, you know, the x men world brings her in. Uh, but before that, it's hard. I mean, just in, and that's what I think I always loved about it as a kid was that, you know, I grew up in a military family. We moved around a lot and I'm half Chinese, half white as are you. And, uh, and, and being different, you know, you're always in moving around a lot. Always the new kid. So I'm always the new kid and I didn't look like everybody else. That's what identified with the x men universe. It's that it's the, the people that don't always fit in with everybody else that were ostracized and that the people wanted to, you know, the majority of people want to like put down or eradicate. So for me, I identify with them because when, when they, especially x and a lot, that's all comic book world, right?

Speaker 1:          10:40          Where there's like the, the guy who you know is different and he's fighting against the rest of the world, but an extra, they all United together. And because of that unification, they, the, their differences made them feel special. And I felt like that's what, um, you know, that's what I had in my own family and that's, you know, our differences made us closer and we had this kind of United front against the world. It's interesting in your book you talk about sort of being a misfit and identifying with nerds and nerd culture and I think that's very much who the x men are as well as the I as you've said. Um, what, um, now that you know, you're at the forefront of that and it's, it's cool to like these sort of things. What's, what's been your kind of favorite revelation? Um, now that geeks rule the world and all that.

Speaker 1:          11:26          Oh, uh, what is my favorite revelation of geeks ruling the world? Well, what's, what's like the most fun thing for you now that it's mainstream and it's, it's cool like the x men and it's cool to go to comicon and it's cool then I think, um, I think that's, it's a good, it's a really good question. It's a cool feeling. And if it's a good feeling, as a strong feeling, it's a confident feeling where there's people that want to judge people by way they look, um, and or by the their interests or by their ethnicity or their religion. All of a sudden those people like the bullies, they're the people who look down on you there. They're no longer the cool ones. And in fact, anybody who looks down on somebody for who they are, their interests, uh, the rest of the rest of the world, they just know it's just not, it's not cool and they know it's not cool.

Speaker 1:          12:19          Usually like when people, like I felt like growing up, like that's what, you know, it kind of, you get ostracized and people are always afraid to stand up to the bullies because you don't want to get picked on next. But I think the tides have changed and it's, um, and it's, it's everybody is free to embrace their individuality. And I think that's the change. Like when now it being a geek is cool. I just think that means that being an individual is cool and excellent. I think we'll be great and I love it and I'm super excited, but I know it's going to be a fantastic movie and I know how hard everybody would, but he works to make it an amazing movie for the fans and make it really exciting and fun. We are all very excited to see x men and thank you so much for joining us today. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          13:01          Thanks for having me guys. Hey, high five. All right.
