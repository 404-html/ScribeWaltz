Speaker 1:          00:00          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:09          The black men of the community could not play hall. He was away. Hockey teams in the area, they were just segregated. We've got some season ticket holders that are complaining about bringing you here at to answer everything. All the name calling the n word. I heard it all.

Speaker 3:          00:27          He got death threats. You're playing the white man's game. No, you can compete with the best gear. The wrong college. For 12 years we've been coming to hockey and he's only the second one we've ever seen.

Speaker 2:          00:42          Was there a discrimination issue or was it simply a fact that he was too proud to go to the minor leagues and you can find good arguments on both sides. There was racial slurs

Speaker 3:          00:53          every corner. Only way to get back at him when

Speaker 4:          01:06          race, like so many other things serve as a distraction and the minute you allow it to distract to, you'll never reach your destination. It doesn't matter what color you are. If you want to do something, you're going to do it and don't let anybody tell you you can't do that. Why wouldn't you play basketball or while you play football? And I'm like, why can't I play hockey? What's wrong with it?

Speaker 3:          01:37          Cause when the,

Speaker 4:          01:40          I didn't realize this at that time at that I have to have real barriers and

Speaker 3:          01:44          open doors. Big tried to get rid of us.

Speaker 4:          01:48          Our job is to keep building. You got guys like Wayne Simmons and Chris Stewards and Dk,

Speaker 3:          01:59          my soul on at Snyder,

Speaker 4:          02:01          you got a dream to be a hockey player and he wasn't going to let anybody take that away from him. They made it so much easier for us to come up and enter play and to know to not think about color as as a, as a factor. You know, it's just based on our steel amount on our college is just given me so many opportunities and the only reason why I even have that opportunity is because of that.

Speaker 1:          02:25          Nice.

Speaker 4:          02:29          You owe it to yourself and you're playing a sport to know your history,

Speaker 3:          02:37          especially if you're black.

Speaker 1:          02:40          Wow. All right. I can't begin to tell you how excited I am to be moderating this panel today. We've got a, an esteemed group of panelists on the stage today. And I'd like to briefly introduce each of them to you. And I'm sure each of them have the opportunity to give them, give you all a little bit more color I into who they are. But on the very far end we've got Kwame mason who is the director and producer of soul on ice.

Speaker 3:          03:08          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:12          we have living history right next to him. Mr Willy. Oh sorry. It was the first black player in the NHL. We have Anson Carter who is a former NHL player, including many teams like the capitals, Bruins, rangers, local. Yes. Yup, Yup. And last but not least, we have Jessica Berman who is the VP of special projects and uh, corporate social responsibility for the NHL.

Speaker 1:          03:44          So amongst other things, certainly we're going to talk about soul on ice today, but we're also going to talk about the evolution of, of the NHL, particularly as it relates to, uh, to black folks. And I will tell you in full transparency and honesty, I am not the biggest hockey fan that sits in front of you. Uh, I'm a fan of sports overall. Um, and I will tell you without hesitation that, uh, this documentary, this film opened up an entire new world for me in not only understanding the sport, uh, but understanding the evolution of the sport and understanding, um, the culture within the sport, but a even more so than things, uh, the many things that the NHL is doing in terms of diversity and continuing to grow the sport. Uh, overall. So let's go ahead and start with you upon me and, uh, talk about a little bit about more about your background, but what was the inspiration for creating this film?

Speaker 5:          04:36          All right, well first of all, it's wanted to thank Google for having us here. It's a real honor and I'm really pleased to be here with these great people who I've gotten to know, uh, over the last couple of years to just talk about a hockey and, uh, we're, we're trying to do, to grow the game. Uh, for myself, I was a radio announcer for 14 years and I'm in 2005. I ended up working in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and a over there over there. It's, it's, it's like that's just a bed of hockey. And, um, you know, I was really fortunate to meet and hang out with a lot of the Edmonton Oilers and they would send me to a lot of games and sitting in the audience, they're just how beautiful that game is for those who haven't been to a live hockey game. You got to, you have to go and see one man because it's just incredible.

Speaker 5:          05:28          And I'm looking at that and looking at the speed, the athleticism and all that, and getting to know a lot of the guys off eyes. The first thing that came to my mind was something that I used to think about when I was a child, which was, how come there's still not a lot of black athletes played hockey. And, um, you know, in that thinking, I've thought to myself, you know, there are, or I was seeing a lot of young guys coming up. I was watching answer Carter. I mean, you know, I remember sitting in my room watching, um, uh, an Olympic game. Uh, and answer and scoring the winning goal. I remember how long it took to get that, that, uh, the, the referee to call the goal. And I was just sitting there by myself and just so happy for him. And, um, you know, I would go on my computer and I would Google a black hockey players and I would get this list of guys and I'd be reading these stories.

Speaker 5:          06:23          And then one day I found out about the colored hockey league of Nova Scotia and I was at my, in my thirties at this time, not really bothered me because here I am a black Canadian and hockey is our second language and nobody taught me about this. So I started to gather a lot of information and I put it aside and I said to myself, you know, this would be a really cool documentary one day to talk about, you know, black history and hockey. And so we fast forward to a 2011 and something really tragic in my life happened where my mom had cancer. And I, um, I remember sitting on her bed in the hospital and talking about what I was going to do in the future because as a mother, she was very conservative. And I said, you know, I got this idea to do this documentary about hockey players and she just told me the best advice ever, and she said, just go for it.

Speaker 5:          07:14          So after she passed, I, um, I just cut my head and I put my head down and I started gathering information, making some phone calls, uh, and trying to do the best I could to kind of put something like this together. And so, you know, fast forward to 2011 I saw my first interview and from then on it just kinda snowballed and it was a loan. Let's talk about that a little bit more, right? I mean, first time filmmaker, yes, I watched the documentary and you're fine to a bunch and you must have been in a number of different cities to have gotten all this done. Um, you know, was there a funding behind this? Like how, how did you make this happen? Well funding was me selling my condominium, which in the case, yeah, I would advise that for any filmmakers out there. But you know, I was, I'm so passionate about the sport, I'm so passionate about black history and it just was a great mesh.

Speaker 5:          08:11          And you know, if no one was going to invest in me, I figured out how to invest in myself because I thought like nobody was telling that story. So if I just said, well, I don't have money right now, might as well just wait. I Dunno how long I was going to have to wait. So, um, and I had already quit my job, so I had to do something. So, uh, I had, I had some capital and I had two great family back in Toronto and they just said, do what you gotta do. So I sold my condominium and then use that money to, to just kind of help fund going to different places and uh, yeah. And again, you know, being a first time filmmaker, not necessarily having a name that's a household name, right. Getting the likes of Mr O'ree and some others

Speaker 1:          08:56          to participate. Um, you know, tell us an easy, it wasn't easy.

Speaker 5:          09:00          I think at the end of the day for me it was, you know, trust, you know, I remember talking to Anson on the phone, you know, in the early stages and telling him what I was, what I wanted to do. And you know, um, George La rock was a great guy that I had known in Edmonton. So, you know, he was the first person, one of the first NHL guys that I was able to shoot. And then I already shot Mr Herb Carnegie. And from there I think guys started to trust and I answer the past man, I just pestered, I just called and I called, I called and I, I mean the first time I met Willie I just passed it. That's a good Italian man. I just Kinda, hey listen, can I interview you? Hey, can I interview you? Where are you going to be all interviewed? And you know, I just, I literally rolled up on Mr Orion.

Speaker 5:          09:46          I said, I'm going to come to San Diego. And I went interviewed and the day I went to San Diego to interview him, he wasn't even at home. His wife was at home and she didn't answer the door and she's calling to some young guy with the camera equipment outside and he came home and uh, we did the film, we did the interview. But uh, it's just perseverance, which is the, to me, the theme of the film, which is perseverance through adversity. The adversity for me was as a first time filmmaker, you know, nobody was going to give me money for this. Nobody who is going to just let me into their homes. I had to keep persevering and I had to keep telling them that, you know, you know, this is something very important and I think, you know, answering those guys can probably say that. You know, they saw how serious I was so they let me have there

Speaker 1:          10:28          to stay on the theme of perseverance for a moment. And we're going to go deep dive with Mr v and just a moment, but can you give a little bit of color around, there was many narratives in the documentary, but talk a little bit more about Jane Lindo and kind of how that was kind of a bit of an anchor in the, in the uh, he, he went through some things clearly.

Speaker 5:          10:47          Yeah. Well, you know, I, I wanted to show our young man that was going through his last year of the Ohl, you know, just, you know, his draft year and there's a couple of the guys that could have, you know, really got Josh Hill sang was a slave to go in the first round. So that was a big name. That would be a great story. But I really wanted to show somebody that I felt was kind of like an underdog that was kind of under the radar and just to see what would happen with them. And you know, Jaden comes from a really well established family. And one of the things I wanted to do was I wanted to show the black family unit, you know, mother, father and supporting a young kid because so many times when we see film narratives, you always have the broken home. I wanted to show a complete home and I wanted to show that hockey is something that is a very family oriented sport and you need your family there. So I thought that their family was a great unit, had a great story to tell. And you know, Jason was a great kid that when I first met up with him, he was this shy kid and just throughout the, you know, the year that I kind of worked with them, his confidence grew and, and unfortunately

Speaker 1:          11:54          he had a knee injury but it didn't stop him from getting drafted at the end. And he was able to just, you know, hear his name being called. And I thought that was very important to show these young kids that, you know, you don't have to be the superstar guy, but as long as you work hard, somebody is going to recognize that. That's right. That's right. Perseverance, perseverance through adversity. So let's, uh, let's stay on that theme and we're going to transition a bit over and speak to a, uh, a living legend. Mr O'ree, uh, who in 1958 became the first black NHL player. Um, Miss Story, clearly you were featured in the film. Um, tell us a little bit about your journey, your largely and widely recognized as being the Jackie Robinson of, of ice hockey, if you will. Um, tell us a bit about your journey and then talk a little bit about that comparison and what, what that kind of means to you and whether or not you are in agreement with that or not. Well,

Speaker 6:          12:49          well, I met Jackie Robinson and two occasions. I met him in 1949 and then I met him again in 1962. But, uh, again, um, I was the youngest of 13 children and, um, uh, I was, uh, born in Fredericton, New Brunswick, and, uh, there were only my older brother and myself that played hockey. My, my sister were into basketball and, um, some other sports. But, uh, uh, at the age of three, I started skating, uh, uh, in my backyard and I started playing organized hockey at the age of five. And like all Canadian, uh, boys and girls, you know, there's, there's ice all over the place and I had a rink in my backyard. I used to escape the school. Um, then my life was when I was, um, when I was 14 years of age, I decided I wanted to become a professional hockey player and thanks to my older brother who was not only my brother and my friend, but he, he was my mentor.

Speaker 6:          13:45          And, uh, when he found out that a, I wanted to play hockey and hopefully play professional and then hopefully one day playing in the national hockey league, um, he gave me all the support that a, that a brother could give. So, um, I left my hometown at a, at 17, went up to Quebec to play my first year junior, uh, with the Quebec Front neck coach Phil Watson. Um, was the instructor who played with the New York Rangers back in the forties. Uh, that was my first year. My second year I spent in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, um, coach, uh, uh, Black Jack Stewart. Um, what's the second coaching then? You know, back then, none of the players weren't helmets, no face shields, no face guards. Goldie's didn't wear any mass though. You're, you know, you're facing head was exposed to pucks and sticks and everything else that was flying around on the ace.

Speaker 6:          14:35          And, um, when unfortunate accident, uh, I'm in front of the net, slapshot a ricocheted the puck come up and struck me in the right. I hit me flat, broke my nose, a proud of my cheek, and I remember dropping down to the ice. And the next thing I know I'm being placed in an ambulance and taken to the hospital. Uh, I'm in my hospital bed. Dr. Henderson was the surgeon, uh, come in and stood by my bedside in my recovery. Roman said, Mr [inaudible] says, I'm sorry to inform you. He says the, uh, the impact of the puck complete d shattered the retina and your right eye and he says, you're going to be blind and you will never play hockey again. Well, I'm 19 years of age and the goals and dreams that I had set for myself of playing professional and hopefully playing in the national hockey league were gone.

Speaker 6:          15:20          So I laid in my hospital bed and um, I get out of the hospital and then the next three days, within the next 10 days, I'm back on the ice. Um, practicing and a, and playing. The only difference I felt about myself, uh, I just couldn't see it on my right eye. Now imagine being a left hand shot and to playing left wing. So to compensate, I had to turn my head all the way around to the right to pick the puck up with my left thigh. And I was overskating the puck and missing the net. And I said, Willie, what's wrong? So I just said, forget about what you can't see and concentrate on, but you can see. So my game started to pick up, but it started scoring some goals and now the season's over and uh, I either have to turn pro the next and the next season or play amateur.

Speaker 6:          16:02          And I was keeping my fingers crossed that I, it would be contacted by professional team. So I returned home to my hometown and punch him luck, who was the coach and general manager of the Quebec cases. The professional team up in Quebec contacted me and said, well, he says, uh, I watched you play the last couple of years. He says, I'd like to invite you to training camp. So I went to training camp and uh, I made the team, but I didn't disclose the fact that I couldn't see it. I'm a writer. I never took an eye exam. So I said, if you're good enough to make the team with one eye, he said, don't, don't worry about it. So I made the team, uh, we won the championship that year. That, that's what gave me the extra confidence that I needed to, um, to go on and a and play pro hockey.

Speaker 1:          16:44          That is incredible. So, so let me, not only were you the, he had the, the kind of weight of being, you know, being pulled up with the Bruins. Right, right after they had some injuries, right. Being the first black player in the NHL, you had site only in one eye this entire time, which was an additional load on top of you. A at the same time.

Speaker 6:          17:07          Yes. I went to the Bruins, a training camp in two occasions in 1957 and 58 and they didn't take any eye exams. They were more concerned about your physical condition. And I always, I always kept myself in good shape. I worked out in the summertime and worked in the gym. So when I went to training camp, I was probably one or two pounds a away from my playing weight. So a, when they called me up on January the 18th, 1958 to play two games against the Montreal Canadians. Um, when I stepped on the ice that Saturday night in Montreal, uh, against the Montreal Canadians, uh, and became the first black player to play in the, in the national hockey league. It was, it was just a thrill for me. I had a, I was no stranger to the Montreal fans because I had played against a Montreal junior Canadians in the forum and played against the Montreal royals, the professional team in the form. Um, when I skated on the ice that evening, I was just, well, you'll read what the Bruins Jersey on and I could see fans pointing it in my direction and uh, uh, wondering, oh, we just a black player. You know what, put the Bruins with number 22.

Speaker 1:          18:13          I can tell you it's hard enough to play with two good eyes. The national one is impressive. Listen, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to put it all together in my head about how that worked out. You almost have to like take a day and just walk around like this and see how hard that is. And then the magic day and an hour with flying projectiles at a 60 miles, some odd miles an hour. Can we look back on your professional career, Mr [inaudible]? Like, can you, can you recall one particular moment that was a highlight and maybe one particular moment that was a low light for whatever reason? Well,

Speaker 6:          18:49          the highlight was when I first scored my goal in the, uh, in the national hockey league, it was, uh, January, the first new year's night in Boston against the Montreal Canadians. Uh, we're warming up, one of my teammates, a Bronco Horvath's. I said, well, if you ever get in on Hodge, uh, keep the puck Mo. He's weak on low shots, keep it away from his club. Uh, Jacques Pont, who was the number one goal? He was out, uh, and Charlie Hodge was the backup goalie. So we're, uh, we're skating around and um, he says, remember now if you get in low, low on him. So it was the third period. And I remember I had just broken away from my check and I'm, I'm busting down the left wing and a little boy been one of my defenseman just hit me with a perfect pass. I didn't have to break stride.

Speaker 6:          19:34          So I'm going in on a, on the defenseman and I go, uh, get the defensemen out of position. Now I'm going in on Hodge and I got my head up and all of a sudden I could hear this loan, Willie low wind and shoot the puck. And it either was right along the ice or just was off the ice and hit the inside of the post and went in. That made it three to one for the Bruins. And then about seven minutes later, the honoree the pocket rocket scored the second goal and uh, made it three to two. But the goal that I scored a was the winning goal. And, um, the Bruins fans gave me a two minute standing ovation. I'll never forget it. It was quite an evening. That's phenomenal. And traps one low, late if there is one, a low life. Uh, uh, yes, a little life.

Speaker 6:          20:17          It was my first trip in Chicago. Um, one of the, one of the original teams in the original six. Um, there was, um, I was warming up and I won't mention his name, but one of the players I'm big right hander came around and gave me a two hander rate across the ankles as we're warming up and he looks up and he's John and they made a racial remark, but that didn't bother me. So anyway, the, the warm ups over, we come out, the first period's about minutes into the first period. There's, um, I'm in behind the net and I got the puck and I'd dump it out to a, my winger and I'm this player come in and he caught me on my blind side. I couldn't see him. And he stuck about six inches out in his stick and he hit me a split my nose, not per two front teeth out.

Speaker 6:          21:03          And, uh, my teeth just dropped down in the ice and now he's just standing there and these kind of, he made a racial remark, but that isn't what set me off. He, uh, he just stood there and smiling. Now he was about six, three and I was five, five, eight, five, nine. So I took a, I took my stick and I hit him right over the head with it and I cut in for a number of stitches and then my, my stick broke. Now I know we're going to fight. So I dropped my gloves and he grabbed the much bigger and he hit me a couple of times and we'd go back up against the screen. And the first thing I said, just hold on when he just hold onto him so he can hit. Meanwhile the bolts, benches emptied all the Chicago Black Hawks come out of their bench.

Speaker 6:          21:42          All the Bruins come out of their bench. And there was, there was 92 minutes and penalties assessed on the players. Now, uh, I go into the room and they stitched me up and plug my nose and at least I want to come back and sit on the bench with the, with the team. But the coach, Milt Schmidt, said, Willie, he says, these, these fans became so violent that I, I'm, I'm worried about you getting Bartling harm. So I had to stay in the dressing room. Um, and they had two police officers outside the dresses and the whole, the entire game. Now this was six minutes into the first period. And, uh, I stayed in there and at the first thing I, I did is I just turned the lights out and I sat there and I kind of meditated for a couple of minutes and then I turned the lights back on and I said, no, Wiliam says, uh, if you're going to leave the league, uh, it stopped because some, some jokers is trying to get you out of, um, you have the skills and the ability to play in the league at that time.

Speaker 6:          22:34          So, um, basically that was opposed the worst one, the next, the next trip. And it was a, I'm not as bad, but I finally gained the respect of not only in the players on the opposition, but fans in the stands. That's right. But you did meet him later on in life. I met him 30 years later. Um, well many, but it's the, um, the NHL. All Star game was in Chicago. I got an invitation through the hockey club and uh, and then they call me on the phone and I said, well, why are you inviting me 30 years after I left the league? Why didn't you invite me five years or 10 years? They said, well, we realize that you, you broke the color barrier and we'd like you to come to Chicago. So the, um, my wife and I went to Chicago and I had a reunited with the players that I hadn't seen in 30 years.

Speaker 6:          23:23          So we're sitting in, sitting at a table, she did for 10 and my wife wanted to a glass of wine and there wasn't any on the table. So I said, well, I'll go to the bar and get one. So I walk out to the bar and the buyer was, it was about 30 feet long and I walk up and I asked the bartender a glass of red wine, please. Now who comes beside me? Is this a gentlemen I had just about to say his name? But this gentleman I had the altercation with, and, uh, he, you know, he's tall and he looks down and he says, hello, are you, what's going on? And I look not too bad. And I said, well, let's get it on because I was ready to go after 30 years. I had his number and I said, let's get it on here. But he, uh, he went this way and I, and I went that way. We never, we never met again, but that, that was about the only one. The only time,

Speaker 7:          24:11          well that's good to hear, cause under the circumstances I can imagine that over the course of time, uh, you could have had a number of different incidents like that. And so, you know, this is a story certainly of perseverance, patience and evolution. Uh, and as a function of that, let's, let's kind of move on and speak to the answer and for a little bit. Uh, you know, interestingly enough, there wasn't another black hockey player after Mr [inaudible] until 1974. That's quite a bit of time. Right. And certainly you didn't start playing in 1974 but was born in 74 [inaudible] want to get your perspective right. Um, as a black hockey player who had a successful career, uh, you know, what, in listening to those types of stories, how the league from your eyes may have kind of evolved over time and, and what your experience in the league was like in, in juxtaposition to that.

Speaker 7:          25:02          And maybe some of the things you've noticed as it's, as it's evolved over time and it's definitely evolved. I mean I know from when Willie played too, when I played, it's come a long way. Like society in general has come a long way and I will say that Sports Mirror society and vice versa. But when I was coming up and playing the national hockey league, there wasn't very many of us playing. I mean it's, fortunately Kwame is talk about Evanston. Our team at Edmonton, we had a lot of black players in our team. It happened to him. Good Shawn Brown walking gauge myself, George will rack. And that's kind of how I was used to playing hockey in Toronto because, and I'm from Toronto and everyone plays hockey as a kid. It doesn't matter what color you are, what your background is. My parents were Beijing from Barbados, so it was hard enough to convince them to let me play hockey.

Speaker 7:          25:44          My parents, you know, ice, what you find ice in your drinks. Like that's where you find nice. So that's what I had to overcome to allow them to allow, let them let me play hockey. But I was in another black player playing on my team and of hockey, so it wasn't a big deal. And so I went to high school and then I went to high school and hockey became a quote unquote white sport, which blew my mind cause I played basketball, I played baseball, I played every other sport under the sun, actually went to Michigan State to play hockey and baseball. And I played everything under the sun. But I got to high school and the hockey wasn't cool again with my black friends and it didn't really register with me because I guess my parents said I'm stubborn and I don't really care.

Speaker 7:          26:23          People say people think so. I just kept it moving. I didn't really listen to my friends were saying and I went to Michigan State and reporters said to me one time, he was like, ants and how does it feel being a black hockey player? I sat and looked at him. I was like, well, I don't know how it feel to be a white hockey player, so I couldn't tell like that's who I am. That's me and I've never thought about it any differently. But coming to the league, the really wasn't for myself personally. There wasn't any situations where I had any differences with my fellow teammates because I was black and there were white. Like when my best friends, Johnny Nina [inaudible] finished guy could look toy more different than myself. Okay. Finish. She's from the north. My parents are Caribbean or from Toronto. I'm black, he's white and he loves heavy metal.

Speaker 7:          27:04          I Love Dance Hall. Reggae music and hip hop and we'd always arguing with the drive to the rink all the time and Evans him because he'd have his Metallica blaring and I come in, I try to change the station and he come into my truck, I've got Buju Banton played or Jay z or or or or Tupac or someone playing. But eventually as we developed our friendship, we became to appreciate each other's differences. So there's times now there's like Metallica playing in my car and I'll turn it up. My kids like what in the world? He listened to Dan, I was like, that's a ghost. He said, listen to. So I listened to it now too and I appreciate it and he sends me text messages all the time saying, well hey, listen to us, listen to a reggae song. It was like we're in Finland, they play Reagan.

Speaker 7:          27:41          But that was the cool thing about playing hockey. Like we all had our differences. We might not have interacted with each other on that level or we might not have, if we never played the game of hockey. You have to be able to come together and play at the highest level. I mean this is a beautiful thing. Let's talk about that a little bit more for a second. Right? So you know, having played in the league, right, but somebody who was clearly talented in other sports, right. And we see a lot of times these days are athletes that could easily play a number of different, what would be your pitch for a young brother coming up who was trying to figure out whether he wanted to go baseball, football, just making it up, right? Or hockey. I'm like, well what would your pitch to say? I think Kwame said it best and he was like, you have to come to a game.

Speaker 7:          28:22          You need to go there and experience it live to see the size, the speed, the skill, the athleticism, the hand eye coordination that players need to play, the reflexes to play the game at that level. That's what will draw you in. Like I love playing basketball. Like there was no better feeling than Dunkin on somebody when I play basketball. Like I've loved it. But scoring a goal had that same exact emotion. That same feeling though brought energy, you know, hitting a baseball out of the park. I love that feeling. But you score a goal, same exact thing, jumping into the glass. That's pure emotion. I couldn't find that in any other sport. So I would tell people, and I tell kids in particular, go to a game or watch a game. Once you go to a hockey game, like you're hooked. I mean, now you've got HDTV.

Speaker 7:          29:03          So it's way better than standard def. So you could find out where the puck is. And I tell if hockey fans will atomic don't fall. The puck fall the fall of the game. When you follow the flow of the game, the puck's gonna find you. Absolutely. And that's a great answer. Um, and a question for the, for the three of you and then we'll, we'll transition to Jessica here. But um, having been most recently in the league, it's, and can you please explain to folks what a line is and beyond that kind of your prediction on when there may be a first all black pop. So we almost came close to them and say, no, it was myself, Lake George. We'd always petition our coach and Craig McTavish is our coaching wanna say Mac let us play together and we have Brownie Shawn Brown defense, let Brownie play forward.

Speaker 7:          29:44          This one shifts. We could down like the old brother live speaking in brother. When I was in Vancouver a few years ago when I played my call my last couple of years in the league and I had myself from the sateen twins and that was our nickname, the bro the line because Dan and Hanks, the Dean and myself, I think you're gonna see it eventually. I mean there's just gonna be a time when you're going to see enough players playing on a team where they're going to come together and form an all black line. Like I think it's one of the amount of time when you see that coming once the number of years, five years, I would say five years or so. I mean it has to start more at the grassroots level that we're seeing that right now you're seeing kids coming up now playing grass talky and once those numbers start to increase your base increases because when you're playing in the NHL levels, it's a pyramid. So you have the best of the best playing. But if your base is a lot wider than that pyramid up top gets a little wider as well.

Speaker 1:          30:33          Right. Well that's a great segue actually to talking with Jessica and, and finding out a little bit more about what the NHL is doing as it relates to this. Um, NHL, full transparency, one of the, one of the later professional leagues to integrate. Um, but doing some of the research for this, I was, I was pleasantly surprised, um, at just the amount of kind of operational work that has gone into diversity within the league and continues. I mean, I, I read a little bit about, uh, they're being kind of a mandatory diversity training pre seasoned for folks that come into the league. Uh, and certainly the work that you're doing with, um, hockey is for everyone. Um, and you know, having been from growing up in Flatbush Brooklyn, I'm sure that you've been, you've grown up in, in are aware of very diverse places and have been in diverse situations and clearly your job at the national hockey league continues to perpetuate that. Can you tell us a little bit about um, the why you guys are doing the things that you're doing and give us a sense of, of, of how, by the way, yes. Black history month is a, is a, is a time of frame that we can shine the light on the things that you're doing, but uh, how these things are happening year round.

Speaker 8:          31:41          Sure. Thank you. And on behalf of the NHL, thank you for hosting this. We talk a lot about reaching new audiences and so this is a great opportunity for us and really appreciate it. Um, before I answer your question, I just have to say I'm hearing Anson Story, um, really hits home for me. It's the reason that I do what I do. It's the reason that I always wanted to work in sports. The idea and the platform that sports brings people together is what inspired me to want to work in sports. From my 16 year old, uh, birthday, my family took me to a hockey game. I had never been to a hockey game. My brother was a football player. Um, I was a cheerleader and had for basketball and football games and grew up in a very diverse community. I went to public school and there was a moment at this game where the magic of the game really took over and the energy in the stands, but also on the, and the islander scored.

Speaker 8:          32:41          And, uh, we were sitting right behind a two gentlemen. It was a kind of the story you were just saying. A black and a white person, um, who seem to not know each other and the islander scored and they embraced and they embraced enthusiastically. And I, um, for those who know me know I'm quite inquisitive, so, and I'm not shy. So I, uh, I tapped them on the shoulder after the moment passed and I said, do you guys know each other? And they said, no. Are you season ticket holders? Nope, please help me understand this moment. Like why I watched you embrace and cheer and hug and high five and each other's families. And they said the moment of that goal brought us together. And at that moment I turned to my parents or with me and said I need to work in hockey. And that could have probably happened in other venues and other contexts.

Speaker 8:          33:38          But having grown up in a place that was challenged with racial issues, I was always very interested in how to bridge gaps in our community in Brooklyn. Um, and that moment was like, well this is the path to do that. This creates that unification, that platform where all of the differences strip away and the pure passion that exists just brings them together instantly. And what I was always wondering is if those two people saw each other outside of that venue, is there carry over that. That was the thing that always sort of fascinated me and still fascinates me when I work on diversity initiatives and the idea that sports is a place where we can model that behavior. And your story with your teammate really hits home for me. Um, and is there a carry over beyond that person? So do you look at, and does he look at people who are different from him in a different way, through a different lens after having that experience where your mind was opened to his world in his mind was open to your world.

Speaker 8:          34:36          So that's just a had to share that because I'd never heard that story. And um, that's really what draws me to what I do. But to answer your question, the Nhl has been, um, and probably a lot of people don't know it has been working on diversity initiatives for more than 20 years. Um, we hired Willie in 1998 as our diversity ambassador. He has been traveling from city to city, market to market, inspiring the next generation of people, but also hockey players to give our sport, to try whether you're a fan or a player. And, um, when we think about why we do that and we challenge ourselves as to the why, um, I think there's really three reasons. The first is that, and the commissioner always says this, it's the right thing to do. Um, we believe in equality and we believe that everybody should have access to our sport.

Speaker 8:          35:32          And um, so we always do it because it's the right thing to do. And the values of sport really perpetuate that and make that authentic. And when you see it in the people who have played our sport and you hear her aunt's in and you hear Willie, and really if you know, hockey players, whether they're playing at the highest level or even in a grassroots program, hockey players are unique in that they have these values that are all about teamwork and humility and resilience and hard work and sacrifice and dedication. And it really creates an environment where we, we say with our partners, if you can play, you can play, you know, if you can contribute as a member of our team, we want you on our team. And, uh, we were actually talking earlier and, and both Willie and ants and have both said, um, although they experienced racial slurs from fans and definitely from posing players among their teammates, they didn't experience that.

Speaker 8:          36:33          Um, and that's because our sport is really all about what you bring to the table. So the culture of our sport. The second thing is that we know particularly today more than ever before and even for the last five or 10 years, there's a demographic shift happening in North America and we want to be relevant. We want to bring new audiences into our game. And so from a hockey is where everyone perspective, this is in addition to being black history month, also hockey's for everyone month, which is a month where we shine a light on all of the diversity inclusion activities, initiatives, partnerships, community engagement, um, that all of our teams and the League do of course they do that year round through grassroots programming and boys and girls club support and all kinds of other outreach into diverse communities. But February is a time where we, where we celebrate that.

Speaker 8:          37:27          So, um, again, the second reason is really just to introduce our game to new audiences. And then the third is kind of going back to what everyone was just talking about, which is we need to increase the diversity and the pipeline into our game. And so we have 26 hockey's for everyone programs across north North America, um, that bring tens of thousands of kids into our game. We're working on strategies to help them, um, to transition into competitive hockey because playing the game at a recreational level is really important. Um, and we want people to be able to do it on a casual basis, but if we want to change the demographic of who's playing on the NHL on our stage, and we all know the saying, you have to see it to want to be it true. Um, we need to find ways to help people to transition to elite hockey who looked different from our traditional population of players. So, um, I would say those are kind of the three for the reasons of the why.

Speaker 1:          38:26          That's great reasons, great reasons. And it really shines a light on the uniqueness of the sport and what you all are doing in, in these stories really give context, uh, around, around all of it and, and make it, make it real. And for me personally, um, you know, call me the work that you've done, uh, has really opened up my world to, to the sport in a way that I could have never imagined. Um, and has gotten me interested. I mean, I've been to one hockey game. I will tell you the truth. I've been the one professional hockey game and this everything you said it was, I mean it's very large individuals who have grace and talent and there's a lot of beauty in the sport when you really get the opportunity to, um, to view it live. Um, and now to really kind of understand the framework and the tapestry that is behind it all really makes it so more, so much more meaning, so meaningful. So I thank you for bringing that to light and please like kind of in our last minute or so before we open it up to questions on the floor, very interested in understanding what might be next from you.

Speaker 5:          39:30          Oh, in this world. You know, I really, uh, it's, it's weird. I don't, I don't know what's next, but I know my passion lies in hockey and seeing it grow. Um, you know, I've been very fortunate. Like you got to understand, like when I left my job in radio, I didn't know what I was going to do. I had no source of income. I just felt like I need to be with these people. I need to be with this group of people from the Ahl to help grow the game. And I kind of use, I figured I was like, okay, well how do you put in a resume? Why don't you make a film? Why don't you show them that you want to be a part of this and you want to help it grow. And you know, I just been fortunate to work with Jessica like last year they had me on the road showing the film and, and, and, and, uh, talking about it.

Speaker 5:          40:24          And I want to, what I want to do next is I want to help grow the game by telling stories and doing whatever I can to get people in the stands. Because I, you know, like I said, like we say, you know, get them into the arena. You know, I always sit back and think, what if Shaquille Neil's parents that play hockey, what of Coby Brian's parents said, play hockey? What of Lebron James' parents to play hockey? And there's those kids are out there right now. And for the black community I feel we sometimes put ourselves in a box. We say, this is what we do and this is what we don't do. When I grew up, hockey was the white boy sport and I was one of those kids who put myself in a box. And because my friends were black and they listen to hip hop, I just did what they did.

Speaker 5:          41:10          But I loved this game of hockey, but I felt like, oh well, you know, I guess that's what the white boys to play. Then the white friends that I had said, well blacks don't play, it's too cold or your ankles are too short or small. All these idiotic uh, stereotypes. And I just like, okay. And then you have to argue with them. I like, but I did had no context, you know, I didn't have that ammunition to say no. There's a Willie ovary, this Carnegie, right there was a colored hockey league of Nova Scotia that was around in the 1800 [inaudible]. The first professional sports organization for blacks was hockey. It wasn't basketball, it wasn't football, it was hockey. Why are we not celebrating that? And so putting that film together is because of people like you that thought didn't think twice of the game. But if I showed it to you, put some nice little hip hop in there and he's got a lid, did not go unnoticed. You know, I thought that it would make someone go, oh wait a second.

Speaker 1:          42:04          Yeah, so you caught me, you caught me, you know? Well listen folks, we've got about eight or so minutes left. I want to make sure that we open this up to Googlers who are in the audience who would like to ask some questions to the esteemed panel. We've got Mike's on, on both sides. Uh, so if folks have questions, please, let's, uh, let's get into it.

Speaker 7:          42:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:28          Uh, we'll start on this side and then we'll, we'll just go back and forth.

Speaker 7:          42:32          Okay.

Speaker 9:          42:32          Everyone, uh, my name is Chris. Thanks so much for coming out and speaking to us all today. It's been a really awesome to hear. So one of my questions is around, um, kind of like the grassroots and ants and like you were talking about Kinda like the triangle and expanding that base. Um, it's great to hear about the grassroots efforts, but I'm playing hockey myself. A massive part of trying to go pro is kind of facing that point when you were maybe 15, 16, 17 years old, you're going to leave home, you're going to go to a city play for a team where you don't really know anyone, you maybe don't have a support system. You've got to go play juniors to try to get to that next level, um, or private school for that matter. So my thought is what is being done at those areas to kind of offer that support system for maybe, you know, the one kid of color who is now out of, out of his, uh, you know, comfort zone for the first time and maybe facing some adversity. Um, when it comes to that, are there, are there thoughts of support in the junior ranks to try to progress people?

Speaker 7:          43:32          I take that back so I'm not sure, but the junior ranks, um, I just know with myself what I do on a day to day basis, a lot of times people reach out to me when they hear there's a black hockey player playing somewhere and they say, Hey Anson, do you mind talking to him or her and give them a words of wisdom because kind of like let them know exactly what you went through. Because a lot of times what I went through is probably similar to what they are going through or they're going to probably, you know, deal with at some point in their career. So I'm not afraid to reach out to the different players and it doesn't really matter like a Kwame for example, past me, Joshua Ahow sangs number when he played for the New York islanders and he's been in the minors back and forth right now.

Speaker 7:          44:12          And Josh was a professional at of junior kid, but he went through some tough things during training camp there with the islanders and he slept in a, he was getting this bad rap. I think part of it was because he was a black player, you know, you looked at a little bit differently. So I picked up the phone and I made a phone call. It's like, Hey Josh, we never met before but you're messing up. And I didn't use that exact language. But because we're here and we appreciate that, mess it up and I'll tell you why I didn't go through what I went through or will, he didn't go through what he went through for you to come next and set us all back. You know what I mean? So we're not to the point now where you could screw up in everyone's gonna think it's okay, you're still black hockey player and there were still the minority in the sport and there isn't that many of us playing.

Speaker 7:          44:55          So you're going to make you do things properly to set the next guy up the right way. And I thought it went through one year, one or the other. I didn't hear from the kid at all for four year. And then I'm with Kwame and Willie at a hockey in Harlem event last year and this lady walks up to me and she starts crying and you know, Brunette, she's white just to let you know, just put it in context for you. And she's like crying and she's bawling. I was like, what's up? And she's like, I want to thank you. I said, thank me for what she goes, because you change someone's life will change someone's life. And I'm there with the deputy commissioner of Bill Daley and build it and it's like this lady lake, which handles lady. And I was like, I have, we met before and she's like, we haven't met before.

Speaker 7:          45:41          I was like, so what's, how do like put this together for me? And she's like, I'm Joshua his mother. And I was like, oh, okay. And she's like, he didn't call you back. I know that. But what you said to him really made a huge impact and you didn't have to reach out to him, but we appreciate you reaching out and you know, passing on what you had to say to him and now he gets it. So I think it's responsibility for people like myself and people that are still involved with the game that we see Willy doing on a day to day basis with hockey's for everybody travels around, he reaches out and touches, leads these kids. But I think it's my responsibility as a former pro now on national TV with NBC or Msg to reach out to these people in these kids as well and letting them know what I see to make their life a little bit easier.

Speaker 5:          46:22          And Jessica, do you have any, oh, so just to piggyback on what he said, um, you know, one of the things like with um, with Jayden, um, you know, when he was in that draft year, I would take him when I was doing interviews and stuff like that, I would take him to meet these guys because I always thought that that's what they need, that support system. Mike Morrison, who was the second black athlete to play in the NHL got in there and he was 18 years old and he was told it to be the, that black superstar that was going to come out there playing Washington DC because Washington DC at that time was predominantly black, but it didn't go the way we all wanted it. And he just kept going down and going down Gannaway angels. And the one thing he used to tell me was there was no support system for me.

Speaker 5:          47:04          So if he had other black athletes that he could talk to, Lena, you only had one other black player that played within bill Riley, but it was just the two of them. But if he had that support system, things would have changed for them. So I think that's one of the things that, you know, Anson and Kevin Weeks do. And I, I hope that, you know, the, the league will encourage more of them to do is, which is to reach out to these young guys and just say, hello, how you doing? How's your game going? You know, what are you going through? What do you need? Let's talk. Because that's the way it's going to grow. Because sometimes these young black players in these small areas, they feel alone. And one lastly, when I, when the film debuted on the, uh, the NHL Network, I got messages, text messages, um, tweets from parents saying that they sat down with the kids to watch the film and their kid wanted to get back out there and play because they thought they were alone. They thought they were going through this on their own. But when they saw the film and they saw what ants in and William all these guys went through, they said, oh, okay. They persevere. It, I can persevere through adversity and quickly, uh, Jessica from an NHL institutional perspective.

Speaker 8:          48:08          Yeah, no, I'll take a couple more questions. I think. Yeah, I have a little bit more. I'll be, I'll be brief. I think there's extra challenges for minority groups for sure. But the challenges that you're identifying are challenges for everyone, right? I mean, it's hard for everybody to leave home. Definitely more so when you're from a minority population and you, you feel that extra pressure. Um, I'll just say from an NHL institutional perspective, we've been meeting for the last three years with all the governing bodies to talk about ways to open up pathways to the NHL. Um, so hopefully there'll be more to come. We actually announced in September our declaration of principles as a product of those conversations, which is a stake in the ground value statement that 17 leading hockey organizations signed on to. It's kind of like our mission statement, which is that hockey is more than a game and hot, the benefit that hockey gives you is to build character or life skills and all about breaking down barriers. So, um, those discussions kind of range from grassroots all the way up through juniors all the way up to minors, NHL, international. So, um, hopefully there'll be more to come on ways that we can increase all those pathways to the NHL.

Speaker 5:          49:15          Fantastic. I want to get everybody in a, I think we started just a little bit late so maybe they'll grant us a couple more minutes to, to get through. But we'll go over here and then we'll come back over here and then we'll, we'll wrap up.

Speaker 10:         49:25          Hi. Thank you all so much for coming again. Um, in addition to growing our player base, in terms of diversity, I think we also as hockey fans want to grow our fan base in terms of diversity. And so I'd be interested in hearing the panel's opinion on what things we should be doing is hockey fans and as the hockey community to make ourselves, you know, I'm, I'm more open environment, uh, for that.

Speaker 5:          49:46          I think if you know somebody in the minority community that's never been to encourage them to go to a game, I would, you know, I think that's one of the best thing to do is to say, Hey, come to a game with me and just give it a try. They might be like, ah, it's too cold. Just be like, listen, put on a jacket, let's go and just get them into an arena and just expose them to the game. And it doesn't even have to be a professional game. It could be a minor league game cause you know, Games are games and they're just fun to watch.

Speaker 8:          50:12          I'll say from a policy perspective, we talk a lot at the league level about creating an inclusive environment. So, um, I think part of that is us making sure we have proper fan code of conduct and that everybody's on board as to what is and isn't appropriate behavior. But I always say it's also the fans job to create in it peer to peer accountability. So when I'm in the stands, even with my family and I hear inappropriate language, I'll say something to them like, we don't want that in our arena. And um, you can even see NHL teams during hockey's for Vermont. Actually yesterday the Pittsburgh Penguins responded to some negative on social and said, you know, we don't, we don't want that in our game. And so, um, the louder and more engaged the positive message is, the more those people who are negative and creating and not inclusive environment will quiet down and go away. And that'll open up the pathways for more nontraditional audience to enjoy our game.

Speaker 11:         51:12          Thank you. So

Speaker 7:          51:16          I think it's really outrageous that willy is not in the hockey hall of fame. What can we do to change that? Be Late to the flight right now cause we've already, we're, we're kind of working behind the scenes. I know several different guys that are on the, the, the panel that decides who gets in, oh I've put the bug in Luke robotize zero bottle Kenzie David poile like I'm all over these guys nonstop because yeah, you know Willie is a living legend and I know not only what he's done for my crew to allow me to put the national hockey league, but also other points like you see these other superstars from around the world. Alex Ovechkin will embrace Willy O'ree and we talk about hockey's for everyone. It's not just minority players, it's European floors, finished player, Swedish players, Russian players. There was a time when European players weren't accepted in the national hockey league.

Speaker 7:          52:01          You heard terms like chicken, Swede or Russians, you can't count in the more. Finns have no clue what they're doing over there on the ice. But part of what willy does and breaking down barriers is letting people know that we could all play this game. So absolutely he can be a builder since 1998 one over 120,000 kids Willie's been, you know, engage with and had conversations with them, encouraging them to play hockey and life lessons that come around and playing hockey. If that's not a builder. Yeah. I don't know what it is. Yeah. I'm sold.

Speaker 3:          52:33          We'll take a

Speaker 7:          52:34          take one more question and then we'll, we'll wrap up.

Speaker 11:         52:38          Thank you all so much for coming to speak here. Um, so this Wednesday I went to a talk on the future of skating in New York and someone there asked a question, um, um, about why in in New York City, the home of three NHL franchises and the NHL itself that the state of, of skating and playing hockey in general is so dismal. Hmm. Um, you know, part of why it's so hard to get into hockey is that it's hideously expensive and it's hard to get ice time. And, uh, people in New York who, um, want to play hockey, um, if they get serious about it, they leave. Um, I was just wondering what you all had to say about that.

Speaker 7:          53:17          Basketball is a New York is a basketball state. Uh, I think, um, you know, I not sure what different communities

Speaker 5:          53:26          are doing, but I think you have to look at it as stages and I think you have to go into these communities, get them interested in, you know, something else. Yeah. It's basically a street hockey and ball hockey. And once you start to attract kids and, and, and the communities and to see how much fun that is, it will transition to wanting to skate. And then parents and families in these communities are going to try to position a petition to get these arenas going. So I think that's one way of doing it, you know, and hopefully that, you know, it will grow.

Speaker 7:          53:59          You're seeing a lot of organizations now to building arenas on the respective cities. That's important that I'll come with lowering the cost of playing hockey. Uh, being from Toronto, there's a rink every block like Starbucks here basically. It's not that expensive, but I hear what you're saying about um, unlimited ice time here in New York City. I think everything in New York in general is just expensive period. But having additional rinks in, a lot of these organizations are doing that right now. And you're asking about trying to get nontraditional fans to get engaged. Kwame is talking about maybe have them come to games, but also just getting to try skating, just try skating and seeing how difficult it is to get up and down the ice. And I've got two daughters, nine 11, and they could skate now, but the first time they figured out how to skate and not actually fall on their butts, they're like, wow, this is amazing.

Speaker 7:          54:45          Yeah. And then I brought him to a hockey game that took of the whole different level because they're like, well, okay, skating is tough, but now these guys are doing this on the ice. Well, someone's going to take their head off at the same time, like out of control. So I think the combination of all those things, I mean you're, you're seeing Adidas now, they're, they're getting involved with Columbia's talk. Most street hockey. I think that's probably the lowest level. And we start looking at trying to get the stick in kids' hands. Yeah. Stick sticking a ball. And once you have that feeling of playing the game, then you want to take it the next level. Because I didn't start playing hockey is as an ice skater, I started ball hockey player. I played street hockey and try like I was a street hockey wizard. One of my friends were like, oh you can't skate. And I had no come back. Then I was like, you're right. But then I figured out how to skate and then I could, you know, start chirping back. Yeah. So I learned from a young age how important skating it. So I think skating and just playing ball hockey or probably one of the keys to that entry level way into figuring out if you want to play the game of hockey or not.

Speaker 8:          55:43          I'll just share two things. First you'd be surprised at how many NHL players didn't start playing ice hockey. They played street hockey, roller hockey. Um, it, it's actually quite staggering when you, when you look at it. Um, I think in addition to providing access to alternative forms of game, there needs to be a culture shift in terms of allowing those players who are not playing ice hockey and not playing a lead hockey to define themselves as hockey players. So if you play street hockey and someone says, do you play hockey? I want those people to say, yeah, I play hockey because hockey is hockey. And so I think we're trying to do a lot more in terms of inclusive messaging on everyone who plays hockey is part of the hockey family. So that those people who are asked like, do you play hockey? Are you a hockey fan?

Speaker 8:          56:28          And they play in their, in their garage or in their driveway can say, yeah, I'm a hockey player. I think the second thing is in terms of, um, access to ice is that the nhls invested a lot of resources in intro to the game, learn to play programs for ages five to nine with the idea that there was a little bit of a chicken and an egg scenario where if you do, we need, we were just talking about it up there about building rinks. Well, who's gonna play in them? Because our, our programs oversubscribed supply and demand from an economic perspective. And you're talking about public private partnerships. What are they going to invest in there? They want to, they want to benefit their communities. So we need to show the demand and in order to show the demand we need to, we need to expand the funnel at the bottom. And so we're really doubling down on that five to nine age range so that we can show that demand in the community at a young age. And that hopefully will spur more investment in facilities, which will help break down barriers from an infrastructure perspective. Awesome.

Speaker 1:          57:27          Uh, well, listen folks, I hope that, uh, all of you are as enlightened as I am after today's discussion and certainly after having seen the documentary, if you haven't seen it, make sure that you do. It's been great to have you all take the time that, so that we could share in your experiences, which have been very meaningful and heartfelt to me and certainly from an NHL standpoint, really giving us a window and transparency into all the great things that you guys are doing that continue to grow and diversify the sport.

Speaker 8:          57:53          Are you a hockey fan now?

Speaker 3:          57:54          I'm a hockey fan. I promise. I will thank all of our panelists. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thanks everyone for coming.
