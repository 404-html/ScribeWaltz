Speaker 1:          00:04          Hello everyone. My name is Qa to justice and I'm an engineering program manager for Google play. And we're honored and excited to welcome director of the movie bell, Amma Asante. Um, everybody give her a round of,

Speaker 2:          00:17          hi, welcome to Google. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:21          Anna, thank you so much for your amazing work and bringing this little known life to the world. Thank you. Really appreciate it. So, um, let's play, let's play the trailer of the film. Um, a group of Google or Scott to see it last night during a screening. I really enjoy this film. I'm glad you're here. And for those that don't know, I'm dido. Elizabeth Bell was discovered from an 18th century painting that was done of her and her cousin. So, um, um, uh, how did you learn about this painting and how did it shape your interest in doing this project? Yeah, so it was really interesting process for me. Um, 2009 I had come off of the back of my first movie, a way of life, which I was lucky enough to win a British Academy award where, and I had been, um, working, developing, writing other projects.

Speaker 1:          01:15          Um, one of them was a Jane Austen adaptation. Other, uh, yeah, um, um, adaptive piece called Lady Susan. And, uh, so I was working with, uh, with a do, uh, producer, um, uh, who had, uh, um, a small company, which was part of new line cinema. And I'm doing all my research because I find that my research is really my education as how I've become educated in any kind of way in life and was really increasingly becoming obsessed with the woman's position in 18th century England in particular. And um, so 2009 comes along and I am working on three different projects and the, the, the, the, the next one is also a project which is kind of looking at, um, a mixed race girl living in Berlin during the 1940s war, Second World War. So really, again, looking at the experience of a person of color in Europe and the Bfi who, um, are the British film institute.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Um, very much involved in my work and my career and financing work that I've done previously. Um, had received an idea, a project from a producer, my producer, it turns out Damion Jones, who had been trying to get a project about Dido's life off of the ground, um, for quite some time now for him. It had started life with a writer at Hbo, um, here in America. And, uh, they'd gone through development. It hadn't quite worked. The project had been dropped. Damien had bought it to England. They had continued with, with the writer and for whatever reason, um, you know, that said they moved on. And so they came to me at, you know, the Bfi said to Damian, have you sent this postcard to Ama? Because she is obsessed with the woman's experience in 18th century England. She's obsessed with people of color in European history and she is an irrepressible romantic and she's just dying to tell a love story.

Speaker 1:          03:17          So, you know, have you sent this to her too, to see what she would make of it? And so, Damian eventually sent me this postcard. Now, I'd never seen the portrait before. Um, but what, what I was lucky enough to have experienced, um, was going to an exhibition in Holland, which is where I live now, which chartered the history of black people in European art from the 14th century onwards. And it was the most fascinating, um, exhibition I've ever been to. And it really looked to us from kind of background, character rent until we came to front and center and eventually became music kind of closer to modern day. But what it showed me was that in the 18th century, we were accessories. When I say, well, you people of color were accessories. So we were there to express the status of the main Caucasian protagonists in the painting.

Speaker 1:          04:11          So we were always painted lower down. We were never looking out or very rarely looking out at the painter. We were always looking are, but the main protagonists without arm reaching out towards them, which would draw your eye towards them. And so when this painting of which is known as bell impact came to me, it, um, it came in the context where I could see it was so different. There is Dido. So beautiful. And I'm happy with this sparkle in her eye, looking directly out at the painter. She's actually painted slightly higher in the painting and wow, it's Elizabeth psalm that is reaching out to her, drawing your eye to her. And uh, it was a revelation to me and what I saw at that point was the opportunity, if I got it right, to tell a story that would combine politics, art and history and race and with the sub themes of love, gender, the women's place, identity, belonging, you know, all of those, I knew it was going to have to be a big story.

Speaker 1:          05:14          So that's where it really started for me. Then it was a process of re research. Um, and going back to, um, you know, finding out exactly what kind of story I would want to tell, how much of that would have to be drawn, affection and how much of it would have to be w need, must be history. What was it like premiering it at the Toronto Film Festival after all of that? It was incredible. Um, my first film had been screened at Toronto Film Festival, but we were very small independent British movie. And whilst bell had been made as an independent movie, it British independent movie. Um, we were, we were, um, brought by Fox searchlight right before Toronto, which was great. And we weren't brought just for, um, the u s or just for the UK. We were bought for the world. We had their might behind us by the time we came to, to Toronto.

Speaker 1:          06:10          And it was quite a different experience having a big studio or a studio like Fox searchlight behind you who was so in love with the story and so much wanting to be part of this story and bringing this story to the world. So it was an incredible experience of something like three minute standing ovation kind. Yeah. More or less. And I'm just the first time that we really felt love for the film from people who had not been involved with it. Yeah. That's awesome. So there's an interesting dichotomy. I'm represented with her name. So there's Dido, which was what her British family called her. Yes. And then there's belt, which was her mother's name. Yes. So why did you choose to title the film bell? Well, in the movie, you know, um, we, we don't ever see her mother. We only hear about, um, and we're seeing this girl in this world, which is completely white apart from Mable.

Speaker 1:          07:07          Um, the maid and I wanted to honor her mother died, his mother, I wanted to, to honor her, even though she could not be physically present in the movie. I wanted it to be spiritually present within our memories. And so as she was Maria Bell, um, and as, uh, she named her daughter after herself. I wanted them to name the film after both of them and, and pay tribute to, to have mother. Ah, very nice. Very nice. Yeah. And so how did, um, how did you connect with Google in Bartow raw as the lead actress for the film? Actually it was, uh, it was, it was a very easy process. The movie that I had talked to you about earlier that were set in Germany, um, which I will shoot in 2015 where hands touch. Um, Google had actually originally come to audition for a, so she'd come in for casting and uh, this young woman stepped into the room and her presence, I was just completely blown away at that time.

Speaker 1:          08:07          So I knew if Gugu um, quite some time passed and she came over to America and she was involved in TV series here and a couple of movies. She was on Broadway with Jude law playing or failure to Jude Law's hamlet. And, um, so time passed and both my producer Damien and I knew of her. Um, and eventually it was time to start coasting. We, we met probably every biracial actress of the right age in the UK. And um, yoga was one of those. Um, but, but Google is smart. She's very, very smart. She understood what I wanted to do with this story. The kind of journey that I wanted to put this character on, which on the surface is very simple. But actually underneath this very complex, she understood that I wanted to take this character from girl to woman with a political awakening in there, that it needed to be a sweeping love story as well as, um, a story that made us feel the emotion of the impact of slavery.

Speaker 1:          09:06          Even though we never actually see a slave. Now, it was very much my wish that, um, we didn't see slaves, but we actually had to feel, we were looking at the laws that supported slavery and we had to fill the impact of slavery from that point of view. And that's because that was a really important reason, which was I wanted to prove that you could put a woman of Color Front and center of an Osti NASC piece of work at a traditional British period drama. And that it would work. Now obviously in the script that Damien had been working on previously, um, you know, which was a very different world. You know, daddy was running around with shells on her ankles and they jumped to Vinay, has an affair with, with, uh, with Elizabeth. And, um, it's, it's, it's, it was good bell and bad and it was a very different movie.

Speaker 1:          09:59          But for, and in that you did, you did see slaves, you did see slaves sort of interludes with slaves kind of floating on the water. And it was kind of a reminder that this is what happened to those over 100 slaves during the Zong case. But for me, I wanted to work from a much more psychological point of view and really look at, well, for me it was important that if I was going to tell a movie that was Austin ass, and that looked at tell society that I also looked at the world that was there and funding that society and the economy of that society, um, and, and the trade that was sponsoring that society and that was the slave trade. So, um, yeah. So it was very important for me to keep it Austin asked, but also make sure that the impact of slavery and was it important that the actress be of mixed race that played the roles.

Speaker 1:          10:50          It was very, very important that she'd be of mixed race being that have we knew that her father was white and her father and her mother was black. It was very, very important that she didn't look completely. Uh, I see completely black. We come in all different shades, but it didn't look like both her mother and father were, um, 100% black or 100% white. It was important that we could see that she was at the junction of race. She is at the junction of status. She is at the junction of all these different themes in the story because the story is really about a woman who comes to a place where she has to combine all of these parts of herself, the child of a slave and the child of an Aristocrat, the child of a black person and shelter of a white person, a woman of color.

Speaker 1:          11:39          Growing up in an aristocratic society and she has to find a way to love all those parts of ourselves, bring them together and be okay with it. So it was very, very important that she looked the mixture that she, she absolutely is. Absolutely. Yeah. Okay. So there's a scene that I thought was really powerful between Mabel the servant in London and bill, um, when she's combing her hair and she's struggling to comb her hair and bell offers to show her how to comb her hair from starting from the end. May Bill offers to show bell, I'm sorry. Yeah, maybe oppositional building. And so I believe that there was a significance there that you wanted to convey to the audience. Was there? Yeah, there was, you know, I was thinking about, um, growing up in a household of people that love you, but our learning trying to understand the right way to love you the way you need to be loved, but people who don't look anything like you, what must that be like?

Speaker 1:          12:38          And it brought me to a place where I was thinking about maternal legacy and the, the things we take for granted, the simple things that we take for granted that our mother passes on to us. And so I had been thinking about cooking and you know, oftentimes it's our mother that teaches us how to cook the food that comes from our community and from our culture. And I thought, well, Dido wouldn't cook for herself, so that's really not going to work. And then I thought, hey, you know, what is something we do every single day we have to deal with every single day. That's like our thing, a woman thing and very much a woman of color thing. And it was hair. And I suddenly thought, you know, no products, uh, you know, no, no, no shampoos, no tools, nothing. Everything geared towards except for the comb.

Speaker 1:          13:29          Exactly everything geared towards a Caucasian woman. And, and, and with nobody there to teach you how to take care of their own health. No one there that knows, no matter how much they say, no one there that knows. And I was thinking about this, and again, this was part of me honoring her mother right the way through the story. So you never see this black woman, but she's there very much in the story and we never forget her. She talks about her right the way through. And I thought the other thing was that I desperately wanted to have another person of color in the movie, which is why I created me to be in the movie. And I wanted to show, you know, in the way that I wanted to show that Elizabeth and Dido Bell have a sisterhood that comes under a lot of pressure, but they remain ultimately essentially connected.

Speaker 1:          14:23          I also wanted to show some connection between bell and a person of color in the movie. And, and so this moment comes in, which, which I find, you know, for myself, you know, when I was putting it together, I found it very hard and sad, but also uplifting at the same time. It was such affection. Yes. With such affection and I, and I wanted it to be that way. Now this is part of three mirror scenes. In actual fact with First Mirror scene is one, one in which data was actually harming herself. You know, she's very uncomfortable with itself. The final one is one word. Data is good with herself. She's happy. You see a small smile. She's coming to that place where she's okay with herself. And the middle scene is a transition. It's reflecting the transition that data is going through and this is off the mirror when they reflect off the mirror and, and uh, Mabel is combing her hair and you see day day relax.

Speaker 1:          15:17          And she's okay with this being around this woman of color. She's, she's relaxed in the kind of sisterhood that this made offers her. And of course this made says, my mom taught me. You see? And, and, and so this middle scene is representing a transition that that data was going through with being okay with a part of herself that society has made her feel like it's a burden. That's awesome. And in fact it was interesting in the painting, they don't, Elizabeth Bell is wearing a turban, so it gives you sort of maybe a hint that she didn't have anybody that knew how to comb her hair. And that's how they managed that in reality, how they manage that. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Great. So what was it like? I'm recreating 18th century England and where did most of the filming take place? Yeah, it was a joy because I knew that I'm a, I was doing something really traditional that all of you guys as an audience would have a shorthand to, we would all know this world.

Speaker 1:          16:15          You've all seen pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility and faculty is wonderful world. But B, I knew I was going to be doing something really different with it by putting this character in the center of it. So I loved it. You know, I constantly thought, you know, I hadn't had, I always have a color chart for every movie that I work on, which, because I think it creates a harmonious, a static on the screen. But every, everything I was working with was knowing that I was going to have this woman have a beautiful skin tone on the screen. So for me, I wanted to present to you a new idea of an English rose. You know, my idea of an English rose, so you'll see in the picture here, um, Belize always sort of, um, featured often around Rose's. She's in Rosie colors, you know, her color scheme is that of, of, of, of beautiful flowers.

Speaker 1:          17:07          And you know, we, we bill out the color scheme of the, um, her entire world really from there. So each, each family really has its own color. So for the Ashford family, they have this kind of icy, cold, blue go figure. And, uh, for bail I wanted her to earn and the Mansfield family, I really wanted that sense of it being regal and Regal and important and wealthy. So they have goals, you know, you'll see that, uh, you know, in the world behind Dido here, it's, it's gold. Their carriage is gold. Lord. Mansfield's world is pretty gold as well, quite often. Um, so it was great. We filmed mainly in, um, uh, we, we filmed the English heritage houses in London, so we weren't able to film it, the Real Ken Wood House because it was under, it was being refurbished at the time. So we filmed in two or three houses that we then had to put together.

Speaker 1:          18:06          I had to have a little ground where I said, this is where the staircase is B and this is where the dining room remove their, my wonderful, wonderful production designer was working with me to, to, to do that and created again the beautiful aesthetic that you see on screen. Um, we also, so we shut a lot in London. We shot in central London where we had to shut, you know, whole streets and really only very little of what you see as CGI. It's real stuff. Yeah. That you see that um, we shot in the isle of Man to do a lot of our exteriors, which, um, is very green and lush and beautiful. And we also show an Oxford, which is actually where, um, Gugu [inaudible] actress is from. So it was exciting for her, was like going home and her art teacher actually walked by accidentally while we were filming.

Speaker 1:          18:55          It was like, it's that woman in that outfit you go and barter raw. Cause I used to teach her, so I had to kind of take him through all the barriers and getting through to her. So yeah. Oh that's awesome to her. Yeah. Okay. So now I want to switch up a little bit and talk about some of the historical aspects of the film. Yes. So most of us in the s are very aware of America's role in the slave trade. Yes. But maybe not as familiar with England and England. Um, emancipated or I should say abolish slavery. Yes. Um, decades before the u s yes. Um, what, can you tell us more about that history of the slave trade and um, and specifically the song massacre, that's sort of the critical judgment that happens and is the beginning of the end of a British, yeah, I guess slave trade in Persian empire.

Speaker 1:          19:44          So, you know, some of you may know this, but, um, I know we even a lot of English people don't know this. British people don't know this, which is that Britain was the middle man when it came to the slave trade. And whenever I'm speaking, you know, I have to say we, and then I have to define which we could, we would be schizophrenia because I'm black and I'm British. So this moment I'm British British. Okay. Got It. So what we would do is we were, we, we were the suppliers. We, we were very big in shipping at this point and we had what you would call the shipping triangle whereby we would sell from, uh, England to Africa and then to the Caribbean or the Americas and then back again. And no leg of that journey should be empty. We should always have goods, which we could trade.

Speaker 1:          20:37          And then, uh, you know, drop the goods off, pick up new goods and, and go somewhere else. So here's how it worked. We would take whatever, um, uh, goods good Britain had to offer. We would load them on the ship, South Africa exchange. Those goods with money as well for slaves, load up the slaves, then off to the Caribbean or the Americas, unload the slaves, pick up cotton, um, spices, whatever we could get, and then bring it back to front and sell it in Britain. So that's what we did. Now slavery was all a bit too vulgar to have on British shores. It was all a bit, it wasn't, you know, it didn't work for the Genteel society. So it was, it was all you guys that had it over this side of the Atlantic and how the so, so when I say I wanted to look at the economy that was holding up this genteel society that you see on pride in pride and prejudice, and then this other period dramas that come before, because data was a little bit early actually.

Speaker 1:          21:42          Then Austen's time, this is the, this is the trade, this is the shipping trade. And what I should also tell you is that the world that you come into you with, bowel is on the cusp of change. So whereas the, the marriage is that where the marriage of the kind of marriages of the time were based on status, you're married so that your family status could grow. Um, what was happening now was the love marriage was coming in slowly. It was starting to Piss, um, society. It was becoming not acceptable, but it was on its way to becoming acceptable and new money was coming in. And this new money would be a farmer for instance, who might gain enough money to buy Shek o and then he would start on this triangle that we talk about. So he would also become, be involved in the slave trade.

Speaker 1:          22:29          And then suddenly he's making a lot of money from this. Suddenly his children are the child of a wealthy man. Suddenly they might be, um, of interest to someone exactly who might want to marry them. So there was a fear of this. And Lord Mansfield is very representative of that cusp of change that we're on. He's got one foot in the now and the kind of the status quo and rules must be stuck too. Let's not break up the chaos that let's not encourage chaos or break up the rules. But then he is conflicted because he has this other other foot very firmly. And, um, being a progressive man in tomorrow, being a man ahead of his time in those two areas are conflicting inside him. That could be 10 movies made about this. There's an incredible man who, who chose to raise their, the way that he did.

Speaker 1:          23:18          So you've got all of that coming in. Now, the Zong case comes into the story because, um, many people were trying to get into the shipping trade at this time. And the man who comes to be the captain, the captain of the ship that sails on this terrible journey is actually a doctor and he has, this is his first time actually captaining a ship. Okay. And He, so he gets on this ship and um, it doesn't quite know what he's doing and it's a protracted journey. The journey is longer than it should be. So they packed the slaves in, in the disgusting way. We know that they would, you know, one on top of each other. They said that you could smell a slave ship, a mile down wind of that because it was so disgusting and full of disease. And so you can imagine when this journey becomes even longer because he's missing all the points where he should, he should be stopping and getting off these, these slaves are getting more sick and more sick and more sick.

Speaker 1:          24:19          And what happens is he decides at a certain point that he is going to order his crew to jettison the slaves from the ship. Um, because he realizes he will get more money from the insurance than he will on the open market for them. Now you could do that. You, you could jettison your cargo, you could jettison, uh, you know, whatever it was you were carrying. If, if you could prove that it was endangering your ship, right. So if you could prove that those slaves was so sick that they were making the crew sec, if you could prove there wasn't enough water, if you could prove there wasn't enough food, if you could prove that there was, I don't know, the ship was tipping and had too much weight on it and you had to jettison so that you had enough time to get to land, whatever, what is clear, what we know.

Speaker 1:          25:08          And what I found out during my re my side of the research was that they did in fact pass these eight ports where they could have stopped and got water. So this ridiculous argument that they didn't have enough water was in fact a lie. And so, um, there in was his own case. Now Lord Mansfield was caught between his peers who were the people who financially benefited from the slave trade. And of course his own moral values. And even more so his love for his child, if he pronounced in a way that would, um, confirm value to his child. He was actually, he was actually sticking a knife into the lifeblood of the economy of England. And his and his peers. But if he found for his peers, what would he be saying about Dido and who she is and what she means to him.

Speaker 1:          26:03          What we know about Lord Mansfield previously is that he had ruled on a case called the Somerset case in which an American comes to England where the slave and the slave at once on English soil says, I know in England now, I'm not a slave. You can't make me a slave and hear the question. Just as the question in, in the zone kind of centered on marine insurance law. The question here really centered on when you're on English soil, can American, uh, law prevail? And Lord Mansfield says, no, it can't. It can't prevail and therefore the slave is free and he frees the slaves. So he had all already kind of ruled previously in a way that would,

Speaker 1:          26:49          which would direct us towards the fact that he was, uh, ahead of his time. He was a man of great moral, good moral judgment and value. But of course, we still could not know what he might rule on, on the Zong case. Okay. Very, very interesting. So, um, all right, so now we want to take a look at, um, an argument scene. Yeah. Between the cousins. When I saw that scene, I kept thinking she was going to say, you're black like they did in the beginning of the movie, but she not doesn't, she says illegitimate, illegitimate. And I'm wondering was that in the original script or did you try out different responses doing filming to find what was authentic? Yeah, no, no. I mean I always knew I was never going to take you there because what I wanted to do was create a sister ship, as I say, assistant head and however that's that that sister ship was going to have to address the issues of race and position and status.

Speaker 1:          27:48          At some point. It was always going to have to do that. But I knew if I took you there, you would never come back from it. With Elizabeth, you would, you would, you would never, she should never be in your hearts again. And also it would destroy everything that I had done previously in showing you that, that, that lip, look how to women of different races can love each other. So I was never going to take you there. But what I also wanted to do, which is something I had always, there are many, there are many parallels that I had wanted to strike with this film. One is the parallel of, um, uh, of, uh, when gender, the woman's place and, um, the woman being owned by her husband versus the slave being owned. So the idea of ownership, um, and the other parallel that I really wanted to, to Tinder cap was this idea that illegitimacy

Speaker 3:          28:40          yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:40          Could be in some circumstances as,

Speaker 1:          28:46          as, as, as, as much of a burden as being a woman, a woman of color. It was, and that for people that were the, exactly. And, and you know, right up until the 60s, I mean, you know, people have taught me about being illegitimate or, and, and the burden that it kind of put on them. And so I, I wanted everybody to understand this is complex. This is not simple. There was no race issues without class issues, without gender issues, without, you know, all of this stuff that was overlapping the whole time. And for a woman, again at the junction of where I've placed her at the junction of all these different paths, and as she says, I find no, no place, I can, I can find where I belong. Um, then I wanted to show you the complexity of what they say is, I mean, what I did have a ball doing is I'm putting together the dialogue of two girls arguing in the 18th century. And what you don't see in that clip is it what follows is what I call a south London cast. Um, because um, you know, bell does puts that right in no certain terms and you know, I could never put together that scene without that south London part of me.

Speaker 1:          30:01          Um, so, and you know, in many screenings that I've been to, it gets a huge round of applause. And when I'm sitting in the screening, I'm there, I'm clapping with her even though I put those words in her mouth because, because, because I still feel it at that moment when she's finding her own and saying, no, you will not, you will not demean me. I will not allow you to demean me. So yes, I mean in so many ways, the language of the film is so bold, you know, you get the black, the black at the beginning of directs very direct. That's something that I experienced in my life with my first husband will not mind me saying that. Um, his mother, when she first met me, I was very young in my early twenties, um, said, oh, she's, she's quite pretty, but she's very black, you know, but she's, she's black and 10 years old.

Speaker 1:          30:51          And it was still nice dress on her, but she's, you know, she's black and you know, uh, Miranda Richardson's characters very much based on that experience and, and, and that person. And so, yes. So the language is very bold, but I wanted to play with the boldness of the language versus us versus, and not get it because the whole scene starts so gently with this, with this piano playing and this, this loving sister sisterly conversation and then goes into this horrible, ugly place. And I wanted to draw you in, um, to the dialogue I'd created there and draw you into and make you think, oh, now it's going to be horrible and disgusting. But she would never do that to her sister. Even in this situation. When she said it, it felt so much more authentic than what I was expecting to hear. Yeah. I was like, that wouldn't work because they love each other.

Speaker 1:          31:40          They love each other. Yeah, exactly. Awesome. Okay. So from what I read some of the history about Deitel Bella is a bit on Wikipedia and the BBC sites and um, and so I learned that bell's existence was, um, was discovered by the papers or the wall, the painting, and then they discovered more about her life through the papers at the kin. What house? And I was wondering, were there any writings in bill's hand that you, that were found that could speak to her voice? And my God, I pray that there will be one day I pray that there will be something. There was a gentleman named Hutchinson who came over from America, um, and he came over to talk to Lord Mansfield about the Zong case and wanting to really lobby Lord, Lord Mansfield to find against the insurers, find for the ship owners. In other words, uh, uh, to lobby Lord Mansfield to find that it was okay for you to drown your slaves because this was going to have such an impact on savory.

Speaker 1:          32:39          And now he writes in his diary, and I'm totally paraphrasing here, but it's easy to find on online, easy to find on Google, um, that, uh, he, he comes to the house and he sits down and he has a formal dinner with the family. And after dinner this negress comes out as grants and um, you know, and, but she has the entire family wrapped around her little finger essentially, and she's walking, oh, I'm at home around the gardens. And you know, they, they're treating her, you know, like one of them and he, and he's horrified by this. He's absolutely horrified by this. And what he says is that I wasn't, I did want to bring up the zone with Lord Mansfield, but I didn't think that that was quite the right time. In other words, he knew that they clearly loved this girl and that, you know, bringing up issues of, uh, black people at that particular point and, and encouraging the men to say that it would be okay to massacre them.

Speaker 1:          33:33          It was probably not the right time. So virtually it's elements like that. It's papers that we can find. For instance, we know where she married John Davinia. Um, so she married him in Saint George's church in Hanover Square. We know that she christened all of her children in the same church. So that kind of people who are, I was able to look at the, the two wheels that Lord Mansfield left dido bail money in. And, um, and to discover also that not even though, you know, in the film we portray it, that he, he isn't sure if he can, he does, but also that his sister lady Mary played by Penelope Wilton also leaves her money. And what that expressed to me would that did it, it helped to cement for me the idea that they loved, they loved this girl and you know, she had to teach them the right way to love her as I've said before, but they love this girl.

Speaker 1:          34:29          So it was really finding for me, finding all of this information for the story that I wanted to tell because look, there have been pleased on dido bell before. There have been short movies of Dido Bell before you, you know, as I say, there was this earlier version and it was me about me as a director of finding my vision of the story, the story I wanted to tell. Um, and so it was, I can only do that through piecing together my own history and deciding then how it should all be sewn together. So, but no diaries, but there's still time. There's still never know. You never know how life is. So I think we're going to stop now and take some Q and a from the audience. Does anybody have, and there's a mic I guess in the center here and if I have any questions.

Speaker 1:          35:17          Okay. I'll ask more question while people come to the mic. Yeah. Okay, great. Um, I actually saw the next one is a scene and we'd like to queue this scene, um, where she's actually having conversation with John and Divinia Ah, about her status in life. I love her. Look the way she looks at him. Yeah, absolutely. It's a complex scene. That one. Yeah. I, that's what I wanted to ask you about. Could you elaborate on sort of, you know, her thoughts at that time cause she's recognizing, you know, this interesting position, she's in society where she doesn't have to marry for money and position well this is all part of her awakening, weakening, really all part of a political awakening or part of her understanding of who she is as a woman and where, and a woman of color in where she fits. Like I say, I always wanted to strike that parallel of ownership between the person of color, um, being owned in the woman being owned.

Speaker 1:          36:09          And I was exploring this, um, in my own mind is I do one day as I did as I do in one day and I was sitting at my desk and you know, look, we're putting to the gather the story that I wanted to tell and I, I wanted to express the pressure of society at that time. The, I mean it was so much pressure came from society. And as I say at the beginning of the movie Via Lord Mansfield Society has a habit of casting out even one of its own. When it has the opportunity, it was so easy to kind of be cast out and kind of be blacklisted and be turned out from society. And I, it was kind of thinking about this fortunate position of, of this character and how she's wealthy and a woman of color at the same time. And yet she's still desperate to belong.

Speaker 1:          36:56          She still desperate to be like the other girls who have to marry. And she's still desperate for society's endorsement, which says she, she, she, she, she only married but Marian equal or higher, which is a man of consequence. And so she's, she's, she's working out all these arguments in her head that I wanted to, to offer to you as an audience. And on the one hand, she's, she recognizes that she's in this very strong position. You know, she is this woman who is both free, um, as a female and as a, as, as a slave, a female because she has money in a slave because she's been, um, taken into a family that has allowed her not to be a slave, um, and, and decided to honor the, the, the side of her, her bloodline that, um, did not emanate from slavery. But then on the other hand, wanting to belong.

Speaker 1:          37:43          She's talking about this pressure of, but who will society think I am if I don't marry a man of consequence? And then she's realizing also the ridiculousness of this pressure because it would be like, I'm a free man, begging free negro begging to be, to have a master, you know. Exactly that. Exactly. And I, you know, in the end when you're working with characters speak to you and they come to you with their own story and you know, there are times where I would come out with stuff and I go, oh, that was clever. Oh, I like that. Um, and that, that was one of those moments where, you know, so many of the of what comes out in this story is, um, you know, comes directly from my own family and my own love connections in live. Like, um, you know, uh, what is right can never be impossible.

Speaker 1:          38:33          It was something my dad used to say very regular knee or, you know, uh, when her blood father says to her, biological father says, you will not understand this in this moment, but know that you are loved. You know, that was something my father used to say to me when I was very, very small when he was trying to give me the steel to go out into the, into the world. And even lady Mary's line of, you know, Elizabeth wait for no man was my aligned from my big sister. She was sick, is six years older than me and she used to try to be the grownup woman. And so she used to say to me, you know, you should never wait for any man. I'd be 10 years old. Um, but the, these particular lines, um, would, we're, we're really lines that for me just, just, just came from being in the shoes of the character and uh, yeah, these things in the story.

Speaker 1:          39:17          Okay. So I, we see a few people in mind. I take a [inaudible], my name is Lauren. Hi Lauren. Thank you so much for coming today. Um, I had the chance to see the film yesterday and it was beautiful. Thank you. Thank you for making it. Thank, I have a quick question for you. Um, my question is what made you decide to make the film more lighthearted and about romance versus a darker film that stresses the turmoil of slavery? Yeah. Well, Lauren, I think, I mean for me, I definitely wanted to, to create this Austin s drama that I talked about earlier and challenge myself to be able to make a film in that way, show that a woman of color could do it, could be behind the camera and do it, but also that a woman of color could be in front of the carrot at the camera and, and, um, appeal to everybody appeal universally.

Speaker 1:          40:08          Now. Um, as we know, Austin never, she never talked about slavery. And if I had gone that route of making something much harder, I'd have been coming away from my idea of creating an Austin s you know, that working in that Austine sub genre of movie making. And so, uh, if for me, I always knew that I was going to tell this more gentle story where you wouldn't actually see stays. But as I explained earlier, you would, you would feel the impact of the horror of what was happening to them. And I also think sometimes that it's you, you can communicate to an audience more easily when you're not, when the horror is emotional and psychological, but is not kind of so explicit on the screen. And I like to think that I don't come to movie making with a message, but I come to ask questions and to try and motivate you to as a society to, to, to have those conversations and ask those questions.

Speaker 1:          41:10          And I think what a costume drama like this does is, is inspired conversation and dialogue. Um, because not everybody reads wants to read the newspaper or wants to wants do you kind of be hit over the head with a message or a political kind of stance in that way. But I think it comes to you in this gentle form. You know, you naturally respond to it as opposed to feeling like you're being forced to, to respond to it. And so I wanted to challenge myself and see if I could really tell what is essentially still a tough story, but within the context of a love story and um, self awakening and a journey towards self love, um, and not be explicit with violence. Thank you. Yeah. Congratulations. Or seeing your vision through. It's beautiful. Thank you. And thank you very much. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          42:03          Hi, I'm [inaudible]. My name is Jana. Hi Matt. Like I said, I actually saw this at tiff and got to witness and be a part of the standing ovation. So thank you for coming to Google. Thank you. Um, so my question, I'm really interested in black protagonists and I read a lot of articles, um, more recently about black renaissance and film. Um, bell is a part of the films that are named, um, including 12 years of slave, uh, the Butler Django. Even, um, you know, some of the argument people are with this is a black renaissance where as I read other articles that kind of discredit this and say, um, all of these films are most of them focus on blacks. But you know, in a space of servitude or, you know, not modern black, um, you know, there's a, there's a disparity. And so I want to know your thoughts.

Speaker 1:          42:49          Bell I think is different because she, you know, she's, it's a historic piece, but she's not in a position of servitude necessarily. Um, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the larger argument of a, this, you know, this presence of blacks on screen, but also then being in the past. Sure, sure. Well, you know, I'm, I do like to think that bell kind of steps away, uh, you know, outside of that argument to a certain extent. So, um, I do, I do agree with you there. Um, but I do think that as filmmakers, um, we, we, and particularly as filmmakers of color or filmmakers that are putting stories about people of color on screen, we kind of have to have the freedom within a certain, um, to a certain extent to, to choose the stories that touch us, that we want to tell. Now, certainly I can say that as a British filmmaker of color, um, we've been starved of those opportunities to really tell stories about things that mattered to us.

Speaker 1:          43:46          So the first thing we're going to do when we get those opportunities is, is, is kind of go to the heart of stuff that matters and you know who we are today. Um, and, and, and, and what, in what inspires us, what motivates us to move forward today. I mean, I think has so much to do with our history. So why not as film makers be able to look at that history? Now, you know, I know Steve McQueen has made other movies aside from 12 years a slave. Um, and I certainly have made other movies aside from, um, you know, this movie bow and I intend to go on and make movies of all kinds. In fact, the next movie I'm going to make us for Warner brothers, it's called unforgettable. It's very much rooted in today. It has a double female lead. He's very much about, again, the woman's experience looking at many of the themes of bowel, but it much more in a modern day context.

Speaker 1:          44:37          And I have no doubt that many of the filmmakers whose films we've, we've talked about, you know, the Butler, I mean, you know what was precious if it wasn't, um, today and though, you know, the lead character in that movie had a very, very difficult time. She wasn't in servitude. Um, but we have to be allowed otherwise we restricting, you know, US restricting ourselves as people of color is no different to other people from other races restricting us. You know, just because it comes from us from the inside, it doesn't make it any better or any more, right. Or any more worthy. Um, what we have to be allowed to do is a teller stories. They have to be more of us so that there is a variety of those stories. Story. If you've only got five or six of us, you're always going to be able to, so comparisons between our movies when you have, when you have 50 about us, then you're going to be able to, I mean, what was spike Lee doing?

Speaker 1:          45:29          I mean, what does spike Lee been doing for all these years? He hasn't been telling stories and people of Color in servitude, can we, you know, we, we don't have to, we don't have to go that far back to eliminate these stories. So the arguments for me are, are unfair. I'm worried, unwarranted. And I think they're restrictive and they restrict creativity. To be honest with you, we have to be free. I didn't tell bell without knowing that I had a responsibility. And I can tell you that I, I took that responsibility very, very seriously. And that is why, despite the fact that I had, um, a lot of worries and concerns that she was too feisty and you know, and, and, and, and had development was, was kind of too upfront for me. I was not going to come to a story. I was not going to put a character on screen. And she was that because, you know, they were worried that she wouldn't be likable. And I said, you know, what's not going to be likable is a week flower woman of color put on the screen at this particular time. Um, and so I take that responsibility seriously and is filmmakers of color. We know how to do that, but we also have to be allowed to be creative, I think. Well, thank you for inspiring the next generation of filmmakers. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, I have one more.

Speaker 4:          46:42          Hi, I'm uh, my name is Phineas. Hi. And I just wanted to ask if you had any pieces or scenes that you had to take out that you know, you to want us to know, I guess, um, it will be interesting to kind of hear about those times.

Speaker 1:          46:55          Well, early on from the script, um, I had written a scene, uh, this is, this is not a very serious thing, but it's just the scene. I would have loved to have shot where I had written, um, one of the very typical ballroom scenes that you get the quintessential ballroom scene in the period drama. And um, you know, again, I'd never seen a woman of color in that context, so I really wanted to shoot the typical dance 18th century line dance scene that you get. And it was a very big seed and you know, was I was going to be shooting it from the point of view of somebody watching from above and uh, it was just so big and expensive that we had to, we had to take that scene out. Um, I do, I did create a scene at the very beginning of the movie, um, where you see, you see the painter, um, putting together a sketch of the girls.

Speaker 1:          47:54          It's actually Elizabeth space. What you see is the kind of quintessential, um, English girl coming to the fore kind of emerging in the painting. Um, but what you don't necessarily know is actually the end of the painting is going to be something very different, far more powerful and strong. We had to take that out because it was no, uh, it was, it was just sort of intercut, kind of credit opening credits scene. But integrating that with, um, Captain Sir John Lindsay arriving to collect the little bow that was a little bit bit long winded. So we took that out. Essentially I was able to keep, keep the essence of the movie that I wanted. So while we sliced out lines, um, we didn't take out too many full scenes that I thought were really important. Thankfully. Um, I'm a control freak and um, I've been lucky enough in both movies that I've made to be able to get what I want up there on screen.

Speaker 1:          48:50          And you know, it won't always be like that. I know that employers, I know that. Um, but for now, um, this is how it has been night that you essentially, you know, I got the, I got what I wanted up there on screen. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah. Well thank you so much. It's been such a pleasure. Yes. Thank you for sharing the film and your perspective with us. This was great. And we want to congratulate you on the success of your sophomore project. Thank you. And we hope you come with, with your next project. Thank you so much. Thank you. Really good.

Speaker 5:          49:20          Nope. Yeah.
