Speaker 1:          00:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:06          I'm Richard Generous, uh, for those of you don't know me, head of news at Google, but that's not what we're here about today. We're here to talk about Hollywood and is fascinated, is sometimes folks are with the tech sector. Uh, we know people are even more fascinated with Hollywood and, and we are too. We share that. So I'm really delighted to have you both here today. So when we first said, just start by having, by, by giving a bit of background, first of all, Michael, Michael Stuhlbarg, um, you, you're one of those phenomenally talented actors who I, who I sort of feel that, that many of us may not know, but we do know in the sense that you, you so immerse yourself in your roles, that you lose your own personal identity. Um, which is I think, a remarkable, truly remarkable thing. Uh, but for those who aren't as familiar, just, I'll just mention a few of the highlights, uh, that, that quietly vicious mob boss, uh, you know, Arnold Rothstein and boardwalk empire.

Speaker 2:          01:08          Uh, the, the hauntingly trouble Larry, uh, Gopnik and the in the Cohen brothers movie a, a serious man. Um, and then more recently, uh, someone I know you portrayed, uh, the Mac programming genius, a Andy Hertzfeld in Steve Jobs. Uh, uh, look forward to getting some perspective on that. And of course in Trumbo, the, that deeply conflicted and key role of the actor Edward G. Robinson. So, uh, thank you for being with us today. Glad you can join us. And then we get to Jay Roach, Jay Roach is by, by many accounts, uh, the nicest men in Hollywood. Um, and, and interestingly, you have not let that hold you back.

Speaker 3:          01:55          It's not stopped, can be, uh, a kind of left handed compliment you, you know, you don't necessarily get a, you know, get a lot of respect instantly when that's the first thing people say about you. But, but I'll take it. I like people and you know, I'm glad, I'm glad that that comes across well in it, in it does come across

Speaker 2:          02:16          and no, it's not stopped you from becoming a extraordinarily successful as a director, uh, with many films across many genres. Uh, uh, you have course the tremendous commercial success with the Austin Powers movies with meet the parents, meet the Fockers, uh, you also, which many folks might know produced the, uh, two of those, a outrageous Sasha Baron Cohen, uh, films, uh, Barat and, and Bruno. Um, very interesting shift there. And in the last several years, you've, you've directed a number of more political films with a recount about the Bush corps, uh, presidential election, uh, game change about John and, and the intimate Sarah Pailin and you're just finishing shooting. Uh, is it recalled Lyndon Baines Johnson the stage play Lbj on her way all the way into a film. Um, and of course, uh, what we're here to talk about today, uh, with, with Trumbo. And by the way, if this guy doesn't need an additional coolness factor, he's been married over 20 years to a bangle, Susanna Hoffs, that's probably the best,

Speaker 3:          03:27          the more, you know, tables at restaurants than anything else. It's my wife.

Speaker 2:          03:33          Exactly. So, um, but today we're going to talk about uh, about Trumbo. Uh, your film about Dalton Trumbo, the legendary screenwriter who in the face of the communist witch hunts of the forties and 50s, became a true American hero in his efforts to defend the first amendment and free expression. So, uh, obviously we'll, we'll talk a lot about that. One bit of disclosure before we begin from my end is that I should come clean on is at 35 years ago, I was, uh, usually fortunate enough to convince a, an amazing woman by the name of Mitzi Trumbo, uh, to marry me. Um, and her dad of course is, is Dalton Trumbo. And over the years I got federally immersed in the close knit families challenge, uh, with the blacklist years and a challenge. It was, I mean, mid to the age of eight was, was kicked out of these junior girl scouts called the blue birds because her dad was a, was a commie. I mean, it was, it was real stuff and challenging stuff and hurtful stuff. Um, and over the last two years, I've had the great pleasure to get to know you and many members of the cast in the making of this film. So, but let's get to the meat of this. Uh, uh, why don't you introduce the story of, of Trumbo, um, and, and as you're doing, so give us a sense of why you felt it was important to make the movie. Yeah, sure. Uh,

Speaker 3:          04:57          the, the, the kind of a one paragraph Hook that got me was Dalton Trumbo was one of the most successful mainstream screenwriters in Hollywood, uh, in 1947, um, and was suddenly deemed a threat. Uh, an enemy of the state called subpoenaed to testify, um, decides he won't testify and won't answer the questions about what political affiliations do you have, who are your friends that might have, uh, some kind of ties to, to a leftist organizations. And he, by refusing is charged with contempt of Congress and goes to jail, immediately gets blacklisted by the studios who all agreed that anybody who was part of the Hollywood 10 would have to be fired. Uh, and the blacklist began based on these 10 men who were called up. He though, instead of succumbing, uh, writes screenplays for the next 13 years under other names, uh, and encourages other writers to do the same thing.

Speaker 3:          06:03          Ends up winning two Academy Awards for two beautiful movies, uh, Roman holiday and the brave on and then write Spartacus. And which by suddenly are finally being named, uh, you know, the back of the blacklist kind of dissolves. Otto Preminger announces that he's gonna put his name on a, Trump has name on exodus and Kirk Douglas puts his name on Spartacus. And in a way, the spell is broken by, by just writing. You know, they, that just by writing great screenplays he gets and the other writers doing the same thing, it, it exposes the blacklist for being just not only lunacy and unfair and unjust, but also completely ineffective, didn't accomplish anything. And, uh, and he kind of throws water on the wicked witch, you know, um, in this case played by Helen Mirin, uh, Hedda hopper, the, uh, the, the infamous gossip columnists. So that's a little more than a paragraph, but that's, that was the hook for me.

Speaker 3:          06:59          I was like, oh my God, how did this happen? I can't believe this happened. And, uh, you know, how I'd like to find out everything, everything I can about this story. Um, and to figure out what it had to do with today too. That was a big, a big part of it for me as well. You know, interestingly, um, as, as, as you know, when he testified, uh, he and the Hollywood 10, uh, did not, as others did plead the fifth amendment, which says, I will not incriminate myself. They pleaded the First Amendment right, uh, based on their belief that they had the right to express themselves and to think your thoughts without government questioning. Um, as you know, um, uh, yes, held in contempt, found guilty and the supreme court upheld that a conviction, well, basically by re, by choosing because they, there was a liberal majority, uh, at the time they started this process and they thought the first amendment would get them through it.

Speaker 3:          07:56          And even if it didn't that eventually the Supreme Court would throw it all out as being ridiculous, but, but then to liberal justices died within a month and a, and so the supreme court, by refusing to hear the appellate decision, essentially a validated it and, and the, uh, the conviction stood. Yeah, it was a pretty, it's an amazing, uh, it's an amazing, um, predicament these guys kind of put themselves into, in a way they, they were so a progressive and thoughtful and, and, and, uh, defensive of certain, like union, you know, issues. They were very antifascist and somehow they kind of became targets because, uh, people who wanted to calls, you know, people unamerican who were a little more progressive, uh, succeeded in exploiting the fears and just went after. And by the way, writers, nine of the 10 of them were writers who were always the first ones that get thrown under the bus in Hollywood.

Speaker 3:          08:55          Um, so, uh, it was, uh, yeah, it was an interesting that, that decision, we portray that decision to choose the first amendment over the fifth, uh, and just, uh, to, to actually, they decided very carefully to answer the questions, answer all the questions, but in their own way, which meant a kind of interesting circuitous way back to always. You really don't have any right to be asking this. I'll answer in my own way, but I'm just going to keep reminding. You have no right to ask me about my union affiliation, my political affiliation, or who my friends are who might have similar affiliations. Exactly.

Speaker 2:          09:33          So as we know of that period, a lot of folks were forced in a very difficult position. So let's let Michael, let's look at your role in Trumbo. You, you play the, the acting legend and Edward G. Robinson, uh, the gangster of all gangsters that were, um, and, and Robinson well, deeply opposed to the committee's efforts. Uh, and, and, and certainly had his, his political leanings were, were far more left than not. In the end, he eventually named names. Um, you know, it's a complex role. It's the role in a sense. It's the position that none of us wants to ever be in of having to make those kinds of decisions. In fact, as, as Trumbo once said, after the blacklist period, there were no heroes. There were only victims because everyone was ultimately forced to do things they would not have otherwise done. So from your perspective, uh, you know, and sort of what made you take this role and, and, and how did you approach it, that level of complexity?

Speaker 4:          10:42          Um, well, Jay presented me with the opportunity and we sat down and had a meal and chatted about the prospect of it. I was just coming off of about four years of working on boardwalk empire in playing someone who was renowned as a kind of gangster. And I was a little concerned that maybe I would be taking on something too similar, uh, with the life of Edward Robinson. But I, I had started looking up information about him and, uh, they couldn't have been more different except the fact that they lived at a certain time. And that, uh, Mr. Robinson for a while got to be known as someone, uh, in the gangster world. Uh, so I read a lot about him and I watched his movies and was delighted at the fact, uh, that, uh, uh, relearning about somebody who I thought was one thing and he turned out to be a whole other thing altogether.

Speaker 4:          11:46          Um, in terms of what is nature was like, what, uh, the, uh, and then the size of his talent in terms of the kinds of roles he was capable of playing as opposed to the ones that he had in some cases became famous for. Uh, but I learned about his love of art, his massive art collection. I learned about his life in the theater before all of that, uh, about his political affiliations, about, um, how generous of a spirit he was, how he would give money to anybody who asked, um, and, uh, how he was, you know, one of the friendliest guys in, in the community, in the Hollywood community. But he loved him, you know, so, uh, as the, uh, all of this political stuff started heating up, he kinda got torn in between, uh, a lot of different factions in terms of his own friendships. Um, and then he started a showing up on what they called gray lists, which were people who were, uh, being lumped together, uh, into, uh, onto lists of, of suppose it communists, but had not joined the party. He was very political. He was a liberal democrat. Um, and,

Speaker 1:          13:11          um,

Speaker 4:          13:13          yeah, he, uh, um, he, he found himself in a position that became quite, quite difficult, um, and went out of his way to get in front of the, the Hugh Act Committee to explain his affiliations to, to explain where he gave money, why he gave him money and a otherwise it seemed as though people just weren't going to hire him anymore. Yeah. Uh, so in the end he had to get up there and say some things that he did not want to say, and he had set himself that had it been a different day or, you know, had he not been under the stresses that he was under, he may not have done what he did, but he did and lived with it. Uh, eventually got to go back to work again. Um, but he doesn't seem to be one of those individuals who was lumped together with those people who were supposedly, uh, uh, um, considered those who named names. He gave them information they already had. Uh, it's a, he's lived a fascinating life. Uh, and, um, you know, I listened to his voice a lot. I watched those performances, particularly around the 1947 48 period in which he had pretty much exhausted being a leading man and was starting to venture into the world of, of uh, getting what was called character parts. Um,

Speaker 4:          14:40          and, uh, and I watched as much as I could about who he was, uh, away from the iconic, you know, cigar chomping gangster. A lot of people knew him as, um, and found him to be quite, um, area date. And our script written by John Mcnamara, uh, really explores more of that personal side than it does, um, the icon that he was known before.

Speaker 2:          15:09          Yeah. And as you and your character point out, the blacklists destroyed the careers of thousands and thousands of people in Hollywood, most who never had the opportunity to truly develop a career. Uh, interestingly, uh, you know, writers, um, uh, could do work under an assumed name started to be very clear. They went from making large sums of money to tiny sums of money. But as you point out, you can't act under an assumed face. You have only one

Speaker 3:          15:40          these days. You might be able to actually though, you know, with the digital technology, uh, yeah,

Speaker 4:          15:46          he couldn't do it at that time.

Speaker 3:          15:48          That's when it, that's one of the most, um, compelling parts of the whole Trumbo, the Hollywood 10 story Wa was, was Energy Robinson's dilemma. And it got to that question that we hope the film puts in front of any audience member, which is what would you do? What would you do if you really had no choice? Trumbo did have a certain kind of a set of choices which was just cave and disappear or keep writing. But other, uh, other keep writing, but under other names, uh, actors, directors, I happen to have a directing teacher who was one of the Hollywood 10, Edward Dmytryk, uh, who taught at USC when I went to film school there, he was the only non writer, uh, you know, of the 10, he, he was put in jail for the same reason, blacklisted and then decided to come back, uh, and name names and he named a few names who hadn't been known to the committee supposedly.

Speaker 3:          16:43          And, um, uh, by the time my God to be a student of his, you could see the, the co the damage, you know, of the, just how conflicted he was as a person need our, he'd made a whole bunch of films. He had, he had made this decision and got work out of the decision. You got work. He started to be able to make money again, we're it all his writer friends, many, many of them lost their homes, lost their, their families in some cases lost their health. And then there were even suicides. So I'm sure there was a kind of survivor guilt. I mean, this is just me speculating. I never really spoke to him in depth about it. He didn't really like talking about it for lots of reasons. Um, but that the, that same dilemma was similar to a energy Robinson. There was no choice. There wasn't another way through it, the way there was for, uh, for the writers.

Speaker 2:          17:32          Okay. In your view? Um, you know, I, I'm actually one of the reasons you'd do a film like this is to, um, is to convey that story and convey the lessons within it. Um, as I think you pointed out, um, in the political that

Speaker 3:          17:50          the greatest tool of all his fear. Yeah. So when you look at this, yeah, we'll, we actually learn a lesson. Can this happen? Again, it's a, it's a really hard question to answer without speculating, but you, you do see a pattern in political propaganda too. If you want people to conform or do what you want them to do as opposed to what they want to do, the way to intimidate them and in some cases bullied them is to hurl labels at them that conjure up fears of real threats. In this case, it was totalitarian communism that was real. Russia had occupied eastern Europe. There were very deliberate efforts to by the rush to, uh, by Soviet Union to extract secrets of how to build a bomb. And that's where their knowledge of the bomb came from, was spies from an American scientist. So that was all real.

Speaker 3:          18:46          But by calling someone a communist, Eh, you know, or, or a, in this case Trumbo was a comics bike by calling him a trader and accusing him of being a puppet of Russia, then you could neutralize him. And nowadays it would be, um, calling someone a, you know, friendly to terrorism or somehow unamerican uh, you know, in a, in a world post nine 11. So it is, I do fear, feel like, uh, that, uh, fear is the most useful propagandist tool and the most useful political manipulation tool. And you see in, in today, you still see a, you know, ridiculous waste of taxpayers' money, uh, by Congress. People trying to make names for themselves, doing congressional investigations that lead nowhere. I mean, that, this, the, the investigation of the queue, I can lead to nothing. There no was no one ultimately charged with any real subversion, no films pulled out, you know, or even even, you know, banned or censored.

Speaker 3:          19:48          There was, they couldn't point to any one particular case. It was just, well, he might've known somebody who knew somebody who maybe had something to do with that other thing. It was all hearsay. And that stuff is easy to manipulate and, and, and it does happen today. It happens in every, in every era. I think. So. I hope the film just raises your, raises, people's skepticism, keeps the conversation going a about where are we being manipulated, ah, based on fear as opposed to being a, you know, asked to consider anything that's a genuine threat around us. And in doing that often the misuse of labels, you know, the, the equation of communism who terrorized totalitarian handle the equation of being Muslim with being a terrorist. Yeah. It's so easy to twist these and, and, and, and use these for, and they're really bad, bad ideas that the idea that all Muslims are terrorists is a great example of it. That's a, that's a kind of bizarre mutated equivalents that costs people, you know, in some cases their lives. There's some there it can fan as sort of hate based, uh, approach to life, you know. Uh, and so it's such a cynical, a choice too, to use fear that way. Just to try to get people to conform or be more like, you know, you want the world to be. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          21:16          Well let, let's, let's shift it a touch lighter. Yeah. Sorry. Um, so, uh, so early you assembled a marvelous, cashed, uh, with Trumbo in addition to Michael, you know, Helen Mirren, Louis C, k e, John Goodman, Elle fanning. Um, but also you landed Walter White, um, another well known gangster, you know, the beloved Bryan Cranston. And interestingly, you're working with him again on, on Lbj. Um, so, so what's the deal with that? I mean, is it about that drugs? Is this, is this, is this about crystal blue persuaded?

Speaker 3:          21:52          What does that, what's the attraction? Just a, yeah, he got me hooked and then I have to, to, to pay for my habit. I have to keep casting and foresight. No, he's um, he's amazing. That's what it is. It just a, and he has not just the passion and depth of someone like Trimble, but he has the wit and that, that that's, it does give me a chance to transition to something else that goes on in our film. There is humor and we have Louis Ck in the film and we have John Goodman and my, one of my favorite scenes in the whole film attacking a, a union leader who's trying to pressure him into caving to, uh, to the House on American activities, uh, committees, desire to, to not employ blacklisted people. Uh, and it's because so many of these guys coped with this predicament by being hilarious.

Speaker 3:          22:39          Uh, Trumbo was famously funny, uh, in, in letters, many, many letters he wrote from jail to his family, to his, you know, to, to Mitzi saying, ego is upper and go to bed. You know, like as if he was still there in the room and, and to enemies. He called one enemy, one, one, one producer who had betrayed him, uh, who was trying to have it both ways, a political hermaphrodite. I was like, Oh, I wish I could, you know, Landa, an insult like that to someone. And He, they were all funny. His own funeral turned into a roast because his buddies just couldn't help themselves. Big, give him a hard time, you know, even in the grave. And that's the kind of guys they were. So in it licensed us to, to be more authentic. We needed comedy actually. And even in the midst of all of this kind of psychological terror, if you will. Um, there was, there had to be humor. And so we cast, uh, you know, a whole people with a whole range of, of skills. There's some, um, Edward G. Robinson has a couple of really great lines. Uh, when he, when he talks about the NPA and says they're all fascist, that they just don't have that they're all Nazis. They just don't have the uniforms. I mean, everyone who's in, in, in the middle of horrible sort of crisis and battle can also be funny, uh, to cope with it.

Speaker 2:          24:03          Well, let me pursue that notion of just a little bit further, um, because you, you have done, uh, you know, serious films, films with serious subject matter, um, and, and obviously, uh, many films like that. You know, I'm a big fan of Paul Thomas Anderson Films, but you know, they're different. Um, and, and, and often not accessible, but I, which makes me wonder, as you approach a serious subjects, do you explicitly go after the use of comedy as a means of making the subject more approachable?

Speaker 3:          24:42          Well, I don't, I mostly, again, I just try to have it honor the story and honor the characters. I'm going to end, by the way I, I can think of an exception to what you were just saying. It using an actress who I worked at the, um, Julianne Moore in Boogie Nights, boogie nights is so dark, it's so twisted and it has some really funny performances by Bill Macy, uh, by Julianne Moore and, uh, casting someone like Julianne to play. Sarah Palin is a great example because she gets where the ironies are. She gets the absurdities and she's playing them with a complete total commitment to capturing the essence of that person. But there is with their, you know, and I, that's why I cast people like Michael Stuhlbarg and John Goodman and, and, and Brian too. But we have Louis CK plying, you know, a hardline communists. And the reason is because we needed someone to the left of Trumbo, who was, you know, had joined the Communist Party during the war when we were aligned with a communist superpower.

Speaker 3:          25:39          But we needed someone much who was actually a good party member, which was Louis Ck is character. Whereas Trumbo was not that great of a party member. He wasn't that conformist even to the Communist Party. So he now you have someone like Louis C K busting him for being a hypocrite and for being so full of himself and, and for, as he says, talking like every single thing he's going to say is going to be chiseled into a rock. You know, that's, that's why you that, that they're the actual men themselves made an obligation to cast funny people because they were funny just to be authentic.

Speaker 2:          26:15          Yeah. Um, let me shift a bit. Um, over the years, my wife and I often joke when we see a film that start off with, based on a true story, which is not the case with trombone. Uh, we always had to Wikipedia and aero is to find out that more often than not, the keyword is based. Not True. Um, uh, and, and of course there's been a lot of discussion about that recently. Uh, most specifically with the film Steve Jobs, you know, Aaron Sorkin and sin in their criticism of Aaron Sorkin with regard to his, his take license is license with, uh, with that real life character into a character. And a lot of people say did not really exist. So, um, Michael First, um, again, you played a real life character with Edward G. Robinson. You didn't have the benefit of spending any time with Edward G. Robinson since he's long passed, deceased, but you also played a real life character with Andy Hertzfeld in Steve Jobs. So, you know, from your perspective as an actor, how do you approach, how do you approach these roles that are obviously not based on fictional characters? I mean, what's your approach to, to the verse similitude I mean, is it, is it impressionistic? Is it realistic? What do you strive for truth, however, right. I

Speaker 4:          27:33          can get to it, I suppose. Uh, yeah, I mean, my experience on Steve Jobs was unique in that it was the very first time I got to meet the person that I was going to be playing, um, uh, at a different time in his life. I'll be it, uh, or three different times in his life. But it was a wonderful opportunity for me to observe him, to asking questions, to absorb as much of his energy as I could. And he was free with his time and was very honest with all of his experiences regarding Mr Jobs. And, um, he couldn't have been kinder to me and, and more generous. Uh, so that was a very positive experience and really it's my job to be, you know, to, to not judge anything, just to absorb it and try to reflect that back, I guess. And taking into account as well the text that I am given to tell that story with Mr Sorkin's dialog.

Speaker 4:          28:27          You know, there's, there's no improvisation in terms of, you know, might participating in what that story might be. It's, it's there for me and, uh, it's my job to give it truth, give it life. Uh, uh, interpret it. Um, in this case it was a much more sort of a collaborative process because I became, and often it's the case with telling the story of somebody who actually lived you. I find that I have to become the authority on that character because then nobody else has time in out to say, well, actually, you know, he did this or he did that. I have to know as much as I can. Uh, in the case of boardwalk empire, I got to know as much as I could about Arnold Rothstein and, uh, and uh, was able to, you know, throw opportunities. It's just about options, you know, say this happened, you know, if you want to use it, that's great. In this case, it's not a story about necessarily about Edward G. Robinson. Our focus is Dalton Trumbo, so I offer as much as I can. If it's helpful, great. If it's not a let it go, you know, it's, uh, I, uh, I try to offer as much as I can. I don't want to become a burden and I don't want to overstep my boundaries,

Speaker 3:          29:42          but I feel like at least it's, it's out there as an opportunity, as something to, to share it, to help with. Yeah. And by the way, I, I happened to know Andy and I know he very much appreciated your, your, uh, uh, um, the way you played him. I'm glad. I'm glad. I think that's the, the thing is, is to, to be authentic, to find an essential truth. Um, someone asked me, uh, when we were screening in Toronto, you know, how much of the film is not true? And I said all of it, you realize they're actors, right? You realize that he's not an energy Robinson. He's interpreting it. Richard Robinson. It's not history. As John McNamara says, it's a story about history. And it is, I think a little bit of a distraction to focus so heavily when you're, when you're watching a movie that's derived from historical thing on all the factual, you know, uh, uh, accuracy.

Speaker 3:          30:40          Things like, wait, that didn't happen on that day. That happened on a different day or that that though, you know, this is their, um, you know, they changed the names of that character. They did this, that's not the, the restaurant where this happened, that happened at a different restaurant. Well, if you are so slavish to that level of accuracy, you would have had to tell this film and you'd have to sit in a theater for 13 years to watch it because we condensed it. That didn't really happen in two hours. It happened. So the point is not to be facetious about it because I do think there is validity and comparing a truce, true story to history. That's, there is something because you learn about the storytelling from the differences, but to dismiss a film, which happens a lot these days and some great films recently because it's somehow took license.

Speaker 3:          31:28          I think if it, if the license is, gets you further from the truth of the, essentially the essence of what happened or the essence of who the people were, that's a really legitimate criticism. But if the film, as we tried to do is trying so hard to get it right in terms of what it was about, what every character cared about, um, who they were as people, what, what, what their dilemmas where and there, then I think there is, it would be ashamed to say no film is valid if it's not perfectly adherent to the, to the facts. Otherwise you have to throw out Shakespeare. You have to throw out. There's never been a film, never in the history of filmmaking. And I would argue never in the history of playwriting either, that has been so faithful to the facts that it couldn't be, uh, you know, uh, um, you know, that it couldn't be ripped apart.

Speaker 3:          32:23          And when you started comparing it to what really happened, I think that, I think that's very valid. Um, but it is an interesting, interesting question. We see this in the world of politics. I mean, Cheney, for instance, Dick Cheney was, you know, the common technique. He was the leak something to the New York Times, right? And then three days later when it was reported by the New York Times, he'd point as reported in the New York Times where he would actually manage to transmute ally and too, but I think there's a big difference between claiming something is factually accurate and and versus saying this is a, an interpretation. For example, we use a lot of archival footage in the film to say this actually happened. There's real Ronald Reagan sitting at a table. There's uh, you know, the real, the real room where this took place, the walls of our set we're at, we shot on green screen and he lack hearings and went to DC and shot stills of the actual walls of the actual room.

Speaker 3:          33:20          All right, so we went to that level of accuracy and then I do this trick I Dolly and on Bryan Cranston as Trumbo intercut with real footage of the real hearings. Now our footage is made to look black and white to match as if some in some weird reality. Bryan Cranston's Trumbo is there at the hearings in 1947 that you've just seen actual footage from and I move the edges of the screen out to the full one widescreen format. I dissolve to color, right? Is Bryan Cranston and saying, I'm not going to answer yes or no because you know, to answer some questions, yes or no, you'd have to be a moron or a slave. And we push in and put the sound into the wide, the wide speakers, you know the surround sound, and I'm saying this is now officially not history. This is a construct. This is an interpretation.

Speaker 3:          34:11          It's an actor who I've craftily tried to blend in and, and take you there, but remind you, be skeptical and be a participant and ask what's real, what's not. That's part of the deal here. You're, you're being asked to take this as an interpretation and go with it. But I'm reminding you that I'm going to mess with you. And that's, I think that that's different from saying, know what I'm saying is the facts and you should base every decision in our political system or whether we go to war on, on this claim that I've, that I'm due to it. Does that make sense? Absolutely. And you know, I mean look, you start from the basis that what is truth? I mean so much is perception and not, yeah. I mean there are very few things that we can easily label is binary, true or not.

Speaker 3:          34:57          But then you ask, you know, Mitzi, uh, and Nikki, you know what's true about this? And there were lots of debates about some, some licensed we took and they were very valid. And some in some cases they got us close so much closer to the truth cause they gave the details of what really felt like to be in that family. But then they bow had to have said the way Brian portrayed their father was so close to some essential truth of who he was. That it was disconcerting sometimes and even surreal. And that's, I think that's the greatest compliment to how Brian came at it, was that he was, he was that committed to the truth. And I really think Michael's, that story of Edward G. Robinson is so heartbreaking to me. It was so important to, and I, he did go so much deeper than I had time to go and each character, so he would bring an idea, various cool, simple detail that I love was that he, Mac, John Mcnamara had it in the thing that this first real, the film within our film that goes wrong in the middle of a take, he flubs a line and he knew from reading about about energy.

Speaker 3:          35:58          Robinson Robinson would never blow a line, but he was terrible with props. So we put in there that he, he has a prop gun that he's supposed to be super threatening with, but in a weird gesture, the, he mishandles the profit flies up, the bullets fly out of the gun and land all over the stage. And it was, it was, it was so cool to know that that was an essentially true part of who, who Robinson was. Whereas what we were going to have him do wasn't, so we went for the authentic thing, uh, as, as close as we could and it just enriched the story. And that's what, that's what happens when you're working with such a great actor who is so committed to some, to the, to the nuances and the details that that give something a life to it. That's, that's, that was amazing. Well, by the way, interestingly in my, my wife not with Brian refers to him as dad, which is a little younger than both of them. They seem doctor Freud, exactly an answer to that. So Michael, let's switch that around again because you've worked with, with many filing directors and imagine all of them have very, very different approaches to how they work with actors. Um, do you select directors as carefully as you select role? I wish. What do you want? What do I wanted to direct your question? I was the answer that

Speaker 4:          37:17          no, I mean honestly it changes from job to job because sometimes you can, you can just know it in the deepest part of who you are as to what a moment should be about or what a character is like. And other times you might have no idea. So, uh, in some cases I want to be a collaborator and absolutely share every thought and idea with a director and to say, what should we do together? What can we do? Help me be on the outside, help guide me through what I'm doing, cause I can't look at myself while I'm doing this or I don't want to look at it while I'm doing it. Um, uh, uh, and in some cases, I know a lot of actors don't want any direction at all. They just want to get up there and do their thing and you know, you can cut it how you're going to cut it.

Speaker 4:          38:05          Uh, it's, it's, it's often described as a director's medium. Um, and uh, I agree with that to a great extent. However, uh, depending upon the length of a shot, you know, if you shoot something for a very long time, it depends upon what it is you're shooting. So it's, it's, uh, you know, I like to think of the collaboration with the director as a collaboration, uh, as opposed to there being any, a sense of hierarchy. Uh, um, and like I sort of inferred a, it would be great if I could choose which directors I wanted to work with. In my case it's been just dumb luck honestly, to get to work with the folks I've gotten to work with. Um, and really just trying to make the best of my situation.

Speaker 2:          38:57          Great. Well, we're at Google and we can't have a conversation at Google without having some question and related to technology. Um, and you know, obviously we're a company born of the Internet and the Internet has had a massive impact on how all forms of, of media of being distributed and accessed. Um, we talked once a about this and you mentioned for instance, how dramatically different the financial structures and frankly, compensation was based on say, a studio financed and distributed film versus an independent film. And we're now potentially moving into an era where there could be such a thing as a self distributed film. Um, what are your thoughts on that? I mean, I, I know you're a very tech savvy person, but how do you look at that?

Speaker 3:          39:42          I think, well, I, you know, I think most artists would answer and say the more you could, uh, connect directly to the audience. You know, I was very envious of, uh, listening to Louis Ck last night. Talk about the way he, um, you know, comedians work their business when they're, when they're working at the scale he's working at where you go, they go and rent a place, you think of, Oh, I'm played Carnegie Hall, Carnegie Hall. So someone at Carnegie Hall invited him in to come in and put a, or Madison Square gardens. But, uh, he like all comedians and I think most musical acts to go and rent the space and then pay the overhead and pay. But the, the world of how it's done and all the business is theirs. They own it. And film has always been owned by the studios, every aspect of it, including the copyright, which is always astonishing to me that unlike in theater, uh, you know, are the writers get to keep their copyright and licensing.

Speaker 3:          40:38          The studios have set it up early on that they, because they were the capitol and the, the, the, the, you needed the big buildings and the big machines to do it. They owned everything and that worked out great. And I think the studio system, you know, made, has made so much, so many great films. I've, I worked almost all in the studio process. I think in the comedy world in particular, they're very good at it. But I'm so glad to see other models kicking in. Uh, a, I've had a great time working at Hbo. I think their model is really interesting where they're just, you know, not we can box office oriented or not, uh, you know, ratings oriented. But the new thing that Netflix and Amazon and Google and apple to some extent to where it's, it's a whole different, uh, more I think more direct shot to the consumer is promising.

Speaker 3:          41:32          And the, as the technology simplifies, as you can see, as you can actually shoot a feature film on an iPhone now, um, and cut it on an iPhone if you want, you can cut but it's easier to use a laptop. Uh, you, you may or may not still need to go through such a gigantic bureaucratic, um, sometimes, sometimes artistically controlling organization to, to speak what you, to tell the story you want to tell. That's thrilling. That is reeling because it will become more like, I'm just going to sit down and write a novel today or, or a short story. You can, you can, you know, my kids are, my, my one son is, is making short movies and he can post them on youtube, you know, and they're there. And if you work it out through, through whatever, you can get a little piece of the financial action, you know, just, just yourself, just you uploading it to things. So I think that's, wow, that's thrilling. And I, I see it as the future, you know, it really is. It's happening, but I mean, it's going to really start happening now, uh, in a very short, short term future, I suspect to you, what do you think?

Speaker 2:          42:41          I think without question, I mean, we have seen, you know, as we've seen the internet evolve. I mean, the one thing that is clear is we're seeing vastly more expression from vastly more voices than we've ever seen in the history of civilization. You know? Yeah. Stop.

Speaker 3:          42:56          It's new. And News is, that was the first to go. I mean, you can suddenly be your own news outfit.

Speaker 2:          43:02          Precisely. Yeah. And that's, uh, you know, as I often say, it's the back to the first amendment again. It's a, you know, you can, it's easy to look at the Internet, uh, you know, in the United States and think of it as the first amendment come to life in that ability to have that access to distribution. And now, you know, the first amendment guarantees you to write, to express yourself. It doesn't guarantee an audience who's going to listen to or quality or quality. And that is certainly true in spades with the Internet. Uh, I don't suggest that the Internet is the solution to all things as I often point out. It has value, but it doesn't have values. Uh, it's, it's all what we make of it.

Speaker 3:          43:38          That someday some other longer conversation about how news is evolved and how under the fairness doctrine and when there were three networks, somehow news was so, uh, you know, so, but it was controlled and we didn't know how much you filtered it was, but it, you know, was it better back then with Walter Cronkite and Huntley and Brinkley or, you know, did it ha, you know, has it, has it evolved to a, it's hard to tell when you watch CNN and Fox and, you know, it's hard to tell if they've got better. So it's a really, uh, it's a really interesting thing of, of uh, yeah, what, what, um, what the democratization of, of our media has accomplished. And I suspect that a jury that will always please

Speaker 2:          44:18          be out. Yeah. And we never know. I mean, cable, I, you know, I was, I was there at the beginnings of that and you know, cable television is actually proven to be a rather remarkable disappointment for the purposes of journalism. It's turned into nothing more than a continuous sequence of confrontational chat shows. Yeah. Um, uh, you know, hopefully we'll see that. And I think we are seeing will evolve hopefully. Yeah. So promising for awhile. Yeah, it is. I mean we're seeing great investigative journalism done by small outfits that are willing Pulitzer prizes. On the other hand, I would suggest that the birther movement would have not taken hold. We're not to the fact that you can find hundreds of sites that will back up people's fears and disbeliefs. Right. So as you point out, you know, free expression doesn't guarantee quality. It simply guarantees the opportunity to put your voice out there.

Speaker 2:          45:09          And I think the challenge for all of us in society now is to try to figure out how do we sift through that to find a way to separate to wit from which I have, which I think is cool about some of the stuff you guys are up to that, that is, that is the p the pickle. And I think, I do think it's a healthy thing, but it's going to be very chaotic for a while, still longer. Um, um, before it's, before it becomes, as, as it lives up to the promise. Well, I just want to thank you usually for coming and spending the time here and, uh, um, uh, for Googlers here for Googlers every word watching the live stream, and we'll have that video available on Youtube for others to look at as well. Okay, great. Yeah, thanks. Thank you very much for having me.

Speaker 1:          45:52          Thank you.
