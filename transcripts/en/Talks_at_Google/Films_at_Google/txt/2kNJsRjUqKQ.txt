Speaker 1:          00:06          Right. So far

Speaker 2:          00:11          stop. I'd like to bring out Mr. Jason Mitchell from the CAS.

Speaker 1:          00:16          All right, daisy, come on in. Alright. Mr Osei Jackson Jr.

Speaker 2:          00:24          Oh, say Jackson Jr

Speaker 1:          00:26          I'm going to sit on the farm. The farm. Yeah. Yup, Yup.

Speaker 2:          00:33          All right. Mr Corey Hawkins. Come on up.

Speaker 1:          00:35          Sorry.

Speaker 2:          00:42          Uh, steam director of the film. F Gary Gray. Ladies and gentlemen

Speaker 1:          00:46          that Gary Gray

Speaker 2:          00:53          and producer of the film with no introduction needed. Mr Ice Cube.

Speaker 3:          01:12          Yay.

Speaker 2:          01:12          Hey now. Hey now. All Right, welcome gentlemen. Thank you guys for coming. So we're going to have a nice little moderate a discussion. I'm going to open up to Q and a for the audience, so we'll have a nice little about one hour or so conversation. So hope you don't mind with that. Um, and my first question to the group, whoever wants to go first, why did you say yes to the story of straight Outta Compton?

Speaker 3:          01:35          Um, to me, you know, it was just the perfect time to tell this story. So many people have, uh, been entertained off the Nwa family tree for the last 25 years, sir. And, uh, you know, it was just like, yeah, there's some people that that don't even know I rap. You know what I mean? As that's out in the world. And, uh, so we want to show him the origin where it all started, what we went through and what we, uh, had to kind of endure, uh, just to be ourselves. And, uh, you know, to me it's a great American story. It's a slice of life. We want to show people the, you know, people know the when and the where we wanted to show people why, like, why do we make this kind of music? And it was all because of the environment that we grew up in. Compton, south central La Watts, long beach. And, uh, you know, to me it was like the perfect story is, is juicy enough to be a movie. Uh, so it had all the ingredients for a great, great film.

Speaker 4:          02:53          Same question to a director.

Speaker 3:          02:56          Oh, well, for me, um, I love a challenge. This movie

Speaker 5:          03:00          is something that, you know, kind of fits in that category very easily. I've never done a bio pic before. Um, and it's, you know, kind of one of those things where when you get a chance to kind of take off your world building hat in a world of fiction and put on your journalist hat and historian hat, um, this is an amazing story. If you break it down, uh, this rags to riches, there's triumph and tragedy as a lot of the universal things that people can really kind of tap into and no matter where you're from. And so as a filmmaker, I gravitated towards this. And, um, even beyond that, I felt like it was personal to me and I feel like it's personal to me because I grew up in this environment at that time, not too far from ice cube and was involved with their careers once they left Nwa and direct and our music videos and things like that. So it was the perfect time for me. Um, and it's arguably the most important film of my career.

Speaker 2:          03:57          Awesome. Thank you so much for that. I have a question about casting for the film. Obviously we have these great gentlemen here who played that we rose to the film. Um, and I had a question about casting. So I read somewhere that you said that this was a full circle moment for you in this filming and authenticity was key to the casting process. What made you say Yes to these three gentlemen for these roles that they were able to play for this film?

Speaker 5:          04:19          Just hands down their performances, you know, for, um, Jason, you know, he has a lot of experience, you know, in New Orleans, but you know, in, in, in, in the streets and, um, you know, he brought a great performance, but it also, I could tell that he really had a lot of, um, experience, a lot of experience that I could use and help to help create easy e. One of the biggest things about casting that role is not only his performance but as a street credibility. And so with Jason, he has, you know, a lot of street credibility and also he's a great actor. Um, with Corey, you know, he has a different background, you know, went to Julliard and, and, um, was doing Broadway and Shakespeare and things like that. And he came and completely transformed into Dr Dre. And so that was, um, a thing that was, so it's just, he just jumped off the screen in a way that no one ever had regarding these auditions. And it was great. And for Shea, you know, he worked the hardest, you know, he worked the hardest to get the role and I'll let them tell you about their journey. But authenticity was the key and they brought it.

Speaker 2:          05:35          And to the cast. Actually, I wanted to ask that question. What was that journey like? How did you guys become these characters that we are so happy to get a chance to see you pretty soon here?

Speaker 6:          05:45          Well, I will say the hardest part about this entire project was the prep. You know, we put so much, so much time in the prep, uh, audition for this role for over two years, uh, before, you know, getting called bags, different acting coaches and Erin's Speiser. He works with Wellsmith. Susan Batson works with Nicole Kidman. And, uh, once I got selected, even work with Dustin Felder who works with will's kids. So I've had a collective effort, three different teachers, three different techniques to really form one project. And uh, you know, I, I definitely couldn't do this without them. Uh, and they led to a chemistry test where I meet these two right here and, uh, you know, I had never done a chemistry test. I never, you know, this is my first go around and I walk in there and a, I go to meet, uh, the people that aren't, that are around, I see a Jheri curl.

Speaker 6:          06:44          I'm going to go say what's up. So I had over to do and I ask him, you know, how I introduce myself? How you doing? I'm going to say, uh, you go for easy. And he says, no, I'm going for cube. And then, you know, after further, after further review, I see what kind of, you know, what kind of a soup I am. And you know, it's just, it's a, it's a different kind of set up. The competition look Gumbo with the same ingredients. Exactly what I'm saying. So, you know, there's, there's two other cubes there. So the, the pressure was always there. And you know, once I, once I booked the role, it was, it was a weight lifted off my shoulders. But even then, I knew the real work had to start. Uh, I had to look 17, I went on a strict diet of, of dirt and grass and diet water and you know, uh, I lost 15 pounds in 24 days of crossfit training and, you know, shout out to PJ stall. And we recorded the entire album. It when we all went through our own separate boot camps. These guys can attest to their, their hard work, but you know, nothing about this film was easy, but great morale makes great movies and they chemistry I have with these guys and the rest of the cast, it shows in our film. And you know, it's, it's all a test to the techniques that we had to go through during prep.

Speaker 7:          08:12          Uh, for me, I'm, I'm like Gary said, I was a at Julliard, um, just doing Broadway Shakespeare in New York and um, I had heard about it and you know, my agent was like, you know, this, this movie straight Outta Compton. I'm like, dope. Like, that's cool. Like how can I get in there? Like, what role can I play? He's like, go in for dre. I said, oh wait, wait, wait, wait. Come on. Come on Dr Dre. And uh, so he was like, um, yeah, yeah. You know, we got the audition set up and everything. I say, listen, I'm not going in for it because first of all, I don't look like him. I don't sound like him. I don't think I, you know what I mean? I just don't think I can do that. It's same things that get in your head as an actor, um, you getting your own way.

Speaker 7:          08:58          Right. So he, he was like, okay, okay, okay, but I'm gonna set up the appointment. I said, no, call me back eight o'clock that night. And he's like, the casting director called and said, you didn't come in. And I said, I told you I wasn't going broke because, um, but you know, I knew, I knew that this project was going to be special because of who was involved because Gary was involved in cute was involved and dre was involved in the other, you know, members of Nwa and easiest widow and, you know, and, and so one thing led to another, I skyped with Gary. Um, and then ended up, you know, thank you man. Uh, flying out to La to do the studio test and he don't run studio tests like normal people run studio test. Like he had about five, six cameras rolling on for one set up.

Speaker 7:          09:46          All, you know, and it was, it was crazy. It was, it was wild, but it was surreal. And all I remember thinking was, you know, looking back at a time when I was doubting myself then while I was in it and I was like, Oh yeah, I'm about to, I'm about, I'm about to go on this, you know what I mean? I'm, I'm, I'm ready now. I'm hungry. I want it. Um, and then, yeah, we, we linked up and the work began, but there was so much work before we could even start the prep work before we could even start principal photography. So we'll talk about that. But, you know,

Speaker 8:          10:15          love me. I was Kinda like in a situation where I felt like, um, you know why I had done a couple of active projects here and there, you know, but I was like Kinda day plan, you know, cause I'm from New Orleans and I'd never even been to California and nothing like that. But, um, it kind of started the pickup, you know, what my acting career and I've done two movies with Mark Wahlberg. I did, um, broken city and contraband. So I was kind of like on the radar for universal. There was like this kid, just a good dude. Like he, you know, he worked hard, he'd come, he'd do his work and he just, he chill, you know, so there was like, maybe we should read them for a lead. So, you know, they sent it to me and I was like, easy, Eh, Ooh, Ooh.

Speaker 8:          10:59          So, you know, needless to say, you know, I, I took the opportunity serious, I did my homework, you know, did what I could and, um, I really just went in, like put my foot in it, you know, and the lady I read with, she's a lady named Megan Lewis from New Orleans and, um, she's normally like really, really like straight forward. It really serious, you know, she's really Boston if anybody from Boston, she's really, really Boston, something like, alright, you know, and I went and read with her and, um, we had this, this, this different kind of vibe in the room that day. I remember her giving me like the double high five and all that, and she walked me to the car. I was like, this is no, you know, so I was already feeling good about it, but then it took them like almost a month to call me back. So I was like, ah, maybe I didn't get it, you know. Then when they did call me back, they were like, Gary wants you to out, you know, for, for, um, a car back. And I'd be like, wait, wait, can't you still like not get the road when you get a call back? They was like, yeah, that was like, ah, well you know the way my bank account set up,

Speaker 9:          12:06          oh no, y'all might got to get back at me, you know? And it was like, well,

Speaker 8:          12:11          you know, we'll call you back, you know, see what we could do about it. So they called me back like 30 minutes later. It was like, man, Gary loves you. He wants to Skype with you. I'll be like for him. Ah, you know, so I went down and did it and we skyped for like, I was 17 minutes and probably some seconds, you know, but I was like, you know, whatever, you know. So I just remember, you know, cause I had to do this scene where I'm like breaking down something like crying and he's like, breathe, breathe. When I'm like finally like I'm not nervous no more. Well, the audition is over now, so I feel our breath and I'm like, I just bust out laughing. So I all these other voices busts out laughing and I can't really see his face on the Skype, like, what's happening, what's happening?

Speaker 8:          12:53          So I never heard the words I booked, you know, so like later on they called me and they're like, we're going to fly you out for a studio test. And that's where I meet these guys. But unlike them, I was the only easy e. But in my mind, I'm thinking, man, maybe they too big, they have to come to a studio test like this. You know, I'm like, you know, so I'm like, I'm on full pit mentality. I'm like, I never thought I got the role. So we're, we're going through like days of it, you know. But through that I could like feel this chemistry going on between us. It was like Gary could throw something in the mix of wedges. We was like, Paul Ryan, is that it? You know what I mean? It was, it was crazy. And you know, shout out to the guys who didn't get it, but we already knew what was that we already knew, you know? And, um, yeah, we went into a boot camp that was, that was some crazy, cause I like this guy, you know, I like to the dirt and lemon grass that he was eating. We had to eat 4,000 calories a day, boxing training, then weight training. Then I had to go learn how to do, you know, walk and talk like easy e and perform and do our ladder and record it, then rehearsal and then do it again the next day for two months. So yeah, it was for real.

Speaker 2:          14:01          Okay. So this next question is for Cube, obviously in a Gary, what was it like having Nwa on set with you guys during this process? Like how was that experience reliving this story with your, with your team, with the crew and with the whole production cat?

Speaker 3:          14:17          I think that was, you know, the, one of the funnest parts was to see them perform. Uh, and we got this big arena full of people and they was actually going to get up there and do it for real. And I've never been to an NW,

Speaker 3:          14:35          it's kind of cool. You know, I was like, damn, you know, it is, you know, it was impactful. It was powerful. And I'm like, man, this is powerful for for 2015, you know, I can imagine how it was for 1989. Uh, it was just a treat to see it from afar and Kinda and, and look, be looking at us, but, but you know, actually be an audience or bottom monitors with Gary. And it was just, uh, you know, I wanted them, you know, some of them most amazing giddy feelings that we've had with each other for as me ran yella tray, you know, seeing them up there, you know, we were just like kids, man. And it was like we were just like old times, so it was so fun. Um, but I did feel like we was in a back to the future movie.

Speaker 3:          15:31          I see. You know, I felt like we was going to change history if, uh, if, if O'Shea water wrong hat and shit, everybody started disappearing and Shit, you know, so, so, you know, we just, just, it was just a great, great experience that I'll never forget that we all went through the fire together and we bonded. I'm bonded with these guys just like I'm bonded with Nwa because they are Nwa now for everybody who looks on the screen, who don't pick up a documentary, you know, when they see Nwa, they got to see these guys. So they are as they, they're an extension of, of us. So it's a beautiful thing.

Speaker 5:          16:18          Do you, so was the question, how was it having the real Nwa on the set? Yeah, well, you know, for me it helped out a lot. For me, the best film making is, you know, uh, you know, when you have someone at the helm who just gives you details and really pays attention to detail and just does all the research and the homework to transport you to another time and another world and make you feel like you're there. And so to have Nwa on the set. For me it was great because I'm getting firsthand accounts of all these moments in the studio, all the fights, all the great moments, all of the pottery, all of the stuff that was going on. And so when you watch the movie, you, you, you, you really get a sense that, wow, these guys were brothers. Um, you got a sense of the anger when they were angry and it wasn't something that you just, um, I was at Google and you know what I mean? Like I don't wanna say it like that, but I'm just saying like, you can go beyond, you know, Google's though, don't get me wrong. Nope, of course. Google is Hashtag Google's dope. No, but I'm saying you get, you get details from the guys that you can't get on Wikipedia or online and those details really help the movie feel authentic. We did Google a lot too. Right.

Speaker 2:          17:38          And funny you should ask that. So we are in a technology company, we are at Google. Right. What would make in this process, what would making this film in like 1995 91 have been like with the ad says a social media and how do you compare that today to what we have today? Like what do you think Nwa in the story would have been like with technology and with social media? The way it was day back in the Nwa is days.

Speaker 3:          18:02          Oh man, you know, everything would have just happened a lot faster than I can. I can't imagine that because you know, it, it happened fast for us. So we thought we was just going to be local. So we thought our music was so rough and so underground that we would just be, you know, underground artists and never really get to this level and a, so everything would have happened at a, at a breakneck speed. Uh, so, you know, it's, it's, it's interesting to think about, I'm kind of glad it happened the way it did. You know, because you never know. One little change, one little thing in history and you know, might not turn out like this. Uh, and you know, this is a story. And Ana and I kept mentioning that the reason we want to tell this story, cause we all been entertained by Nwa for over 25 years.

Speaker 3:          18:57          Uh, you know, know Nwa. There's no poison. The hood movie, No boys in the hood movie, No Friday movie, which Gary Directed, uh, and we did together, you know what I'm saying? And so these things, uh, these things all coincide with each other and it's a great origin story because, you know, people love snoop and them and them and all these things and you know, they bumping they beats and all that. And we wouldn't have none of that without Nwa. We might not even have shea junior without Nwa. So, you know, everybody world is that, you know, so, uh, you know, is really all about showing people where it came from and, and celebrating it in and making people a part. You know, the way Gary shot it, you feel like you were in the studio with, you feel like you rolling with us. You feel like you're being produced by doctor dre. So, you know, these are experiences that we understand, we felt and we want the audience to experience what we experienced. And, uh, you know, Gary did a magnificent job in capturing, you know, everything that we want to show. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          20:18          And this question is for you Gary. Yeah. It felt like La and south central Los Angeles and Compton or actually the sixth member of Nwa and this film, it felt like that was actually a character of the film and the way that you really took care of filming and doing those things there. What was that process like actually filming most of the movie, particularly in the Los Angeles area, home, southern California earlier?

Speaker 3:          20:39          Well, it was crucial, you know, like you said, it I, Los Angeles, Compton, south central, you know, they, they do feel like the sixth member

Speaker 5:          20:48          of Nwa and it's because all of the things that happen in that area, in that era really forging Nwa, all the good stuff, all the bad stuff, all of the things that they went through and you hear it and their raps you hearing in their poetry. And so, um, being able to open up and show not only wide shots of Los Angeles with the palm trees and you know, and um, how kind of beautiful but dangerous it is. Um, being able to tap into the street culture with the car, custom cars and even our atmosphere, our extras, all these things lend itself to making it feel like Los Angeles and the 80s. And it's just about authenticity. You know, when you watch the Scorsese movie and he does a casino, Vegas is the, a character in a movie. And um, all of the different things that you get the nuances from Los Angeles really helps serve the story. And that's why it was important. So this question is for the task mates. What were your favorite moments from set?

Speaker 8:          21:51          I'm glad you said favorites with the NAS babies. With the nurse. Yeah. That's so dope. But um, they met me. Has So, so, so many good moments, you know? But, um, that cube said like, he never been to an Nwa concert and I'm not a rapper, so I lived with della because her before, you know, but I went through this process of kind of like,

Speaker 1:          22:17          yeah,

Speaker 8:          22:18          being like y'all on TV, you know, to be in like

Speaker 8:          22:23          super confident when I'm around these guys. You know, they was the same people who were like, y'all are the dues for the job. You know what I mean? But until you see somebody come out, the character that you normally see them in, it don't really feel like that, you know? But when we did those concerts, you can see them like, yeah, you know, you could see him in that zone, like their eyes light up and you're like, wow, that's what's up. You know? So like, it was good. You know, it's like that type of feeling that you have, you get to like really do that rock star life for a minute. You know what I mean? It was just, it was a famous moment. It was super dope. Yeah. Uh, who's, who's seen the film.

Speaker 1:          23:01          Okay.

Speaker 8:          23:02          All right. Ooh, y'all in for a surprise. All

Speaker 6:          23:05          right, well then, uh, you know, that, that, that, that changes things a little bit. Um, I, one of my favorite times on said, uh, it's in the trailer. Uh, you know, I, I'm pretty upset at a, at a man in an office, you know, kind of, I kind of take it out a little bit, but one of the highlights of us film and the movie was Paul Giamatti bouncin with a BB and some gold ropes on to why g hitting the switches that, uh, you know, Paul Paul Giamatti was the, the veteran and the rookie locker room. You know, he had things to say to all of us that build confidence in us. His, uh, yeah, Tom Brady, uh, his, uh, he ain't Cheetah. He, uh,

Speaker 9:          23:58          he told me, you know,

Speaker 6:          24:00          he would tell me, he would tell me about his father, who was a famous baseball player. Like is if you, if you look him up, you know, Mr Giamatti has a huge role in baseball, but he was, he was telling me, uh, the amount of pressure he would feel if he had to play his father and in a role. So, you know, it would, he, he told us all things that, that built up something and then say, you know, I appreciate everything. Football.

Speaker 7:          24:23          Yeah. Give it, um, it was uh, it was probably, I mean it was, I think it was definitely the, the concert scenes. You know, it just had to be the concert scenes because again, I'm not a rapper either, so no, I'm saying to be up there. But the thing about dre, he was Sorta, you know, on the tables back in the day. So it was just cool to be up there really like spinning and like, cause I had to actually go through that and learn how to Dj literally learn every single thing, every single producing, you know, everything about it. But um, those were the moments that we really felt like Nwa. And then to have, like you said, La is, is like a competent, it's like a six character in a movie. You know, we had people bring in as plates, onset of food and sitting on the rooftops and you know, hold my baby, you know, stealing easy east chairs come back though. I'm thinking most people would take the chip back. They take the whole chair. I'm like, whoa. Really? Was it was, it was positivity though. You know, it was just a lot of positive energy. And it's funny because in the news and the media, everybody tries to say, Oh, you know all this, you know hootenanny is that a word?

Speaker 9:          25:38          You know, Hashtag [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          25:42          movie, you know, all this craziness around it.

Speaker 9:          25:46          Ooh Man. Craziness around surrounding the movie. But every day we got a new nickname. Now you're officially stop this right now. I'll give you a man who here what they call me like you have, you have a nickname. Oh Gee, doctor. Who'd Nan who? I think I heard that since like the dukes of Hazzard, 1983 Oh man, I'm going to know inside job forever. I can't even go on it. It was just, it was real positive, real path causing. Awesome

Speaker 2:          26:32          for you cube. Um, Compton, that's where you're from. That's your city, that's your hometown. What does straight out of Compton, what does this movie mean for your philanthropic efforts that you're for the city and how can this film success tied to those programs that you're running out there?

Speaker 3:          26:49          Well, you know, it's like, you know, Compton and south central Long Beach, it was like we was trying to really put the west coast on the map, you know, before Nwa, uh, it was only one real west coast rapper getting any light and that was ice t and. M. So we was trying to, to inject some kind of pride into the city, uh, before easy. He really pushed for Compton. You know, people was, people didn't even want to admit they was from Compton, you know, it was like, it was so bad and everybody knew that it was such a raw area that people wouldn't even say they was from there. They were saying it was from Carson. You know what I'm saying? Which is right by Compton. And, um, so he injected pride and you know, by, you know, other people, Sam Brooklyn's in the house, Queens in the house.

Speaker 3:          27:47          And we was like, Yo, now Compton's in the house and you know, people were Compton with pride. Now I see my man with the Compton on his hat. So it's a, it's a badge of honor and people know that there's talent there and uh, you know, it's just really about, given that talent, inspiration, showing people that we come off the same streets you do, and it ain't just comped and it can be anywhere and ain't gotta beat your hood. It could be the suburbs, just do it, you know, just have passion and a, have a drive, have a commitment and have some discipline and you can get a lot of great things done. So that's what we're really trying to push. And, um, you know, dre has really stepped up for the city of Compton as well. You know, he's, uh, you know, donate in a lot of, is, uh, I guess money from this new album to Compton. And, you know, we're figuring things to, to do for the city as well as, you know, easies uh, kids, you know, his kids are left behind and all when he passed away. So we just trying to hold the legacy up. That's all. That's great. That's beautiful.

Speaker 5:          29:00          Yeah. Um, for me, um, I've worked with dre over the last four years or so. Um, it, give it back to, to Compton specifically. Um, but I have a youth center actually called the Tom Bradley Youth Center on Pico that I've adopted and over the last decade have been instrumental in keeping that place up and going and running and working with a lot of, uh, kids without parents. And, um, there's a elementary school and watch called a hundred clustery elementary school and also Verbum dei high school where I put a film program and, and, and those places in order to show kids that they can do other things, um, that's creative like they did, they picked a pen and pad

Speaker 3:          29:42          in a microphone. So, you know, we sent cameras and editing equipment and stuff there and been doing that for quite a long time.

Speaker 7:          29:49          No, it's crazy. I feel like all you gotta do is touch one life man. Like in, in what they're doing is, um, it's, it's powerful because they have a, it's a family tree, you know, that they create it. So, you know, we're an extension of that, you know, of their legacy and, and hopefully this film, you know, continues that too, but like just what they've done, you know what I mean? In terms of giving back and just showing up. You touch one person, that person gets touched millions that, you know what I mean? So I just think that's huge. Okay.

Speaker 3:          30:20          Well we can keep down on a hootenanny.

Speaker 9:          30:27          Good luck Cory. Good luck Corey.

Speaker 2:          30:35          So it's been about 25 plus years since the release of f the police. And um, this movie did such a brilliant job of depicting a police brutality and what that element did to people in the cities of Compton, in Los Angeles and to people all over the country. What, what has changed? What do you think has changed between then and now, and what can we do to really elevate this conversation and to support projects like straight outta Compton that are doing this as well?

Speaker 3:          31:04          Well, not enough has changed, you know, and this movie really highlights that, that uh, uh, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Um, I think what, what insights you, when you see it in our movie is the fact that you know, that these guys are trying to do the right thing. So the humiliation is that much more, you know, and I think it's more humiliation, uh, is really the, the type of abuse that we highlighted. Uh, um, so, you know, I just think we got a weed it out. Um, and it's, it's very funny and I just don't understand it that a guy can go into a church or whatever, kill all these people and they walk him out like he's the president, you know, and bulletproof vests and shit. And you know, I was like, whoa. And then the little 18 year old kid, the mouse off at the cop, he's the one with the black eye and a busted nose.

Speaker 3:          32:14          So I just think they need to refocus the anger on real criminals that do real crime. You know, if you want to beat up on somebody beat up on a child molester, you know what I mean? Not The kid that's a little drunk coming from is, you know, uh, coming from the party or whatever. So you know, these things, you know, it's just uh, uh, a mentality that we got to correct. Okay. Now I think the solutions are, uh, more body cameras, Dash Cams, all this stuff, just to be able to hold people accountable, be able to see the real picture of what went down and it just hold people accountable. You know, everybody crossed the line every now and then, even regular citizens cross the line. So when they cross the line, you just hold them accountable and it's starting to happen. And, you know, I don't, I don't think no cop want to go out in the day and then end up on CNN and later that night.

Speaker 3:          33:16          I don't think nobody wants to do that. So I just think, you know, those kind of things are helping officers think twice. And I hope our movie helps people to think twice that, you know, you can't, you can't, uh, pain our community with a broad brush. I think there were all the same, you know, for all the statistics that they show about the crime in our community, 40%, this 30% that just know that there's 60% that don't do it, there's 70% that don't do it. So it's more law abiding citizens in the hood and criminals and, and um, that's really what we just trying to show is that, you know, don't paint us all with the same brush and a treat us fair like human beings.

Speaker 1:          34:09          That's all.

Speaker 5:          34:19          Well, I think you, you're really, he really hit the mark, you know. Um, you know, we've done a lot of talking. We've done a lot of protesting. I think we should start focusing on a solutions. You know, I'm cautiously, cautiously optimistic that a lot of the headlines are going to put pressure on our leaders and our leaders in law enforcement to make change in the culture. This is not just one cop at a time is a, you know, you wouldn't do it if you didn't feel like it was okay to do it, you know. So we have to change the culture. You know, you come to Google, it's not just about a job, it's a culture and that's why you guys are who you are. And so successful. So in police and law enforcement culture, there has to be a shift. And that style, it starts at the top, not just what the guy who's having a bad day.

Speaker 5:          35:01          And so I think that if we consider putting pressure on our lawmakers to change federal law and make it a felony to tamper with audio recordings and video recordings and things like that. And so if you're caught up in that, you go to jail and you'll spend time with those criminals that you're trying to, um, um, you know, keep behind bars, make it a real penalty, not just, you know, uh, you know, consequences of an invisible investigation and make it a real penalty. And I think if we start, stop burning down our cities, stop just talking about it. I mean the conversation is good, but let's on solutions.

Speaker 7:          35:38          Um, I believe there was a study in Rialto, California where they put body cams and dash cams on every officer they are in, basically they'll complaints went down by 88%, and the incidents went down by 60% over the course of actually just eating a year, I believe, or something like that. And so let's start focusing on solutions less, not just, you know, channel our anger and, and, and, and, and conversation on protesting. Let's look at real solutions. And I think that's part of it. Um, my mother is a police officer and, uh, it was one when I got to sit and she came to visit set, they were like, you might have to recast. Okay.

Speaker 9:          36:18          Right.

Speaker 7:          36:20          She, she, so she's a cop, but, uh, she's a fan of their, their music. She's a fan of them, you know, she's a fan of the culture. She's a fan of, uh, of, of Sam positivity, um, in which she does in the community. And I think a lot of departments can take a lesson from it is, is, you know, her and her partner, they started this thing in DC. I'm from DC, um, and, and it's called Friday nights out. And basically they set up these stages around different parts. You know, th th the trouble areas in DC, you know, where I grew up and they allow kids to come out and like if you wrap, you can get on stage and you have a place to do it. You know what I'm saying? If you seeing you, you know, whatever, if you, you know what I mean?

Speaker 7:          37:02          If you, if you'd like to do art, they bring out artists and they work with the kids on Friday nights, the nights where people, you know, can get in a little bit of trouble. You know, they like to do that. And it's the police officers who are down there. So, you know, she likes the art. So she gets up there and does it with them. And you know, it's little things like that. They're really change, you know, the, the, the, the community and because they're supposed to be, to protect the community, they supposed to know when they walked the beat, they supposed to know who live in this house and who live in that house and understand what you can understand and have that dialogue with the community. Then you can, you can, you can open it up, you know what I mean? The possibilities are endless and the possibilities for negativity that stop, you know what I mean?

Speaker 7:          37:42          Um, but I think that's just one little, you know, the one thing I like to add too is just, let's not mistake, I don't want anyone to be mistaken about our story. And the message within a story. This is not an anti cop movie, right? It's an anti criminal movie. You know, excessive force is a crime. All right? And, um, ultimately we know there's a lot of peaceful warriors out there that put on a badge, but on a gun and that will help us. And I think most of them fit into that category. So for other cook good cops that are out there, we're not talking about, you were talking about that people who have the propensity to go overboard and, um, do what they're doing. That's what we're complaining about. Yeah. Yeah. Let's, let's not get it twisted. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          38:24          Somebody break in my house. I'm calling the cops. I'm not calling the homeys, not calling Gary. I'm

Speaker 3:          38:36          calling the cops. So you know what I mean? It don't, don't get it twisted. We just want to clean up a couple of, couple of missteps, a couple of little over aggression, you know, uh, it's just want to clean that up. But you know, we were not anti law enforcement by no means, no means.

Speaker 2:          38:54          So we're going to start lining up people in the audience for Q and. A. So if you have some questions, please start lining up now. And I wanted to wrap this up today you guys, thank you so much for coming. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          39:04          You guys are having, it's definitely doable,

Speaker 1:          39:09          right?

Speaker 2:          39:15          My last question is a quick rapid fire. You're going to start with, I start with straight out of, and you're going to tell me your answer. So ready. And I'll go around. So straight out of Long Beach,

You did that and see, and you hear what these guys, it's absolutely amazing to see if y'all didn't hear the first Hootenanny's a real word, right? Okay.

Speaker 3:          39:57          Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go. We're going to use it every day.

Speaker 10:         40:01          Um, Mister Cube, your highness.

Speaker 3:          40:04          I love it.

Speaker 10:         40:11          No, it's like when I saw this coming today, I heard you guys, I'm Jason Ellis. A couple of days ago, which fascinating interview the child did with him on Sirius. But everybody was stunned that I was coming over here to talk to you all, at least on my team. So is there any tangent that could get a picture with y'all too?

Speaker 3:          40:27          Prove I was actually here. We only taken one picture is yours. Come on up. We'll take yours. Have it.

Speaker 1:          40:34          She's lap collab. Google is,

Speaker 3:          40:41          hey, can't believe you up here because it all it is hootenanny everybody say who? Nanny Hashtag

Speaker 1:          40:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         40:57          so maybe you'll take two people, not just young and just, uh, so this question actually is for a doctor. Hootenanny no, I'm just kidding.

Speaker 3:          41:04          Keep Rolling.

Speaker 11:         41:08          No, it's not going to end for a log time. You got out of the side that, yeah. Uh, first of all, I just want to say a raider nation. We are always in forever. Yeah. So I'm from southern California, born and raised in Barstow and grew up really truly with a hip hop is as everything that pretty much got me to the place where I am now. And music, like express yourself and lethal injection and all these incredible albums that you created, um, had so much to do with where I am today. So I just wanted to hear a little bit about all of your musical influences and what really inspires you and inspired you in your role.

Speaker 6:          41:44          Uh, I'm completely inspired by him. You know, it was all about, you know, a lot of people didn't want me to get the role, but he wanted me to get the Bra and that's really what I needed. Um, he, uh, he's had my back forever. You know, I just wanted to make sure I had his back on something and in everything, you know, as far as what I'm doing in my career in film and whatever I choose to do further and music is to further build on this empire that he started, you know, and, uh, I'm just thankful that I'm given the opportunity to do so. And, uh, you know, I'm gonna make it rock. Okay.

Speaker 8:          42:25          Well, I'm a music dude, man. I'm a really, really, really good fat to have, you know? And I'm like, I kill it in the shower. Awesome. I'm one of them dudes. You know what I mean? Like, like music is a part of my life, you know? And they just, it make everything go together for me, you know? And as far as like straight outta Compton goes by US rerecording the whole album, I think he put me in a different mind frame of where I am today, you know, because I kind of view us as like the old Nwa, like, you know, the situation they were in because it's so much controversy that surrounded this movie and all that. But it's still like a super positive thing that we're doing no matter what may come out of it. It's still words and it's still art that we'd given them, you know? And it's like, it's, she mentioned in that forever, you know? So for me to be a part of that is like, it's the best to say that these, you know, so yeah, that's what's up.

Speaker 7:          43:21          Yeah. Same here, man. I'm, I'm, uh, I'm just a fan of music, so for sound good. If it's, if it's honest, if it's, you know, coming from where you come from, then, then it's, it's good. I rock with it. But, um, in terms of like, just inspiration and in playing this character, I just look up to these guys now, you know, it's like I really see where they came from and I see what they're doing now. And I'm like, I want to do that. I want to be a movie mogul. You know what I mean? I want wanna, I want to own a business.

Speaker 8:          43:48          I want to be a billion. They're so freaking bad.

Speaker 7:          43:54          It's so crazy. Like to see the possibilities, you can do it, you know? And, uh, it's, it's just great to be a part of this, this family tree. So that was great.

Speaker 3:          44:05          Musical influences. Uh, George Clinton and parliament Funkadelic, you know, they really showed us how to not care and be yourself, you know, and just do what you feel. And, you know, they so, you know, light years ahead of a time. Um, still, you know, that music is still intricate in, you know, complex and free of any kind of, uh, chains or musical, um, I guess, uh, parameters, you know, they just do what they feel. And, uh, so, you know, George Clinton, parliament funkadelic, Rogers App, uh, James Brown, you know, uh, these guys are, they are a blueprint and you know, we are an extension of what they have done. You know, you got P funk, you got g funk, you know, so there it is.

Speaker 5:          45:14          For me, I always kind of just loved the artists that just stood up and had the courage to go against the grain. And Marvin Gaye, me, the album called what's going on when he was making balance and he just stood up and said, you know what, there's so many things going on around me. I can't just talk about love stories and things like that. And that's an album that he got a lot of problems, um, and a lot of flak for, um, for, for creating and then, you know, then putting it out. But it's a classic, and I'm not just saying this cause cube is here, but he made an album like that called death certificate where he talked about the social ills around, um, where we grew up and just stood up and with all the controversy and all the judgment that came, um, I just like I'm inspired by artists that stand up and even in the midst of all of the pushback and the criticism and controversy and speaks to what we go through. And I'm Marvin Gaye's, you know, my number one and you know, Cube doesn't notice, but you know, he definitely inspired me as well.

Speaker 3:          46:19          Now we know.

Speaker 11:         46:21          So I am just so excited that you guys are here like presenting to this audience. I'm just so glad that we had this opportunity to see you and listen to you and your actual like perspectives. And to that end, um, just real quick queue. I cannot believe I'm addressing you. The person who wrote no Vaseline cause that was insane

Speaker 9:          46:44          as an eighth grader. Like it was crazy.

Speaker 11:         46:48          But the question that I do have is for Cuban Gary, how do you feel about people taking your work? Kind of out of the context that it's in and enjoying it like mainstream America enjoying it but not really understanding what it's about or where it's from. Like the example with um bye Felicia. How that's become like a great phrase for everyone to use and then they don't really know that it's from Friday or who Felicia

Speaker 9:          47:13          [inaudible]. That's ridiculous to me.

Speaker 11:         47:22          So how do you feel about things that when they happens like that when it's co opted by, like the main stream culture,

Speaker 3:          47:30          you know, I don't mind as much, you know, cause I figure to the cool people in know what I'm talking about, you know, and everybody else and everybody else need to catch up. You know, that's how I feel. It's like a paint and you know, once you put it on the wall everybody's going to have a different kind of interpretation of what you were trying to say or do. And that's fine. That's what it's all about. You know, I can't tell you what to think about my song, you know, you gotta tell me what you think about my song. You know, all I could do is do it, do it how I feel it. And you know, when Nwa, I don't want to say that we was, you know, this super positive political group that went to go politically changed the world. No, we, we had a lot of records that was just straight raw, uh, and probably wasn't positive at all, but they was honest.

Speaker 3:          48:31          And I think that's why people love us because we was honest. We wasn't worried about that part. We wasn't worried about the people that didn't like us. You know, we were just worried about what we liked. And, you know, a lot of more people was on our side than against us. And, uh, that's why we still here. So, you know, it doesn't bother me at all that people misinterpret anything that I do. You know, it's all are like he said, you're just expressing yourself. So, um, I couldn't put it any better than cute. Put It, you just express yourself and let it be what it's going to be. And that's it.

Speaker 6:          49:08          The people who don't know that by Felicia is Friday or the same people who are Twitter say, aw man, Kanye is going to blow this Paul Mccartney dude up. Or Man, thank God Katy Perry found new artists like missy Elliot for the Superbowl halftime. They probably, you know, those people will probably watched straight outta Compton and be like, oh, this should be a real group. You know, so, you know, that's, that's, that's my piece on that.

Speaker 12:         49:40          So real quick, I just want to thank you guys for coming by. Yeah, I'm striped from comp to actually I grew up on Maple Avenue, east elementary, Roosevelt middle, all that stuff. Um, so they're kind of, I have a question specifically for a Cuban for Gary. Um, when I was growing up, a lot of like my friends and staff really bought into Gangsta rap and they kind of figured that there were really only two options, right? It was either going to be music or I was going to be sports and like I've tried to go back to the community just to tell them about, well, you know, you could do programming, you could do, you know, other kinds of arts, you know, you go on to Madison and all that kind of stuff. Like what would you guys say to maybe those youth in Compton Long Beach, you know, you know from where we're from that think that music and um, in sports their only option.

Speaker 5:          50:28          Well, I like to speak to that just because, um, I grew up in south central La and I don't have a degree. I didn't go to college and I went into film, you know, I didn't, you know, do all the things that, or, or at least I didn't feel like I had limited options. You know, I just found something I liked and I just stuck with it. And um, you know, you can get in the program or whatever you, you know, you want to get into. And I was on the streets. You know, part of the reason why a lot of the work we've done together, it feels authentic cause cause I was really there and either witnessed it or um, you know, was involved in it. So you can make a transition. It's about what you create. You can create your own universe. And I know it sounds Cliche, but it's real and I've, you know, like right now I'm super nerding out on model airplanes, you know, and I'm building seriously.

Speaker 5:          51:15          And it was telescopes down. No, it was, I mean I, I've gone through a few phases, you know, studying the, the surface of the moon and things like that. And then I w I build my planes and drones and cameras and, and, and I just started flying airplanes so you can, you know, be wherever you from and then just have the courage to make the transition. I love with cubes done where he's gone from, you know, gangster rap to political rap and back and to movies into, you know, giving people opportunities. And he's a family man, and he's not afraid to stand up and say, I'm going to make the transition regardless of what you think. You can judge me. It doesn't matter. So from people from Compton or wherever you from, just don't be afraid to be judged. It's okay.

Speaker 3:          51:59          And there's all kind of, it's all kind of, here's what I tried to stress that it's, you know, whatever industry you love, there's a thousand jobs around that industry. You know, you don't have to be in front of the camera. Matter of fact, that Karen man had told me when I was shooting Boyz in the hood, he said, I've been sitting behind this camera 35 years. I shot everybody. I see him come and go in front of me. I'm still here. So sometimes the jobs that are the real jobs is behind the scenes. So we got to just encourage, you know, everybody's not gonna go on, uh, you know, be the player or be on stage.
