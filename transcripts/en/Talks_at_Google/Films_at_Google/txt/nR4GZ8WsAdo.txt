Speaker 1:          00:09          Thank you so much for being here

Speaker 2:          00:11          guys. Have a seat. Let's chat. I know this is Google cause we're miked right here. Might all this tech is here and cameras are all set up. It's, you know, a Google the place. So, um, first of all, welcome to Google Chicago. We are so excited to have you guys here. This movie is incredible. Um, I guess I really shouldn't be saying welcome to Chicago for you because you are kind of a Chicago Guy, right? Yep.

Speaker 3:          00:35          I lived here 11 years.

Speaker 2:          00:36          Incredible. Yeah. Any love to hear? I mean obviously you've done some amazing work around Chicago stories, right? Whole food barbershop. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:45          Yup. Roll bounce. Right. I did about at least about six, seven movies here. Actually, one thing I'm very proud of with my business partner Bob title, when Obama was here, um, you know, he actually greenlit the tax incentive for film. So we were one of the first major guys to allow five, you know, movies to come to Chicago with a nice discount for a filmmaker. So I was really proud of that. Wild is, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:12          That's just incredible to me. And so one of the things that I see as a consistent theme through some of your films is the fact that you have a pension for telling stories about the culture, all sides of the culture, right? You know, you get your sadness and your happiness, you get the joy and that's a lot of what we get in the hate you give. So yeah. Tell me, what about this book and the screenplay drew you to it. Why did you want to tell this story specifically?

Speaker 3:          01:35          Yeah. What I really love about it was it was specifically about the culture, about this young girl and her family. You know, the ideal of navigating between the two worlds. So the ideal of her struggling and then that being compromised when she witnessed the shooting of her best friend. I just thought that was an interesting character arc. But what I love is how the family is always centered and no matter how tough things get, no matter how you know, people in the neighborhood telling her not to say anything about the shooting or how much pressure she feels from the police department and how much pressure she feels from her white friends, her white private school, she just push us and it makes the film has this emotional rollercoaster. Where are you going through all these emotions? That's what I really imagine envision for the movie. When I talked to Angie, because her book was very amazing, but what I really love is how, which I find really significant is that you can tell a movie about this specific culture, but it can be for everyone. You can do it with a way where you're not compromising who we are. And I think that's the key. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:44          and that's one of the things that was the most beautiful about it. I mean, it's the kind of movie that can speak to a range of audiences and really welcomes them in with open arms, which is so incredible and hard to do. I think so. Amandla for you. What brought you to this movie? So I hear

Speaker 4:          03:00          that you signed on even before the book was published, you were all in ready to go. This list for you. How did you make that decision? What connected you to star story? Um, what connected me to this story was the book by Angie Thomas. And if you haven't read it, I highly recommend that you do because it is so beautiful. Second that, um, uh, yeah, I was immediately just blown away by this story and the power that it had in depicting a nuanced experience of blackness in a contemporary world. I felt like not often are we afforded those sorts of representations. And so it was really exhilarating to me to see this girl who was code switching, you know, um, who was presenting herself differently in different spaces. Right. Um, and then the way in which she's galvanized towards activism because of these really tragic events that we've often become desensitized, desensitized to.

Speaker 4:          03:54          So to see those placed in a personal narrative and to understand the power of, you know, instilling empathy in people through that. But that's what really drew me to it. And so you mentioned code switching and that's a term that's kind of gaining more and more attention as people are trying to understand what it is to be a person of color and two different spaces in the world of white space and a black space. Can you explain a little bit more about that and how star sees herself code switching in the movie, the specific situations that she feels that she needs to make that change? Yeah, sure. So I'm code switching is, you know, entering spaces that you know, you're not necessarily fully accepted into. And so understanding that the way that you present yourself in that space might be a little different from how you are and your most authentic environment because you understand that if you present as authentically as you are, it could be detrimental to your success, unfortunately.

Speaker 4:          04:57          Or you can be further alienated or isolated. Um, which is something that everyone does, you know, and they're at home and probably a little different than who you are at work or at school. Um, but stars really caught in this dichotomy, which I actually experienced as well, um, of growing up in a neighborhood that is black, um, and has a lot less privileged than the neighborhood that the kids at her school are from because she goes to this school an hour and a half across town. Um, that's mostly white. And so she's one of the only black students there and she does a lot of self policing because she knows that these kids don't understand her experience of blackness, don't understand her community or who she is or her culture. And so she figures out how to adjust to that environment in order to be more accepted. Absolutely. And so the way that that manifests in the film is she has star version one and star version two.

Speaker 4:          05:56          And, and when I first read it in the bucket, it really just, it registered in a way like I've never seen it depicted like in any sort of piece of media before. Um, where, where star describes the experience of feeling and hearing your voice change, right? When you enter a space that you're not most comfortable in a, or at least when you enter a white space in which you understand that your blackness will not be understood. Right. So I've really connected to that and this whole idea of star being, you know, kind of canonized by her peers at school as a, an accessible black girl, as a nonthreatening black girl, as a not like other black people, black girl, you're different, you're different. You're not like them. Um, which is just so kind of invalidating and simplifies our existence in a way that's really detrimental.

Speaker 4:          06:55          So it was so exhilarating to me to see a portrayal of a black girl that was actually reflective of our experiences. And that was really expansive and all encompassing and multifaceted because oftentimes, you know, we're, we're only given a certain amount of tropes that were allowed to play. It's a little box. Sometimes there's a little box. Yeah. We can play, uh, the humor. We can play the pain. Yeah. But not often is it that we get to be everything. And so that's what was so exhilarating about reading this character. Um, you're right. And the unpublished manuscript and wasn't out yet, but it was, it was floating around because people were so excited about it. And I attached really early on

Speaker 2:          07:41          your heart latched on for sure. My battery on that says something about the work for sure. Yeah. Um, another thing that I kind of want to discuss, I mean it's super, super timely. Obviously police brutality is on the top of mind for so many people and especially here in Chicago with the case of [inaudible] Mcdonald's, Jason Landegg just being convicted for his murder. Um, what is the importance of a movie like this landing at this time? You know, there's never a right time to, to talk about the hard things, but it seems like this is almost healing in a way for this movie to happen right now as some things are changing in America.

Speaker 3:          08:18          Yeah. I just felt like, um, you know, it was just that we were just in, I was just telling a Madela like when we were in Atlanta last week and, um, and we finished the screening and someone tapped me on my shoulder and I turned around, he asked, can we take a picture? And I was like, yeah, we can take a picture. And he'd like, thank you so much for the movie. And he said, we are the family of Emmett till. And, and I was like, you know, just kind of blow me away. It was the whole family, like six of them. And I just think back to, you know, Ayman Til being here from Chicago, going down to Mississippi. You know, he had sort of the early, because his mom was telling him how to act down in Mississippi. Right. And how to conduct yourself as a little different from down there.

Speaker 3:          09:01          So that talk is something that you progress over the years. It probably was started through slavery, you know, when, when we were free and how do you act around certain people. So I just felt like it was very important for other cultures to be able to recognize and see that, you know the talk to some people it's like the birds and the bees, but for us or African Americans or people of color, it's a difference. So I'm in a young girl like star, just have to navigate and keep pushing through. She's very much of the world and know how to interact. I don't know how to move inside her guard heart hikes world, but she has another, we have these other things on this as well. So a lot of that is just to let people, as Angie was say, who wrote the book is to have empathy, what people go through and also recognizing how did these things happen and in the shooting of the cop, why did he react the way he react? We talked about that and we see it from a black cop perspective with comments and we'll see sometimes is not that much of a difference. So when you think about that, it has to be the system, right? The system. How did they teach cops? What did they, who are in charge, who are the leaders inside those departments? And we don't condemn. We don't. We just show what the reality is so we can cause conversation.

Speaker 2:          10:16          I thought Commons character, uncle Carlos was so unique. Like you were saying, you don't often get the perspective of a black cop. I mean it's such an interesting situation to be and where you know, you see what the people are going through, you understand you're part of the culture. And then also being kind of on the other side of these are your coworkers, these are your colleagues and how do you speak up? So He's, he's so nuanced in that way.

Speaker 3:          10:39          Yeah, it is. It is true. I mean that's, let's say all of us in this room, we all have it inside of us. I mean let's just take comes character myself. Like as an African American man, it is a conversation that we have had in rehearsals. If I'm walking on the south side of Chicago, if I'm by myself as an African American man, and if I see three African American guys walking on the other side of the street and they walk over here, I'm going to think something's up, right? I'm gonna move over to car, cross the street. So that's that own internal racism that I have within myself, within my own culture. So that has to be broken. That's what common realizes when this young girl start confronts him. And those are the kinds of dialogues that the movie brings up. You know what I mean? On both sides.

Speaker 2:          11:22          Beautifully done.

Speaker 4:          11:23          I think Angie's, you know, intention with the book was to like present these topics and these issues in a way that was, yeah, I've come that was inclusive of different perspectives. Um, that didn't further perpetuated divisiveness, you know, that grounded it in humanity and like we always get asked about the timeliness of this project. Yeah. But the thing is, has been timely for a really long time. Waste unfortunately, will probably be timely for awhile. Um, but we always get asked is also really interesting question. Or I think last night we got asked it, which was, um, what is the role of an artist in social movements? Like what is the role of the filmmaker? Um, you know, when is it time to make art and then when is it time to get up and go out in the streets and protest. And, um, and I think they're so interconnected and both are so, are so invaluable.

Speaker 4:          12:20          They weren't off of each other and they work off of each other as, you know, like art has always been one of the driving forces are conduits for social movements. Absolutely. Like they have like a really beautiful symbiotic relationship. And so I think that was the driving force behind this pieces to make something that in the midst of what feels like chaos and what feels like times in which things are postulated is so black and white, right, wrong versus right. Me versus you, um, winner versus loser. Uh, I think it was, it felt important to create something that explored it in a way that would ground us and what makes us most human and understand that every single experiences is multifaceted. And it requires a, in order for there to be any sort of movement made or any progress made, do you have to consider even your enemy in a way that is not one dimensional.

Speaker 4:          13:21          Right. And it also comes down to empathy, like you were saying before, just being, um, being able to understand and look at another side or perspective. Yeah. Um, you mentioned the humanity in this, you know, there's so much going on this movie, there are so many themes, but one of the things that I found really interesting is your portrayal of the black family. Right? Um, you don't get a lot of that and TV. I mean we're, we're starting to get there a little bit more with shows like blackish and we're normalizing it. Um, but maverick is such an interesting character as well because he is this father who is so complex and you know, he's done time and it wasn't necessarily his fault, but he's coming from this one life that he had before and it's kind of completely switching into a new role and he's being a father. Um, I'm interested to know what was the most important thing to you when you were portraying black masculinity and fatherhood and the home in this movie?

Speaker 3:          14:15          Yeah. One of the things that, um, that I love that, you know, the perspective of having a father in the, in a movie like this, because you know, when I look back, I've been making films for for a little bit since the 90 [inaudible] that full out. So when you look back at it, I say some of the African American characters that films that have African American characters in it, 80 70% of them don't have a father figure in the household was always a single parent. And that's not the case in the neighborhood that I grew up and I had fathers next to me to the left or right of me. It was a community. The community actually raised everyone. And that was always a barbershop like Mr. Lewis and always a barbecue joint. And like Mr Reuben, you know, like, I don't know if, you know, you noticed on the wall it was like he would give kids free barbecue if they, he sees their report cards and that's the kind of re that's the kind of thing that we wanted to bring community back. Uh, one of the main thing is, um, I love their relationship. It was very strong in the book between Matt and his daughter. And I thought that was great. And one of the things I love to say is that the family has so much joy in it. A, we had so many levels of humor. Yeah. Believe it or not, there's a lot of humor in that movie.

Speaker 3:          15:30          It'd be a lot of emotion and it's fun. You will be entertained. But it just were issues that we see every day. And um, I really do believe that film is an entertaining venue. That's why people pay to go see movies, to be entertained. But the movie has that, but you'd be able to relate to it because there's the family and no matter all of these obstacles they keep pushing through. They keep going through and at the end we see star has her journey. And that's the main thing that I'm really proud of. That it was two parents. They are very close. Yeah. They talk about sex a lot.

Speaker 3:          16:05          Relationship grounds. Yeah. Grounds them together. I just had some memories. I just had memories when I was, we were doing a scene in the diner and how the family after this big incident, the families just hose the hands together and they pray. So to me that was a throwback to soulful around the dinner table and the food. And every, and I even tell the actors to do it. Everybody's just started overlapping, talking dialogue, talking about food, eat that hot sauce. Don't put the hot sauce in there. You better get to those festivals for all that was just, we're a family at the time.

Speaker 2:          16:36          Yeah. Yeah. And that's what makes for a really authentic storytelling too. Um, and you, you mentioned the fun and the joy and the humor and a lot of the things you were shooting. How did you guys maintain a sense of joy? You know, I feel like black joy and black excellence, black happiness is so important in terms of self care. So like even when you're shooting a scene that is so heavy, that's emotionally charged, how do you guys kind of come back and find the joy in what you're doing? Well, we have Regina Hall on sets, right? She has a jazz man. She's hilarious. She always brought the joy,

Speaker 4:          17:14          all is brought the humor. Um, I think it's just kind of our natural inclination to work through trauma that way it's rely upon our humor and our joy. And even though this experience was so intense and traumatic at times, yeah, there was always a sense of levity and like all is a sense of community and family. Um, and a feeling that if you really were coming up against a wall emotionally and, and you were tired and you know these events and portraying them feel so heavy, there's all this someone you could turn to who would have your back. That's, I think so

Speaker 2:          17:52          community and it's very finest. Kind of having a nice family to shoot with really helps with that kind of thing. Yeah. Um, talking a little bit more about, you know, having that community and that family all RMU onset, um, in the movie, I guess stars trying to figure out who her community is even outside of her home. So in her school I Williamson Chris is a great character. He's really interesting because he's navigating allyship and trying to figure out what that means for him, how he fits into the scene, how he fits into star's life. Um, if you guys had to I guess, determine something that's important for someone who is trying to become an ally or trying to figure out how they can get involved in movements and civil rights and racial equality, what's the first step? You know, it, it can feel heavy right, to, to step into a world you're not used to and be like, you know what? I'm with them. How do you do that?

Speaker 4:          18:47          Um, one of my favorite lines when I, when I read it in the script, it gave, if I had this feeling of like a retribution of like, oh my God, I wish I'd had this in high school, would have saved me so much like internal strife. Um, but there's this scene where Chris says to star, I don't see color. I just see a person for who they are, or like guys and star says, if you don't see my blackness, you don't see me. Amen. Uh, and that was so validating to read on the page because I think there's this idea that owner, to be an ally, you have to look at the other person as your equal. But almost as if in the process of doing that, in order to do that, you have to discredit the aspects of them that are different or that make them more marginalized than you.

Speaker 4:          19:36          Um, when really it should be the opposite. When you look at someone wants to be an ally to them, it's so important that you are inclusive of all the aspects of their identity that make them them and see them. And the way in which, you know, those aspects of self, uh, dictate or, or influenced their experience cause the idea of, you know, oh, I don't see color. It's like, really that's a great, great intention of course. For sure. Yeah. But it also rests upon the assumption that we live in a post racial post identity is society. And we all know that that's the case. I would love, we would love that, but that's not where we're at. So the king, and I don't even know if it's possible for be in a place that, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't use identity or as, as a lens through which we primarily look at each other.

Speaker 4:          20:26          So I think being an ally is about looking at someone and, and not being afraid of this comfort of, oh, this person is different than me. They're experience is different than me. Uh, it's not about trying to, um, postulate their experience as equal to yours, but rather like respecting it and all of its differences. Testing, learning. Yeah. Learning about it. And I really think sometimes it's just about shutting up, sending down, shutting up and listening, open those ears. Uh, yeah. Cause I think that's was really, um, you know, when there's a group of people who have historically taken up the space and been very comfortable in that, it is very uncomfortable to no longer take up that space or, or you know, control it or kind of demand that you take up most of it. And so it's different what it looks like, discomfort, um, to, you know, people who have historically had privilege is often just equity.

Speaker 4:          21:29          Um, and that's what's really essential for Chris to understand is he needs to take step back and not take up as much space even in their conversations. Right. Um, stars really assertive in and making sure that he's listening to her and saying, you know, actually this is my time to talk and listen to me raise my story, here's my story. And so I think that's a huge part of it is stepping back and being like, oh, I'm so used to taking up all this space right here, but actually let me step back. I mean draw it back in and allow this other person that the time, um, and the space, he's in the word space a lot in the time and the space, um, to express themselves and express their, their perspective.

Speaker 3:          22:17          Yeah. They're just like two people. I'll be, there's two lines in a movie to define that. How an ally can work, you know, um, Sabrina Carpenter plays Hayley, right? Eh, she says who else is going to speak up for our people? Girl is, she's a white individual saying that. And then you got shook my car. Yeah. You got Kj. APPA who plays Chris in his line is being an ally. What do you want me to do? Where do you want me to? What? How can I help? Absolutely. So that shows the difference between the two that we show two different sides. One is about listening instead of trying to follow somebody. So being a part of it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          22:56          So, uh, one thing that's really interesting is, you know, as star is trying to figure out whether or not she's going to use her voice and speak up, I mean we see that happening in different ways in the world now with like Hashtag activism, right? So it's incredible that we're using social media to, to say their names and to learn more about the stories that aren't really being told without it. Um, but then bringing that into the real world and taking another step is very different. So what advice do you have for people who are learning to speak out, who want to speak out, who want to try and do something new, but are kind of feeling that that little bit of them that's holding them back. What's the first step to, to kind of opening yourself up to trying something like that?

Speaker 4:          23:41          Hmm. Um, I really, because I really love approaching activism from a place of like art history and humanity. And like when Angie Thomas wrote this book, she was still in college, she was writing it on her lunch break, lunch break.

Speaker 2:          24:01          That story too. There was a short, so it's, sorry. Yeah. You know, she was

Speaker 4:          24:05          someone who is active socially active on the Internet but wanted to find a conduit through which she could express it further or take the next step. And for her that ended up writing a novel. Okay. I know they run it up and that that has now been New York Times number one bestseller for 83 weeks. You know lievable I'm not saying that's going to happen to it,

Speaker 2:          24:28          but I'll name find your own lane. But I feel like I'm,

Speaker 4:          24:32          I dunno, I really believe in the power of, of expressing your activism through your artistry. And this was such a beautiful opportunity cause it was this like synchronistic like beautiful thing where everything came together and we able to marry all of the things that we cared about. Um, and I feel like, um, yeah, it's about expressing yourself and whatever conduit that may be, you know? Right. And so we, I think we have some audience questions coming up for you guys. Two quick questions before we have to that. And you guys can kind of start lining up at the mic if you have any questions you want. Okay.

Speaker 2:          25:07          Ask. Um, on a lighter note for both of you guys, you being a Chicago guy, having lived here for so many years, what's one of your favorite places to eat in the city?

Speaker 3:          25:17          You know what, they got one and they have one in Atlanta, but it's this, yeah, this is not the same, but right down on Wabash, you know, right in front of Columbia college was Harold's chicken. Okay.

Speaker 2:          25:29          Always still stop by when you buy. Could we, yeah, my wife. Can we stop by? It's a classic. Okay. And then for you, um, I heard that your Harry Potter fandom is real. Yes. My heart is just skipping a beat as one. So I want to know nothing to do with the movie. Just my own curiosity. If you had a patronus, what would it be? Oh my God, that's so challenging. Um, take a second. I'll start with mine. It'd be a dolphin fan. That's accurate, right? That's good. Right? I would like to think that moms would be like a deer or something, but I feel like it would probably be like a mouse. Hey, they're cute though. And real fast. Just never know anybody with questions. Anyone who wants to ask anything. If not, I will keep on going. Don't tell me what the good time. Do you want step up to the mic over here?

Speaker 4:          26:28          Okay.

Speaker 5:          26:28          So my question is, you talked about really living this dichotomy, life, uh, grown up from where you are and then having to really change that persona when you go to school. And I think about like Keith Stanfield and sorry to bother you in the movie. Now he switched to his white voice, right? Because he had to work and yet to pretty much change the environment. So I'm curious to know, how have you been able to navigate your life in your professional career where you might have to change a mannerism a little bit and kind of juxtaposing that with your actual environment from where you are back home. How are you able to navigate through the waters and kind of live two different personalities?

Speaker 4:          27:11          Um, and you know, I mean I started going to that school and I was 10 years old. Um, so for me for a long time I had this idea that there was something wrong with code switching and that, that there was something wrong with me for having kind of this multi faceted personality that shifted depending on who I was around. Um, and it kind of took me until I was a bit older to understand that there's nothing wrong with that and that that's pretty natural considering the circumstances. Uh, I used to hate that, that, that, that I had to make myself smaller, um, or, or change who I was in order to feel more accepted into that environment. But learning that language of whiteness and privilege has actually been really invaluable to me when it comes to navigating Hollywood, uh, who would have thunk it?

Speaker 4:          28:13          So, so it's a tool. It's a tool at the end of the day, I don't necessarily look at it any more as having to compromise myself. I also have kind of witnessed the shift happening where we are living in a culture that is so transparently driven by black culture and by blackness that I'm starting to notice that even in my spaces of work within my industry, if I show up to that space authentically as myself, I seem to be more accepted than I ever happened in the past. And there seems to be this kind of push for in inclusivity. Um, that is new. Um, and I'm so I feel like I have to compromise myself less and less. Um, but I'm just more accepting of all the different parts of me and the way that they manifest in my mannerisms or the way I talk all wrapped up nicely. Okay.

Speaker 2:          29:10          Oh, thank you guys so much for being here. We are just honored to be able to talk to you about this movie. It really is such a movement right now and we hope that it's going to be received so well by so many people and seeing all across the world and I really think it's going to start a lot of great conversations. I was telling you before, my husband and I saw it last night, we talked about it for like an hour and a half, just chatting and chatting and chatting. And I think that's one of the really, really special things about this movie is that it allows for that conversation in such a safe and open space, mixed with humor, mixed with emotion, mixed with, you know, your classic family. And I think that's what's really beautiful about it. So congratulations to you guys as a movie is out everywhere, October 19th to make sure you go out and see it. Also pick up Angie Thomas' book, which is based off of, it's also a brilliant read, nice and easy all the way through and just in a really robust story. And it's kind of what inspired you guys to be here this weekend. Amen. So you can see it tonight in Chicago, right down the street, right? All of you just got plans right tonight. Like now you're done. So you don't have to think about anything. So George Tillman junior and Amandla Stenberg, everybody.
