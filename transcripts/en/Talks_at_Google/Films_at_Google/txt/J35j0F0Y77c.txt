Speaker 1:          00:00          Please welcome to the stage director, Catherine Hardwicke, actress Toni Collette and Jacqueline Bisset and screenwriter and marina back.

Speaker 2:          00:11          So how are you all doing? Pretty well. Thanks. Yeah, thanks siding. Yeah, glad to be here. And the brain test. Yeah. So how did you all get attached to the project? Uh Oh, everyone's going to be okay with you. It started, it did, it did, yes. Um, wrote the screenplay and our director, our director, I'll produce a Chris Simon had met Catherine at a film festival and I think in London and a few years back. Yeah. And when we were looking for a director for our, for our film, he said, I know just the person. And Luckily Catherine said yes. So that's, that's the short form. And Tony was a mango tree and then there was, there was a mango tree in there somewhere. And then Tony was involved with the project right from the start, from way back when.

Speaker 3:          01:04          And then actually initially I was offered to play the role of Jess and somebody else was playing Millie and that's somebody else dropped out. Yeah. And it went through a few different Millie's that nobody was sticking and yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:15          well she just demanded that she was going to be milling, let's be honest. Eventually

Speaker 3:          01:21          to me was I was doing a play on Broadway and I was playing was last year, the realistic Joneses. And I was playing a very capable, grounded, solid person who holds the world together for lots of other people. And, um, I was frustrated at the last, Millie had fallen out of my friends, said, well, tell me about film because I was so eager to make it. I was attached to it for several years and I just think it's so special. Um, and when I explained to the characters and their dynamic, she was like, why would you play that role again? I've just watched you do it on stage, you need to be the hot mess. And so that's when I told the guy. And then as soon as that happened, actually everything lined up and fell into place and it obviously it was meant to happen this way.

Speaker 1:          02:01          So you felt as if, um, the characters were more or less, you kind of got attached right away when it comes to that, or at least when you were introduced that,

Speaker 3:          02:10          oh, when I read it, it was almost like I had no choice. It was like a soul connection to this story and I just fell in love with it and I had to do it. It was an, it was an, it was a need more. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:24          Oh, it was, it was, you know, Tony's kind of passion for it was fantastic. Was it? At times when you kind of think what, you know, this is, this is, you know, is the long haul. And then, and then when Catherine also, you know, join that was just, you know, then it, then it really took off. I did find out something last night from one of Tony's longtime best friends, uh, speaking about the hot. Yeah. It kind of embarrassed. Okay. Because Tony, you know, said, okay, you should play the hotness, will your best, do your best. Friends told me that she thought this part was the closest to you. Have any parts you've ever played? I actually,

Speaker 3:          03:01          I think I'm a combination of both. Yeah. That could be embarrassing, but it nearly is great. Did you guys like Millie or what'd you get to say? I mean she's horribly flawed and has made some very bad decisions, but she's very charismatic and the life of the party who doesn't admire that?

Speaker 1:          03:21          Mm hmm. What I found interesting with when he came to both the cast and the setting was that it was all set in England where the Dewberry Morris character as, um, the American that comes through. Um, were you thinking about, uh, what the story would be if it weren't said in England? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:37          well, I'm, Lorena, uh, lives in England, wrote it for London. So it was a very, I think it's, I mean it's kind of odd to me with, I mean that question luckily hasn't come up too much in terms of how, how can, how come, how come she's an American from that because it's so kind of multicultural London as it has our most large cities and my kids are at school with, with kids from all over the world. And so it didn't seem that strange to me too. You know, too when we were, you know, when, when Tony, where did that role yeah, exactly. For, that's a bit of that to be the case. Um, and actually I think it really brought something to it. So it was, it was good. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          04:12          And speaking of the script, I heard that the film was based off your radio play goodbye. First podcasts on the BBC four. Um, and I guess Catherine, you, uh, I don't know if you heard of a can buy prior to this?

Speaker 2:          04:25          Um, no I hadn't and I never actually heard that. It's not actually, it's actually not based on that. That's a bit, no, that's that, that is, no, it's kind of Nice to be able to just say that it's not, that was a project that, that, that preceded them is in a very different form with, uh, and, and written with a different impetus. And this, this, this sort of started a fresh, um, although it's a same subject matter because like lots of writers and you, you keep going back to the same subject matter. But it, yeah, it touched on the same thing. It was very different project. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:54          And he also spoke, uh, mentioned that you wrote this, uh, to be sending England to be put there. Um, how exactly, how did you like filming around England? How was that for every

Speaker 3:          05:06          freaking awesome. I didn't want to leave the city. It's such an ex culturally exciting city. It's changed so much after him over the years. Actually

Speaker 2:          05:15          I used to be an architect. I loved it. The old architecture, the new architecture adds this great energy. Like that combination, the part of the world where they shot it to that the house, her house with her husband was down near, um, the, what's it call that big round thing that goes around the London, the London eye. Yeah. Great area. Yeah. Really, really cool. And it was fantastic to see it through your eyes as well actually to see it on the shot through Caspian size because it's just the place that I'm in every day that I walked through that I, you know, and then it's kind of just seeing the kind of, the breadth of vision that you had was really, really cool. I love that. I didn't want it to be like a nodding hill where people live in those terrorists, townhouse walk ups that we've seen in a million movies. So that's why we tried to find it. We down that Great Gina, which was

Speaker 4:          05:58          a forge brick building that this new architecture would come in and put all these ramps and made it really fun. Lots of different levels and yeah, we love shooting in London. We want to go back.

Speaker 1:          06:10          Any noteworthy points from the entire shoot that you had?

Speaker 4:          06:14          What a broad question. Oh, do you want to talk about it? Okay. I've got a very determined to bladder tack. Tony kept saying, well, when we're doing that tax, the are we going to stop in a minute because I'm really busting. And they said we can't find a place to stop. They kept saying that. So Drew's addicted to this ice to teach her drinking out of those styrofoam. Very not very green at all. Um, Styrofoam milkshake cups. So she'd finished, offered it to me and I took her up on the offer and we had coats like trying to hide Tony like right in the middle of downtown landlording, those black taxi, very roomy. And I didn't feel it once I filled it twice go. There wasn't a crew member when I did the [inaudible] window that people drove by like healthy green tea. It's no great.

Speaker 4:          07:29          Maybe that's not the anecdote type it in. And it was actually, I'd have to say the moment that the scene where not giving anything away because you didn't seen it, right? Yeah. Okay. Where Tony head is shaped there was, I mean that for me was really amazing because we did that really early on, didn't we? In the shoot days. I felt so responsible as it could be shit. And Tony Shaved her head and you know, we did it like nobody likes it and anything that was real, that was real, that was not liked. And that actress Frances de la tour, she was so brave. She did was bring shady named one of the heads right. She practiced Paul Paul yet the second 18 she was going so fast. I was like, could you slow down Francis Cause I couldn't, we could barely even see it on camera. She was brave. Has anybody here ever shaved her head? It feels great. Cherry red.

Speaker 1:          08:27          In fact, I did it until about mid college.

Speaker 4:          08:31          Now you're doing it don't look like recently you haven't,

Speaker 1:          08:37          it's very refreshing once you shave your head and then everyone kind of wants to touch it. It's like, oh you're a port.

Speaker 4:          08:41          No, you got stop touching you. So yeah, although that's what she, I think she's done it before. You've done it before. I haven't done it before. Everyone was freaking out. They gave the vote cause you're

Speaker 3:          08:56          like calm my nerves. But I'd done it five times. Five Times. When did you do before I, when I turned 25, I was in Mexico. I had a lot of Tequila speaking true to the character that might've been a slightly merely my bit. Um, she would never shave her head, you know, for other purposes. Um, I did it for Peter Greenaway film, actually called eight and a half women. I did it three days after meeting my husband. I guess I was that one meant to challenge. Wow. He, he was like, yeah. And I did it for, a friend of mine is a designer and I modeled in a show of hers. We'd been in Tibet together and so I was attempting to get kind of the look of it. So just for a special treat to Google, we're going to do it again today. We know you love your hair. Cool. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:44          Unless, unless she does it, she plans to do it again. Just, um, I guess that's kind of cool. If you were to plan to do it again,

Speaker 3:          09:51          I've done it five times. The likelihood of doing it again is high.

Speaker 1:          09:57          I just want to remind everyone that we do have a mic set up, uh, on both sides of the stage if you want to come up and ask some questions. Um, but I can continue going on with more questions that I have here. One interesting part that I found about the movie was this entire theme of reckless, this kind of seems to go rampant throughout the movie. We saw your character go through quite a few reckless action. What with initially with the cancer's sprinting around because you know, she didn't get regular checkups and that's kind of how it started. And you know, right after the birthday scene where, you know, just just go to the Moore's. Um, uh, in particular what I was kind of curious about, um, how'd you approach this entire reckless attitude? I don't know if you projected anything personally.

Speaker 3:          10:46          I mean, it was all in the script. We had the brilliant gifted, this beautiful script and their story. And the thing that I love about, um, not just my character, but all the characters, they're so fully realized. Sometimes you watch a movie in the lead characters seem to be, you know, like real people you can relate to and then the other character's somehow becomes secondary. And I think the film suffers on the whole because then you're not invested and you don't believe in the real world. This is a fleet realized rich, dense life shared life that these people are living. And I love the complexity of all the characters. I love that my character is completely flawed and he's kind of, you know, maniacal at times and outrageous and completely selfish and narcissistic and it does make some bad decisions, but she's also incredibly charismatic and that in itself is basically lets lets her get away with murder where she takes advantage of

Speaker 1:          11:38          any particular point. Why it kind of seems as if reckless, which was such a strong theme in the movie.

Speaker 3:          11:43          I think, I mean, just the, for me, I, I, you know, I'm very much the strong opinion that people don't get diagnosed with cancer and study to become saints and heroes. I think it, I think they, they the best they can.

Speaker 2:          11:54          And, and, and given certainly the women that we all spoke to, you know, the, the, the research that we did and the, and the, and the, you know, everybody drawing on experience, you're just trying to get on with your life and you kind of, you have cancer for a while and have one kind of helps look after you. And then particularly what we were looking at was diagnosed in younger women. You have to get up and do the school run and you know, clean the house and do all the things and the kind of the help slowly falls away because people can't sustain it. Nobody can sustain it. And that's about all, you know, you're not sort of, you're not constipated. And I think that was what we, we sort of wanted to look at. It was just how life goes on and how that impacts on everyone.

Speaker 2:          12:30          And so that's why all the characters had their own viewpoints and we're all trying to be good and we're all trying to kind of help everyone get through it. But everybody kept making it difficult. Uh, you know, at every turn and you know, Catherine sort of grasping that and giving each character that their real identity filmic identity was, was fantastic. So yeah, it was about them. It's all about complexity wasn't, it was about how hard it is. You know, I'm for, I'm for Jaclyn's character. Oh, I'd love to hear more about that because like as a mother, I'm hearing this, it's an interesting perspective to get. Well, I haven't gotten dota like, yeah, Millie, what a handful. I mean, the fact that I, my character was away a lot, set up a situation where she resented me, I think, and was annoyed with me, completely annoyed with me that she was, she didn't, I don't think, oh, near the very end when she says, Mommy, you've still got it. Got Her almost into the taxi. Um, but my only salvation, but of all the rest of the time, I think she knows that her daughter thinks she's just really just, you know, I don't even think she has respect for my daughter actually. Do, do you think she had respect from her daughter? No.

Speaker 3:          13:43          No, not really. Not really. No. But I think I have my character had respect. Really. Yeah. Part of, I mean when you, I think when you facing at your own potential mortality, that's very, uh, kind of lonely solo journey that you have to take. And I think a lot of the things that Millie learns, I mean, what I love you, she doesn't change that much, but she does learn to appreciate what she has. And what she has is a Ford mother and she has is flawed and probably see as much of herself in her mom. Um, they're two peas in a pod. It kind of takes one to know.

Speaker 2:          14:12          I thought, well, I thought Miranda was adorable in many ways

Speaker 3:          14:15          and then I thought, but then

Speaker 2:          14:20          Millie was the doorbell in many ways too. If she hadn't been my daughter, I'd probably want it to hang out with her, you know? But I couldn't get in there between she and drew. I mean, there was just no space for Ms. Miranda for between those two. When she goes to got sick. I mean, apart from the fact it was in total shock. I don't think she knew where to start to, how to get in because they would, they'd went to each other. These other two friends, they went to each other for comfort on every level, you know, pretty much. And um, I mean there were even more, there were almost more engrossed in their friendship than they were in their husbands in a way. They were sort of, um, just very, very close. And uh, I've been in the scene when I visited, um, Millie in the hospital and then her friends arrive, you know, and she's much happier to see the friends come.

Speaker 2:          15:06          Then she has to see me ride with my puree of God knows what, what was it? I can't remember what it was, but there again, you know, she, Miranda was like, ah, you know. Okay, great job. She was not minding, but she was not really able to find a place to be. I think so. I mean, when I was sitting by the bedside, I remember thinking, this is so hard for me to sit here and not take over. I mean, let me Jacqueline, I mean I would've been, you know, I would just before I was given permission to take over, cause she says I want to go to the hospital. But before that I'm there by the bed and I'm thinking, oh me, Jacqueline would, I just would have taken over a million things. So because I'm very,

Speaker 4:          15:49          we didn't know that but I had to sit there.

Speaker 2:          15:51          Yes. I had to sit there and be, you know, be be Miranda, which was to sit there and fall asleep and wake up and think God knows what's going to happen next and she's going to die or what's going to happen. It is he looking after her and everything and is he really looking after and he gives up to her quickly and he goes out of the room and then she takes her charge immediate, she gets five minutes and she's out the door. She said, I want to go. She her husband's word of I'm going to get the nurse to get to stop you from wanting to go.

Speaker 4:          16:16          Now let's not tell the whole story. Whole sticks in the film. No, but this is going out alive, right. Or somewhere it's recorded. It's going into the world. Okay. Well, I've been the, anyway, so I didn't know. I thought it was a complicated,

Speaker 2:          16:32          but it was nice. I liked it. And, um,

Speaker 4:          16:34          one thing that was fun, uh, a couple of times you came and said to me, I think I, I can't be very nice because these characters don't seem to like me, so I don't get to be myself. My Nice, compassionate itself. You guys planned to be worse. Yeah. She wanted to be more prickly and outrageous, which I loved. If you got a question. Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          16:55          Um, first of all, well done. Everyone knows a beautiful film. Um, but I also wanted to just really get to the crux of this movie was the relationship between, um, you know, the two girls. And what I thought was done so beautifully was that opening scene where you got us to really buy in to that friendship and buy into that relationship, which is where I think a lot of movies on a similar theme fall short. So I was wondering two fold. What was your inspiration? Um, and also what did you guys do as a cast to make sure that that happened? That connection showed on screen?

Speaker 4:          17:27          Uh, when you're talking about the opening, you're, you're thinking about the, yeah, exactly. Yeah. And that's what it was a tell I that was one of our toughest things to get together. I think Catherine don't, yeah, we kind of kept writing and rewriting and trying to reorganize it and figure out which bits were going to be crucial in which bits. We don't need that, but do you need that? And that was, I mean that was really, I have to really, again,

Speaker 2:          17:50          defer to Catherine who, who had all the raw footage and, and, and more and the, and some of my favorite moments in that, that is the kind of girls running in the little, just this kind of texture or moments which made that piece really rise and, and, and you know, helps you buy into it. You know, I really have to hunt the Caspian sentence of texture and the story and the commitment to that friendship and understanding the history. So we worked, we worked on that one really hard and we'd kept thinking, I'm never sure if we've got this. Yeah. I think in the, you know, in the end it will as it was well done. And then, um, how did we create a bond? I mean, Tony and drew had barely met each other. A couple drive bys. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          18:30          A bunch of mutual friends and we'd met a couple of times, but we weren't, we put some crazy reason. We just never hung out. I wrote a letter to her kind of basically talent. It was a love letter, basically begging her to be a part of the movie and talking about why I thought she was right for it, which is that she emanates such warmth. She's the ultimate girls go. And, uh, she's, you know, if you dreaming of best friend, there is nobody better. Um, we would all pick drew, right? Yeah. And uh, and I talked about why I thought the film was important and, and I, and she, and why I thought it was rare and she agreed because she loved it and we had five days of rehearsing together. I was like praying, I hope they get alone. He Must Jay, you really can't.

Speaker 3:          19:14          But we'd already communicated with. We'd been writing a little and we both had really great intentions for the experience. And I think the fact that we knew we had friends in common and I knew they loved her. It kind of just, you know, it makes you realize you're not gonna be faced with a crazy person, um, because they are already in the circle. Um, but we just got on like a house on fire. It could not have been better. And I think it gives the film something so real because we kind of just fell in love with each other as friends and we're at the end of the movie, we grabbed, our family's, caught the train to Paris. We didn't want to let go. We had a week there and we've had several holidays together and weed, weed, weed. I, it's very rare to come away with a friendship. But I have to say, I wonder also whether it's just the material, the story is so profound and it was such an amazing experience that perhaps the two people playing that those parts, it was inevitable that we're going to be,

Speaker 2:          20:09          honestly, it's just I, you know, but how fortunate, well, I mean, I think that you can write, you can write shorthand, you can write, you can write kind of banter. You can, you can write to two people kind of acting like they're friends and if it doesn't fit authentic, you just see it. You can't, you really can't kind of fake it. You can't put those two together. Um, and you, and you did. And you know, they, they're, they're great devices as well. The Fun thing would build on what Lorena road and then they were just crazy shit comes out of her mouth and through his mouth all the time and original like neat, interesting stuff. That's like gold. I was like, yes, back there behind the camera and say Betty in that, that it, that they sort of really inhabited those characters and that friendship became an authentic one. That was sort of there on the page and then I was in real life, ladies and gentlemen. All right. You have another question here?

Speaker 5:          20:59          Um, yeah, first I was going to say, I really enjoyed the film. It was beautiful. Thank you. Um, and then I just wanted to ask, kind of along that same note, I thought what the film did really brilliantly was infused comedy to scene. So, you know, I'm on the verge of tears and then you're kind of laughing. So I just wanted to know how you found the balance between that and how you knew, you know, when you could make it fun, even though it's, you know, such a tough subject matter.

Speaker 2:          21:22          Thank you. Thank you very much. That's really nice. What I think is, it's basically the way that I see I see the world and uh, you know, probably I'm a bit twisted, but, uh, you know, something, something bad happens, then I'll probably laugh at it. You know, it is, it's kind of nervous reaction, but it's also, I think life's like that you kind of stuff comes out and you undercut it all the time. And that's sort of who I am. But also I grew up, you know, I kind of came out of a comedy background and I was always kind of horrified that, that, that can kind of comedians. So pigeonholing and I think some of the best comedy act as well as some of the best dramatic actors as well. And vice versa. You know, that you find very dramatic actors, you've got fantastic comic street.

Speaker 2:          22:00          And I think that I really wanted to kind of bring that to the script and given it, it's a tough subject. You've kind of got to go somewhere with it. That takes me in and out of that. And when you have a tragic moment to undercut it with, it was not like a deliberate, it wasn't mathematical, but it was, it just always felt right to try and offer some, and actually there are moments when you kind of can't do that. And, and the sort of the beauty of, particularly towards the ending where it becomes right to 10, you just have to calibrate it. And again, you know, the, the activism and Catherine, you know, that's, that's that, that, that genius as well. So, you know that, thank you. Good day to you.

Speaker 3:          22:37          Thank you. [inaudible] of the things I loved about it totally is so exciting because I find like straight drama or you know, just bring broad comedies, both of them equally dry. I think this film is so lifelike and so relative because we traverse between all of those areas and it's, yeah, you did it so beautifully. Bless you. When I'm actually, and again

Speaker 2:          22:56          the women that we spoke to who were going through this and then they were funny and they, and they were, you know, they were kind of urging us to kind of talk about the more taboo and of the end of the film kind of relationship, sex, how it is, you know, the kind of, the way that your sexuality becomes so challenged by, by, by what happens by, by, by IVF, lung cancer. You know. So I think it was just in the other part of the story. So, you know, it was, I think it felt right to reflect into reflect the way that the people are feeling about it. Can I ask a question? Yes, you can. Did it, did it occur to you that, that ever, ever in this version that she might not die? No, no, no. So it was, I would say if anyone hasn't yes. Yeah. No, no, no, no. That was always, that was always, obviously we can recut the end and do a sequel, but, um, but no, it was, it was sometimes

Speaker 4:          23:46          people do get, yeah, I know. I know. Yeah. No, no, I know what you mean. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, we don't want to give this away to everybody. Okay. All right. We have another question here.

Speaker 6:          23:58          So moved on so many levels by the film. Um, the writing, the acting, it was, I was bawling like a baby for great. You know, I was happy, I was sad and it really made me think about two kind of main relationships in life. One with a really great girlfriend and one of a mother. I have a one year old and it makes me think about how, you know, life gets in the way, work gets in the way, and just films like these kinds of make you think like, do you, do you do something different with your time to take advantage of that time that you do have that's outside of work and outside of kind of daily responsibilities before something like this happened. So I just wanted to ask whether as mothers or I don't know if you guys have kids, but as mothers or you know, great friends, has it made you think differently about the time that you have on earth and you know, before something like this happens?

Speaker 2:          24:49          Well, I think a lot about this anyway, but this film for me was incredibly Cathartic and it took a long time to separate from it. Uh, so yeah, I do. I think about it and there are scenes, particularly there's a scene with young owner who plays my daughter and the scene where I'm having a very tough conversation with her and I just, I'd get into bed at night to read through the script and I just could not do it. There were just some moments in there that are so kind of intense, but yeah. Uh, yes, it's, um, it's an it, I mean it's inevitable on any film you're working on for it to kind of seep into your life and for you to ruminate and ponder.

Speaker 4:          25:27          I love it when people walked out of the theater and told me that, you know, they went to call their best friend or one guy said, hey, I called my best friend to bury the hatchet, you know, that we've got to like be buddies again. Or people called their friend to go on a road trip. So I think that's fantastic. Yes. Still

Speaker 2:          25:45          want to call the person who have to tell them exactly, which just means like for films, it, it, it opens people up. You know, this film actually opens people up. And I, I love that. That's part of the reason I want to make movies. I think also disconnected and numb and for film to do that and make you appreciate what you haven't really pause and think about it. It's bloody fantastic. Thank you. Thank you for that. That's really lovely. I think it has been Cathartic and I think actually for some of my male friends who came and I know it's a, yeah, I know that is because this is sort of a, it's a trope or a cliche that you know that men, the expressing of women do. And I, and I don't think that's true. Again, my whole thing in the film was not, not to my stereotypes was to try and go, you know, something can talk about the feedings, you know, till the cows come home, some income. But um, I think it has had a quite, quite a cathartic effect on, on, on several men I know who weren't able to sort of say how they felt about recent experiences that have been very challenging for the mishap, sat in the theater. And, and just bald. And that was shopped them. Actually, you know, one of them had to go home and drink

Speaker 4:          26:49          isotonic drinks. He's like, yeah, yeah. One Guy told me that he was sitting there and he started crying. He didn't want any other guys to see him cry. So he kind of looked around, he saw the guy next to him was crying and he saw the other guy was crying. Then he saw the cheese Nachos guy was crying. It's like, oh well whatever. He said the guy had been eating cheese, not just, didn't even think he was watching the movie and then then he looked over there and the cheese Nachos or like getting soggy.

Speaker 7:          27:22          It's kind of unfortunate that there isn't the male cast here to also speak on the roles, you know, as, as everyone's kind of going. Right.

Speaker 4:          27:29          Cause we love the guys in the movie, didn't you guys like the guys? They're hot and dimensional and you know. Cool. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          27:40          But how did, um, how did you want to portray the male characters? You know, watching all these sorts of experiences that are strong in terms of some sort of a feminine hit, you know, having a mastectomy, you know, I'm dealing with breast cancer at at least with, with guys. Well I guess we also have a chance of getting breast cancer, but it's not as likely as girls mastectomies. Probably a bit more attached to, um, other women in terms of something emotive. But how did, uh, how did you want to portray the men when it comes to something observed like this

Speaker 4:          28:13          one thing? You know, a lot of times men feel like they can, they know, save the day or solve the problem or be protective. And it's not very easy when your enemy is cancer. You know, there's, that's something that a man can feel helpless, you know, and they, they want to be supportive and these guys are like, I think they're great man in the movie. I love these characters and you know, and Dominic Cooper's character, Tony's husband, I mean, he's, he's just like really a great guy and stands by her even all the bad things. She was, you know, and he's a great dad, you know, which is unexpected when you, you know, look at other roles at Dominic's played. I kind of think that I expect him to be like a bad boy or something like that. And he really stood up and it was like, great man. You know, I love that. And a lot of times we just seen movies where the men, they, if their daughter gets kidnapped, you know, they go out with a gun and kill yeah. 100 people right there. Couldn't revenge. But, you know, that's one way to be a good dad. You know, there's other ways. I think so narratively as well.

Speaker 2:          29:19          Potentially the easy thing to do would've been to have made the husband having an affair. And then all this empathy lies squarely with the person who's going through the illness. And that did occur to me at one point as an option. But, but I, but I, I, I think it was so much more challenging and complex and I, I hope, um, dramatically, uh, kind of challenging and satisfying that did that. It was that it was a character who was, who was sick because, and also the character that Tyson Ritter plays as well. That how he handled that because of it, that's going to be a challenging role. Somebody to be able to pull that off really. And do you guys like Tyson, you know him from all American rejects is pretty good.

Speaker 4:          30:02          Cool. Right? Yeah. And how many women wouldn't have enough here or would have to have a guy that could kind of pull that off?

Speaker 2:          30:09          Oh, he's so deeply likable. So I, I, you know, I think it was, yeah, the, I was, I was glad that it turned out that way, but it wasn't a, it was an easy choice to make thinking we're going to go with this one. What did you guys do with him? You mean? No, no. The, the, the, the, the fact that, that, that the cat, that Tony's character was the, the, the, you know, in technical terms of sort of the transgressor narratively, and it wasn't the guy that would afraid that would have placed the sympathy. There have been a different movie. Yup.

Speaker 7:          30:38          Can you comment on, um, what your thoughts were in trying to contrast both the relationship with those two with, with, with uh, Toni and kit and Tony and ace in the,

Speaker 2:          30:50          what do you think it's, I mean, I mean, these character

Speaker 4:          30:53          chameleon obviously they had, they had to represent

Speaker 2:          30:59          something different. Um, and again, I didn't want, actually there's a line that a pretty constant says, yeah, don't make a, you know, the, the Jayco character when he just wants to have a baby. And it just didn't make me the bastard for wanting to have a baby. And I sort of felt like quite a lot of the time that could have come out of anywhere. Don't make me, don't make it, don't turn me into an evil person for doing this. Yes. So, you know, twice wasn't an evil person, you know, the husband wasn't an evil person because he couldn't love her the way she needed. They have a floored it and everybody's, everybody's got good and bad and they will just trying to get it right and getting it very wrong along the way. It's all winter. And I both thought of Friends of ours that are very, like, what would Tyson's character be like? People that are really open minded and you know, like really kind of fun. They love every wind people that just kind of, they love everybody, you know?

Speaker 4:          31:50          Yeah. Embrace.

Speaker 7:          31:54          Yeah. There was a one scene I found in particular that was quite strong. It's when Millie opened up to her scars to Jess and they kind of, it kind of slowed down the entire movie kind of slowed down for you to absorb what was going on. And there was also in that moment with, with Ken as well, you know, when, when that was first revealed, um, how first, how did it kind of start out? Like, um, how much makeup did you have to go on or how did, uh, how did you want it

Speaker 4:          32:23          physically? How did we achieve that, do you mean? Yeah. Uh, I don't have very much here. So it was very easy to strap down

Speaker 2:          32:32          and B flat and, and then this, we used to CGI and post to make it look. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          32:40          Got It was right. So we, you know, the company in London would send me photographs to make sure that it, cause most CGI companies, they don't do that kind of work so much. They do more, you know, something growing things up and stuff. So this was just very subtle to look really natural. And the first time, uh, the first image that came back, well took a few rounds to get it right. Let's just put it down. But I think it in the end came out as a very sensitive and you know, beautiful scene, which I love that scene I do to your face.

Speaker 3:          33:14          That scene when you look up, it's just kills when, well, what kills me is the way he looks at me. Do you has this thing? Um, she's such a nice person. I, and I watched, I watched her in this movie and when she's feeling the most pain, she smiles and the way she looks at, this is what I think the crux of the film is between these two women, the way she looks at Millie and she smiled at her and accept her when Millie feels at her lowest kills me every time. So beautiful.

Speaker 4:          33:46          When she did that smile when we were on the set, you know, I just kind of, almost gas because I felt like a laser beam of love came and I could see it on the set and on the Monitor I was like, wow. It was powerful. You see it in the film. It's amazing. Yeah, she's a good, she's a good one.

Speaker 7:          34:08          Strong. Um, another theme that was also played through was the juxtaposition of life and death. I was totally expecting for some reason when Jess was trying to give birth, that, you know, a million would kind of die in there and it'd be, it would just be guessing. It'd be a bit too much. Just see both that life and death kind of go through all at the same time. But I really appreciated the fact that, you know, there was the portion of the scene where she finally gave birth. We focused on celebration of life. We focus on that sort of effort with everyone in the room and sharing that and then, you know, did another dedicated scene where we flashed through uh, Millie's life and then she kind of slowly, slowly parts away. Um,

Speaker 4:          34:53          okay.

Speaker 3:          34:55          Yeah, I think it's, you know, the story's really special. It's birth death and everything, you know, birth, death, life, everything in between. And it's an incredible that you changed it, they said to less than two hours and managed to kind of really reflect something very, very real and very human. It amazes me. Bless you. Well, you know, maybe with me basically from the end to know how many, but yeah, it was, it was very gratifying to see that, that, that that's, that sort of working, you know, for that has, it has an impact.

Speaker 7:          35:28          We got another audience question. Yep.

Speaker 3:          35:29          Hi. Thank you all for the movie. It was beautiful. I was here in tears. Um, my question I guess is mostly for Tony, um, on this

Speaker 6:          35:38          film and or maybe other films, you know, I'm watching you for two hours and falling apart. Um, what is it like for your family and friends to see you in a movie like this or I'm sure other films to um, to, to watch her, they used to it or, um, is that something, is it hard for them to see you fall apart on screen even though you might be right now?

Speaker 4:          35:56          You know, one of my best friends, I've known him since I was 13, he said, oh, it was really, really hard watching your diet, but it was a much harder watching you have sex.

Speaker 8:          36:10          I think my parents felt the same way.

Speaker 4:          36:19          I mean, yeah, it's, I mean, I found it weird playing someone who died. I got to of, I mean, I can't imagine how it is for people who really know me and love me to watch that because it's quite realistic. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          36:37          Um, so how was, uh, how was it working with the kids? Not much has been said about that.

Speaker 8:          36:43          It's like

Speaker 7:          36:44          all the, all the, all this serious talk about like life and death and it's like, yeah, there are also children here. How was, how was it working with them so much? It's

Speaker 4:          36:51          fine. I mean they're just so free and honest and present. That's what you want from any actor that you're working in. Um, but we, the house that we lived in, we spent how much time in rehearsal with them to do that. No week anything. We basically lived there. We didn't sleep there, but we spent all day. Then the meals and yeah, we had lots of activities and hung out and we went through scenes. But it was just, I think more than anything, just getting to that comfort level so that people feel natural and comfortable and at ease with what they're doing. I know I'm one of the first days I had a plan that we would rehearse during lunch and then I would have you and Dominic make the lunch for the kids. I think you guys were a little bit shocked. Like the cater isn't bringing lunch in and I know you're the parents, you got to make the lunch and the kids would come up and they didn't like the food and I'd say go ask your mom, go ask your dad.

Speaker 4:          37:42          So I was trying to like have little arrangements where they had to become the mom and dad, but you know, honor is the girl is very professional. And then our little friend, the boy is like a wild maniac Ryan. And for example, member when he puts the honey and the sister will let discussing that was his favorite. He could not wait until we did that and he every minute do I get to put more honey on? And then he was just so excited about that. And then the worst thing was I didn't realize he was drinking the honey. And so by the time she was so hyped up that he was just bouncing around like what? Like running around up and down the stairs. He had to monitor the amount of sweets he got to eat. After that I was just like, if I saw his dad or anybody walking with a cookie torn when I'm like, no, take it away.

Speaker 4:          38:36          No more sugar. Cause the guy was, he was a maniac. He never acted how he, I don't think he had done like one commercial saying, you know, eating probably some honey some days I saw he was testing your patients. Tony, I saw him testing yours. Oh, he'll never, he'll never watch this. He'll never hear this. And I really love, I love him. I think he did a great job. That's beautiful to work with. It's very hard am I think it traditionally that, that probably feel quite bad saying this, but the British, um, Gerald actors and not as naturalistic sometimes as, as, as American job actors and I don't know why that he got some bad ones in America today. It goes from having these two really. What, and you know, you, you, you saw a lot of people for it and, and, and, and, you know, even though you knew that, that, that, that was going to be challenging. It was, well, I was trying to find the kid that had, you know, a lot of life and energy and you know, rambunctious. That wasn't like a stage train kit. So the person we almost hired was so energetic that he tackled me to the [inaudible] ground. I was on the ground. I was like, whoa. So this one was like, that was like def con five and I got a def con four one is who we ended up with Ryan.

Speaker 4:          40:08          But he's so natural to what she captured them just in their own world and it's perfect. And she's very emotionally intelligent as well. She was, she was from another planet. She is,

Speaker 9:          40:22          oh, we do have another one. Yes. Um, I really loved the movie. Thank you very much for coming. Um, one thing I wanted to ask is, um, so it's a very recent trend that we see, uh, women in their forties or late thirties as main characters are films. We're used to seeing them only very young, as romantic potential romantic partners of main male characters. And then you don't see that actor for a few years and then they suddenly are the mother. So, um, what a wonderful trajectory. So, so yeah, so this is, I mean I was very happy to see this as one of the very few movies around as you know, having women in that. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          41:03          So how do you wish it was a trend? Yeah, that's what I wanted to be a trend

Speaker 9:          41:09          I think. Is it that trend? What role do you think this film plays in that hopefully a trip.

Speaker 4:          41:14          There is a big conversation going on, you guys, I'm sure aware of it that everybody's talking about. Why aren't there more? Why are there equal pay for, you know, male and female actors? Why aren't there more wonderful parts for women? Why aren't there more female directors? Why aren't there more female writers? And this is like, uh, you know, great thing about gender unconscious gender bias. I actually understand that you guys have had training here at Google to really change that proportion, that balance and your group is really an inspiration to us all. We've been talking about you guys a lot that we had some people come and gave us a training workshop that worked with Google and told us how the culture really changed here and got more productive and kind of more awesome. So we hope that the rest of our industry, we hope that the film industry learns a lesson from you guys to have a better gender balance, you know, but it's not happening yet. As we know, the statistics are pretty sad. It's, we're actually have the worst report card of any industry almost, right? Yeah. The film industry, you would think we would be more creative and more forward thinking. But we love that you guys are like leading the future, you know, leading the pathway, you know, and you're, you're on the right side of history and you're ahead of the game. So we want the film industry to be the same way too. We want to change this.

Speaker 10:         42:34          Okay.

Speaker 4:          42:35          Not just the film industry, the world, but we only care about the film. Okay. Well, but if we can tell stories that encourage, you know, people of diverse, diverse voices, every kind of person, you know, women and men, every, every nationality, every buddy, we want that kind of, those voices out there, you know, I mean, you, we love orange is the new black where everybody looks different. Nobody looks perfect and it's beautiful and people like it. So it works when you do it, you know, people respond. But how do we get these slow moving dinosaur, you know, film studios to change and catch up with 2015 catch up with Google.

Speaker 7:          43:21          Do you have any, uh, major takeaways after working on this movie? Like, did you learn anything from playing your character is working with other, uh, other characters and the other actors

Speaker 4:          43:35          she taught us, we learned from these. He is to, you always learn something.

Speaker 10:         43:41          Hmm.

Speaker 4:          43:43          But I think some of the things that we all talked about and our friend over here mentioned, you know, it's like cherishing those moments in life, you know? And, and it does make you think when you meet with a lot of people that are caretakers and, and people that are, uh, that are survivors that you do want to value every moment and make your life count and make what you do something that you're proud of and excited about and you know, so yeah, I think it makes us all like empowers us all to try to do cool shit.

Speaker 7:          44:13          There was that I'm seeing right at the end where he saw it red on the wall before I die and then there's a blank. Um, yeah. Was, that was an actual thing. I've never been to London before, but

Speaker 4:          44:25          around the world and like 80 countries around the world, Candy Chang, actually she lives in New Orleans. She's a city planner. Have you guys heard of this before? She started this idea and talks about her idea for creating this. She's amazing in the, and people can put them up like you guys could call her up, she'll send you the kit, you can put it up on the wall and everybody can write stuff. And it happens, happens spontaneously all around the world. One day we were driving to the set and I just saw it out of the corner of my eye. There was one up there. I'm like, Hey Tony, do you want to skip lunch today? And we're going to take the five d camera over and just film a little scene. And Tony said, yes. And then Dominic said, where are you guys going? I want to go, you know, cause I thought I'll just have Tony. So we went over there, we didn't have the DP, none of the crew, and we just filled that little cool scene. That was the one.

Speaker 3:          45:13          It's one of the most, well that's an example of one of the most exciting things about working on this movie. Catherine is very open and very free. And the amount of times I would turn up to work with an idea of what was gonna happen and that would happen, but then it would move completely off. It was so exciting. It was so exciting to be like, don't you want to be surprised in life? You know? And the film was very, um, passionate and uh, and I loved it, but that was just one, one thing that just, I didn't know that was going to happen. You know, it was really great.

Speaker 4:          45:48          And even like, oh, for example, in that same taxi scene after them, the cup incidents, okay, then we're driving along in the taxi and suddenly I'm like, okay, we're going to do this closeup on drew and the camera person whispers in my ear, we don't have any more cards for the camera. I'm like, aren't we like on a major motion picture? Well, indeed picture. How could we run out of card to the camera? And so I didn't really want you guys to know that we were like amateur hour. So I'm like, hey, why don't we do this park like selfies on the iPhone? So I pulled out my iPhone, let's do this scene like that. And then of course through, and Tony did that awesome scene that you see in the movie that's filmed on the iPhone five and recorded on the iPhone vibe we're getting out of London.

Speaker 8:          46:41          Uh, so that was one of those,

Speaker 4:          46:45          yeah. I was like, Ooh, Shit. What Cameron? All I've got left is the iPhone, but it's a very cool scene. Right? Because it feels real and it was and yes. So we try and there's another scene filmed on the iPhone pipe. Did anybody figure out what it was? Come on you guys. Are there any technical, geeky cause warts at there? Um, it was it the birth scene. I know there was that there's the face time interaction or not winning. Oh yeah. Good. But that wasn't it.

Speaker 8:          47:20          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          47:23          I'm not going to tell we're going to give a prize. If anybody figures it out, you're going to get something special in the mail. It might be a cup. Oh, this is what we worked for. You.

Speaker 8:          47:38          Okay.

Speaker 7:          47:40          I bet you didn't put anything on, on the wall on filling in the blanks.

Speaker 4:          47:45          Oh yeah. Tony and Dominic both rode on the wall. What did you put a, well, it says before I die. Dot Dot. Dot. Before I die. I want it to, and I wrote fear nothing. And that's what you see her writing in the movie.

Speaker 7:          47:59          That's amazing. Um, did you guys want to put anything, uh, when, uh, when you saw that or would you of wanting to put something up?

Speaker 4:          48:07          Well then it became a whole exercise at the end. Credits is the entire wall. So they spent months creating things that they would want to tell.
