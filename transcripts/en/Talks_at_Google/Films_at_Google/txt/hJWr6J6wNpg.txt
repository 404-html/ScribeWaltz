Speaker 1:          00:05          Please help me welcome to the stage. John [inaudible]. Nitsky Haylie Meyer Shire and released.

Speaker 2:          00:09          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:17          Have a seat. Any seat? You black. Welcome. Any seat except for mine. Okay. So, uh, reviews came out right

Speaker 3:          00:25          this morning. I, I don't know if you've read them or if you guys, uh, don't read them.

Speaker 1:          00:30          No, no. What is that noise making device? And I mean through reviews were great.

Speaker 3:          00:40          Read one, which was, which I guess we'll lead into the whole talking about the story here, the unquestionable feelgood movie of 2017. Have you heard that Pete Hammond deadline Hollywood? Uh, congratulations on writing an incredible story. Thank you. This is Holly. This is your, your writing debut? Yes. Directing debut and film debut in general.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Yeah. Yeah, that's my debut. So where, where did

Speaker 3:          01:08          the, uh, I guess, where did the idea come from? Where did this originate?

Speaker 4:          01:12          Um, you know, I came from a bunch of different places. I had had the character of Alice in my head for a long time of this woman who had sort of made a lot of decisions early in life and then started, started questioning them. And that kind of post-separation post-divorce time in a woman's life. And, um, I had a friend who had three guys move into her family's house growing up and I just thought that was such an interesting idea and a great setting for a comedy. So I sort of put this character in that sin, in that scenario. And you know, all came from there.

Speaker 3:          01:41          Huh. Okay. So was there the, in real life, was there the sexual tension that,

Speaker 4:          01:47          no, I actually don't, I don't know anything about the, what actually happened. I, it is a fictional film.

Speaker 1:          01:53          Sure it is. Yeah. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:55          And recent. John, how did the two of you get on board the film yourselves?

Speaker 4:          01:59          I read the script, um, and I just loved it. I thought it was such an original idea and um, the idea that, you know, a decision you make a 25 isn't necessarily the right decision for the rest of your life. And I think a lot of people are crossroads at certain times and trying to figure out chapter two of their life. Um, and so I met with Holly and she was wildly impressive and had a great vision for it. And we went ahead.

Speaker 3:          02:24          John, what about you? I mean, Sam, I read the script and was blown away and you know, it's about also about three young filmmakers who uh, move out to la hoping to make it and may nat and Pico can all relate obviously to that. Um, so, you know, I was honored to be a part of it.

Speaker 4:          02:44          John John came in on my first day of casting. Yeah, just very special. Really. Yeah. And so none of you knew each other beforehand? No, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          02:55          I heard.

Speaker 3:          03:08          Yeah. Right. So I guess we Reese you've been acting since you were 14, 15, 14 and uh, so with hits gushy, Pleasantville still one of my all time favorites from when I was younger. Cruel intentions, American psycho, uh, legally blonde, sweet home. Hello.

Speaker 1:          03:26          This is the legally blonde hair.

Speaker 3:          03:29          Sweet. So Alabama walk the line with what she won the academy award again. Congratulations.

Speaker 1:          03:35          So

Speaker 3:          03:37          I guess you've been putting out a movie a year since you were a teenager.

Speaker 1:          03:42          I guess so.

Speaker 3:          03:44          And so you went, you were a child star and then went to be an adult star. How did you navigate that complexity without sort of going a little bit typically child star? Crazy.

Speaker 4:          03:55          I mean, I don't know. I wasn't aware that I, I wasn't really like a big child starting. I worked in movies in, my parents were very adamant that I stay in high school and then I went to college so I didn't really start working with any kind of regularity until I was about 19 I got a big audition when I was at Stanford and then I had to drop out to do the movie and then I got another movie and I've got another maybe instead it just started working on, but I thought it was going to be a doctor. I really, I'm not the kind of person who would move to la and live in a car because I can't, my parents are about doctor. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          04:29          So they did. They want you to be doctors because my parents were always like, you can act with computer science degree. You can't do computer science with an acting degree, which is the only advice I really ever listened to, which landed me here.

Speaker 1:          04:39          So thank you mom. Thank you mom and dad. Um,

Speaker 4:          04:43          um, yeah, they wanted me to be a doctor.

Speaker 1:          04:47          Yeah, I'm pretty sure they still want me to be a that.

Speaker 3:          04:52          Did they call you up after they seem so your movies and like Reese, we really wish that you had, you know, become a brain surgeon.

Speaker 4:          04:58          Well I think in the movie is more like after I do a talk show and I talk about them a lot, they're like, oh, we wish she wouldn't talk about us. They're in, they're against sports.

Speaker 3:          05:07          And there you grew up in the south, right?

Speaker 4:          05:09          I grew up in Nashville, Tennessee. My Dad was in the military, so we were all over the place. How did you kick the southern accent? Oh, um, well I got advice when I was about 18. I went into a casting office and they said, you're never going to get work with that terrible accent. So I, I watched a lot of TV shows, like 900 to 100 and I watched the way that they would articulate and I would copy them.

Speaker 1:          05:38          Oh Wow. I'm not gonna, I'm just gonna leave it there. That's crazy. So your parents burying a man out of London. What's that? We're just going through that and John. Okay. So dude, SNL. Yeah. People, people dream about being on

Speaker 3:          05:58          that show. How did you make the crossover from, from I guess let's sketch comedy TV over into this movie business?

Speaker 5:          06:05          Well, um, I wouldn't have gotten the opportunity to even audition for this, had it not been for SNL, that kind of helped, you know, put me in a room with Halley and Nancy to begin with, which was pretty crazy to even have an opportunity to, to be considered for this movie. Um, but, uh, my background is an acting. I, I, um, I've been doing theater my whole life and I studied theater at USC, so I really have always wanted to, to act, you know, just, I just happened to do comedy. In addition to that, you know, happen to do comedy.

Speaker 1:          06:39          You can, but he's not from the Midwest, so we're not sure where that, this looks weird. Michael Keaton x isn't cam and he and I know where it's coming from. I Dunno. I Dunno. Do I do it all the time or is it just sometimes, no, he does lots of different voices. Yeah. I can't quite tell. Yeah. Yeah, there's just certain

Speaker 5:          07:02          words that I just like, like I, I'd like to say about, even though

Speaker 1:          07:06          that's I'm from Jersey, but like more fun to say about and I'm going to the buyer, like I'm going to the buyer. Like why wouldn't you choose to say it that way? Just take what you like from every accident, I guess. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          07:21          Good pack. The cod hovered. Yeah. Hey, go. Right. And so highly now turn 30 pre recently. Yes. I don't know how you hear. No, that's fine. I'm good with it. I bring this up because you make me feel really insignificant with my own life decisions. Being older than that. Um, and having seen now what you have accomplished? Uh, I guess it makes me feel like I've had a few wrong choices when I was 25. Um, but you started your own acting career when you were like four. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          07:50          Well, it's funny I'm being asked a lot, but I was in no way a child actor. My parents forced me to be in their films with basically, but I'm very grateful because now it's kind of like I have this personal connection and a little bit of a photo album. But no, I was just, I was always on their sets so they'd throw me in the movie, but it wasn't because I wanted to be an actor. And who are your parents? Um, Nancy Meyers, a producer of if our movie and my dad is trial Shire who was her partner for a long time. Yeah. And

Speaker 3:          08:23          for those who don't know, a, the two of them have produced many things such as the intern holiday. It's complicated. Parent trap, Baby Boom, private Benjamin, a father of the bride. And if you've heard of any of those came from this family lineage. And now apple has not fallen far from the tree. This movie is absolutely incredible and you're standing on your own. So thank you for continuing this. Um, and it is such a fun movie. Was it as fun to write as I guess? I guess the question is, was it as fun too, right as it was for us to watch? Oh boy,

Speaker 4:          08:56          you got a little over excited Mike Dry and make the movie writing is, um, I love writing. That's, yeah,

Speaker 6:          09:07          it's where I identify most in the filmmaking processes with writing your, um, I mean, in my case, I don't have a writing partner, so you're completely alone with these characters and there's so much fun to be had there, but it's, it's it really challenging writing a movie and layering your character's and uh, you know, I, I think I did probably upwards of 30 drafts of this script also. Um, well, I, you know, I did 15 on my own, then I gave it to my mom,

Speaker 4:          09:36          another field out of that. So, um, is that scary and giving it to your mom? Like his hands it back with a big no because she's the only person I give it to. So it's not like I'm getting a, I just, you know, I gave it to her and she has such thoughtful, good notes and just, um, I think good notes are just raising the right questions. She never said you should do this, you should do that. It would just say, you know, why did they break up? Why did they just raising those questions that make you go home and think for so long. Like, Oh my God, why? I don't know and I don't figure this out. Um, so I don't even remember the question. But yeah, writing is a lot of work and super rewarding. It was fun. I love, I love to write. I sort of, there's this great Joan

Speaker 6:          10:15          Didion quote, like, I don't know what I'm thinking until I write it down and I really identify with that. You know, sometimes you just don't know how you feel about something until you just write it down. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          10:24          that's interesting. Uh, yeah. As someone who writes, because I have to answer emails. I appreciate someone who

Speaker 4:          10:30          does it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          10:34          All right. I guess where you grew up in the industry, you grew up around very successful parents and, and, and being on sets all the time. Obviously you have written the maturity into this film that I wouldn't have expected from someone, I guess as young as you are, um, from, from a certain perspective. So, yeah. Where did that maturity come from? Where did your larger view on like, relationships in life happen?

Speaker 6:          10:58          Um, you know, I think for me, I was, I was trying a little bit to honor the medium of film, which I respect so much and I wanted to, I, you know, film is forever and I didn't want to write about trivial issues. So for me, the themes of family and divorce and starting over are important. So that's kind of why I, you know, I think Allison's story and crossroads is, um, a little bit weightier and real, or then the issues of sort of, you know, you know which guy and you know, the kind of like 20 something story,

Speaker 3:          11:31          right? Yeah. And that I enjoy in this, that did, it doesn't take the normal like slap stick kind of silly turns that that Rom coms, romantic comedies do in most cases. So it was, it was a pleasant surprise and I think that's why of course today the reviews are coming out and they're all very positive. So, uh, you've done a good job there. Um, regarding the characters, I guess. So we saw in the preview, there's lots of other people in it. Obviously it's not just the three of these people. Here are the two of them, then a director. Um, Michael Sheen is the, is is a house as husband Candice Bergen is Alice's mom. Uh, we've got lake bell's a wonderful addition. How did all of these wonderful people come give you get attached to this first time directors film?

Speaker 6:          12:14          Um, well, you know, the casting is such an important part of the process because you're, you're sort of handing your character off to somebody and letting them make it their own. So it's, it's um, it's such an important thing and we, we thought really deeply about this and um, it was a really nice mix I think of newcomers and seasoned actors and I think that mix added something fresh to the equation. It really felt like there was different generations in this movie. And um, I have to say, you know, we, we sent it to these people and sometimes you think you'll never hear back or what. And the, a lot of them responded and my mom had worked with like bell before, so we knew her, but the rest of the actors in this movie or just good old fashioned sending them the screen

Speaker 4:          12:53          then hoping they'll say, yes. You have to realize as an actor you don't get a lot of scripts where you get to play a character anymore. Like it is. Yeah, it's pretty rare. And, and to have a fully fleshed out character with a beginning and a middle and an end or a real journey or real lines to say or humor is really an anomaly these days. I mean you're honestly just reacting to a green screen and, okay.

Speaker 1:          13:14          Ah,

Speaker 4:          13:17          does it hurt here? Like what am I on? Said I'm not sure we're going to put it in language. Just give me like six different reaction.

Speaker 1:          13:22          Do it

Speaker 4:          13:26          hers are starving and do something really meaningful and deep.

Speaker 3:          13:29          Hmm. I, I guess I didn't realize that the bad guy with the green screen was never preconceived beforehand.

Speaker 4:          13:37          Sometimes they just, they have no idea what's coming next.

Speaker 3:          13:43          It's a working, working with the w, the three stooges. Um, was there any parallel there by the way? No. No. Why three guys? I'm sidetracking here. Why three guys? Why not one? Why not two?

Speaker 6:          13:55          Uh, I think good things come in threes. It just was always going to be a trio for me. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          14:01          Fair. Okay. So back to my original thought. It was always three. So this is a little bit of a spoiler. Um, some of you have seen the movie, we screened it here last night. Uh, so at the end I was actually, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the end of the story, Alice doesn't choose any of the men, um, which is, which is cool.

Speaker 1:          14:18          Great. They just das imagine that, don't need a man to be happy.

Speaker 3:          14:27          Uh, it, it's refreshing to see a romantic comedy where like the fee the female protagonist finds happiness on her own. Sure. John, I choose here.

Speaker 1:          14:36          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          14:41          I did. I did think that you were going to go for John. That was going to say that to me too. Yeah. I'm writing a sequel.

Speaker 1:          14:49          Okay.

Speaker 3:          14:50          Home again.

Speaker 1:          14:52          Okay.

Speaker 3:          14:53          Still home again. Um, yeah, I guess that's what that is one of the most powerful things about this movie that I feel every woman is portrayed as a strong woman. Even like the smaller supporting characters are, they're all, none of them are, are typically like you're frail, weak sort of women, you know, they're often portrayed. Uh, was this a conscious choice when you were writing it and I guess for you Reese, was this something you noticed in the script that attracted you to the role?

Speaker 4:          15:23          Yeah, I don't, I don't, I mean, I don't play a lot of weak.

Speaker 1:          15:27          Amen.

Speaker 6:          15:29          I don't really know any week.

Speaker 1:          15:31          Amen.

Speaker 6:          15:36          Say if you want to be a woman, you better be tough. And that's the only kind of women I know. So that's, that's, yeah. Hell he writes. Yeah, I wouldn't have, I don't know. I also don't know any Greek women who wouldn't have gotten, it wouldn't have come naturally to me to right. That she's vulnerable. [inaudible] that's for sure. And she gains strength by the end of the film and self confidence and feeling, you know, like she's going to be okay by the end. But no, I don't, I don't know. Never. I wasn't consciously thinking this is a strong woman. I just thought this is a woman. And

Speaker 3:          16:04          so you've also, yeah, I agree. Very well written. And so Erica Oldie, oldie produce this as well. So she's only just only been producing for, you know, just a few years too. She's a new producer. Um, and I was reading up on her too, and she produced this film. It's primarily made by women as well. So how did, how did you find her? How did she become attached?

Speaker 6:          16:28          Um, after I had written the script, do you know, we, uh, gave it to our agents who wanted to help us get the financing for this movie. And Erica was the right person, I think because she, her whole company is based around women's stories and I think she has a particular affiliate, like she loves these kinds of movies and um, she wanted to tell women's stories and help female directors. So it was a really nice pairing and she's a young woman herself. And, um, I was great. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          16:55          That's wonderful. And so Reese, a little side question, I guess over the last few years, um, so you'd be getting in, producing yourself and your produce big little lies, which donations for that, which is wonderful. Um, what made you want to get into producing?

Speaker 4:          17:14          Um, well, about five years ago, I read probably the worst script of her ride my entire life. And, uh, the part for a woman was just absolutely dreadful opposite of guy. And I called my agent and I said, well, let's just a piece of crap. And I don't want to do this. And she said, every actress in Hollywood wants this park. And I thought we deserved better than these parts. And so I was like, I better, I can either start complaining about it, which isn't gonna do any good or I can do something about it. So I started buying books and turning them into movies in my first two were wild and gone girl. And um, and so I just started from there and creating parts for other women as well. And that's sort of been the next chapter of my life.

Speaker 3:          17:58          So do you enjoy performing still more or are you aiming more towards the producer side?

Speaker 1:          18:04          No, I like being an actor. I really love it. It's my first love it and I get on set and I get all excited. She's so good at it, I enjoy it. But

Speaker 4:          18:12          I love pretty saying and I'm really a big reader, so I read a ton and um, and then I can just, and I kind of have an eye for what is actually going to get made. And what's cinematic because not every book is, you know, things can be beautifully written but just it's not going to happen. And, um, I think those two things together really help create a successful producing career.

Speaker 3:          18:34          You should produce a movie you star in where you play a doctor and it would satisfy everything I said. Yes. A brain surgeon. Thanks mom. Uh, going back, I guess to the casting, you have two wonderful children that you cast, Lola Flannery and Eden Grace Redfield. Yeah. Was it, is it harder to find a, to cast roles for children or to cast roles for adults and specifically for these two kids? How did you,

Speaker 6:          19:00          yeah, it's really hard to catch children because um, you know, their parents rehearse it with them. So there's, it's hard. Sometimes when I was watching the auditions it would be like they've had a very specific way of saying it in a specific rhythm and you feel like you might have to undo that a lot, but these two kids and that you could just feel that there was something supernatural, not supernatural,

Speaker 1:          19:20          but very natural about them. Um, there was sort of,

Speaker 6:          19:26          well the little one caught my eye honestly because she was racist twin and we were like, this is a little Reese. And then she happened to be, to have this fantastic comedic timing and be, you know, super unique and um, Lola, you know, I really wanted somebody in that part that could play the comedy of being anxious, but you wouldn't actually be super worried for her. You just felt like this was a stage she was going to come out of. And I think Lola has kind of an inner happiness to her that are very, she's very sweet and then the sweetness comes through and um, I think they just both were so natural, you know, they really, they didn't feel like child actory they just, you know. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          20:06          And John, I guess your character, uh, you guys, you, you and Lola have great onscreen chemistry where you liked that offset or off camera too? Yeah, we really hit it off. We were, uh, we would sing a Dell alive. We were tight. We all got along. It was really one big family, uh, almost instantaneously I would say. Cause the guys actually ended up living together

Speaker 1:          20:30          together. Yeah. You know, I didn't, when they got cast that we all live together like now was a bad idea, but it turned out all right. Turned down. I can, I can still speaking now. Wait, well yeah, a little bit more jacket and we are, we are one busy working,

Speaker 3:          20:48          uh, around the globe. Still owes you some rent. But now when we all talk we all love each other a great deal. And then, yeah, I guess you touched on family, I guess that uh, uh, the whole cast does to me seem like a family. Like we're watching this family literally and figuratively on screen. Um, when did, when was the first time that everybody sat down together that everybody met as a, was there one point when everybody got together to

Speaker 4:          21:13          can also rehearsal? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          21:15          Yeah. Everyone. Yeah, we sort of, there's a lot of intertwined relationships in this movie. So we did a lot of rehearsals, you know, with the different, um, like John and Lola and then John and Reese. And the reason that, you know, it's like everyone has a different relationship in this movie. So we, um, we all got together and talked about those different dynamics. I think that's when it first started. Jelling yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          21:35          When did you realize that you had something really special that was kind of bubbling up here?

Speaker 6:          21:41          Um, that's a good question. You know, I think there was a really great energy on the set. It didn't, it didn't feel, I felt like we were making a feel good. I thought when we were making the movie, you know, it had a nice energy and um, you know, my mom was the producer, which added another family element. It really literally was a family. Um, recess. Kids would come by and John's parents and, you know,

Speaker 1:          22:06          it was fun. Why is that?

Speaker 4:          22:10          Work on my lines.

Speaker 1:          22:14          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          22:15          The tone of the movie really match the tone on set, honestly. Yeah, I really did. Oh, that's, that's incredible. Um, I guess I would have loved a bit of fly in the room, I guess. Did you don't do a table read or anything for the movies to you?

Speaker 4:          22:27          I think for this head, you, Tamari, y'all and y'all came in and was somebody who was auditioning. Again, I read this with all my friends. No, not, I did a table reading at his house with actor friends. Yeah. That's amazing. Why didn't you invite any of us? Well, we all just debated about this word that none of us could say. And we were like, what was the word? He was like c h. A I. S. E. I was like, oh shit. And then John was like, shoes.

Speaker 1:          23:02          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          23:03          What do you call it? I shake machine. That was one of the bank to me. So every time there was in the room, they'd be like, there's the had to be it Shay's because you sleep on it that night. And that's why I said chat. So you couldn't sleep on a chair that night. So it has that is that, I know today we'd call it a self. The bad hello. So for medicine is different. I don't know. Not a shoes

Speaker 3:          23:48          or John is wrong. That's little I know about. Yeah, she's doesn't have a pullout. That's, I guess that's the difference. You're fancy. It's got the little swoopy arm thing, doesn't it? Oh yeah. Am I wrong? It can. It can have a swoopy arm. All right. Well my shit smartest minds in the world.

Speaker 1:          24:12          Okay.

Speaker 3:          24:13          And they have randomly Google it. I guess you're in trouble here though. Yeah. Nobody's banging it.

Speaker 1:          24:22          Not a single person brings it.

Speaker 3:          24:29          What? Q and a are they doing right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:33          They're not the clown from it. Yes. A balloon. A bunch of scared kids. Hi Kelly.

Speaker 3:          24:57          I'm just, I'm that no one's picturing somebody on a stage over there with a, the little face drawn on scary. Oh Gosh. Okay. So the whole, the whole movie takes place in La. Um, where did you actually film this? Was it actually in la?

Speaker 6:          25:12          Yes, it was actually in La on the west side of La.

Speaker 3:          25:14          And what, whose house was a lovely gentleman named bill. Um, it used to be Cindy Crawford's house. Yeah. It kind of has a Hollywood history for gardeners before that. Okay.

Speaker 6:          25:25          Yeah, I found the house. Um, I googled that Spanish houses on the west side of Los Angeles because I knew that's where we wanted to shoot the movie. And I found it on a real estate listing and we left a note in your mailbox.

Speaker 3:          25:39          Wow. Crazy. That stuff doesn't happen. Yeah. I mean I was watching like that. I'm very lucky. Wow. Am I mean, I guess talking back to the family lineage, like everything your parents did to had it was set in these massive just beautiful houses. Is that yeah. They got to build there. Is it really?

Speaker 6:          26:00          Yeah. Back in the heyday of the romantic comedy. Wow. And they build their set. So, um, you know, which is the nice thing about building your sets is when you write a scene and you say, you know, she enters this way and he enters this way and then you can build that and it, it tells your story through the sets. Um, but what was amazing about this house was I had storyboarded the whole movie and I was so nervous to find a location cause I, you know, you write things that he fixes this and this and they look through that window. So I was like, I'm going to have to find a house full of windows because so many, it's kind of a visual Motif and the movie is people are looking through windows and seeing things happening and then it got to this house and it was, the windows were all in the right places. I was like, this is it.

Speaker 3:          26:40          I had a guest house to and an had a guest house, which was great. That's crazy. Yeah. And so was it empty? Did you stage it or was anything like original? This guy bill, you said any bells, furniture and make it into the movie?

Speaker 6:          26:53          No. So we sold some of Jennifer Garner's curtains. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          26:59          the movie. Thanks Jen. Does she get a credit and thanks to Jennifer Gardner for providing curtain for having good days?

Speaker 3:          27:06          Yeah, I guess so. I guess, uh, what happens to the PR? The bill wasn't living there. What happens to the person when you're displacing them? For how long did it take to shoot this?

Speaker 6:          27:17          No, he didn't. He didn't live there, live there? No, he was about to renovate it and I think we got to him right before, right before. Yeah. I was very lucky that he didn't live. That's also an unusual thing. Usually you have to put that person up and when you inconvenienced them in such a way, but he didn't actually live there. I don't know. Something was right. It was some, something in the stars were aligning for their special.

Speaker 1:          27:37          Oh, super natural. This is what it was. Cause it was the kids. The kids grow pecans. Yeah. How long did it, 30 days.

Speaker 3:          27:46          I think you shut the whole thing in a month. Less than, yeah. Wow. Yeah. That's crazy. Nope.

Speaker 1:          27:53          Okay.

Speaker 2:          27:53          All right.

Speaker 1:          27:56          How do you long do you think it takes to make a movie? I don't know. Green screen. This stuff takes like eight months. Right.

Speaker 6:          28:02          Actually, when we wrapped, my mom was like, I mean I usually, this is like, I have five more months. This, you know, it was amazing that I think everybody really, a lot of movies. Yeah. 90 days. What else? 30 35 almost every movie my entire career. Wow. I, I don't have like monsters. Blasters.

Speaker 1:          28:23          Hey Leah, you could actually just shoot people writing.

Speaker 6:          28:29          Yeah. It usually takes about 30 to 40 days

Speaker 3:          28:31          and with rehearsal and everything too. Yeah. Wow. That's incredible. I didn't know know that there's some new thank you audience. If you guys have questions, there's two mics in the aisles and you can begin to line up here and ask anybody anything, whatever you would like to. Um, Oh yes. So we've got one already. All right. Hi.

Speaker 6:          28:53          Hi Guys. Thanks for coming. Um, before I ask my question, John, I actually saw your mom before standup comedy

Speaker 1:          29:02          at the comics. Wow. Okay.

Speaker 6:          29:04          Yeah, she told us a story about how she liked, messed up your camp clothes. This is crazy.

Speaker 1:          29:12          It's amazing. Do you want me to comment on that?

Speaker 3:          29:17          Yeah. My Mom, first of all, my mom is 57 and just started doing standup.

Speaker 2:          29:25          Great.

Speaker 3:          29:27          That's pretty cool. She's going to freak when she finds out that you're asking this and yeah, my mom tells a story about, uh, when I went to sleep away camp, um, my parents are divorced and my dad's very Thai Bay. My mom's a total

Speaker 5:          29:42          mess and my dad called her is like, you put John's name and all the clubs, right. It labeled his name on all the clubs. My mom was like, Oh yes, of course. Of course. And she like immediately hired somebody but the labels on. But when they were all done, it said my name on the front.

Speaker 2:          30:02          Okay.

Speaker 5:          30:03          So it's like down my zipper and I crossed my hands. Yeah. My Mom's whole joke is when I got back I was crying and I said, uh, it didn't make any friends, but everybody knew

Speaker 2:          30:14          my name.

Speaker 5:          30:18          Yeah. My question is for East

Speaker 2:          30:21          [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          30:33          That's great.

Speaker 7:          30:40          A really big reader. In fact, Pacific Standard's last movies had been like my favorite books from last five years. So it's been really exciting. Um, but my question is, so how do you know kind of, I'm a very big believer that the books are always better than the movies, but it's been really enjoyable to watch all of my favorite books in the last couple of years been these amazing movies and shows. So how do you know kind of when you're reading something that this is going to translate really well to the screen?

Speaker 4:          31:08          That's a really good question. Um, it's a little complicated I think because of knowing what people will actually buy and turn it into a movie and it's two sisters during the French Revolution. It's just not going to be a movie. It's too expensive. Um, it's too niche. So I think I try to find things that are universal, kind of relatable and um, and my main directive has just been have a woman at the center of it doing something, sort of telling another aspect of um, the female experience. So gone girl is like, I don't know what she psychotic, I don't know. But it's something that took a, an idea of the perfect girl and kind of flipped it on its head and wild. I'd love the idea of a woman versus nature cause you see men versus nature all the time. Right. And then I'd never really thought about what's the movie where women are up against the environment by themselves. Um, so it's just stuff like that. Things that feel fresh and new.

Speaker 7:          32:06          Cool. Over here. Hi. Um, so you talked about, um, the availability of roles for men and women, um, over your 20 years, uh, in the industry. How have you seen that evolve in, do you feel like we're at a point in time where there's a lot of momentum for roles for women? Or how does that work?

Speaker 4:          32:25          Yeah, I mean, I think it's a better time than ever. Um, but I have to say when I started, it was a good time for women's movies. Um, women were the stars of their own movies at the time I came up. I was, you know, I was lucky I got in a window where I made legally and sweet home Alabama. And, um, I can be the lead of a movie. I think it's harder now and particularly in movies, you don't see women being the star of movies very often. Um, I've heard people say it straight to my face. We have one movie movie that has a woman starring in it this year. We don't need another one. Um, so, but the great news is with all these streaming services and the, um, the new platforms, there's now they need content more than ever, and that creates opportunity for women of all ages, women of all color, um, people. So it's really kind of broadening the spectrum and, and creating more roles.

Speaker 8:          33:16          Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I want to thank you guys for being here. I want to hell you mentioned earlier that you felt like you were making a feel good movie and I feel like we all need that right now, so thank you. Um, and then I just wanted to say, um, I was thinking yesterday while I was watching movie, you know, you're one of my favorite actresses. What would I say if you're actually here and actually at Google, um, and I was thinking about how you've had this history of performing in election, in curl intentions, all of these women who are not too strong but sort of strong in ways that people don't want them to be or don't quite understand, and that they're successful in ways that don't fit with expectations. And I think that's sort of a really interesting message for the women in Google right now. Many of whom are enrolls that people don't expect them to be in our don't quite trust them to be successful in. And it's your particular history of performances. An interesting one right now. And I'm not shocked to see this many women here in this room and screaming for Aarp legally blonde, crazy flick, although she was left out of your recitation. Um, so just want to thank you for that. And also, Hi John.

Speaker 2:          34:36          Yeah.

Speaker 9:          34:48          Hi. Um, I feel like I have so many questions to ask race cause I feel like it would be best friends

Speaker 4:          34:52          if we ever left. Really. I think we probably would. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          34:56          But you actually said something that changed my whole life question dynamic before. Um, you said there was a script that you read that was like really crappy for the woman. Did that ever get made? Yup, sure did.

Speaker 4:          35:07          An Oscar winning actress. Really? Are you able to say I didn't do well or that dot? No, it did not terrible. Maybe, you know, I've always had a thing where, and back to your point about being a woman who does sort of unorthodox things, I turned down so many parts were like I got a lot of opportunity after legally blind to play the girlfriend and superhero movies, girlfriend, girlfriend, I, I was like, why would it be a girlfriend when I give me the lead? I would rather take less money be the lead of a movie show girl that she can be the center of her own story than be a very wealthy girlfriend and you know, cause it doesn't move the needle for me and a certain point, it's all about it. I also have a little, I had a little girl when I was 23 so it kind of shifted my perspective of like, what do I want her to see on film?

Speaker 4:          35:55          I grew up with Holly hunter and Debra winger and Diane Keaton and Meg Ryan and those were events for me when they had movies coming out on a Friday night. Like that's what I wanted to see a woman who's figuring it out. Like she doesn't know what the next step of her life is going to be and I just think that's what drives me every day. It's why I have a mission, just to create those parts for myself, for other women, for female directors to have that opportunity to tell women's perspectives. Because if we don't see women's perspectives, I mean we've, we've talked about this, women and women's films treat men differently. The men treat the women differently. That's a narrative that's important. And I would say the same thing about women of color, women of different generations, you know, all, all different perspectives need to be represented and it's just enough. I've had enough of the same people telling the same dang stories. Like if we don't, if we don't see some new perspectives, society can't change and we can't have different conversations. And that's how I feel about it.

Speaker 1:          36:52          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          37:08          hi guys, my name is Brooke Taylor, which is actually a character in legally blonde. It's made me super popular in fifth grade.

Speaker 7:          37:18          A question I got asked on my first day at Google is if I could have lunch with anyone dead or alive, who would it dead or alive? Who would it be? And I said, oh, what's that made me even more popular. So thank you. Um, thank you very much for the glamour article. I'm sure that's been circulating quite a bit. Um, you have a lot of ambitious women in the room who are strong, not because they're strong women, but because we're women and that's what women are. Can you speak a little bit to the article and just give us some advice and um, even talk about how it's been received, if you've gotten any sort of feedback.

Speaker 4:          37:46          Yeah. Well, thank you so much for saying that. I worked really hard on that. I recall I probably did 30 drafts. Um, because I do think it's really important what she say. But I, for probably like three years ago I was asked to give a speech at this glamour vet about ambition and women and why that's considered a negative trait and women, and they did this study at Columbia that identified it as a negative trait in a coworker, as a female coworker that she seen as selfish or self serving. And I thought why has that become such a negative thing? I was always ambitious. Even as a little girl, I didn't know you were supposed to hide it. Right. So there's this new Harvard study that women who are seen as ambitious hide it if they're single. And I, I really, that just drove me up a wall cause I thought I run away from anybody who doesn't like your ambition a guy or a partner because it should be encouraged. I mean, and it's not a self serving thing. It's like most women who are ambitious have a bigger goal, were community leaders where we're strong family leaders, we can change a lot and and create a lot of change, but we're stymied because of this stigma around being ambitious. I think it's why a lot of women don't run for office. As we look at women go, of course she wants to win, why shouldn't she went? She's probably going to help us,

Speaker 4:          39:04          you know? And I think we have to change it. We have started talking about it and I have had a lot of response from men at big companies who wrote me and said, I never thought about it that way. And I've heard women talked about in board rooms and stuff is boy, she's climbing and she, and he goes, I'm going to change the conversation. And I, I just, Oh yeah, they're talking, you're talking about your daughters, you're talking about your sisters. You know, we need women were 50% of the population. We're 50% of the change. Yeah. You know? Amen. Sister

Speaker 2:          39:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          39:38          my question is also for Reese, it's about big little lies. Okay. I'm actually born and raised in Monterey, California. I'm like, God, I know it's rare. And I wanted to ask you about the decision to change the setting of that book to Monterey because it feels really important to the story. So why Monterey? Um, why like that story in particular?

Speaker 4:          39:58          Oh, that's, that's a good question. And because it's set in a Sydney, Australia, the writer said it there and we decided to Americanize it, um, because I want it to be in it.

Speaker 2:          40:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          40:13          so is there sat and I do a terrible Australian accent and um, and then Monterey, because we wanted it to be in a coastal town that wasn't Los Angeles because that has its own identity. The writer was, um, David Kelly is from that area and lived in that area. And, um, the directors, Jamar Valet wanted to use water as a metaphor for the dark, mysterious unknown that lies inside of us, the secrets that lie underneath the calm. And he did, I don't know if y'all have seen it, but the last episode is you see why he's always filming the ocean. And, um, so yeah, it's a metaphor. Yeah. Cool.

Speaker 8:          40:51          Hey guys, thank you for being here. I'm Katie. So my question is a little interactive in nature. It's directed towards you, but I would love it if you could maybe use John as your student.

Speaker 2:          41:04          Yeah,

Speaker 8:          41:07          so as I'm sure you guys have heard as well as a lot of us in this room have experienced dating in New York is notoriously pretty tough. Gosh,

Speaker 2:          41:17          a girl, a girl

Speaker 8:          41:22          or a guy could use all the help that we could get. So I was wondering if you'd be able to give us all a refresher on the bend and snap.

Speaker 1:          41:37          I do the, it's Santa as you. Okay. You want me to teach? Yeah. Well first you have to know why you're doing. Sure. You're trying to get someone's attention, right? Motivation. Okay. Right. So you pretend that you dropped something on the ground and then you lean forward and then you snap. Well done. Pause. Oh my God. I follow that question.

Speaker 7:          42:19          Talked a lot about the importance of having really powerful, strong female characters are presented in the narratives we tell on screen. But there's so much work that goes in, whether that's on the part of producers or writers or a cameraman on the backside of things to make those characters appear on screen. What advice do you have for, there are lots of creatives that are at Google who outside of our nine to five are like myself, are screenwriters or work on the production side or the editing side. What advice do you have for trying to get your material in front of the right eyes in an industry where there are so many barriers to entry, especially for women,

Speaker 4:          42:55          right? Do you want to attack to take that?

Speaker 6:          42:57          Um, well, I mean, in my opinion, the best way to get your content out there as a, to have a very original voice and to not be afraid to tell your specific story because then it feels very you. Um, and I think like Reese mentioned, it's such a, it's a really good time to be a content creator, I think because there's so many platforms. Um, so, you know, I think just not being afraid to cold email people, send your material out there. I mean, I know it's idealistic, but I, I am a big believer in good material gets found and gets recognized, you know, and, and like Reese mentioned, there's not a lot of strong roles for women. And so if you are, I hope writing those kinds of characters, I think it will be recognized and you know, from youtube to Amazon to Netflix, I think, you know, all of these places have their own content now and will not, I don't know if we're at wa or Google, you know,

Speaker 1:          43:49          wherever you want it to send your material too.

Speaker 6:          43:52          Yeah. Youtube. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so I mean that's, that would be my advice.

Speaker 4:          43:57          And just start making stuff. Don't, don't get stuck cane out. Even if you make a short with your friends or you get everybody together on a weekend and make a short film a year, you're getting stat, actual film and experience under your belt. And, um, there's so many places, like New York Film Festival has a new program for female directors. Warner Brothers is doing a pilot program for female screenwriters that want to be directors that you read a 10 minute short and submit it. Um, there's a lot of those kinds of things and um, yeah, you just start making but don't get stuck or over. Um,

Speaker 6:          44:32          I don't know. I just see a lot of creative people get stuck and it's good sometimes to work in a group too because it pushes you out the door and you have a partner.

Speaker 5:          44:39          Yeah. Yeah. And um, when I was first starting out, youtube was how I, that's how I got my agent was from making sketches with buddies, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          44:49          That's great. Yeah. Let me think. It is, I mean, even though the statistics are terrible about being a female director, um, I do think because of people like Lena Dunham, people think that young women might be great at what they do. And I think she's paved the way for a lot of young women too, for people to recognize. I do think it is in some ways a good time to be, you know, a female content creator. Great. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          45:17          Cool. I look down and look up and there's 5 million people asking questions again. Uh, yeah. Molly. Hey. Hi.

Speaker 10:         45:22          Um, hi. I'm Molly. I'm super excited that you're here. All of you. Thank you. Um, so my question is for Reese, but I think you can, Haley, I'm Don. You can both answer it. Rick, you've done so many different movies, different genres, production company, draper, James. Um, what's next? What is one thing you'd love to do? And John and Hailey, what's next for you? What's your next big projects? I'm thinking we would like to do outside the box.

Speaker 6:          45:47          Um, well I just extended my production coming in to digital and mobile programming, so I'm going to be capable of making more short form content because I do think that's the first step to finding new female voices. That's great. Yeah. I mean, I'm going to, I don't know if I'm doing anything outside the box. I'm definitely going to keep trying to do what I did here and make you know, comedies. Um, which seem to be fewer and further between now and put women at the forefront of them. So yeah, more of the same.

Speaker 5:          46:16          Um, I'm working on a show with my writing partner with, for comedy central at the moment. And then I'd like to, you know, like to do more good movies, man. Keep working. I'll be nice. And this is my first really. So our first. Yup. Yup. Thank you. Yeah. Cool. All and we have time for a few more questions.

Speaker 8:          46:34          Hi. Thank you all for being here. Um, so today there was an article in the New York Times about rotten tomatoes. Um, basically there's a bunch of people in Hollywood who are planning like putting blame on rotten tomatoes for movies, not doing well. Um, basically saying when these reviews come out and they get like an aggregated score that kind of like predicts movies not doing well at the box office. If, you know, the critics are saying it's bad and it's surfaced on different sites like Fandango or even when you search iMovie on Google, which is relevant to all of us here. So I'm curious what you think about that. If that really is something that's relevant, if that's something we can lay blame for.

Speaker 6:          47:14          I know about blame. I mean I think rotten tomatoes is owned by Fandango, I think. Yeah. So you know, it's one in the same. Um, I, you know, for me, I think it's a part of the equation, but I don't think the actual audience, um, cares that much about it. And I think rotten tomatoes is largely men. So we made a movie about a woman and uh, so I don't know that they're necessarily, I don't know. For me, I wouldn't look at it. I, but I wouldn't judge a film by it, but I, I'm am aware that, you know, it is a big part of things. I think, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think more men look at the scores too. Like my boyfriend would say, well, that huddle and I'd be like,

Speaker 4:          47:54          care if game of fine art. Yeah. I think it does have an effect in certain capacities. If there's something people really want to say, they're going to see it, but I think it can drive a movie that might be on a bubble for two people waiting to later. And you know, certain movies like this, like we are, we're coming on the box office. We need people to show up and see the movie. And if you want more movies with women at the center, you have to shop and buy the tickets. Or it's just, it's hard. It's, you know, it's data that the studios look at and they think, oh, well that one didn't do good in this wind in it. So they don't make more of them. Um, it's just a numbers game. But I will say we need, Ann Patchett wrote this amazing essay about like, don't let other people make your judgments for you.

Speaker 4:          48:38          You know, don't, don't you have your own opinions about art and books and music. I hate, oh, I might, I'm fortunate on son. He'll be like, well, I heard it's not good. And I'm like, yeah, but who did you hear it from? And maybe you guys don't have the same taste and maybe you're not interested in the same thing. So I really encourage people out there form your own opinions, have something to talk about, you know, see movies. I loved seeing movies and having a different opinion than other people because that's what makes you you. Um, and we've taken that out a little bit by reading too many reviews or listening to too many people's opinions on Twitter and stuff. I think makes probably two more questions. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          49:18          Hi, I'm Chloe. Um, so we'll just talk about like this quote unquote strong female character. It got me thinking. Um, this is a question mostly for Reese, but I would love to hear how these thoughts too, if you have any. Um, obviously I love legally blonde, but one of my favorite movies of yours actually is freeway. Um, and it got to be, you know, I was thinking about the, how a lot of people, um, see women in action movies and how just a woman like punching someone or shooting someone can be like just enough for people to give them the strong female character label. But, um, obviously there's like, you've been doing so many romcoms and comedies and like big little lies. And I was wondering what you think of the difference in value of a strong woman in a comedy versus like a family drama versus an action movie like freeway or like some more recent ones like Mad Max and atomic blonde.

Speaker 4:          50:11          Yeah, I mean all of those genres are great and I think more than like looking for strong or weak. And look, I answered that question because I think of myself as a strong person, but like I'm just looking for complexity because women just aren't good bad. There's this whole rainbow of other things in between, you know, they're complex and confused and I'm contemplating things and some of them are just plain strange, all know, like I want to see every color of the rainbow. I don't want to just see like, I dunno. Sometimes I think you just get watered down and it gets watered down because they don't understand the complexity of the female brain because you're not a woman writing it. So, um, yeah. What do you think? I don't know. I mean, I don't see a ton of action movies. It just not, you know, as an audience member, my favorite John Rhe um, but I do think sometimes the women in those movies are considered strong because they're acting like men.

Speaker 4:          51:08          Um, and you know, for me, the characters that have meant most to me, the ones that resist portrayed are strong because they're complex and they're real, you know, there's something real about them. I don't, I don't think you see a woman in an action movie and think that's me. Yeah. Just like her and atomic blonde. Um, even though it can be super entertaining and great to watch, you know, for me it's the relatability of a character that is that, you know, if you see Reese on screen being strong and she's going through separation, that might give you, you know, if I can do it too, you know, and I think that's for me where the strength comes from onscreen.

Speaker 5:          51:42          Thanks John. You have a favorite genre, favorite genre, genre, you know, the right answer really. I, I'm not really into, uh, like superhero action movies. I do like smaller stories typically. Yeah. Interesting. But it drama or comedy and done. I just finished Ozark. I thought that was real good. Really good. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like, that's cool. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. So we have time for one more question here.

Speaker 6:          52:11          All right. So first of all, thank you. Cruel intentions, favorite movie of all time. Um, so the best part of working at Google is our colleagues are incredible. And half of my meetings I'm like just in awe at how talented the people are in the room. So I was curious about who you guys have worked with, where you've had that moment of like, oh my God, this person is so impressive. Like who's the most impressive actor, uh, that you've worked with outside of John, obviously?

Speaker 4:          52:42          Well, Gosh, I've worked with some really amazing talented people, but the, yeah, isn't it great that you can be around people and you're like, wow. And the great thing about movies is it's a collaborative experience. So every movie, this movie has amazing, we had so much fun and I loved working on these people. I'm trying to think of like one person. I was like, oh my God, this person is so incredible.

Speaker 6:          53:08          Maybe like super intimidated when you found out they were,

Speaker 4:          53:13          oh, I ain't got to work with Jack Nicholson once and I was pretty tight. I can barely speak. I mean, it got to his clothes off and he was standing there and I just kept inching and just like, he goes, hey kid, get out of my closeup

Speaker 1:          53:27          because I'm a leaner. I tie. I tended to lean on people. I like get away. Um, but I was struck about that. That was pretty cool. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          53:39          that's, that's flooding John, to have you, I guess on Snl till you've had a lot of people come through it. Like, have you experienced anything similar? Um, well, I mean, obviously this movie, getting to work with these lanes and Nancy, um, at SNL,

Speaker 1:          53:54          right.

Speaker 5:          53:55          Specifically at Larry David is my comedy hero. So, uh, getting to work with him, it was pretty awesome. I see the movie, it comes out in theaters tomorrow, September 8th.

Speaker 2:          54:11          Excellent question. Yes,

Speaker 1:          54:12          Haley. Thank you guys. Wonderful.

Speaker 2:          54:16          God help you.
