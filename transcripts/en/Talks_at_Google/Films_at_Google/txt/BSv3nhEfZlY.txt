Speaker 1:          00:03          Welcome to top that Google today. It's my pleasure to welcome Millennia Abramson for room.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11          Thanks for joining us today. Pleasure. Uh, so do you mind telling us about the film? Well, um, so it's a film based on a novel, the same name by this, uh, Irish Canadian writer called Emma Donahue. And I like to start with, I don't, I tend to start with a little bit about it's more fundamental thematic shape then it's then where it takes place because otherwise you, everybody goes, oh no. Um, so for me it's a film about parenting and it's a feeling bad being a child about growing up. Um, but it takes place in a very unusual context, which I think focuses those questions in a very particular way. So it takes place in a locked room for at least half of the film where, um, we have a mother and child and mother was kidnapped maybe seven years before the film starts and had a child in that situation, which is the one positive thing that's come out of it.

Speaker 1:          01:02          And it's about her relationship with that child and how she protects them from the kind of darker aspects of, of their, of their world. And it's, it's a story that's told from the point of view of the child for whom this is a normal place or the location of his childhood. And then it tracks these people, these two people as they get out of the situation and as they tried to integrate themselves back into the world. So how did you get involved in the project? I read the novel and she dies and then already 2011 and I have a, um, I had, my little boy at that point was for nearly four. And so it just, it sort of slayed me. The book. I mean, it's very beautiful. It's very moving and it's very sensitive. Um, and I think something of my own feelings from my kid where, you know, overflowed onto the character in the novel.

Speaker 1:          01:54          And I was just fascinated by what Emma had done and how she was talking about these really universal things in a situation which would normally just be a bleak, true crime kind of story or at worst it could be a pretty exploitative sort of story. Um, and I thought I had two thoughts, which is they were, I want to make this into a film and quickly followed by, I will never have a chance to make this into your film because the novel had been, um, had, I was a big success, particularly in, in states. Um, and I think while we were debating it in the office about how we might go about trying to get the rights, somebody said, Oh yeah, Obama was pictured coming out of a bookstore in Martha's vineyard on his vacation with a copy of this under his arm. We just thought, well, you know, forget it.

Speaker 1:          02:38          This is way too, you know, for a production company in Dublin. Um, and instead of UK, Ireland, London based company. Um, and, but I just wrote this letter to Emma because I felt so strongly about the book and about how I thought it might work on film that, uh, I thought, well, at least I'm going to say what I think. And then she can decide whether there's anything in that. And I wrote this very, very long ladder just sort of talking about the novel. I thought what the challenges were, what I thought, how it worked and how it might be transposed into, into this, to other medium. And she replied, and that was the beginning of a conversation that went on all the way through the film. You know, we worked together very closely and really lovely collaborative way, um, um, as a kind of thing in the film industry that you're not supposed to allow authors to adapt their own novels because they're going to be really precious and they, you know, they sweated blood over this.

Speaker 1:          03:30          And so, yeah, they're going to be awful. It's going to be a nightmare. And there are plenty of stories like that, but we just kind of really got on and I think I just trusted her and she trusted me and that's how we worked. He just tell they stole my next question. And just because they do say, you know, it's very tough to work with the screen. Definitely. Yeah. It's killing your darlings. Yes. But it sounds like it was wonderful process. What were kind of some of the discussion points of, obviously you're having to tell this story in a different media. Sure. Some things maybe aren't gonna translate as well as the screen. One of the big things I thought was just, you know, Jack's voice is so strong and it's so distinct in the pro style. Yeah. Were you ever like, oh we can't tell this from, you know, we can't do voice over, we have to do this?

Speaker 1:          04:13          Or was it just like it has to be this? Well, I think that there were like, I think there were various temptations that, and I know some pitches were made to Emma where people said, okay, we can use CG or we can create a kind of like externalize the magic aspect of a child's point of view somehow or use a very, very definite point of view camera. You know, I'm not quite the Gopro, but you know that idea that you literally are in the boys had, I just felt that all of those things are wrong. They're not native to cinema cinema handles point of view in a very different way. You know, it's about, and it's much more fluid point of view in cinemas, much more fluid. Like in a novel, there's always a voice mediating the story. You know, you're reading it, you're reading it in the, the writer's voice, whether that's first person, third person, even if it changes, you're always sort of with somebody.

Speaker 1:          05:00          It's a mediated thing. Film at least in s in a sense as direct. I mean you know, and point of view can shift very subtly. So you can be with a character and then you can find yourself in even in the same scene tuning into a different car to just so you have that degree of fluidity. And my view was that with a v with some small emphases and and inflections, you could on a very small use of voice over just a pin, you to the boy at a couple of key points, you would still be very much with him but without having to make a huge song and dance with it. And also the advantage. And then in the film in a way over the novel, they said it becomes more of a 200 because the mother and the novel, she's only really seen through the eyes of the boy.

Speaker 1:          05:44          She's this idealized person. And of course we can imagine what she's really going through, but it's a projection. Whereas we've got a real breathing person in our, in our story. And so part of the thing with the adaptation was to be able to shift between his point of view and then undercut that with what you know she must be experiencing in the same situation. And part of why that's interesting is that that actually is what happens, I think with all parents and children or be it in a less extreme way. Like we turn our faces to Archie, we turned in one face to our children, which is this, hey, you know, good, great to see. Everything is always, you are telling your child with every gesture and facial expression that everything's great. Sometimes you're not. Sometimes you're shouting at your child and you know, in a supermarket and feeling like the worst kind of parent in the entire universe.

Speaker 1:          06:32          But in the in general, you're trying to make them feel safe and filter the world for them. And that's sort of what room is a, is a metaphor for it. But it comes to that. Filtration is never fully successful. I'm things do penetrate and aspects of the household that you're in or if you're kind of, if the stresses, they will pick it up. And moving from childhood to adulthood is a process of the dismantling of that membrane. You know? And I think in our film it just gets dismantled in a very dramatic way. And that just helps you think about those things in a, in a more focused way.

Speaker 3:          07:11          Sure. It's the stakes are kind of having to explain to your kid maybe why the tooth fair isn't real versus why the air entire existence that they know is not right

Speaker 1:          07:18          on any dangerous. It's dangerous and that they need to get out of there. Exactly.

Speaker 3:          07:23          So, I mean obviously two of the most important factors in this film, and it would all hinge on the actors you have playing Jack and ma. So how did, um, how did you guys find Brie Larson? How'd you find Jacob Tremblay? He was so, he's amazing. Amazing.

Speaker 1:          07:36          Yeah. All right. He sort of still blows my mind and I was there, you know, and m I think with Bray, it was one of those things like if any film works, there are always moments that you look back on, which are just pure luck because it's such a bizarre medium. It involves so much chaos and uncertainty and, and uh, the several moments of luck for me, one of them was that when we knew we were really going to make the film, we were starting to think about casting work with a very, very good casting director in London. And we were thinking about it, very short list of, of women who we thought could play the mother because once it, or to be the right age, which is mid twenties, early to mid twenties, didn't want to be casting somebody older and doing all the movie stuff that just makes things feel a bit fake.

Speaker 1:          08:21          And we had maybe three names and then somebody in the office, actually somebody in Admin in it, in Admin in the office said, Oh, I saw this film called short term travel. It's really good actor in that. And I like e if you make films, two things happen all the time. One is that people come up with scripts and um, and the other is that people have casting suggestions and you learn to smile and nod politely at both and then completely ignore them. Right. Um, and, uh, I thought our, well great, you know, thank you so much. And then there happened to be a DVD lying around the office and I took it home and I just had a bit of time that night and I watched it. And She's absolutely staggering. Bria, staggering in that film. And she's, she's interesting because she's both dramatically incredibly strong and you can go very deep, but she also has this lightness and she inhabits her characters without any of that showy, you know, tragic heroine intensity that would just kill this film because you've got to believe that she's a real person that would have been on any street in any American town.

Speaker 1:          09:23          And I was just unlucky. Um, so I went on, I met her and I met a couple of the other people that we were interested in and she just, yeah, I started a conversation where, or not meeting that we just continued through one audition and it just felt like I didn't want that conversation to, and you know, and then with Jake, when you're casting a child, you give yourself a time limit. So if it's a small child, you can't sort of say, well we'll, we'll cast the child and then when we know we've got the child, because otherwise if we don't have the drive and have a film, we'll then start putting the film together because we know we're okay. Problem is that's going to take you a year and then the child would have changed. So it's this weird, it's like cooking a dinner and trying to get everything to be ready at the same time you have to get on with the film.

Speaker 1:          10:09          Uh, you know, setting it up and you get on with looking for the kid. So I, and I used to say to Emma and would say, you know, well, what if we don't find the kid? And all right. And I'd say, Oh, you know, you know, there's top professionals working on there. So, you know, we do this all the time. But actually of course there was this terrible fear that we wouldn't find our boy and then we would have to postpone and all that. And then Jake put them, he was put on tape by his parents in Vancouver. And I saw his tape and it was really good. Maybe a little bit, he'd done some commercials and stuff. So there was a little bit of that sweet kind of, you know, being kind of acting, which it, which is fine if you're selling toothpaste or a car insurance, but if you put it in a real film, the kid just looks like Kotick, you know, that, that sort of way.

Speaker 1:          10:55          So when I went to meet him, met him in La and with a few other little boys and it's weird auditioning to little kids cause they're all gorgeous and you don't want to sit there going, yeah, you know, get rid of that one. But, but it's just, it's who fits the thing. You know. And Jake had that lovely, uh, he's very natural kid. His parents are not showbizzy at all. Um, he loves acting. Uh, and uh, very quickly could see that, that we could take that layer of sweetness away. And I just wanted to see, can I make him comfortable? Not pretending, you know, another was just sitting there. And what is it, what's it like if I ask them just to sit there and you know, holds a look and then look away and look back. And that's when you see, does it, does the, the little guy, when you ask them to do something, does he then do it with a natural kind of comfort?

Speaker 1:          11:48          You know, and he does a course. He's still very young and, and it involves, you know, getting that performance out of him involved on both sides. So much kind of effort. And I'm Brea as well because Bree was so much part of, in the scenes, he was really helping him and she'd of, she'd say, stop kicking your leg against the table or, you know, move your hair, or remember what Lenny said about this or she was amazing. And then she'd be able to go right back into her, her performance. But Jake has it. And if he didn't have it, we wouldn't do it just would be no film. I'm curious in terms of working with the two actors, because Bree kind of has to be in this very horrible, not horrible, but she, you know, she'll broken downstate versus Jake who in the beginning needs to be kind of just like, hey the world is, the world is, yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:31          Did that affect your production schedule at all? Did you guys try and shoot prep with ray first and then, and then bring Jake in fresh or what? We prep a Bri from the moment she was cast, that was about eight months. So we shot and I was in contact with her a lot and was over and back to California a lot. And um, so and, and talking about the couch cause, cause like I say, the character isn't fully formed in the novel. So there was loads of room and Bri was, but she was getting on with our own prep and we were talking and she was going on with our own prep. So she, and she got herself really into the right state of mind by the time we were ready to shoot. But then Jake arrived and it's just like in the film, nothing will dampen his spirits.

Speaker 1:          13:08          I mean, so it doesn't matter how kind of, what she's been going into in preparation, he's going, hey, what's your favorite star wars character? And you know, look if I held your nose and you'd do my, you know, it's just like, you can't stop him. He's this little lovely little boy. And that was actually really good I think for her because it stopped. It stopped her being able to sync. She had to come back up and come back up between takes. And there's some lovely moments like, you know, I don't know who's seen the film, but there's a moment where they're reunited at the, after they'd been kidnapped. It's very, very emotional after they've escaped is incredibly emotional. Brie is absolutely, you know, it is one of the most, it was amazing piece of work from her. She's just, she's crying, she's sobbing and it's real.

Speaker 1:          13:49          You know, she's got herself into that state and I'd call cut and j could go, why you still crying? You know, Lenny cold cut, what's wrong? You know, let's hang out. What do you want to eat from the craft service table? So, so it was just brilliant because it just, it kept everybody from taking themselves too seriously. Um, what sort of research did you, did you do, did you have Bree do, did she kind of take this on our own? Um, I believe Emma had said when she was writing the novel, at least she didn't get too bogged down in it just because unfortunately there are so many real life kind of examples of this that you don't want it to become too much of one story. And also you, it's always imagine an [inaudible], whatever the word is because the research brings you a certain distance, you know, can give you a lot of the, I was quite interested in small things like you know, what, how do the police operate afterwards?

Speaker 1:          14:35          What are the media do, what are the kinds of, what are the beats of all those things? Just so that it feels real. And I find those some footage of, you know, arrivals home to houses really useful. And I read interviews and watched interviews. But the thing about, the thing about it is people don't, you know, none of us speak unless you're, unless that's your thing. None of us speak with great insight about ourselves. I don't think we do anyway. You know, and people stories become a bit calcified so that after that, when you see a story, it's sometimes already become a kind of bit of a uh, a potter, you know? So in the end you've really got to imagine what was it really like the moment when they stopped at what, you know, you have no choice but to do the thing that you always do if you're making a running book or making a film and just try your best to get inside it using your own, you know, your own resources.

Speaker 1:          15:27          But I know, I know I did. I did. Yeah, I did read some of the stuff and watch some of the stuff from particular interested in the media and how the media exploit's those people and what it, all those interviews feel like. And because we were doing one of those interviews in the film, it was a brilliant thing to be able to watch those simpering deeply concerned, heavily quaffed people who, whose make that, you know, who have that dripping sense of deep concern and you just know that it is. There is a savage ratings getting machine operating under that. So that was it. Useful to watch. That's one of the things I noticed, um, that is also pretty prominent in the book. Where do you think this film kind of would've resonated maybe 50 years ago where we weren't in this 24 seven media cycle where it's almost this like horrific expectation of these people are victims.

Speaker 1:          16:19          That's right. It will have to participate in an interview and then it's like if they don't, people are like, well, what's wrong with you? You know, my, and I had to be private about it. It's like all the people cheering when they come home. And what makes you think that that's what these people who've just been through this terrible trauma need? I mean, I'm not suggesting that people cheering don't actually feel something, but everything is a spectacle. And I don't think 30, 40 years ago, this would be an entirely different film. And you would actually imagine that largely people would keep, this is also not necessarily a good thing, but people would want to keep it quiet because it'd be perceived shame and, and all that around what had happened. Now at least that's not there now. Although we are, you know, it's very interesting, you know, that whole idea of how we, how shame operates in, in the public's fair now and, and how ticketing social media that that kind of mob can form really, really quickly.

Speaker 1:          17:14          Um, and it's the same I think in these cases. People end with the parts over them, judge the mother. Um, and when she comes out, she is so concerned to show that she's done a good job with the boy. That's very, I think that's something very sad about that. It is. And I think, I think it's probably one of the crucial things, my understanding is you could say to a parent is like judging them on their parenting style and saying, you know, well it shouldn't, shouldn't you've done this. It's like, well you don't know, you weren't in my shoes. That's where I didn't even have shoes. Yeah. Um, so I'm curious about religion just because it is a little more prominent in the book, but I don't think it was missing from the movie. But I'm, I'm curious as to what the decision was in terms of not making it this kind of huge factor.

Speaker 1:          17:56          I just didn't want it to be, I mean, in a way I didn't want it to be appropriated by that constituency has that kind of story. I just an Emma what Emma did and then all of that, she does bring in a little bit of it and then it's really just, it's Mars attempt to use whatever materials she's got to make this work for the boy and I, I felt what, I don't think anybody needed this. I'm, I'm myself, I'm not religious. I'm it. And I'm pretty kind of emphatic about that. So I suppose it's just a personal thing. She just talk about heaven, but that's a very generic idea. But as soon as you talk about God and Jesus and stuff, um, I just, for me it rang alarm bells and I just didn't want the film being talked about as a cause. I think people should believe whatever they want and be totally free to do that. But in this story, for me it is the actual love of a mother, which all mothers, um, you know, most people give to their children regardless of whether they're religious or not. And I thought, well, if you could do it without that, then let's do it without it.

Speaker 3:          18:59          I definitely kind of enjoyed that. It made it more accessible to me is also like a Christian or whatever. Yeah. Where it's, it's, it's just more her appropriating the backstories and mythology. She already knows that as opposed to, uh, you know, making it about a specific. Exactly. Um, so when, uh, one of the things I really enjoyed, and this is just more of a film making thing, was that the use of sound and music and then the kind of lack thereof. Yeah. Um, I don't think we even heard music at all until we kind of went into Jack's first.

Speaker 1:          19:29          Yeah, there's a little bit, but really the first proper score is Wimmer in his first voiceover. Was that something that you knew from the beginning that you just want it to be this like cold? No, the music thing is always organic with me. I worked with the same composer. He's what I've worked on every, with everything that I've done. He did frank as well, but the songs on the soundtrack and I, we've been friends since we were in the Irish equivalent of third grade, like we were nine, so that, right. That's that then isn't it? And um, we always just, it's always a thing that he just starts coming in, starts watching stuff, starts to put pieces against what we're doing and we see them, we keep them where we, we, we lays them. And I think I'm always pretty sparing with music because I think it's when a film can do a lot of it's work, just easing those very simple tools.

Speaker 1:          20:16          That's a very strong thing. And then when you do use music, it has more effect because it isn't just this wallpaper that's there all the time. Um, sound, I think it's a really good sound job on this film. We spent a lot of time on it and just that feeling of opening out when the door opens and, and you just get this and you realize that you've been in this kind of vacuum space for, for a while. And then once they're outside and Jack is having to deal with the kind of buzzing confusion of the world. There's quite a lot of very good, very separate design that just emphasizes different frequencies and just masses a little bit with perspective in the same way that the camera starts to be, um, to deconstruct a little bit. Some of those experiences, like when, when he's with the police and they're asking him questions in the way that a child does, he's, his attention is just as likely to be focused on the barges, the face, you know, where the heart is, the face and, and, um, and those are the things we didn't really do inside the room where everything is familiar.

Speaker 1:          21:14          So yeah, sound design is, uh, you know, it's a huge part of it and just personal grievance is that so many theatres are bodily set up and they also play that film's really quietly because they don't want, they use a huge big blockbusters which leak into the sea, send them into the theater, right beside if it's a multiplex and see half the time when you're watching a subtle film, you're losing massive amount of its impact because it's not an immersive sound experience, it's just that it's just a bit too quiet. Um, only heard it in properly and, and good, but lack of sound. That I think was the thing that was most, we heard the least the most. Um, um, so I think one of my favorite scenes personally, at least it was when they're out and my, or joy or she's just like, I want him to connect with something.

Speaker 1:          22:01          Yes. Um, you know, and clearly he's actually capable of, and she's not, but I'm, I'm curious as to what you want people to connect with. Like what's one of the things you want people to connect with most with this film? Um, for me it's always, it's a good way of asking it because people usually say, what do you want people to take away? Or what ideas do you want them to take away? But I don't think in terms so much of, of ideas and there are lots of ideas and it's quite a fertile film for thinking about things via, you know, but, um, I think more about experiences and a kind of film is such a, it can be, especially in the theater, is such a kind of completely, I use that word again, immersive experience that it, it, it, it sometimes allows you to open up a little bit, just very simply about the relationships in your own life.

Speaker 1:          22:48          For Poor, for me, it's to feel more a different kind of empathy or a or a an awareness of other people. And I, for me, it's, it's, I hope that you feel that you've had a very, very intimate encounter with people that you've cared about. And I think through art, those encounters are pure in a way that they can never be in life because it's almost impossible in life to distance yourself from your own requirements or impulses or once in a given situation or there was, were, were actors in, in our own lives and we can, it's very hard to abstract that probably with your own children is the only time where you feel that, you know, that lack of yourself being that important. But, but for me, I think a good piece of film or humanistic piece of film is one that sharpens your sense of empathy and, and, and does it in this crucible of a, of a, of an experience in this, in the theater.

Speaker 1:          23:46          But then maybe you bring that back out and, and it just opens you up a little bit. Um, so I think my last question is, and we're going to be taking audience questions if anyone wants to line up, um, what was the most challenging thing about making this film for you and what was the most rewarding thing? Probably the most challenging was, was was how do you preserve the, the tension in the film after the escape because you have a, an escape sequence in the middle of the film, which would normally be the, you know, the climax of a film and then you're going to move on into this different sort of question that you're asking in the second half. And I think in way we found just by, but by making something of the anticlimax of the escape, make that the plot point that for an ordinance goes, oh wait, this isn't, this isn't going to be this sudden realization that it's not going to be what you were hoping for.

Speaker 1:          24:37          And also, I suppose certain kind of very focused storytelling in the second half, which just creates this, I don't know, just this, this, this tension around whether the relationship can survive. And probably the bit, the most rewarding thing about it was, um, actually just feeling the audience's reaction to you. What, I mean, that's not so much about the making, but I've made it, you know, if this is my fifth feature and they've all had, you know, they've, I'm very lucky there will be well reviewed and I've gone to very good festivals and first two to three were very art house films and you get an extremely attached audience for those. But, but it's a small one and in a big room for a lot of people. It's just not what they want. And, and I didn't go out making this film in order to, that wasn't the purpose.

Speaker 1:          25:24          I didn't want to go and say I'm going to make abroad and clap crowd pleasing film. I wanted to make the right that the film that this should be. But when it turns out that that actually has a, a much bigger audience and not, the effect is so emotional, sort of amazing. I mean in, in Toronto, I, Eh, I didn't go to the screening, but I came, I came at the end and I heard the music start on this absolutely huge response from the audience. And then I walked out and there was a massive innovation and, uh, that was sort of overwhelming. It was, but it was, it was really lovely.

Speaker 4:          25:58          Yeah. Um, do we have any,

Speaker 1:          26:04          I feel like it's a shareholder's meeting. Uh, was there any part of the book that you wanted to adapt for the film and we're not able to, yes, there were some parts of the book that I really loved. I think again, in the second half there's a trip to the shopping mall that they go on. My has a brother in the book. We, we, she, he's not there in the film. Um, and they go to the shopping mall and Jack is dragged around and it doesn't understand anything and it's all overwhelming. It's a really lovely commentary on the way we live. Um, but in the film, it was only by really focusing the film in this very laser like way in the second part where you aren't entirely tracking the relationship with the mother and son. That's, so I shot, I did shoot a shopping mall scene and it's really interesting and on its own is very interesting, but, and it also took them out of the house at the end and I felt, no, let's, you know, let's keep this balance. It's one interior to another via this big expansive section. And so I kept it up at that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, thank you so much for joining us today. It's a pleasure. Thank you so much for coming.
