Speaker 1:          00:02          Hi everyone. Welcome to talks at Google today. It is my pleasure to welcome a Jeremy's Sonia and Anton Yelchin Burt Green Room. Let's give a round of applause.

Speaker 2:          00:14          Great to be here.

Speaker 1:          00:16          Could you give us a brief overview of what the film's about?

Speaker 3:          00:20          Sure. It is a punk rock siege thriller is set in the backstage green room of a concert venue during a live concert and basically an out of town band as a witness, the aftermath of a backstage murder and the club happens to be run by Nazi skinheads and so they barricade themselves in and tries to private night.

Speaker 1:          00:44          That's good summary. Uh, so this is, I mean it's, it's a very claustrophobic siege, Phil. Um, you know, it's very sort of limited in the scope of where you, was that always the intention with it or did you ever, were you tempted to go outside the club with it?

Speaker 3:          01:00          Oh, I wanted to, I wanted to, but no, I mean this scenario demanded that we say in that pressure cooker scenario, um, my first film murder party actually takes place in a enclosed, actually it's a Brooklyn warehouse and it's a, it's an, it's an McCobb art party gone wrong. And it's similar in tone as far as like an overnight sort of blood fests, but that's more of a Gonzo horror comedy. The, the key there is when you're an independent filmmaker, you're told do something in a single location that'd be cheaper. Um, it's just people talking in a room. And for me, you know, my attraction towards cinema is, is visual. And so I found that very, uh, suppress. I was just, I was just like, this is terrible. All I do is listen to people talk. It's not my thing. Um, so my next film I do, I've got out in the open road and explored highways and forests and got a lot of production value to that. And then for green room, it just, the scenario demanded that I promised I'd never go back into that sort of scenario, but I did. But this time I had, I knew what I was getting into. So I think we achieved a certain level of craft. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:16          Um, you said that you said you're tracking film is visual and this is one of your first movie that you aren't the cinematographer on. Correct. What was it like sort of taking, not necessarily step back is obviously you're going to be very involved in the visual aesthetic of it, but what was that experience like? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:31          that was a big thing is that knowing going into this is an ensemble performance piece and there's pit bulls and shotguns and gunfights and mayhem all throughout the film that my attention had to be elsewhere. But if I was looking through the eye piece of the camera and how I get this tunnel vision, that was blue ruin, it was very quiet and almost wordless for most of the film. Green Room is just nonstop like throttling and the emotional charge of the characters had to be really

Speaker 4:          03:00          accounted for. And, and I, I leaned heavily on Anton and the whole cast for that. Um, but I definitely had to oversee many departments and having a sim or target for was actually a great weight off my shoulders.

Speaker 1:          03:11          So Anton, how did you get involved in the project?

Speaker 4:          03:14          Uh, in a pretty, pretty standard way. I think I just, I, I got the script and I read it and I skyped with Jeremy and a, I then ended up meeting with him a little later, actually a little bit later actually. And then a, yeah, pretty, pretty standard trajectory, honestly. Uh, not, nothing too exciting to relay here. Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:36          I found the script in the street, the street that I read through a mate, that's all Jeremy was waiting on the other side. What's it Michelle? Michelle's going to say a store man room to then drag it, uh, you up with you on that because experience and like punk has been an influence on your lives. Did that, did you know that about Anton when you cast him or

Speaker 4:          03:58          us? No, I think that I have a history and so to see, and anytime I would love to tell you about his band, Jeremy. Okay. So my band name, it was with my best buddies. So like I love those guys. So I've relayed to them over the years, may times my dissatisfaction with the name. But that being said, I had this band and we had a great time just being a really shitty punk band. And we played a lot of gigs, like the one in the, in the film where, uh, you played a six people. Um, uh, and ironically I found out we're doing our press day at the viper room tomorrow in La and that's where we would play Sundays at midnight. So Sundays at midnight. That's not like peak hour for a show, you know. Uh, but we, we, we had such a good time and I think when I met Jeremy, um, obviously it wasn't about like I, yeah, I'd been in a bad mood.

Speaker 4:          04:55          It's about other things when you're signing on for a film, I think. But the feeling that you have playing with your friends, your best friends and sharing those times, like if you're going on the road to play or you're just playing, just bonding over playing for six people. And all of you feeling so low that the six people having clap once, um, is the best feeling in a way because only you and your friends share that. And that's kind of for me what was so touching about this film is like pat and his friends are all put in jeopardy, but for pat he's seeing the fact that his best friends are in jeopardy. That to me was kind of the, the heart and soul of the piece. But like really what's touching that you experience when you're playing with your friends, you know,

Speaker 1:          05:45          speaking of your friends, there's also, this is actually a character that we meet that isn't a member of the band is, is imaging boots character, right? Cause this, but you don't know who or what she is and she emerges from the shadows and we don't find out a lot about her even through the course of the film. Um, could you talk about her sort of evolution is, I feel like she's like a hero at the end of it.

Speaker 3:          06:06          It was very important for me to have a strong female character. And I like, I like playing with the fact that she starts as the girlfriend of the victim, you know, and she's trapped in the room with this band and then she, we didn't even give her closeups images of boots. Yeah. Whatever you're, that you're in the background. We cut off her frame, you know, she'd be out of half out of frame, kind of disregard her as a character, but she kind of earns her way in to the inner circle and it's really fun to see that dynamic happened where, you know, not to give any spoilers away, but she does emerge as a central character and she pretty much takes over and kicks ass.

Speaker 1:          06:43          And you've worked with her before on fight night, right? Uh, yeah. Sorry. I was just like trying to negotiate all this while Jeremy was so many layers. Um, yeah, I was

Speaker 4:          06:53          happy to be able to work with him again. I have so much respect for her and so inspired by her. Um, and the great thing is, is, is our work in fright night that has literally nothing to do with this film. I mean, it was just like totally different characters in a totally different film and I was just happy to be on set with her again. It's always nice to see your friends.

Speaker 1:          07:14          Uh, outer work murdered, murdered. That's the kind of guy I say. That's why I was casting this film. My blood lust called hearted willingness to throw. Your friends are going to see a film for you or somebody doesn't get murdered or stabbed or you know, if you dig deep, there's, I kind of found

Speaker 3:          07:34          my, my way doing these genre films, but um, I have a short film, 2004 called crabwalk. It's a melancholy comedy. Who would have thought? Um, and yes, I will eventually explore a lower body count, but I think I'm actually getting these in before I get too soft. I'm a father of three very, very fulfilling life at home surrounded by love. But these are the films that I loved growing up and I'm trying to maintain that connection long enough to, to, to, to do them myself before it become one of those guys that makes, I don't know, animated films for my kids.

Speaker 1:          08:13          He's standing around with them. I know there's, there's a lot of sort of violence and viscera, but it didn't feel gratuitous, which I mean that as a compliment. Like it was like, yeah, this is necessary because this is the situation. How did you negotiate that kind of fine line between like, oh is a slasher girls horror horror film? And like this is horrifying. It's,

Speaker 3:          08:35          it's to ratchet up intensity and all the violence has a very articulate purpose within the movie. Um, and sometimes it is like full frontal Gore and it's a rub your face in it. There's a transition in the film, one of the key characters where she becomes a killer and she is reluctant. It's not like, again, there's no blood loss to it. It's just like a very, this is a war movie. There's, there's two sides, one very singular goal on one side and then just pure survival on the other. But for the kids and the punk rock band to sort of acclimate to their new environment and a step up and to mount some kind of revolt, they have to become killers. And that's brutal. It's not just high five, let's kill the bad guys. It's, it's, it's holy smokes, we're in far too deep and this is not gonna end well.

Speaker 3:          09:24          Um, and sometimes you get a little gratuitous close up if it's a non fatal wound, but there is one in particular is coming to mind that I am thinking of. We could give a high five if you had no, no, it's brutal. But the key is that, that it's um, it's coupled with an emotional component and there is reverence for all the characters. That's what sets it apart, I hope is that either even like the, the quote unquote bad guys, like when there is a life lost, you feel it and it, it's, it's, the intensity is real and the, and the loss is real and it's not supposed to wear. There's a couple of high five moments in the movie had pepper those in just so it's satisfying narratively.

Speaker 1:          10:05          Um, speaking of the bad guys, your villain is it never, he did Patrick Stewart Moore. Feminine and a good way. He was so scary. Um, so what was sort of having him as your villain like onset just do the whole process?

Speaker 4:          10:21          Well, you know, I think when, whenever someone that is accomplished as much as, as Patrick has a, Patrick Stewart has, when Sir Patrick Stewart Matrix, when when you're on set with someone like that, you're, you're really fortunate because the way that that man conducts himself with everyone is incredibly, I guess honorable is a good way to put it, is so much respect for everyone. And it goes without saying it, you know, his career on, on stage and screen it is immense and he's incredibly accomplished. But it's very important to see how human beings that have achieved a lot behave with everyone on set. And that's my biggest takeaway is, is seeing someone that is so respectful, so lovely. Um, and so kind with everyone. And beyond that, uh, I didn't talk to him very much because he was trying to kill me. Um, but, uh, uh, yeah, it's, it's really, it's inspiring. You just want to go out and be like, all right, well if I ever come anywhere close to or even half as close to what he's done, I just as a human being, these are lessons that we have to learn along the way. We make movies all together. You know, it doesn't matter. All of us are together in this sort of shit show trying to make a film and we all have to be respectful to one another and that's like the most important human part of making films I think.

Speaker 1:          11:44          I mean even as an antagonist, I feel like he's actually in the beginning at least he's a very sort of respectful and it's all, it feels sort of transactional and like let's all be calm about this even though the stakes are terrifying. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          11:57          we're on record is pet. This is Patrick Stewart's most quiet performance on stage or a screen and his entire career decibel wise or they can literally Zach quiet and we miked him clothes and the key there was like he has such presence and authority that the onetime he does sort of lose his cool and yell at one of his underlings played by Megan Blair in my, my good buddy. Um, he does a face palm, you know, it's really violent and impulsive and he takes a breath and he apologizes and then it carries on. And if we, other than that he doesn't raise his voice. I think it's all like this implied power and like when he steps on a on scene, he does not have to have monologues or, or do anything that's like trying too hard to be profound. He's just this quiet authority figure and it's creepy as hell.

Speaker 1:          12:46          Maybe. I noticed this part of the film in particular, just because this is Google and we work at David, but I was like, he found the one group that there's a legitimate, like I believe you when there's a reason for them not being on social media and people not knowing where they are. Like yeah, we don't post about who we are and where we are. And that kind of hurts them in this scenario. But was that just sort of an added bonus, um, as apartment or, we did, it was that sort of, part of it was one of the things like, you know, the Internet is cool, it's good, thanks.

Speaker 3:          13:15          You know, how it affected music, how it affected the hardcore scene is terrible. And it's because you no longer have to show up to places. You know, there's still vibrant scenes in pockets throughout. But like when I was in the hardcore scene in the 1990s, it was all about being there and you couldn't click on anything. You couldn't stream anything. Um, it was very tactile and, and that's what I was there for. I was not like a guru with a huge vinyl collection. I can't drop a thousand names, but I remember just being there, it just sort of defined my youth. Um, and the ain't rights are this band trying to hold on to that dream and that sort of Pat's carry the character pad men just said is to texture. Um, so they refuse to go virtual, um, and talk about you have to show up, you've got to be there. And of course they pay the price, but now the twist is because greenery was coming out. There's a lot of talk about hardcore again and h one divorce put out this green room radio, like all these gurus talking about the old days. That's kind of fun where the thesis of my film might be proven wrong.

Speaker 1:          14:25          Maybe the Internet's awesome because now we're talking about

Speaker 3:          14:29          these hardcore bands from the 809 is that I grew up with and it's really fun.

Speaker 1:          14:33          [inaudible] going to Oregon. You can play the viper room again if we're going to play. We played the viper room at midnight. You guys can catch us there. And he saw this sort of speaking of the Internet, its effect on your career. You, you are someone who definitely sort of hits you've built your career on your own, was very, you know, I, I think when you funded murder party on your own and, and it's just sort of blue ruin and blew own buddy, what do you think of sort of this phenomenon of like how, how do you think it would have been different if you were, um, sort of becoming, coming into your own as a filmmaker now when it says the age of Youtube and people are being discovered online or people are sell funding crowdfunding? I used that for blue ruin too. I use everything.

Speaker 3:          15:18          Yeah, whatever I could get. But I think, um, I felt alone without access. I tried to make movies mostly of my high school friends and murder party, got distribution, which is a huge coup for an unknown film with unknown filmmakers behind it. Um, and then for blue ruin, you know, I started to acclimate, you know, digital cameras were getting way better. I was using these small DSLR type cameras to make that movie. Um, and it wasn't until promoting that Phil, I mean we got you submitted a old fashioned DVD copy to directors' fortnight and can, and, and that was where everything shifted. We got into that festival, played on the world stage, like the most prestigious festival in the world. Um, but when we marketed blue ruin, I saw the power of social media. I it caught fire on Twitter. They broke, you know, the top 10 on iTunes and overall and just, uh, I'm still on Twitter because of that.

Speaker 3:          16:17          So maybe, maybe I'll, I'll retreat later, but I'm loving it. And just being part of this tour right now, like just seeing my film reflected in the eyes of audience members, it's like what I, what I love. And you remember why you make films because you get so close to it over the course of the two years making it, you kind of can't see it for what it is. And then when people, you just ask them for 94 minutes to come and survive this insane punk rock thriller. And then they do and you high five and then you remember why you make them in the first place.

Speaker 1:          16:51          Which of the characters do you think each of you or it's not as like in this film, I'm like Reese obviously. Um, so aggro could you take it down and really try? I might just flip this table over here. I'm a split between it actually. Reece and pat pretty much was actually a real tiger is a real Sam. It was a real tad based on people. But, but I think I definitely pad is the expendable basis. That's how I felt in the hardcore scene. Ouch. No, this has been hammered home quite a bit over the course. Well,

Speaker 3:          17:32          in a while ago I was about 15 pounds heavier with, with muscle and worked out and I was actually amongst my crew, the Reese type character. I'm not anymore, but I felt like pat. Um, but yeah, it is. A lot of this is based on my experiences and mostly that of my friends. Like I, we had hardcore bands in Virginia. We'd go to DC for shows, but my buddies were the talented musicians. I just yelled into the microphone. Um, and some of their songs actually his, the fictional band and greener in place, the songs that I heard in high school written by my buddies. So it's, it's really coming full circle. And this is a way, this whole film was an archive of my youth, like making crazy genre films and being in punk rock bands and hardcore shows and just like, it's a way to archive that cause I'm looks so soft and lame. I want to just a little bit of street cred and green room I hope gives me a little bit.

Speaker 1:          18:29          Okay. Absolutely. Um, what's, what's, I think my last question is what's something you hope people take away from this film?

Speaker 3:          18:37          The elation of surviving a purely like physical experience that that's, you know, it's, it's fiction and it's two dimensional on a screen, but I want the experience to be real and so far so good. It's really, um, there's, if you watched it a second or third time, there's all kinds of layers of political commentary and he can go on about the intellectual nature of this movie. But I want that visceral experience. And I think it's what's lacking in cinema. Even when we get to big spectacle and we can explode worlds, and I don't really feel much. And Green Room is this hyperintense intimate action movie that is grounded not only by authenticity and it has its fair share of violence and mayhem, but it's the actors. It's the performances that makes it drives home the reality and that that terrifying intensity that you feel like you are with the band and the rug has been pulled out from under you and you have no idea where it's going to go.

Speaker 1:          19:36          I mean, I, I feel like that's the director's statement right there. So I don't really know what I can add to that. Well, what do you want them to take away? Just how sick I am playing bass. Yeah, there you go. But don't forget that you're expendable. Okay. Thanks Ben. Thank you both so much for joining us today. Cause the green room,

Speaker 2:          19:54          you.
