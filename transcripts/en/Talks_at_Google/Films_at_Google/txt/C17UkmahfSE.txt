Speaker 1:          00:06          Hi everyone. Welcome to talk to Google today. It's my pleasure to introduce Justin Lynn and John Cho for star Trek.

Speaker 2:          00:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:19          aw, thank you guys for being here. Thank you. And other you for being here. Oh, I was wondering what he was holding the a communicator to communicate it. Yes, I'm familiar with that. I pay attention. That's fair. Um, Jesse, do you wanna tell us a little bit about this film? Can I see it? Um, the process? So, sure. It was about 18 months ago

Speaker 3:          00:54          almost. Exactly. Um, I was shooting something in Ventura and my phone rings was Jj Abrams and I never met him before and we just started talking and he said, do you have any connection to star trek? And it was a really cool talk and he, I said, okay, well I'm shooting. So it was a Thursday. I said, let's meet up on Monday. Let me think about it. And, uh, and I, I remember driving home just thinking about, I knew star trek was part of my life, but I never thought about maybe like participating in the franchise, you know. Um, and it was a really cool drive. And I, at one point, I just decided to call my parents and I said, hey, look, can I just have dinner with you? So I drove there and we had this great dinner and was at that moment I felt like, let's do it, you know, I mean, at the logistical challenge that was ahead of me and the team was insane.

Speaker 3:          01:45          Like, you know, I, I do the fast movies and they used to be two years to get that from idea to delivery. And that's insane. And here it's 18 months, you know. And so the next thing I knew, I'm, I'm on a plane to London with Doug and I'm in the hotel room with Doug and Simon and Lindsey, and there was no idea and we had to get something by June. Um, but I think it was really, it was really great exercise because, um, I felt like it was a worthy challenge, you know, and, and everybody in that room, even though it was like really relentless, uh, we love Star Trek. And so, um, that was, that was our starting off point. And I felt like, especially with 50 years, uh, of Star Trek, I felt like if we can kind of really kind of deconstruct or try to deconstruct why we love it so much through these characters, then hopefully by the NL reaffirm our, you know, the passion that's been there and hopefully we can contribute to the legacy.

Speaker 1:          02:44          Where did you eat? What was that dinner I had, I remember Simon Simon was eating this healing with your parents. Oh, they, they, they, they know I like, I'm healthy.

Speaker 4:          03:00          I don't eat really healthy, but they, they think I eat healthy. So they like steam a lot of vegetables and like go crows and stuff like that. This is a year. Is that how house

Speaker 5:          03:09          painting at ut you're healthy you have to hit, yeah. Yeah. That sounds good. Yeah. Um, speaking of characters we love, John, you have been with this sort of iteration of the cannon for a while now. Um, what was it like stepping back into the shoes of sue?

Speaker 4:          03:23          Uh, it's always, it's great. I, I consider it, uh, an honor to put on the uniform and, um, I've always admired star trek. Uh, as a piece of American popular culture that's, you know, uh, put forth something, um, you know, but the idea is that it is, spouses are a beautiful, and I feel like it's a, it's a worthy piece of culture to be associated with. And so I take it seriously and, um, it feels great to put that uniform on. And then there's obviously a team of people that I really loved working with the cast of course. And, um, and then I was reunited with Justin this time around. And uh, so that was very, very special

Speaker 5:          04:12          for you. Was it sort of interesting you, you know, the last time Justin is at the helm of one of your films, it was probably on a much smaller scale and slapping their buck credit card movies,

Speaker 6:          04:22          just different limits. That was,

Speaker 4:          04:27          that was a diners club card and this was a mx black. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          04:30          But, um,

Speaker 4:          04:34          but I was, I was remarking that in, in a lot of ways. Um, I saw Justin's independent spirit come out in this. I mean, he just described that he had a truncated a timeframe and, you know, uh, they went in and, and he had to start making decisions without having a completed script. And so, you know, just from when I'm, when we, when we had that initial meeting at paramount and you were working on stuff and then I could see the gears going and you were, uh, making gut moves, you know, and think, well, I know that we have to do this. That's what I feel. And then we will have to write around these three or four decisions that he had made early on. And so, I mean, that's an unusual way to work at this scale, you know? But it was kind of great seeing, seeing what I felt, I mean, from my vantage point was sort of an independent spirit and improvisational spirit, uh, colliding with this giant thing. Yeah. So it was very exciting, a little dangerous. Um, little scary, but eventually, uh, I mean, I, I saw the movie eventually satisfying.

Speaker 5:          05:52          I think your stamp is very much on this film and in a great way. It's, it's, I think we're seeing things we haven't ever seen in star trek before. And some of it's just because you know, technology, but I think a lot of it's due to your influence. So what were some of your favorite things that you were excited to bring to this sort of beloved?

Speaker 3:          06:10          It's funny because, um, I grew up engaged in, you know, my parents had this little fish and chips restaurant, you know, and they close at nine and we'd have family, family dinner at 10 and, uh, you know, Star Trek came out 11 back in La, you know, and, uh, my brothers and I, we'd talk our way into staying up with them. And so from eight to 18 hours, our family time, you know, our engagement was on the original, the original series and every night. And so my, I remember even as eight years old, I didn't understand the, the notion of reruns. So my, my like, so filing when I saw the episode repeated, you know, it didn't make any sense to me, you know, so it was, it really was a great kind of, uh, environment. Um, but I, I think because I, my engagements offer reruns, um, by the time I saw it like the fourth time, the fifth time, um, I kind of wanted to fan fiction mode, you know, because every, it's this, the show is so compelling and fun. Um, but I've always wondered, well, what happens to Sulu and Chekov when they leave the bridge, they hang out, do they like each other? You know, like little things like that. And so in constructing this movie that I wanted to at least explore that and at least be able to showcase some of that, you know, and that that to me was aside from all the actions and stuff, those for me on a personal level where the most rewarding,

Speaker 4:          07:26          sure. To note that I'm pretty sure Sulu is taking a selfie

Speaker 5:          07:33          that's a modern sooner the selfie survives into the, um, no, I think, I think you, you hit on it like a great point. Like for me that's a very shared experience actually because that was the only thing we were allowed to watch growing up. It, star trek or sesame street creates a very weird, like sense of what the television landscape is as a kid.

Speaker 4:          07:52          Yeah. I was, uh, you know, the first time I started thinking about, well, I, years ago, I don't want to brag, but I did a showtime movie called the Tiger Woods Story. I played Jerry Chang, uh, his Stanford roommate.

Speaker 5:          08:08          Okay.

Speaker 4:          08:09          And, uh, did a lot of research, um, but, uh, Lavar Burton director of that movie and I was, I remember being really, really impressed because he was in roots reading rainbow and star trek and I was like, this guy is, uh, making a mark on American culture. And I meant very seriously, you know, and uh, anyway, so did dovetails into, uh, my admiration for the franchise.

Speaker 5:          08:37          I think it's the same, it's like these, there are only so many things in our lifetimes that have this level of impact on such like a global scale. And like I, I, I just think star trek is one of those things. It speaks to everyone. I think everyone identifies with a different thing in it. You know, for some of us here we are at Google. I'm sure a lot of people are, no, I'm tech tech and TV, like star trek is inspired so much of real technology. Yeah. Um, so what would you say, like some of the things that you really, really identified with, um, work

Speaker 4:          09:08          a first for me it was, um, you know, um, I'm an immigrant a, um, and we immigrated to Houston, Texas. And, uh, as a kid, I'm watching this show in the early eighties, or there just wasn't anyone else on television that looked like me. Um, Eh, you know, except for like Kung Fu theater, which loses, who's a disappearance. I bemoan, but, um, uh, but aside from that, it was George and he was in a cast in a heroic light if limited, you know, on the show. It was, it was heroic. He was on a spaceship. And, uh, so that was just a momentous for me and I, and, and I didn't realize how important it was until really later. But, um, that's my first memory of it.

Speaker 3:          09:59          Yeah. For me, I remember we, we had just immigrated also to the states and it was just my parents and me and my two brothers. And, uh, it was, it was Kinda, it was, it was a bit scary trying to like you halfway around the world and you'd have to learn the English, you know, new language and everything. Um, but I, I remember kind of watching star Trek and real, I think that family kind of goes beyond blood. You know, it's, it's a, it's a group, people coming together going through the shared journey and, uh, that really had a really very powerful can imprint on me.

Speaker 5:          10:30          Yeah. And I think it's, it's an ideal that we're still struggling with, sort of working towards, but it's nice and it's nice to have a star trek movie coming out now. You know, we're not in the greatest of times. It's nice to sort of have a reminder of, I think this film does a good job of being like, yeah, it's like, hope there's hopeful. Um, John, I want to go back a little bit to something you've just said is, um, you know, I think, uh, the Asian representation, like I don't want to go too much into it, but you know, starring John Cho was such an exciting thing to see because it's like, yeah, and you're starring in this, you know, it's, it's nice to have you continuing that mantle and, um, I think it's, oh, thanks.

Speaker 6:          11:05          Uh,

Speaker 4:          11:08          I'll ask myself a question. How did you feel?

Speaker 6:          11:14          Yeah, it was crazy. Um,

Speaker 4:          11:16          oh, we, which is an example of, I mean, uh, I'm not just kissing ass cause I'm a Google, but, uh, it was like a strange moment of, um, populist expression that happened online, you know? Um, I, I don't know, you know, if we could have, if that could have happened, uh, in 1990, you know, I'm, I'm assuming not, um, or any, how it would have happened in 1990, obviously. Um, so it was brilliant. It was simple and I always thought it was interesting that that guy used the tools of, um, movie makers. You know, we just sometimes, you know, if you go to the American film market, they'll just have a poster of, you know, Stephen Dorff on a jet ski and it's called, you know, uh, you know, terminal snow and the, the, the script isn't written yet. And some Russian guy, we'll plunk down, you know, 7 million a and say, okay, write me the script. I mean, they present the poster before they write this screenplay and, and because, because it's a really effective way to sell an idea, you know. And um, and the starring John Cho thing was just a bunch of really well done posters that got people talking. The, the most interesting, I read an interview with the guy, William you who, who started it and he said, um, the most interesting thing he said was, if, if you find this funny, you should ask yourself why. Um, there was no question. So I haven't technically failed to answer.

Speaker 5:          12:57          I think you asked the question that I realize that I'm just fluttering calls. No, I think it's a, it's like a question that we should still be asking you. And the other side of it. It's also very nice to have representation behind the camera. Um, I think it's, it's nice to see, you know, directors of color and it's exciting to see something is epic is this, you know, have that sort of influence. And I think, again, it's going back to like the roots of Star Trek, you know, and it's not just Asian Americans. It's like you have Nichelle Nichols, you have, you know, all these sort of groundbreaking things. And, um, I just appreciated seeing sort of diversity again in this star trek movie and not just the ones like humanoids. I'm, the thing I was super impressed by was the aliens on this. Um, you did some stuff with the aliens and I was just so impressed by, and it's no longer, you know, we've come a long way since just your painted green in a body suit and that's suddenly you're, you know, a sexy alien lady or something like that. Um, did you always know that you wanted to include such, like a wide berth of

Speaker 3:          13:51          Oh yeah. I mean, I, that was one of the, uh, the perks of the job, you know, and, and Joel Harlow, who did it such an amazing job. I mean, as soon as I signed on know, we were looking at a different creatures. We're looking at the history of trek and you know, especially with crawl, like I, you know, interest elbows, Keller character. Um, it, it was really interesting because we really want it that designed to embody 50 years of trek creature. So, you know, cause the nature and there's a twist you guys, you know, it's the whole thing is that, you know, we want it to, I mean, we wanted to make sure that as we were designing it, uh, we were very mindful of the history, you know. Um, but I also feel like the aesthetic now with filmmaking, we have more tools now than ever in cinema. And it's, especially with like, um, visual effects and CG and it really kind of has a vault to its own aesthetic. And it was, it was cool to kind of try it. One of the goals is to bring this tactile nature back into film. So it was really cool to go in the shops and would've like molding it and stuff and you actually can feel and touch and build these characters. You know, I was, it was a lot of fun,

Speaker 5:          14:58          John, for you. Was having like it visually show that like the, the sort of nature of like, Hey, there are a lot more buttons this time and aren't just like pads, like for you, did that help you even more get into this sort of further iteration of Zulu?

Speaker 4:          15:11          Uh, I don't, I don't prepare that much. Um, all right. I'm not that serious of an actor. Uh, but yes, I mean that it's, that the enterprise is like a very, um, maybe it's because of all the mythology surrounding it and all the culture surrounding it. That's like a, it's an obviously recognizable pieces is very a cathedral like for me, you know, and then, um, so it's something I've known. It's something very familiar. And then, uh, to come on this on the new bridge is a strange because it's new and old. Um, and the bridge is just, it's very easy to pretend there. Um, and, uh, I'm a limited, I'm an actor with limited range, so I need as much help as possible and everything seems to do something or you can believe that it does.

Speaker 3:          16:05          Thanks. So, no, I was impressed though. I mean, I'm the Newbie here and when I walked on to you and Anton and everybody, it's like they just go into it and they're in that mode. I believe that I believe. Good. Thanks.

Speaker 5:          16:22          That's beautiful. Uh, Justin, you did, you did a very short for us. You did a great story. What, was there anything sort of you learn from that, that you brought to star trek with you or,

Speaker 3:          16:37          well, what I loved about that experiences, um, I didn't want, I want it to be fully immersive and, um, a lot of times, you know, I, I feel like as a filmmaker I'm always looking for areas to, to trim, prove and try to grow every day, you know, and with the fast movies, um, that aesthetic was something that I, it was out of practical, um, interaction. You know, like I would come up with crazy ideas and all these great people that's crass, people around the world come in and try to make it happen. Like, but there'll be like the weirdest little thing where I'm like, okay, it's going to, the car's going to crash and the land and I want to lay down his roof. And they'd never land on the roof. Never. You know? Um, so like editing, always kind of like you always ended up doing one or two extra cuts.

Speaker 3:          17:24          And, uh, the thing doing the VR was I really wanted to challenge, you know, because it was going to be live action and to do it with no cuts. Um, that took a lot of prep, a lot of people coming together to bring that to life, you know? And, and the thing that I learned about that is there's some really talented fucking talented people in this world. So if you could think it, everyone's going to come. And, and that passion just drives it. It was so inspiring because, you know, I mean, if you have to really think about it, live action going like lights, cast shadow and then yet how are you going to do three 60. But like if you just have an idea and you present it out there, it's amazing how like a group of people come together and make that come into reality, you know?

Speaker 3:          18:05          And so, um, I really appreciate it. You know, I felt like I was in like editing crazy editing world for awhile, um, which is my own doing. And I really loved that experience because there was no cuts, you know? So that really dovetailed into this film where I, there's, there are a lot of moments where I think also because the cast is so great, you know, where I can just let the camera flow and, and there's a sincerity about that, you know, I think edits are great, but it also, it's cheating, you know? And so people that get that, uh, and to be able to have that kind of controls, it was pretty amazing.

Speaker 4:          18:39          Speaking of the cast. Uh, so I have to ask about the Dubsmash thing. Who started that? It officially started with, uh, if you don't know, uh, we had just had been, do you know the APP? Dubsmash? Uh, no. It's a lip syncing APP. And, um, Zoe started at Zoe Saldana started it, um, and it got really out of hand and we spend all our time doing it. And then we had a Dubsmash, um, uh, crisis because, um, we were texting them to one another and the weekend we really started in earnest. Um, we, I mean, I think we'd done like 80 all together and there was on this super long text chain except, uh, Karl urban was not, uh, who plays bones, was not, um, uh, texting back. And, uh, which was weird because it was like very him. And when he came back to work that Monday, we said, uh, we, we've been weeds Dubsmash Dubsmash and he's like, what are you talking about? And we realized that we had been texting an old number of his, um, to a production cell phone that he had a while shooting the last movie. And it had been going to a landscape architect and we were very scared because, uh, you know, Sophia was doing stuff in makeup, full hair and makeup and, uh, there's a lot of secrecy around these movies and we were revealing everything.

Speaker 4:          20:34          There's a lot of evidence and uh, anyway, so, um, it turned out it was uh, yeah, so, uh, we thought that Carl was, um, effing with us and um, but it turned out he

Speaker 1:          20:48          was real and we had to call him this man and a, beg him not to, uh, since sell these things. Um, he was very cool. And did you not participate back? Cause that would have been, I wish, I hope we sent him a bottle of Scotch or something.

Speaker 5:          21:10          We'll take audience questions in a minute if folks want to line up. Um, okay. I some sort of rapid fire questions for you guys, uh, for both of you, um, for you in real life. Not Relating to any character of you have made a plate. Um, engineering science. There's security department, red shirt, yellow shirt or blue shirt.

Speaker 2:          21:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:28          Generics, science, science. Is there an arts department?

Speaker 5:          21:38          Um, if you had B one alien species within start talking about, would it be,

Speaker 1:          21:44          I, I would, I would love to be strong and, uh, like a Klingon. Okay.

Speaker 5:          21:53          That sounds good. Clean on. Okay. What's one piece of technology from the Star Trek University you'd like to see realized sooner rather than later? Like a holodeck. Replicators warp drives.

Speaker 1:          22:05          I mean the food stuff, right? Like the applicators. Right. That's, that's pretty cool. She ain't chick filet in space chick filet and Sushi guys. You've got to try that. We survive post productions, chick fillet and Sushi.

Speaker 5:          22:21          It sounds really healthy. Um, would you rather deal with the Mirror Mirror, alternative universe version of yourself or a triple infestation

Speaker 1:          22:30          mirror Tribble that that's, that's there's something about masses of something that's very nightmarish to me. Yeah. Bumps. I said I'm scared of bumps.

Speaker 5:          22:42          Okay. Um, who from the cast do you think is actually most qualified to run a startup?

Speaker 1:          22:48          Wow. Simon. Simon Parr. Yeah, but you know things. Zack, is he so believable? He like when he jokes around like it takes me like 10 seconds. So even laughed because I realize that it's Zach and not Spock. I go show up on set, he has a band job cause he's always probably things banjos. I'm like, wait, Spock holding a banjo, that's still, it's still having a hard time getting used to.

Speaker 5:          23:15          That's certainly something that would probably be very visually disconcerting. Um, well speaking of that, uh, the Internet is kind of an interesting place for fandom and what's probably the most unique piece of Fan art you've seen?

Speaker 2:          23:31          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          23:32          Oh yeah, the Spock Kirk stuff. Oh No, I was, I just in general, fan fiction gets gay fast, you know, I'm sure there's some like nice, heroic. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          23:46          Okay. All right. Going south real fast. Um, do either of you have like a sort of Kobayashi Maru story where you kind of cheated the system a little and,

Speaker 3:          24:00          and yeah, this whole film was a Colby when I signed up. I don't know what happened before me, but you know, it, all I know's Jj came to the call and you sit, hey, go make it your own. Be Bold and just do it. Go. And then once I took it every, I wanted to be ambitious in every idea I had. It felt like we didn't have enough money, you know, so I felt like we were back into doing their big indie movie, you know, and that like, we got sequences in the movie where, um, you know, we need probably 20 more days, first unit in 20 days, 20 more days, second unit, you know. But we would do stuff where we'd shoot first unit, everybody would go home and I'd stay and shoot second unit all night and then they would go home and the first unit show back up and we shoot first unit all day.

Speaker 3:          24:43          But, you know, it was like that was the process for this movie, you know, it was totally worth it, you know, and it was great. And, and, um, you know, just everything like the, uh, some of the sequences we shot, like the motorcycle sequence was shot in a day and a half. That was a total, like, I used it, I literally smoke the mirror out of that sequence, you know, and I'm sending cameras out and just shooting. And, and it was just prepping and using every trick, uh, up to, uh, to this point in my life. I know I use every trick on this, on his phone. So,

Speaker 5:          25:12          so at any point did you ask Jj Abrams how he got your number? Like re Jj Abrams just calling you? It's kind of interest

Speaker 3:          25:26          saying like, you know, um, at this point in my crew, like sometimes the phone rings, I just don't know who it is and you just kind of pick up and it could be anybody,

Speaker 5:          25:34          you know, it's kind of cool. No, no, no accidental. We'll go to our audience.

Speaker 1:          25:47          Cool. Thanks Justin. This is a question for you. You're a big star trek fan and a big fast man. So it was fun to see you're involved in this project. Thank you. Could you talk about what it's like to try it? When you create something that fans have like a connection to something that's familiar? The challenge of keeping it familiar and like making that connection for people but then also making it interesting enough that they want to show up at things. He's something else,

Speaker 3:          26:08          you know, the reception. So far, I mean, whether they like it or not, I think it's hopefully they feel respected, you know? Um, I remember when I, when I, you know, jumped into the fast franchise, I'm not a car guy. I didn't know anything about cars. I think have a better appreciation for it, but that's not my passion, you know? And so I remember I would go and hang out with guys that were drifting and stuff and, and really just hang out all day and just hang, like really trying to understand their passion. He's like, I love basketball, you know, but that's my passion. And I, if, if, if I watch something, I, that's basketball related, I hope they are respecting my, so that, that was what I learned through that. And Luckily I think with Star Trek, um, this is the original series is based on the original series.

Speaker 3:          26:53          And I do have a love for maybe different at different levels, other people. But, um, that's something that I think we were very, um, I was very clear on, I mean, when you do this, you know, especially at, at this budget level, you know, you really do feel like that's where the art and commerce just collide. And some of the meetings you go in and the fights that you have to, you know, really go. It's pretty intense, you know. But I, I feel like at the end of the day that that first meeting I had, uh, not with Jj, but with the studio was very clear what we were going to do. You know, I think sometimes when you get in a room, people are like, oh, you know, it's been 50 years. Should we try to make star trek more like this or more like that, or more like this. And, and I just felt like that was the wrong approach. Like, we have the goods, you know, Potter Star Trek's about these great characters. It's about this, you know, really the shared journey and the sense of exploration and discovery, you know. And, uh, and part of the mandate of star trek is to try new things. So I really felt like it was all there and, and, and sort of trying to be something else, like let's really kind of find them within and, and, and, and, and really celebrate that.

Speaker 4:          27:58          I will, amen that by saying, I mean this is not bs. He, he, he did talk about the fans during production all the time. And it was this constant, uh, I mean it's, it's helpful just on a practical level too, for as an actor, you're, you're pretty self centered. And I mean, I mean like internal you'll focus is internal. And um, one of the, the sort of spines he kept coming back to was what did the, what would the fans want? And it is this like a constant thing that you would hear from Jeff? I think that there'll be clear too, it's not to pander to try to understand why there's so much passion. You know, like again, I come from the fast world and sometimes people think fast and it's just fast cars, good looking people. And you're like, well, if it's that easy, the studios would make like 10 of them every year, you know. But it's not that easy. I think there's an emotional connection that we have

Speaker 3:          28:53          and, and the, and that's a relationship that's very dear. You know, and I think, uh, but part of that relationship is also sometimes having to put, put it in uncomfortable places, maybe challenging certain notions. Um, and that's, I think that's part of the fun of, of, of doing being a part of, of something that's so special.

Speaker 5:          29:12          We saw it with sort of a mix of people who are maybe only familiar with the newer ones and people who've been watching it since forever. And I think everyone felt like they had a good time for those who have been with it. Like, you know, the characters longer. It felt respected and really enjoyed. And I think there are wonderful little nods to the sort of those of us who've watched the original series and watched it through. And, and yet it's still really like inclusive to new audiences. So thank you so much for joining us today. Go See Star Trek. Thanks guys.
