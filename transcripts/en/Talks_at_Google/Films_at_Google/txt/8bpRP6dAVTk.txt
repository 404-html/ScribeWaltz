She's been awarded the Nora Ephron prize for a groundbreaking woman filmmaker by Tribeca Film Festival and Vogue magazine and she's also been selected by Glamour magazine as one of the 35 women under 35 running Hollywood.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Ooh,

Speaker 2:          02:26          excellent. So thank you all so much for being here. I think it would be great if you could each quickly just introduce your role on the film and why this project was so personally important to you. To be a part of

Speaker 3:          02:37          hi. Oh, hey. Um, I'm Aleisha. Um, so I have, I guess I have a story by credit because Sarah and I developed the treatment and then hired the amazing Amy Fox to write it. Um, and Sarah and I produced it. And then I'm also in the film and I just need to say like, I just heard that intro and it's the first time we've all been together and I want to cry because I'm just so grateful to be like part of this amazing group of women who like have these incredible resumes. And you know, I guess my interest in the film was how do we make the world better for women? Like that's really my truth. Um, and how do we tell stories that sometimes other people are afraid to tell about the stuff that's not okay. Um, and in this case, how women are treated sometimes on Wall Street is that story.

Speaker 4:          03:43          Hi, I'm Sarah and I think Alicia did a great intro and on our involvement in the film, um, my character in the film is, is a woman named Aaron Manning. And, um, um, she particularly has a place in my heart because she's a woman trying to have it all and, and someone who enters the corporate world thinking she can't have it all and she's, I'm pregnant and hiding it and dealing with a home life and a work life and realizing that maybe she won't get to where she thinks she can in her career. And I think personally, um, I can really relate to, uh, maybe not being in your career where you think you will be at a certain age or a certain time point like when you choose to start a family. So I hope that she's a character that kind of resonates with a lot of young women out there who are thinking about being powerful women and also starting a family.

Speaker 1:          04:34          Okay.

Speaker 5:          04:35          Um, I'm Anna Gunn. I play Naomi Bishop and I was just in love with the film. As soon as I read it. I, I thought that the story of three women who are leading the way in, in terms of the storytelling and the nuance, the detail, um, the layers to each of the characters. And especially I was looking for a character, very much like this one who is not a reactor towards a man, but it's really in the forefront and is the one moving the action forward as as are my lovely co stars and producers. And, um, I really was intrigued by the fact that she's devoted her life. And just as, as you said about Aaron, there is that question of the sacrifices you make, the things that you take on or give up in order to get what you want and to, to succeed. And I was fascinated with a woman as confident and strong as she is, who's been on a winning streak. And then when we meet her though, she suddenly had her first real loss and she's struggling then for the rest of the film to get back up. And, and it gives her a different perspective completely on the life that she's led so far.

Speaker 4:          05:54          I, um, yeah, I had actually worked with Sarah Alicia previously

Speaker 6:          05:58          in theater as a playwright. And so when they approached me, um, and they had founded the company and had this concept of a Wall Street film with these three women characters, um, I was, I was, it appealed to me immediately and I don't have any background in finance. Um, the original Wall Street movie was one of my favorite movies, which is an odd fact that people wouldn't necessarily expect that from me. But it's true that a, I just always loved the right, it took you out. I loved the ethical questions and that maybe the questions of family loyalty and kind of how greed, the interfaces at that end to the idea of taking that genre and then putting this new perspective on it and also telling the truths of the women. I mean, we interviewed so many women who was experienced as you'll see in the film and the idea that these, these women have been working on Wall Street for 30 years, 20 years, 10 years, and we haven't seen their stories anywhere. And that the big part of my goal as a storyteller is to uncover stories and tell stories that we should, we should have seen these women before, but we haven't. So here they are.

Speaker 6:          07:01          Um, and I directed the film. I, I mean, I just wanted to do it from the moment I read the script, thought Amy's writing had this like kind of sophistication and elegance and kind of provoked us, uh, kind of, uh, kind of precise approach to filmmaking that I was really inspired by. And a, and I was really inspired by this, the main character as Amy wrote her. I mean, Naomi was someone I kind of had never kind of, I think seen on screen before and I knew a dialogue with this character with the right kind of mind and body behind it would be a conversation I could grow from as well

Speaker 5:          07:34          as a woman myself. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:35          That's excellent. So quickly from the audience. I'd love to get a show of hands form, um, the folks in the room and for the men specifically, I'm curious, how many times in your career have you felt like either personal or professional relationship has suffered because you've been too career focused? Okay. How about for the women?

Speaker 1:          08:00          Okay.

Speaker 2:          08:00          We got some shy folks out here come if feel wavering hands. We're not sure if that's why it fell. Yeah, I'll raise my hand. Hi. Um, it's clear that this character is so strong and driven and ambitious. Can you talk a little bit about what it was like preparing for that role and either personal or other interviews that you did to pull from?

Speaker 5:          08:19          Well, I first talked with Mira for, um, a couple of hours I think. And we were really on the same page from the get go in terms of the warrior that this woman is and the sacrifices that she has made. She has chosen to, and it's very clearly spelled out there. Um, she does what she does. She, she took it on out of need in the beginning. And then I think the, the, the winning, the art of the deal and the win, um, is something that is insane. It's an, it's incredibly addictive. And I talked to then Alicia and Sarah, they gave me so much information about the women that they had interviewed, the women who were the inspiration for these roles and also investors. And then I was on the phone with Barbara Byrne, who is a Wall Street luminary and she was wonderful and I took reams of notes and she really let me understand her journey difficulties, the struggles, sacrifices, and also the victories and what really put, she has such a joy in terms in such a passion for what she does.

Speaker 5:          09:27          So, um, we then had a day in New York before we started shooting in Philly. Um, and we, we went through a mock IPO so I could, I felt like we, I could really wrap my head around it then and then going out to dinner with, um, a variety of women and just watching the interaction and the razor sharp wit and, um, incredible intellect and fun and laughter and strength. And so I took pieces from, from all of that. And um, I also felt like, you know, with good writing, the, the, the hints are there, the, the, the meat is there. So there were, and I liked the fact that, you know, that she doesn't see her family very often and it's not leaned on too much. It's not, you know, heavily, but it's, but it's there and she really has, she has her fish and she has her mentor, John and I think even her boyfriend, she is wanting to have a close and intimate relationship, but there's always a sense of perhaps there's a trust issue there. So, um,

Speaker 2:          10:32          well that sounds together. Yeah. And we'll say a little bit of that later as well. Just kind of the importance of building a network that you can trust on and yeah, kind of at what costs. Right. Um, excellent. Um, Amy, you know, I think at, you know, at Google we talk a lot about being kinder to ourselves and kind of quieting what we call this inner saboteurs. So you have this little person talking in the back of your head. I want to work at Google. What's that? It just happened to talk about it here. Um, in the film, the characters briefly discuss, I'm not giving anything away, but they did briefly discuss the differences in how men and women digest feedback. Why was it important to you to include that conversation in the film? Um, I think for

Speaker 6:          11:14          me personally, it was an aspect of the story that I really, really related to. I think, um, I, so as I was interviewing people, um, this theme kept coming up again and again where women would say that if something went wrong, if the, if a deal went wrong, if something didn't go through, they, they would be very hard on themselves. They would sort of stay up nights questioning why did that happen? And men and women told me that men are less likely to do that. Not, not that they never do that, but that men are more likely to get pissed off and say, oh, that didn't work out because of this happened or that and blaming something outside of themselves where women will turn it inwards. And that's, I guess I just personally have been very aware of in my own life and I've taught writing for 10 years. I see a big difference in my male and female students with that voice you're talking about. I see it in my daughter already. Um, I don't know why that is. I don't know why that, that Sabbath to her seems to be stronger and women, but it's something I'm very passionate about dispelling whenever I can. So that seems really important to me.

Speaker 2:          12:15          Yeah, I think it's interesting because it does, the inner saboteurs can also be such a strength, right? To Gut check yourself and keep yourself in line. And I think we're starting to see a turn of weighing a bit more on some of the Q values versus Iq and making sure that we find that line. Um, we actually have another clip and we see Aaron in the scene. Basically mustering all the courage and guts that she can to blurt out that one sentence. Um, and I know how tough that is because I've actually done it that they're the same thing. Um, and get completely shut down. Um, can you talk to us a little bit about what you think you've seen in the workplace where women can help other women and pick them up from these places?

Speaker 4:          12:57          Yeah, I mean, I think in general, women don't go in there and do what Erin does in that scene. Enough ask, ask for that job promotion even, even if you do get to know. Um, and one of the things we really wanted to explore in that scene between me and Anna and both our characters is how difficult it is to be women of different generations and how Ana's character isn't really, and I'll let you speak to that, but from, from my standpoint as Erin, I don't see that she's overwhelmed with her work at this time and she feels like there's not enough, um, spots at the top. I'm only seeing it as my bosses shutting me down. So we were also in, I'll let you talk a little a bit to this, but interested in the dynamic between the two women when you want a promotion.

Speaker 5:          13:47          Yeah. We talked that scene was a really intricate and, and very difficult seeing really because, um, because I think that we establish a backstory that Naomi was actually very supportive and, and brought Aaron in and nurtured her and moved her along. And actually one of the things that the women, um, emphasized a lot, the women that I spoke to, um, was that it was very important. The mentor mentee relationship is extremely important. And the, the, the having somebody bring you in and bring you along and help you along. And then in turn when it's, when it's, when you get to a certain point, it's your turn then to mentor somebody else. And they also said that it was extremely important to know that, that you had somebody, one person at least who had your back and vice versa, that you could count on in a crunch.

Speaker 5:          14:37          And I think that Naomi really feels that way about Erin, but she's got, right now she's just, you know, experienced this failure and it's just been splashed all over the television. She's just dealing, um, I don't know if she's actually dealt with their boss at that point yet, but she's, she's looking, she's so intent and she's so intense about looking for the next deal and the next win and making sure that she doesn't slip away. And so when she says it's not the time, she's not trying to be mean, and she's not trying to be dismissive, she's just saying this is the reality. And she's a person who just speaks her mind very, very honestly, and she doesn't mince words. And so it's not meant to be a get out of here. It's meant to be, look at this place as a mass. We're all, you know, it's a, it's a, we're all in some sort of jeopardy.

Speaker 5:          15:32          And when the time is right, she, she means it. She really means it. So that you know, she does say what she really gives Naomi, gives her boss later tells her, tells him that um, Aaron did wonderful work and so she is looking to help her along. But there's there is that misinterpretation, the kind of things. Yeah and the misinterpreting of certain things that are said and wondering does somebody really have my back because this is such a competitive environment and I just want to add one thing cause it was a relative to what we were just talking about. Women internalize it more. So Aaron's the know from Naomi, Erin's internalizing is I'm a failure as opposed to the timing's bad. And that goes back to what we're saying. Like if a man gets a no, they might bounce back more quickly and go ask for it again a little later. And interestingly enough, in reference to film making in the edit room, we played a lot with what order to put the scenes and do we put Naomi asking for her promotion first or Aaron asking first and they told different stories because in fact they're both trying for the same thing. And there is that fear. And that competition because there is that feeling because there are so many, so few women in this world of there's not enough space. Um, and that's, you know, part of the story we were trying to tell. That's okay.

Speaker 2:          17:02          It's, it's definitely, um, something that we, you know, you're competing for the same types of projects in this time type of recognition. And uh, our CFO, Ruth Porat who actually came from Wall Street, um, she has shared with us in multiple different formats that the communication styles between men and women are different. That men will go in and I want this promotion. And not all men just for the sake of, I'm generalizing here, but um, where women, when they say something like that, you have to assume either as a male or a female boss at they are shouting it from the mountain top. Even that one sentence, is this the right time for a promotion? She is screaming that she's ready. Um, so I think, you know, for, for all everyone in this room who can help people get there, it's important to know that those communication styles really matter.

Speaker 6:          17:51          Okay. I just want to jump in. I'm only just, I think about 10 days ago, there was an article in the New York Times about advice for women asking for a raise or promotion. Um, and I actually thought it was an onion article when I saw it because it literally was instructing women on how to do a dance so they wouldn't appear threatening and asking for what they deserve. And there was no acknowledgement that maybe they need to be heard differently, that the person doing the, with the power it needs, it was literally like, well, you don't want your boss to think you're demanding. And this was in the New York Times about a week ago. So I just feel like there's so much progress to be made on this issue. And actually, I mean, when it comes to, when it comes to this scene, um, the other detail that I find interesting is that outfit that Sarah is wearing is a, is a kind of a type of kind of, um, an outfit that she kind of had scouted out during this mock IPO that they actually experienced.

Speaker 6:          18:47          And it was very specific. There's kind of a schoolgirl quality to that outfit that doesn't really kind of progress past the point of kind of seeing her in this moment. But it really informed kind of how she set up in that moment when she's asking for that promotion and kind of the optics of what you choose to wear in a work environment was something we discussed across the board with all of these characters. But that was very specific that that was the outfit that she was going to wear on that day that she was going to ask for that promotion.

Speaker 3:          19:10          Can I add one tiny thing that brings it back to Google in a way, which is, I dunno if you guys know this, but at the United States of women they did a hackathon about creating apps to help women ask for more pay and they're like, there was an article, I think it was, I'm trying to remember in the Wall Street Journal a couple of weeks ago and there are these like seven new apps all about how do we hack the pay gap? Um, and I just find that it really interesting that there are all these new technological tools for people to make change this way. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          19:50          It's, you know, when not touching a ton on the pay gap, but it's something that, um, Laszlo Bock who was one of our executives just released a op Ed, um, publicly that there is no pay gap across genders at Google, which I mean, in my 12 years I go, well, that was my proudest moment and I was almost in tears reading it just to give me the peace of mine that we've looked at this, come back to work, don't think about it. Just move that off your plate. And it's one of those things where I hope Google is leading the way to get some of those data points out there and make a real difference. So, um, excellent. So we have one more clip for you. Let's go ahead and cue it up. I think we can tag line. This one is, it's lonely at the top, setting up for a drink with a girlfriend to catch up.

Speaker 2:          20:36          Um, you know, I think it's tough. We, there's the, the underlying here where you kind of are seeing your character who's very strong and powerful and ambitious and, uh, letting her guard down for the first time and just looking for, you know, some human connection and having some time with somebody. And then she very quickly realizes that she's being taken advantage of. Um, and I, you know, I think this scene is also interesting because we see two women who were both driven and both ambitious and going after their same goals. And, um, I'm curious for any of the, kind of the point of how we balance this line of being successful and driven and ambitious and firm and decisive, but also vulnerable enough and maybe showcasing qualities that we're not proud of or that we may not aspire to or we don't want to admit we're capable of. And how do we balance that? Um, so tell me maybe as a director or writer or any of the actresses kind of,

Speaker 4:          21:37          do you guys have answers that I am all ears and it's more of a statement than a question.

Speaker 2:          21:45          Yeah. Any thoughts on, you know,

Speaker 3:          21:47          it's funny when I watched that scene high, watch it as the carrot, you know, I'm still very connected to that human and that human. I like I had to play the scene as I'm protecting my friend. Like that's how I found my way mentally. And HeartWise is like I want to take, I want to like take care of her and if she's with a shitty guy, I want to help her out of that. And that's, uh, I, that's not how the scene is experienced and I fully understand that, but that's sort of it. It's interesting to me personally that it's like we have these rationalizations that we believe so deeply in that sometimes we do hurt someone thinking that we're trying to protect them. Um, that's life. And that's to me, one of the things from the beginning when Sarah and I were first talking about this movie, about like these gray lines and, and what is moral and what is right and how do you show that? Um, and I think Amy did a spectacular job aided by MIRA in, in really sort of presenting these things. And then letting audiences, experiencing them and have bothered to talk about, but I don't, I guess to sum up, yeah, I don't have an answer. I really don't. Um, I think it, we wanted to present it as a, as a point of discussion.

Speaker 4:          23:32          I don't want to, it's rather maybe, maybe Anna will. All right here we are. But I think again, and again as we were talking about this movie and interviewing wall streeters, what came up was it the women in business, whether it's Wall Street entertainment, you name it, are either too nice or too tough. They rub people the wrong way or whether the nice girl that can get walked all over and it doesn't get paid. Um, and I think that's actually sadly still true to life. I find myself sometimes being too tough on people and then I go the reverse and try and be too nice. And it's like, and I'm constantly as a producer, actress thinking about it and I shouldn't have to. Um, but I am. Um, and then, and I think women, you know, men when they're in a tough situation, they're going to tell you like it is, they're going to tell you like it is like this and you're going to listen to them and blah blah blah. But if I talk to you like that as a woman, it's like, oh well maybe I should smile a little. And so I think it's something I'm like, I don't think, I don't know how to solve it. It's sad.

Speaker 5:          24:24          Yeah. I think that's, that was something that hit home so hard for me was the, was the fact that they did that, that, that there is that walking the tight rope of being too tough or too soft and either one is going to get you, you know, in trouble in some ways. And so it's, it's almost like being on a tight rope, you know, how to you, and I remember Barbara Burns saying that reading people and understanding people, psychology and understanding what the client needs, understanding what your boss needs, understanding. But it's something that women I think have to think about much more in terms of, like you say, how you present yourself, how you cope. Go in and ask for a promotion, how you have a discussion with your client about pricing something when he thinks it should be higher. And you think in reality it should be lower.

Speaker 5:          25:09          But you gotta you gotta be careful, especially when you've been told that your ruffling feathers and rubbing people the wrong way. And when doubt starts to creep in, that's, you know, that starts to erode the person who, you know, Naomi, who has been, I think just like a shark sometimes moving forward in these waters and really, um, just really not afraid, frankly. I think she's just pushed a lot of stuff down and when the doubt starts to creep in, that's when things started to crumble. And again, I think she really is, it's, it's a, it's a moment when the bottom kind of drops out when she thinks that she is, you know, I don't think she really has, she doesn't have time to have many friends, which just is a very solitary person because she's so focused and she is a person who I think has, has, has closed a part of herself off and closer part of herself down. So that, you know, in this conversation it's, it starts to be, it starts to feel, I think like things are just falling apart around her and she's really looking for somebody or something to hold on to. Yeah. So

Speaker 4:          26:16          as I think about it in here, like just, just talk about it more. It, it is strange that it has to be something that a woman is held liable for it because it feels like a super power that you are capable of both of getting things done and being someone's best friend. That kind of capacity for empathetic leadership feels particularly like a particularly female capability that should be rewarded. Yeah. And Yeah. Yeah. Well,

Speaker 6:          26:44          I'm actually

Speaker 2:          26:45          [inaudible] this point, you know, I, when I was doing the research and getting prepared for today, um, I, I couldn't believe it and I tried to fact check it like 18 different times, but that Kathryn Bigelow is the first and only woman to win an academy award as best director in 88 academy awards. Um, can you talk a little bit, we talked earlier about mentors and trying to find people to help you navigate your career or build yourself up and those times when it feels like it's crumbling around you, how have you navigated your career in that way?

Speaker 6:          27:18          Well, it's kind of laterally because I see more and more women kind of like kind of younger generations, uh, taking, you know, kind of creating situations for themselves to direct when not when, you know, in face of, you know, the lack of permission or kind of the gatekeeper is allowing them to occupy those positions. So I find there's a, you know, a number of women that kind of have made their name in independent film making as directors that I turned to that are kind of, we're kind of trying to come up together and then we kind of try and form this kind of peer to peer mentorship with one another. In terms of mentors that I had kind of through kind of, you know, the process of just learning to become a filmmaker. Yeah. More often than not they were men. They were male directors that I had as faculty and my film school program or just people that I shadowed with or yeah, more often than not because there are so foot few women in that position they would be men.

Speaker 6:          28:06          But I do find there to be some kind of optimism and when I look sideways, yeah. Yes. Well I think, you know, a big, a big theme for me in the film and then sort of looking at, um, women in the creative world as well as the idea of, of scarcity, right. And the idea that it, it requires someone to feel secure and powerful in order to be generous. So I think that is why so many mentors in Wall Street and in the arts as well have been men because you have to not feel that your own position is in jeopardy in order to reach down and help someone else. And just in doing press for the film, um, I had a memory that I hadn't thought of in a long time. And when I first moved to New York about 20 years ago when I started out as a playwright and Tina Howe who was a pilates or prize winning writer, came and spoke at a conference I was at for women playwrights.

Speaker 6:          28:56          And she actually got up and she said, kind of the counter what you're saying. And it didn't sound very inspiring and all she said, um, yeah, don't look at us up here to help you because we barely have jobs are so, um, and she said, look to each other. And it's funny thinking back on it because in a way she was right. And those are the people that have helped me the most. Like, you know, you've been with the three of us all started out around the same time. Um, but there's also something very sad about that. Very sad that a woman who had won the Pulitzer prize basically said, don't ask me for anything. My own stature here is so shaky. Um, and just for me doing the film, looking at the difference between the business world and the arts world, it's also been interesting because in the business world, even though someone at the top may not feel secure in their position, they at least have resources at

Speaker 4:          29:42          their disposal in the arts. I find there's such a scarcity of resources that people are even more likely to look out for themselves and not reach out to help someone else. So it's, it's been very interest.

Speaker 2:          29:53          Um, I want to make sure we have some time. If anybody in the audience has questions. We have Mike set up on either side.

Speaker 1:          30:01          MMM.

Speaker 2:          30:03          In the meantime, I'll throw out another question while people are getting up and thinking of their questions. But, um, I don't know if you guys had read and I've been talking a lot about New York Times articles up here. Um, but there was one about one about equity that was in the RST. Exactly. Okay. Um, there was one about brotalk on Wall Street a couple of weeks ago. Um, and it was for those of you that haven't read it, it's, um, basically was saying that, you know, in it behind closed doors or just when you're not in mixed company, that there's a lot of brotalk that happens on Wall Street where there's, you know, they're objectifying women and how does this impact women's careers? And, um, I don't think it's specific to Wall Street. Right. Again, that's a resonating theme throughout this movie. This is not just one particular industry. It's a story in a perspective we haven't seen before. Um, but I'm curious, you know, for the men in this room and men in business or Hollywood, they will be responsible for helping to sponsor us to get us there because they're in the positions of power. Um, so what are your thoughts on ways that men can help to sponsor women if it's not a direct mentorship or it's not women that they're looking to? Any examples of men that have really helped you guys around your careers are helpful with the film?

Speaker 4:          31:16          I mean, I will say that with my first film, the investors were 90% men. Uh, and I had no track record and um, they didn't need the, um, I find that sometimes fee, and this is not good or bad, it's just different. Sometimes female investors have a little more of the herd mentality, so they're more interested if their friends have invested, they're more interested in how much they're friends who invested. Where I find personally that the male investors decide to believe in you and they believe in you. They write a check for whatever they want to write a check for. But I think it's just important that we're 50% of the population and that whether it's a man or a woman in a position of power, that we realize that big changes have to be made in terms of bringing women up, supporting women who want to have families and want to go away for a year or two. That doesn't mean they're not valuable. They still have 30 or 40 years left of working. Um, but making it a mission, you know, much like we need to make diversity a mission. Like making it a mandate that every company

Speaker 2:          32:11          and holding people accountable. So that's another thing that Ruth brought a over to us in terms of hiring and promotion and just making sure that, you know, if there's not enough women on the dock are not enough women being talked about in talent reviews, that we are asking pointed questions and making sure that we're holding people accountable to those conversations. Um, go ahead and move a question. Okay.

Speaker 4:          32:32          Hi Guys. Thank you again so much for coming. This is such a treat. I was curious if you could tell from the clips. There are a lot of really powerful in the film. And I was wondering, uh, if, if you guys would like to talk about any moments that were really fun to film or to write or to direct, that will kind of stick with you as you move forward to other projects. Um, and if any of them really resonated for you personally or just like a really fun part of the film to work on.

Speaker 6:          33:04          Yeah. Like I feel like I loved every single scene and just, I, I just, it was everything.

Speaker 5:          33:09          The thing was just so meaty and juicy and there was so much to sink my teeth into. And, um, I, I, the, the money speech I thought was incredibly written. And also, you know, we talked a lot about finding a balance in there because she, Naomi, as much as she makes that statement, she's not making it. It's not, she's not the Gordon Gekko, she's not, you know, she's not talking about grief, but she is saying this is important and we deserve to have this and to own it and to stand up as much as men do. And not to be afraid of it. Um, and I just am sort of jumping back to in terms of, you know, what men can do to bring women up or you know, how it is that we can support each other. I guess I was really lucky. I had to, um, mentors myself who were, um, Kim Stanley and Vivian Mason who were from the actors studio.

Speaker 5:          34:05          And they really gave me the sense that I could do anything if I put my mind to it. It might be hard, it might be years to get there, but it was, you know, it was, if you love it, you just keep going and you keep doing it and you work in a 99 seat theater in La if that's what you need to do. And you just keep, keep feeding it and keep honing it. And so that really did that. Their support and their belief kept me going through the lean times at the times when I thought maybe this isn't gonna work out. And I think that, again, that's something that is explored in this film and I think it's very, very important for us to, to look at it and to keep shining light on it. Because I want my daughters to be, to feel like they can do that, that they, that they feel like they have every opportunity that a man has and they should feel that they can go in and not be afraid to ask for the promotion to ask for what they want and to, and to speak their mind.

Speaker 1:          35:04          Hm.

Speaker 6:          35:07          I mean, I'd say any scene I got to see James Purefoy and Anna just act off each other who just like delightful chemistry and like you guys are like a kind of classic old Hollywood like Clark Gable, like Lumbar, like you guys just had that sharpness with each other and James isn't too bad to look at. It's not too bad to look at it. For me, there's this magic, I'm actually a very, um, concerned about the wrong personality type for a writer because I'm very social person and writing requires for you to be alone in your house for Jensen time. Do I have always starting out in the theater. My favorite moments are always when the thing that you've created alone and you know, you get in your head and you're thinking, I mean, I don't know if it's like coding, but you're thinking like, does anyone care about this thing I'm writing?

Speaker 6:          35:52          And then it becomes a reality. So for me, when I first, the first time I was able to come on set and, uh, they were shooting some scenes and ana department and there was this fish and I just remembered sitting at my computer one day and going like, you know, she, we had talked about it, but I just remember like, oh, she should have a fish and the fish is swimming. And you think like, I'm spending my whole morning thinking about this imaginary fish. Like, but then you go on set and there's a real fish and they really feel it's quite powerful. Remember you like taking pictures of the fish for like an excited about the, here we have another question.

Speaker 7:          36:34          Yes. Hello. Um, so you've talked a lot about this, a mission behind this movie, not just entertainment. Um, do you think it being a movie versus a book or an article or some other men's, is it going to reach more people are going to have a different impact? Do you think it'd being a movie specifically?

Speaker 2:          36:49          Well that depends on people like you buying your moving ticket on Friday, Saturday or Sunday of this week preferably and going, she's not getting, we're not kidding. I think movie, I mean personally I think movies have a wonderful and television. Um, Ha has a wonderful way to uh, create conversations about change because I think a lot of people see them and they see them for fun. And, and our goal as a team and making this movie was to make something that is just in and of itself an entertaining Wall Street movie. We really just want you to go to the movies and enjoy the movie. But then isn't it nice when you leave a piece of theater or a movie or a TV series and you have real issues to talk about afterwards? Um, our goal is that you just watch it and you don't really notice that it's starting three women directed by a woman produced by women written by a woman.

Speaker 2:          37:35          You know, you just watched the movie and enjoy it and then afterwards you're like, Hey, women can do that. And it's a really great movie. I think that's a really interesting undercurrent when watching the film is that there's not a lot of discussion about being a woman. Right? It's just something that I knew of going into watching the film. But um, it is, there is so much there to unpack that is covered through the some text or through the interactions that might not always be something that, you know, men would pick up on in regular terms, but because you're seeing it play out on the big screen and it was one of those movies, I definitely will say it's uncomfortable to watch because it hit really close to home. Um, and it was one of those moments that I get so frustrated and I could feel everything that Anna was going through. And um, and it is really powerful message to put out there. And I think to digest in this platform yet another reason why it's important to see on the big screen, not the small screen gone name. I just want to say

Speaker 6:          38:36          on that note of, you know, yes, there's a here we've been asked here today to talk about some of the themes and the issues. But um, when I started out as a playwright, my brother who works in finance actually, uh, would constantly kind of, he would basically say to me, he thought I was too caught up in social issues and he thought it was, I was prioritizing too much in my projects, the themes and the subject matters that mattered to me. And he would constantly say, just tell a good story. People just want to forget whether it's environmental or the, it's just tell it gets right. So, uh, my brother actually came on as an investor in this film and when he came to see it at Sundance, he had never read the script. He just took a leap of faith. And when he came to see it, I was really nervous because I needed it to be a good story for him. And he really, he loves the story. So that's a vote of confidence for you.

Speaker 3:          39:25          Go ahead. Hello Amy. Now, for some reason I want to fish. I don't know why. So a question for you, Alicia and Anna. I'm so in the past, uh, it kind of what struck me is that you both played really strong and um, if not polemic, a female characters on TV, especially you, Alicia. Holy Moly. Amazing. Um, but I was just curious like if those, either of those characters that you played, um, I'm talking about breaking bad and orange is the new black obviously, um, helped inform your performance or kind of made you think about, you know, riding the line, you know, between like, you know, soft and hard and strong enough to strong, uh, just curious if no, then then nobody.

Speaker 5:          40:14          Well, I, I sir, I had a very, uh, strange and interesting journey with Skylar in terms of the sort of Skyler hate on the Internet. And it was a very difficult thing to understand when it first started happening. Um, I wasn't really into looking at anything on online and I was informed about it. And then I, as I wrote an op Ed piece, um, uh, towards the end of the show, I opened Pandora's box and looked at, you know, looked at some of it because I wanted to understand as a, as an actor, you want to understand if what you're doing is not working or is rubbing people the wrong way for some reason. And then I started getting, I mean, it really did parallel Naomi's journey in so many ways because I started to doubt myself and I started to think, okay, what's, you know, what should I improve or what should I do differently?

Speaker 5:          41:09          Um, and then I, I really went through a process of shutting it down and not looking at it anymore. And I think there were several reasons that it happened, but I think we're still dealing with the, the expectations of what a woman should be, what her gender, you know, gender roles, what a wife should be, what we expect a woman to look like, to, uh, to, to speak. Like if she's too confident, if too, all those things. So, um, I felt like I really understood because I'd been through that. It really informed how I played Naomi because I'd been through that. And I think that's why she's such a tough person on the outside because she has to be.

Speaker 3:          41:50          Hmm. Um, and for me, uh, similar journey, you play a character like that that's incredibly recognizable. And I always say like, my daughter would be on the seven. My daughter learn the word bad ass really early because I'd be with her and like multiple times a day people come up to me and they're like, Europe, bad ass. And she's like, what's up? You know? Um, and uh, and similar to when we were talking earlier, I never saw her as a bad ass. Like when you're in it, you're just trying to do the best you can. Like fig really thinks she's doing the best she can for these women. Like she really does in her twisted way. Um, and let's be honest, what happened when she left? Not great stuff, like she was working the system, but she was running that place better than he did.

Speaker 3:          42:57          You know? So just say it, just say the woman knew what she was doing. So, um, with this I think in reference to this piece of art, I just want to say I was so deeply inspired by Genji and all the writers and all the, all the female directors and, and the diversity of that cast and that also, um, I got to work in Shonda land after that. It was funny because I wrote like when we wrote our characters before we came to Amy and, um, when I was creating this character in my head, I had never played, I hadn't played a lawyer since like, you know, five law and order as ago. Um, which we did together. We didn't know we were in the same episode, didn't know each other. Uh, and um, so I w I was interested in playing sort of the opposite of fig and when we wrote her, like, and I knew that I wanted to be married to a woman and an African American woman because I wanted to create as many roles for women and women of Color in this movie.

Speaker 3:          44:12          And we didn't have an answer about what, when we first had the ideas of these characters, we didn't know how, how the movie would end. So we didn't know like would she catch the bad guy in the, I'm like, she was the one in the white hat. We didn't really have a sense of where we were going with it. Um, that's Amy's brilliance. And, um, and I, I back to sort of full circle how fig thinks she's doing that. You know, Samantha things still thinks she's going to catch the bad guys. She's going to go and do it a different way, but she really still wants to wear the white hat. Um, so I don't know if that answers your question at all.

Speaker 2:          44:54          Um, so we, we are running short on time, but I just want to make sure if you guys could summarize quickly one sentiment from this talk that you want to make sure that the audience has walk away from when they see the film on the big screen this weekend. What would it be? Fair. It is for women.

Speaker 3:          45:14          Your dollar. Don't let money be a dirty word.

Speaker 2:          45:19          So the film opens up this Friday in New York City and La, please, please, please go see this film. It's a very important statement and it's a great, great story. Um, I'd love to thank all the Googlers for joining the events team for kicking off a flawless event.

Speaker 1:          45:39          Thank you so much. Thank you.
