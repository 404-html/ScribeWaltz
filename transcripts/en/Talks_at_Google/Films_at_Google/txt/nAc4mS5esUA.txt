Speaker 2:          00:27          No.

Speaker 1:          00:28          Oh, welcome to Google.

Speaker 2:          00:35          Thank you. Oh, how are you reaching the floor? If I sit back,

Speaker 1:          00:43          are we all going to sit like that? Okay. There we go. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:48          Wow. You all left your desk. I'm sorry. You're right. You're right. Oh, you're a lady.

Speaker 2:          00:54          Okay. Okay. Oh, okay.

Speaker 3:          00:59          Oh Wow. My voice travels. It's fine.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Thank you. Okay, so thanks for being here. I can't see Kate. Mila. Well, other ways I look like this cause I'm sure I know it. It's okay. Okay, so we got to see the trailer, but can you tell us a little bit about the movie just so they

Speaker 3:          01:18          okay. I can. Okay. Um, it's two regular gal, best friends who become embroiled in an international espionage adventure for which they're not prepared. It's a good one liner.

Speaker 2:          01:31          Great.

Speaker 3:          01:32          Yeah, that's it. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:33          that's it.

Speaker 3:          01:35          Chaos ensues. High. Jinks ensues. Hilarity and shoes. Um, shoes and shoes issues. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:42          that's true. I did. I saw it yesterday. They're not lying. Um, okay. So the movie does a pretty good job of showcasing female characters that are allowed to be human, which is awesome because you don't want, right. Isn't that great? Because he don't get to see that a lot in comedy. So it's really nice. Yes. Yes, you're correct. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Um, so, uh, this is especially nice to see in comedy. Is that what drew you guys to the part? Um, is that kind of what you were thinking about throughout the filming of this movie?

Speaker 3:          02:16          Yes. I mean, I, yeah, no it did. I um, I wasn't, I do one film a year cause I have kids and family and so it limits the amount of work that I can do out of town. I was working on a different film. This project came along. I was like, I can't do it cause it would take me out for six months and would uproot my whole family. They're like, yes, but Kate Mckinnon's in it. And I was like l so I, I read the script and then, um, yeah. Uh, and what honestly drew me to it was the relationship between two best friends being incredibly grounded, incredibly genuine. Kate talks about this a lot, but in so many spy movies, the two characters have a fight. And that's a catalyst for like, they have a fight and you're like, but will they ever get back together and solve the world's problems? Right? So we don't have that. Like women or people in real life don't always fight. And so, you know, having that resolved doesn't always resolve other issues. So I really was drawn to the fact that our characters were simply friends on a crazy journey together. Yeah. So I uprooted the whole family for six months for that. So clearly, I too, I'm kind, I am so flattered that you did sweetie pie, because that's time with you. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          03:35          No, no, no. You guys. No. Like, you know, in a romantic comedy, in the best ones, right? You, you love to watch their sparkling banter and rapport. It's fun to watch two people on screen who liked to talk to each other, who get each other, whoever rhythm what we have out of rhythm. Yes. And so to watch a friendship that has that, and it's genuine and I daresay in real life as well.

Speaker 2:          04:07          Okay.

Speaker 3:          04:07          It's just a joy to watch people who take delight in each other. And that's what really drew me to this. And it felt so real and like my relationship with my best friend. And what would happen if we really got sucked into an international espionage adventure for which we were not prepared. Yes, correct. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:28          but so that's what I loved about the movie the most, is seeing a real friendship, especially between two women where they raise each other up and they're not, you know, the stereotypical like bad eighties movie where they're like being mean. Girls like that was really great to see. So you guys actually didn't know each other before the film, right? But became friends during it. So can you describe each other in three words?

Speaker 3:          04:54          SMART, funny, inspirational it up. Be Nice. Can I use the same ones? I'm sorry. Those are the ones I would use for you. And May I add sparkling five basis entrepreneurial spirit.

Speaker 1:          05:21          Yes. Nice. Okay.

Speaker 3:          05:23          Honestly, your entrepreneurial spirit in addition to your creative genius is very inspiring. Wow.

Speaker 1:          05:30          Lots of love going on here. That's great. Okay, so in the movie, the characters try to pick out the worst song out of a Jukebox, which I loved as a music fan. So what would you pick? I know so many. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          05:49          I like Pat's songs and I saw that pop music. I don't know. I do. I guys, I'm not that hip. Like it's like I go see indie bands and silver like and know, but there's a bad song. There's a bad song that you like though. Like I like it's all there. All the bad songs, no bad, but none of them stand the test of time. It's not like you go first and I'll think of a bad song. I don't know, like Chumba Walmart or something who let the dogs out. What is it? Timeless. But it is not a good sign and prescriptive for, for living.

Speaker 3:          06:26          You get knocked down and you have to get up again. You have to, what is, what other choice do you have? He drinks a whiskey drink. He drinks of vodka training. That's Trumbo amber, right? Yes, you're right. It's very philosophical. Thank you for bringing that. Now he sings the songs that remind them of the good times and the songs. There might've been the bad times. I know of the best. Oh, the lyric. See, it's about positivity. Okay. Can you think of a bathroom? I know one. I know one song that I think is a bad sign. I don't know the name of it. How's it? Yeah. I don't want to knock the yard right here. Oh, that's not the, are they usually don't write it anyway, so you're fine. Okay. No, no, no. Okay. But I've only ever heard one song that I was like, Oh wow, this is a bad, I like to Shizam that on the radio. In your car. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, so

Speaker 1:          07:29          the Great Jillian Anderson is in this movie and it appears that Kate and I have a mutual crush on her because she's awesome. So a Kate, at one point you dressed up a scholar from the x files, which is,

Speaker 3:          07:42          yeah. Awesome. And

Speaker 1:          07:44          you also made a video asking Jillian to call you. Um, it's, it's, it's viral. I'm not making this up. Um,

Speaker 3:          07:53          yes I did. Thanks to the magic of the Internet. Never disappear. Maybe we can get Google to erase it. Uh, so anybody, anyone, anyone raise their man help me out. No. Okay. So what's the weirdest thing a fan has done for you guys? There's lots of worst stuff. Have Kate on the Internet than that guys. You can just, you know, there's some good performances that you wouldn't let me see that are online. Right, right. You know, again, anyone in this room who would like to choose to just, you know, hack the code or whatever, I can do a little cleanup. Um, you know, talk to me. I'm sure I'll be forever grateful. What was the question? What's the apparently are here to delete stuff from the Internet? I have somebody leading something for Kate. Listen, I'm on train. I have lots of requests. What a weird things we've done for what it was. No, it wasn't.

Speaker 1:          09:01          That was kind of a cool, I think it was cool, weird thing you did as a fan of Jelly. Sure, sure. So what has been a weird thing a fan has done for you guys?

Speaker 3:          09:09          Lived in my house. I'm pretty weird. No Way. Yeah. For Real. That's it. Pretty good. What do you mean? Can't just give us a little blurb. Well, I going to come to tell the story then when came in uninvited while I was out of town. Wow. And decided to reside well in May used to be home because this person was a fan of yours. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It's, I'd say it's pretty weird. Wasn't just a random squatters, not like my cousin. No, it wasn't. No. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          09:44          Yeah. It's really good. It's dark and you go, okay. Okay. Okay, good. That's fine.

Speaker 3:          09:56          Um, for me, you know, Gosh, no people just do nice things. I got a lot of, um, self generated art about my cat, Nino because people seem to, maybe they've heard somewhere that I have a close, I'm very close relationship with my cat and I know your cat. Well, you call it unhealthy. I call it a marriage. I don't know what. Anyway, I've gotten a lot of art about Nino and that. I appreciate it. I love you. They paint, they paint, they knit, they make tee shirts. Do they know what your cat looks like? Oh yeah. Oh really? Google it. Thank you. I believe we're like in the headquarters. We're not, you're not, that's in San Francisco. But this is close to your clubs. Like an outpost for that

Speaker 2:          10:57          next question.

Speaker 1:          11:00          Oh, you guys are killing me already. Okay. And a good way. So both your characters have hidden skills in the movie, a, everything from trapeze to video games, shooting. Are you these things? Do you do it all and you're in your lives? And more importantly, do you have any hidden skills?

Speaker 3:          11:17          Um, I, I have no hidden skills. I have. Okay. I can make fettuccine. Is that a hidden skill? I roll my own pasta. Okay. When I have time. Yeah. Yeah, that works. What else? I played the cello.

Speaker 2:          11:38          Oh, me too. Yeah. Rotting in jail. Can your cat cow?

Speaker 3:          11:47          Sure. Oh no, he hates stringed instruments. Oh Gosh. When I pick up that chiller that he runs to the other room that's not play the guitar I do. I still, you musically inclined would be a good, what's not very hidden. I feel like people kind of know you're musically inclined. Yeah. Can you do like a back who, yeah, that's a good hidden, I'm not going to do right now, but no, I can't do, I can't do a backbend. Can you make very vulnerable position? Yeah, I'm going to say no, just some APP, but on the spot. I'm doing it back then. Great. Okay. So I got a couple more questions for you guys then. What's happening? Nothing. I'm just, I'm ready. I'm ready. I see you're ready. Yes, I see. Yeah. Okay. So if you weren't acting, what would you be doing? Carpentry. 10000% carpentry. Okay. Specifically perhaps cabinet making, but maybe just um, general carpentry or refinishing furniture. Also quite interested in plumbing and electric.

Speaker 2:          12:55          Cool.

Speaker 3:          12:57          She's on Hgtv all day. I love, I mean to see the fruits, the physical fruits, the wooden fruits of one's labor after the day I feel would be very satisfying. And having refinished a few pieces of furniture.

Speaker 2:          13:15          Okay.

Speaker 3:          13:16          Feel like I, um, I got the ball rolling so that's my alternate life that I may turn to at some point. We'll see. What have you made? I just refinished, you know, some cedar chests

Speaker 2:          13:29          and you

Speaker 3:          13:35          okay. You speak as though I have not, I have no idea. I was like this, I am aware of this. What, what, what would I be doing if not this? Yes. Cooking. Oh, so you're a good cook. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. What do you like to make everything. I'm a pretty good cook. Bake everything. No. Horrible Baker. Oh No, no, no, no. Like I burned toast. I don't bake, Cook. Like I cook really well all the time. I mean, I can bake, but just not desserts I guess I should say. Not like a cookie Baker. I have to say I'm the same. Yeah. You and I love to cook a lot. I love to cook. I can't bake a cookie. Like I literally didn't know that you could buy those premiums. Look, he's in there like this is, I can't do it either. I will burn it. Same. Yeah, I know why Mila. It's because you don't play by the rules. I don't, I also don't like recipes. Maybe neither follow direction. Who does that make it up? Feel it? It's like ideas. It's like recommendations. Yeah. Eh? Yeah. No. Yeah. No, I'm with it. Okay, so if you were stuck on a desert island. Yup. It's one of those questions,

Speaker 3:          14:42          but somehow could access only one John of movies. What would you pick? Romantic comedies. Horror.

Speaker 3:          14:53          I hate her. I hate it. You don't watch any movies? Scary movies. I'm no, like I genuinely get scared and then I can't sleep. And then my husband's like, this is the biggest mistake ever. Why did I let you watch it? I'm like a 12 year old. Like I was the last one you watched. I haven't. It's the shining. I don't know. I don't like, I really do get scared. Like I get very emotional and then I worry if there's a child in it. I'm like, well, where's its mother? Like I get very uncomfortable very quickly. I like, well, the child usually eats its mother, so if there's a child in the preview, I promise you I'm not seeing that movie. Like I am not kidding you. If they have like a child and the door opens and it's like, Huh? I'm like, nope, not happening. You love that. I find it very relaxing.

Speaker 2:          15:38          What's your favorite scary movie?

Speaker 3:          15:40          Horror movie? Yeah, the one that really laid me out on my parent's floor for a week and a half was the original omen with Gregory Peck. Ooh, very good. When he goes into that grave, spoiler alert and finds the dead Jackal.

Speaker 2:          15:53          Ooh,

Speaker 3:          15:55          wow. That's what you want is watch by yourself on a desert island. Well, you and I should not be deserted together, but did you hear her original answer was water and that's because she has an entrepreneurial spirit. She knows what she needs to survive and she also knows that she can sell it to the other people.

Speaker 2:          16:17          Right? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          16:20          For better movies. Yeah. All right, so,

Speaker 1:          16:28          so who or what inspired you to get into acting and comedy?

Speaker 3:          16:34          Oh, I don't know. I was nine. Kate, you're, I don't know. Maybe Lucille Ball. Actually I think you, you know what, maybe Lucille Ball, cause the first thing I saw when I came to the states was, um, was nick at night and I said watching a lot of that. So it was a lot of, I love Lucy Three's company. I'm talking about like Mary Tyler Moore, like a lot of old, like 60, 70 shows. Right. And predating that. And so I think, um, I would definitely say, uh, probably inspired by Lucille Ball. Well, cool. Yeah. Um, uh, for, for me it was just Saturday night live. Really just that and Mel Brooks movies, my house, it was all Melbourne cause all the time he had no choice. Yeah. Favorite Mel Brooks movies for both of you producers, young Frankenstein, young Frankenstein. Good choice. It's their choice. Yeah. Yeah. Which one? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          17:31          Okay. So, um, last question. I think we have time from, uh, one question and then we'll open up the floor to audience questions. And I'll throw this and be super awkward about this. What's that? It's our a microphone that we throw to the audience to ask.

Speaker 3:          17:46          Neat. Yeah. Yeah. They come up with a throw a ball microphones. So cool. So, um, so what is, what would be your dream role as an actress?

Speaker 2:          18:11          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          18:15          surely there are so many, there are so many badass women of history that I would love to inhabit persona wise and also wig wise. Um, I will say that my dream role in musical theater is Miss Hannigan for a new view who pries musical theater. But yeah, I know. I don't know. I have nothing. Okay. I can make something up, but I don't, you know, I don't know. I was the first thing that pops into your head like a rock star or someone?

Speaker 3:          18:54          No, no. A vox style. You wouldn't want to play a rockstar like who anyone like wants to fit everyone. I mean like [inaudible] anyone, anyone from Janis Joplin to, no, I should do, if you're portraying a rock star, you should have like at least rhythm. Can you not sing at all? Well, I mean, I like to think I can. Okay. Don't answer that one. I'll answer for us. No, I know you love me. And they know you're a very supportive friend. You're very nice. Why don't you sing no, and let us [inaudible] guys, here's the thing. Don't worry guys. I do a cartoon called family guy and for I have Google, wrong audience, wrong audience there too nerdy. There's, they're like, well, we don't solve algorithms. It's like that widow. But um, for 15 years I've been like, I'm not seeing it on your show. Mcfarlane made me sing 15 years ago, three lines and it took three hours and I was like, I'm not doing this for three months ago. They put me in a recording booth and I had to sing a whole thing of Oklahoma. So in a year you will hear meg and this is by the way, when, if ever you see this, should you ever want to remember? That's me trying. That's me trying to be good. That's all you need to know. I don't need to showcase it. Everybody will see it. It's a family guy. It's coming soon. Let me singing Oklahoma the best I can. Keep in mind. Well, I look out for that guy. I mean guys, it's brilliant. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          20:48          Okay, so who wants to ask the first question? Nobody. I'm going to, I'm going to throw this at you, so I don't hate anyone in the head. Can you hear me okay? Yes, I have the question. Familiar. I've heard tofor and Ashton, a few people talk about how great the 70 show it was making that, would you make a movie followup to that or get back into it in any way?

Speaker 3:          21:12          Yeah, I mean, yeah, it was great. Um, I feel like I'm too old to reprise a 16, but, um, would we, I, yeah, of course. I think we love it. Plus I met my husband on the show, so yeah, I think the show's great.

Speaker 2:          21:28          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          21:32          Another question from me. Do you still play games to find time for kids? Sorry, I know I spent, what is it feed? So it's a 20 to 24, 25. It took up a lot of my life and I would shoot movies and um, and you go on break, so you get, it's like a five minute break in between scenes. And I was like, I gotta go. And it'd be like on some rate and they're like, well you need to go back to set. And I was like shy, like I think it literally, it was just too much. It was unhealthy. It was just not healthy for me. Have a question. Raid What game weights? You know what I'm talking about Ray Ray? Um, like if you do first person shooter games or any like, like any of those games you can kind of pop in and out. But if you're doing a group game where it's, if you're not going through the story mode, you see what you started, then you are, then you are responsible for your group. And I lot of times it was either like a healer or whatever. Long story short that. Okay. What's the next question?

Speaker 3:          22:37          You do have secret skills. Wow.

Speaker 4:          22:41          So I have a question about your hidden talents that you were talking about. You were saying that you might take up woodworking. Have you ever happened to talk to Ron Swanson?

Speaker 3:          26:14          I saw her at a yogurt land and I freaked out the one on Sawtelle and Olympic. So maybe she hangs out there. What flavor would be having a toppings of joy?

Speaker 2:          26:28          I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 3:          26:35          Hello. Okay. So, um, during filming, did you have any funny moments that you had between each other? You spend a lot of time on set, any pranks or anything fun thing all day? Pranks? No, cause we're adults cause I'm in between takes that was nursing. So I would honestly to answer seriously, it was with my baby. But um, Paul book the genome and then Kate, we just Chitchat with me and then I would go into my little hole and pump in her, feed the baby. Like it was so not that exciting. I saw lots of bathrooms in, Oh, everywhere we were everywhere I pumped it was a bathroom and like a little sheet, you know. What'd you do? Banana peels all day. Every day. Yeah. I killed a few people. No, I'm kidding. No, I don't like, I don't like practical jokes. I don't either. That's not true. If, oh, you like pranks I not done to me. Right, right. No, I liked, I like done to other people. I'm a hub, a hub on the whole country, so I don't feel that I would ever do a prank just in case something horrible went wrong. Like if you drop a bucket of water on someone's head, what's to say that they're not looking up and they drown in the water then he got a lawsuit now Paul Book. Gl.

Speaker 3:          28:06          Sorry. Oh, sorry. So we got one more question. Make it a good one. Shoot. Too much pressure. Oh my goodness. Okay. Scenes on social media, it's like going on like super fast. Like nowadays, like in everything, it's there. Um, since you're a celebrity and you said like somebody was in your house, how do you manage that? Like in your personal life? Like, I dunno, like we shared everything like, oh, right here with Mila and we're having a great time. And then like a lot of people can't. I don't know like how to manage though. No, probably both. I don't have social media. Oh cool. Neither does Kate. So that is how we manage social media. Yeah. By not having a Google. So that's that. But to your point, um, the biggest problem that I have with people, um, that's a horrible statement. That's not what I meant to say.

Speaker 3:          29:09          Like in, in like as far as people taking photos and posting them is when I'm with my kids, I do ask them to post it after I leave only for security reasons. Why am I just don't post that you're here with me if my child in the background, I just don't want that posted like an hour later to your point. But I don't have, we don't have social media, but we've heard of this Google when we hear it's great and you guys have a Google phone, we hear that's lovely. And uh, you know, other great Google things. Yay. Eric Schmidt, right Larry Page. Guys I know words. I thank you. I use the search engine surrogates all the time. Google things. It's like a verb. We Google then all day. Um, this nice little girl. The girl. Describe the, that the woman standing back there. I had a question.

Speaker 3:          29:57          Favorite musical guests who spit on SNL since you've been on the cast? Good question. My goodness. You know what? You know what there was this week when, I don't know if you've heard of Adele. She came and she was that week that she also did, she filmed her live concert at Radio City Music Hall and we all got to go. And that was um, it's the biggest venue in the world. Maybe that's not correct, but it sure looks like the base, you know that I performed a radio city musical. What did you do? Finish your story and then I'll tell you anyway, she did, she sang her glorious voice, filled the valid hallowed halls and it was transcendent. What was your story? Well, cause you were talking about Radio City Music Hall and at one point Fema Guy, we did live readings all around. That's why, why parts and yet, and um, and so we performed all at different theaters and we sold out radio city music hall a couple of nights and I was like, you know what, if I'm going to stand on the stage and perform, I want to put on some tap shoes and then say I can perform at radio city music hall.

Speaker 3:          31:06          So I put it on tap shoes and tap my way down the stage once. And when look, I performed at Radio City Music Hall and that was like my big story that I can tell people now. Do you? I want it to say, but I performed at Radio City Music Hall, so you can tell him I'm a rock star in a real spirit, but not, well a failed rockstar who can't sing or town, but performing radio city music hall. That's all the time we have you guys. Thank you so much for joining us. [inaudible] on August 3rd it's really funny. Thank you everyone for being here.
