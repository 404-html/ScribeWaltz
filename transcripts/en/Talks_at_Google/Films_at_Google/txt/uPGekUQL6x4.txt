Speaker 1:          00:10          Thanks for having us say no problem. I'll do it. Well, I'm going to be doing good. Doing good. Good. So you both are twin brothers from Australia. Yup. Curious to know how you both that started in the film making industry. Uh, we say

Speaker 2:          00:26          jump the back fence into the film industry. Uh, we were in design for for quite a while. We were in motion graphics artists, uh, dealt with a lot of post production, visual effects, that kind of thing in the early two thousands and around the same time as each other around maybe six months from each other. We both jumped into directing live action at production companies for advertising commercials, that kind of thing.

Speaker 3:          00:48          Started to do commercials, music videos, you know, a lot of live action stuff. And in about 2007, uh, we moved to the states together to New York knowing that La might end up being further down the line. And so did a decade in New York doing mainly advertising, good spots for Google, but you know, a bunch of things. And it wasn't until about 2014 that we just felt a little restricted with the shorter form a narrative stuff. 30 seconds, 60 seconds, sometimes 15 seconds. Yeah. And felt like we wanted to stretch our legs a little bit. And that's where bag man, this short film that Ken is based on inspired by, uh, came about.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Great. And what kind of work did you guys do for Google now that you're here? A number

Speaker 2:          01:33          different things. There was some stuff for the phone originally and then that got canceled. There's like, there was a bunch of different things with a few different agencies. You guys got money so yeah. You guys

Speaker 1:          01:44          stop and scrap stuff. I'm sure you were aware of that a little bit. Um, and as brothers who created number of short films and just like your first spots together, um, how do you guys merge your ideas and influences together? I feel like brothers get on each others tails your look.

Speaker 2:          02:03          Yeah, it does for us as well. I mean a lot of people say I could never direct with my brother or sister. And Yeah, some people like that where the type of twins that have grown up liking the same stuff, having the same taste. Yeah. Uh, generally we've, you were in high school together, college together. We're in a brief stint in the army reserves together. We've done a whole range of stuff. So it just makes sense that we have the same

Speaker 3:          02:25          taste. Yeah, no, it works. It works well. I think going into high stress environments, uh, this isn't necessarily one of them, it's a bit casual. Uh, but you know, you're in a board room with studio executives or whatever and you're pitching a movie, you want your bro there to kind of backyard and it's nice to have someone to take over and you have a second to think for a minute. And yeah, no, it works really well.

Speaker 1:          02:49          It's great. And when you guys were looking at two potential careers, how did you guys come up with filmmaking? Did you guys have a moment in your earlier years that you thought filmmaking is the career

Speaker 2:          03:00          for me? Yeah. We've always been obsessed with movies. I'm sure you know, millions of people are. But I guess back in the 90s, whenever we could get our hands on a camera, uh, we would, you know, from high school, all that type of stuff. And we started making our own thing. You usually we were emulating stuff, so it was like watching trailers and they're making our own backyard version of trailers and all that kind of junk. Uh, early on as well.

Speaker 3:          03:25          We had a fascination with putting visuals to music and that led quite easily into the music videos. Totally. And just like creating emotions with very simple stories. Um, a lot of the time with no dialogue, which bag man became the lead character in the short, which you can check out online. Um, it doesn't say a word in the entire film. Right. And so carrying over that very simple aesthetic of minimalism and quietness into a studio feature film was interesting because you know, your lead character needs to say to him

Speaker 2:          03:59          and stuff at times. Great. And speaking of which, tell us a little more about kin, uh, the trailer we just saw. Yeah. Well look, it's a, it's the last movie of the summer. So we're transitioning into movies that are maybe a little, hopefully smarter, uh, awards fair, things like that. Um, I think this movie has a taste of both. It's, it's got some big Saifai concepts, stuff in it as you can see from the trailer. Uh, but it's not your traditional Scifi. It's also got a much more of an influence with character and a story about brothers. We figured out pretty quickly when we wanted to turn bag man into a longer form project that, uh, we really needed to dive deeper. And so we didn't want to be handcuffed by the things that were in the short necessarily. So we were, we felt like we were free to change certain things and adapt and things. And so we figured out it's about family and then specifically about a very unconventional brother unit. And what does that look like? Like are you only brothers if, if, if it's blood, uh, is it circumstance and the things that you go through trauma, like what brings brothers together? So that's really what the movie's about. Um, essentially this kid finds a giant crazy alien space rifle and that does not belong in this movie. But that's the challenge to try to make it all feel as grounded and realistic as possible.

Speaker 3:          05:21          The other half of that sort of genre tone with the Scifi is a much more sort of indie spirited, you know, character drama. Uh, there is elements of crime stuff in there. There's a coming of age road trip. It's really multiple things. And what turned us on is just things that are harder to define. You know, coming from advertising is very easy to get put in a box and we early on became the visual effects guys and you've got, you know, transforming cars and houses and rooms and in their fun stuff and they generally have big budgets. Um, but at the of the day we have influences from, you know, more modern, gritty crime dramas like out of out of the furnace or, or place beyond the pines or mud or you know, these more sort of quiet, a sophisticated sort of filmmaking. And it's the partnership of those two with Scifi that makes this really unique.

Speaker 2:          06:16          That's great. I know we saw James Franco in that film talk a sub and more about the actor and actress selection. How you guys decided who goes in this film. Well you basically do a top five list for every role and there was months of discussion from outside of just who's right for one thing you definitely don't want to do is write the screenplay thinking of an actor, horrible idea because you'll always disappoint yourself. But with this top five lists you go through and you're like, okay, who are we going to go out to? And the casting process can be really frustrating because you've got to go one at a time. We're not auditioning when I bring it all these giant act as like Dennis Quaid into a room and getting him to do his lines. It's not the way it works. So you go out one by one to these people and you wait for them to say they're available or they're interested or whatever it may be.

Speaker 2:          07:02          And we were really lucky to team up with 21 laps. The guys who made stranger things, uh, which wasn't made when we joined up with them. We just knew of this Netflix show though doing on the side. And I said they do really good stuff and they can easily get on a phone and say, James, uh, these, these are really good guys. They've got a great script and now that they haven't done a movie before, try it. Trust me, watch this short film and get back to us. So, uh, we were really lucky. Zooey was out number one and we actually got it, which is kind of incredible. Uh, she has this sense of cool that you can't fake a, and she, yeah, she's Kinda perfect for the role.

Speaker 3:          07:41          And then James came up, uh, through Shawn Levy, one of the producers, and we'd always liked the more sort of spring breakers side of, of his career. And He loves playing with darker characters that have a very sort of in your face. Charisma makes you uncomfortable. It makes you not know whether you would need to laugh or sort of pull back in your seat. And he plays a character. I A mallet wearing a Cosby sweater wearing a gun runner in this and he's one of those characters that kind of is pretty terrifying but also has some very comedic moments. It's, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          08:14          Uh, the other, the two brothers, I mean it's about them. Uh, the older guys, Jack Reynor, he's an Irish actor, has actually quite a dense Irish accent in, in real life. He was in a bunch of indie our cinema movies like, um, glass land with, uh, Toni Collette, what Richard did by Lenny Abramson. He was even in a giant transformers movie, which, um, I'm pretty sure he doesn't want to be in again. Uh, and so maybe for his house though. Yeah, probably. We wanted someone that you might have seen before and he was in Sing Street, one of our favorite, he's a great character in sing street. Um, thanks Rick Fan. Yup. Right here in the red. Uh, so we, we put someone in that lead role that you might know, but you're not like, you really know. I think Jake Gyllenhaal and that role might what might've worked as well because you want to learn who these two brothers are without kind of being clouded by something. And then the lead kid, we auditioned heavily for this and it was a very difficult role to find someone who was NCLR and emotionally mature and someone who could stand up in a room full of adults and feel like they belong and isn't trying to like sing and dance for you the entire time.

Speaker 3:          09:25          And this is his first movie. Like we, yeah, we had nothing to go off other than an audition tape, a self tape from home on a phone. And uh, we just really were impressed with the fact that he didn't come out trying to impress us. He had the confidence to kind of pull back and be very subtle with it all. And yeah, he, he's, he's brilliant. It's his movie. That's awesome.

Speaker 2:          09:47          And as you guys are working with these actors and actresses, how are you guys working with each other on set?

Speaker 3:          09:54          Well, I think rule number one is we want to try to not contradict each other. That's, that's, that's not rule number one. Yeah. I mean the last thing you want is to be sitting at the monitor and you have an idea and you run up and you tell them something and then Josh has an idea and run up and says the exact opposite nightmare material. Um, but yeah, we, we 50, 50 everything, we have the same tastes like Josh said. So we trust each other. There's mutual respect there and, okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's awesome.

Speaker 2:          10:24          And as we're coming up kind of on time here, um, what's next for you guys? What are you guys thinking about with your next move? We have a really killer science-based TV show that we're looking at right now. We're developing with the writer of arrival. Um, and it's going to be killer. You guys are actually gonna really like it. Uh, hopefully that's something that comes out and a premium channel at some point. We're pitching it out at the end of the year, but then just a couple of movies and different things. We,

Speaker 3:          10:50          we certainly don't want to, like I said before, get put, sort of put in a box. We like telling interesting stories and unique stories. Uh, this, we're just lucky that this first one is very personal to us and came from something that we did as a short film. So yeah, we're really,

Speaker 2:          11:07          I'm interested just as much to find out what's next. Um, you, the movie hasn't come out yet, so hopefully it changes things up. It's hard to know. That's great. And we want to open it up to Q and a from the audience. So if anyone has a question, feel free to walk up to the mic. Yeah, we'll tell you what's up, man. What's your name? Nelson. What's up Nelson? Um, first of all, I'm really excited because I love Carrie coon. She's, she's great man. I'm also more gray, so I think they did a great question. Yeah, I know they've done a soundtrack for this French show that I really love. Was it working in sort of the, the process of working with a band like Mogwai to sort of say, look, we got Mogwai stories for days there. They're really, really cool. It's one of our favorite bands.

Speaker 2:          11:48          Um, we knew at the very beginning that we wanted to go with a band on this and not a traditional composer just to have a different life for the music so that it could come out in an album and have its own fan base. Let's be honest. It was a selfish endeavor. Yeah. Hell yeah. You want to hold a vinyl in your hand? Definitely. And so we did a playlist that went for about 13 hours. That was from bag men and then we transferred over to the movie and we just kept adding to it and we gave it to the rider to listen to. So it was just kind of set the tone. Yup. And there was a lot of Mogwai in it and we realized one day, why don't we just ask Mogwai. So we did. And they get offered really big stuff all the time.

Speaker 2:          12:24          He said, and they turn it down like big Hollywood movies and they'd never done a movie before. Like you said, they only done a French TV show and a bunch of docs and where they are on the phone and they say, yeah, we really emotionally, emotionally connected to you as screenplay and we'd love to do your first movie. And we were just like, oh. And we went on mute and then it was like, they're cool guys and we've got to go to Glasgow and, and sit in with this in the studio with them. And in a sense like help produce one of our favorite McGuire. I'm going to switch like when does that ever happen? Yeah. Now their locker leasing not only the soundtrack that the score soundtrack, but they're going to, well they have, uh, taken cues and stretch them out into full length studio song.

Speaker 2:          13:08          So it's, it's a Mogwai I'll cold call again. It's ridiculous. And you should pick it up cause it's a really solid album. Comes out of the day a, the movie drop. So August 31st I'm excited to hear that. Um, and then one last question is, uh, so you were mentioning how this has a more, you know, family centric and I really love that about these newer Scifi movies like arrivals or midnight special if you've seen it. Yeah, absolutely. I can loop or even any thoughts of great references continuing like exploring that SciFinder you have this TV show that's hopefully going to come out or are you into other genres that you have? It definitely man. Like John was saying before, we don't like being boxed as directors. It's kind of really limiting. So yeah, we like all kinds of film and that there's so many different references in this from like 80 to mud to all the way upstream district nine to like, it's moonlight meets district nine in a weird way.

Speaker 2:          13:59          There's so many different things going on and that's just purely because we like a lot of different movies and, and, and why can't they all be in white? Why can't they all sit in the one film where you telling me you go and see it? And maybe they don't, but we think they do. Uh, so when it comes to the stuff that we want to do in the future, yeah, I think so. [inaudible] is a part of it, but we're also interested in, in other things. I mean, the movie that Damien Chazelle is looking at right now about, um, the mood killer, man, we'd love to do something like that. So who knows? 6,000. No, appreciate it.

Speaker 1:          14:31          Hi. Hey, how are you? Hi. Origin Harris. Found Australian Australia. Okay. Maybe a little bit more. Maybe more than us. He goes, I've lived here 17 years. So who knows? Try Sound. Um, no. First I just want to ask you and nothing super technical, but I'm really very proud to see Australians on stage ever. Thank you. They kick ass work. I it, that's the first thing. And Americans, everybody else. But we're not talking about them right now. Between you and I. Well, no, but I'm just very curious about, you know, the life that you had in Australia and obviously you were involved in this kind of stuff or at least burgeoning into this stuff when you're in Australia. Um, what kind of different perspective do you think it does give you coming from Australia and you know, there's a lot of Australians in la and

Speaker 3:          15:15          sure there is. It was part of the reason we moved to New York to be honest. Um, look, we have always felt like we are a little bit of an outsider coming into the industry and coming through advertising as well. We have a different perspective on certain things, um, certainly aspects of the film quite timely as well. Um, and so yeah, we have it. We have a unique perspective. I think that's

Speaker 2:          15:41          always helped. What do you think? Um, in Australia we worked mostly music, video and advertising. Um, so we didn't really have a chance to dive into the Australian film industry per se. I think they're doing some super respectful staff. Um, I think it's small and I think it's, um, there's a ceiling on it in Hawaii. So, so if you want to tell a really big story, you've kind of got to bring everything else down to make it work for the money. And that's disappointing or limiting. It's limiting. Um, so I, I do think a lot of people get up and move and obviously London and La are two massive options. I think there's a shit ton of talent coming out of Australia and, and that's why we have a lot of actors and maybe Americans don't even know half of them are Australian. But like there's a lot that are doing really, really good stuff. Yeah, I dunno. I don't think we could have made this movie in Australia, which is disappointing in some ways. But then the way we've approached it by putting the two tones together, I think is very Australian. So I dunno, I'm actually really interested in how it goes down there and what the response would be because we're, we're trying to do some promotion with over there and hopefully people see it. Oh Man. Do it pimp away.

Speaker 1:          16:56          Good luck. Thank you. Appreciate that. Paris. Thank you. Paris.

Speaker 2:          17:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:02          Hello. Hey, how are good? How are you? Where's your name? Susan. Hey, nice to meet you. Um, from this far away, um, my question is about the diversity of the cast and how intentional that may or may not have been and if we can expect to see more of that in your work.

Speaker 3:          17:17          For sure. I mean, again, sort of stepping into America and seeing a lot of the conversation that's happening, uh, in one way is super encouraging because things are changing in another way. It's kind of disappointing that we're even talking about this. And so this is just us playing our part. I mean, it's more interesting to us to have a story about a young African American lead that is finding a MacGuffin from a Scifi movie. And we just don't see that. I mean, said that awhile ago, white kids had been fine in alien spice space rifles for far too long. Let's mix it up a little bit. So, yeah,

Speaker 2:          17:57          so, so it's two things. The first is it's just more interesting as a filmmaker because you want to dive into something that feels different and unique. Uh, and on the other side, um, you know, we made a short, we lived in New York and we said it in Harlem and, and we will definitely going to keep that vibe when we moved over to make the movie. Uh, it's really, really refreshing and

Speaker 4:          18:21          okay,

Speaker 3:          18:21          really delightful to see the reactions from young black teens when they see this movie to be honest and representation is super important. And seeing themselves up on the screen and seeing how this character's arc, uh, evolves is awesome and we've had some great responses.

Speaker 2:          18:36          Thank you Beth. Appreciate it. One more question here. Awesome. Last one. I guess I'm Chris, what's up Chris? I'm curious about, so I spent a couple of years of my twenties in attempting to be a screenwriter. Uh, and I'm curious that when you guys were trying to make the leap into first feature film and one of the struggles that I had as a Scifi writer was how do you, how do you determine like, you know, the story you want to, right? How big do you make it based on, you know, that budget's going to be hard to come by. Like you want to tell you the right way, but then the more cool scenes you pack in, the more dollars start to grow. He's a really cool question. Um, I feel like coming from visual effects really helped us with that. We know what things cost and so we've restrained ourselves. That's probably the right word, restricted ourselves when we have told stories for the last 15 years because we know where it gets a little dodgy because you're like, I don't, I can't afford this and we don't want to be doing the scene that we can't afford in a really bad way. So this movie is a really good example of that where we do some big things in this and, but

Speaker 4:          19:47          all right,

Speaker 2:          19:48          nothing is ridiculous. Nothing gets to the point where you're like, well, wow, they spent billions of dollars and an

Speaker 3:          19:55          [inaudible] is not one green screen in this movie. It's all very practical. Props were made, environments we created, sets were built. We're dealing with a young 14 year old actor that's never been in a movie. We had to make it as realistic as we could for him. So that was one reason, but another is just, we've always been very responsible directors in a weird way. I don't know if that's a thing to brag about. It could be a batch coming from advertising you, you know, like what the budget is and you know what you can afford, you know, what things cost. So, you know, we just started putting ourselves out there to fail.

Speaker 2:          20:28          Well, we had a lot of conversations specifically on this movie about how far do we go? And, and I think this is the anti giant movie in a way because you're getting all of that stuff still, but we're making you care about it. Um, we're starting slow and we're, and we're, and we're introducing to these characters and the, and it takes a little bit before the gun comes out and gets fired. And we're like, obviously that's part of tightening the noose intention and all that stuff. Expectation. But then we're also, we're never going to that place where you'll start rolling your eyes and you're like, all right, that just got really silly. And I think that's just done on purpose. We want it to feel real world. And the Buzzword is grounded Psi Phi man. So like keep that shit grounded. Thanks guys. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:14          Well thank you guys for coming by our office. Thanks to Evan has visited Jonathan Jazz's a Google page. Go to Google them a twin.work. Um, they also Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and go check out Ken. Next week we're around. Yeah.
