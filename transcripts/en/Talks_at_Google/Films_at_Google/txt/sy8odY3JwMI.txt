Speaker 3:          00:46          Awesome guys. Thank you for coming to Google. I think this is your first time here for trade. It is. Yes. Yes. First Time, I know you've done a Google plus hangout if, I don't know if you've actually done it on our campus. So welcome. I have not and I'm very excited to be here and uh, we're excited to have you. And for those Googlers who didn't know right before we came in, Tyler Teraji and lyric actually popped into a coding class that was happening right over here with young women's leadership academy. So we had about a dozen young ladies from Queens who, uh, I think they were doing some, uh, VR coding and they just popped in. So all that screaming, yes,

Speaker 1:          01:26          I heard it wasn't me. It was, no, it was where you William? Yes. I wish. Anyway, thank you guys. So I'm sorry. I, let me just give me right now guys. I'm tired and I'm stupid when I'm tired. So this and this may go straight silly. Just, just no, I'm just be prepared. I read the disclaimer, the disclaimer. Okay. All right. All right. I'm ready. And this is not being filmed at all, so, okay, good. Good, good. All right. You won't take those off now.

Speaker 3:          02:06          So acrimony, uh, the name kind of says it all if you know what the definition is. And I was about to say, so, uh, bitterness, ranker, anger, anger, rage, Alice. I didn't know what the definition was. Oh, I'd literally, I'd written this script and I was like, I got to find a title for it. And I was watching, he was watching CNN and somebody was describing our president

Speaker 1:          02:30          and you were like, and they said, it's acrimonious. I said, what is that word into this angle? That's the title of the movie theaters March 30. Well, you answered my first question. How did you edited you come up with the, I already knew you were going there. There you go. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:48          Um, but this movie is, is a little bit of a departure from what you're known for your, you're a worldwide brand known for making movies, um, that are humorous

Speaker 4:          03:00          and dramatic and watch it be careful. Yeah. But, but this is a thriller. Yeah, no, it's, it's a big departure for me. After doing gone girl and working with David Fincher and seeing his brilliance and, and he would watch he and Ben Affleck and on the brakes talk about cameras and lighting and shots and this Hitchcock kind of filled that they wanted and they want to make sure that the, the way the light falls, I'm like, what the hell are they talking about? So I really started paying attention to it. And then when I saw gone girl come together, I said, I want to do something like this. So I started, I had this idea for a while and I, and I started riding again. And of course there was only one person who could play Melinda. And that's to Razi p. So did you, did you write the role of Belinda with Taraji and mine? Merlin, Linda, Linda, sorry. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          03:48          that Belinda's for someone else that's called by. Oh my God,

Speaker 4:          03:59          yes. But no, totally wrote it with her in mind because you know, when I start writing a few of the scenes, what happens is the characters start, they speak to me that I could, I could hear them as I'm, as I'm typing. And then pretty soon I started to see a face and I, the first face I saw was hers.

Speaker 5:          04:14          And then he calls me and I'm like in the middle of filming and by, Yep. I'm not done until months later. So I'm like, sure, I'll do it. My high eight it says, he said, no, no.

Speaker 4:          04:24          Yeah cause nobody, let me tell you something. Nobody does a film while they're shooting their television shows because you don't have the time. It's, it's 1618 hours a day, six, seven days a week sometimes. So He'd some crazy schedule. But uh, for some reason she said yes.

Speaker 5:          04:38          Well cause you wouldn't go away. You wouldn't take no for an answer because I was, I tried to give him every excuse. I was like, Tyler, I am cookie. I was like, how do I di program my instrument being cookie? He was like, he let me finish. He was like, okay, you've been living with cookie for three years now and you got that. You can come and do this, and I was like, okay. I was so nervous and scared and that's why I did it because if it doesn't scare me then I'm not going to change. I'm not going to transform it anyway, so I don't do roles that don't really scare me. Not unless the check is good.

Speaker 4:          05:21          First scene that we shot, it was cookie, the first thing, the very first and I pulled you aside and said, nope, that's cocky. What was the first scene? It didn't make it in the movie. It's the trashcan where you come out and you went to the trashcan and the and the his, his, his, his ideas in the trashcan. He dropped a cigarette ash on it. He's like, thank you lord that she is open. Then you get in the car here

Speaker 5:          05:41          dry. Oh, how you cut that? Cause that was because that was cooking. Well you call me in the middle of the vehicle, you said no, no, no, but no, no, no. I say that to say that. So I say that to say this. She's

Speaker 4:          05:54          like, you know what, you right. You right now watch this. She comes

Speaker 3:          05:58          back and she's this, she's Melinda. Everything, the boys, the boys, the eyes that this the, the way this woman looks up at, at it, at him, it's chilling. Man. It was crazy though. It's true. And I was looking at that, that character, while I have been broken bleeding and I was, I was kind of shocked. I, I mean you, you played strong characters, tough characters. Um, I have get to see you play a character like this and it seemed like it was, it was kind of scary. I mean it was definitely scary.

Speaker 5:          06:31          I've been waiting for this APP ever since I seen fatal attraction. I been gunning for a character like this and it was great because I'm always playing the righteous female, you know, she's really always the moral compass, you know, to stand up kind of woman's strong and pow, I wanted to do this because she's that. But in another light, right? He's made up this story and um, I mean, we've all been there. You know, you man get a tax. It's a simple tax. It could be from a cousin, you know, maybe he didn't see the cousin and 10 years, I don't know. But we will take that and run with a child. It says his woman, he's been dating, but he has a whole nother family out. I don't know about, every woman in here is not agreeing with you talked about, I will take something and we're all capable of it, but then there's that one. We're capable because then there's that one part of you that's the rational where you got to go, okay, this is stupid. Like I can't, this didn't, this is not happening. Well, Melinda didn't listen to that voice. Right. She just took her story and ran with it.

Speaker 3:          07:35          Well. Right. I mean, she, she's pure rage. And as I remember, if I remember correctly, very early on in the movie as Melinda's talking about herself, she says, my rage is like this discreet thing. It's like something that's separate and apart from, yeah. Um, which is kind of amazing and I want to come to come back to that because you touch upon mental health just a little bit in the movie. And I wanted to explore that more, but, uh, I wanted to get more into the character of Melinda and then go to go to lyric because, um, the, the, the character seems to be off to save, to save the, to say the least. Did you, and you talked about your, you know, what you did to build out that character, basically. Fan, you're off.

Speaker 5:          08:29          It was Tyler. That's what you think about it.

Speaker 3:          08:34          But she's also, she, she's broke and she's, and she's hurting. So his, through his lyrics are, so there's, there's a lot there, but I wanted to know how you, how you gotten into that camera.

Speaker 5:          08:44          Well, I mean, we've all had a broken heart. If you haven't, you haven't loved. But you know, I've had those moments where I had to talk myself out of scratching up a car or throwing a brick through. Come on. You know when your heart is hurting, you want that person hurt. People hurt people. Right? So if you hurt me, my natural reaction is to get you back. Right? So, but then you have to grow up and you have to realize that jail is not for me. So I'm gonna keep driving and pretend like I don't see the car. You know, I'm not. So this was a role for me to act out all of those things I thought about and wanted to do and not go to jail, including show up with an ax. But yeah. Good. Yeah. Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          09:30          exactly. So, so

Speaker 5:          09:33          I had, this hair is driving me crazy. I'm so sorry. Okay. This is what I did with on set. We'll be in a serious thing. She'll be like, and if you do that again, what the hell is going on with his hair? Right here is what we dealt with all the time. All the time. Be looking at me like sweet. Why? Because the people, I have a weird way of operating like working, you know you have act is where you have to be quiet. You can't move you right there. Sorry. She on her phone. I don't really like that and I could add in the middle of a damn circus. I mean literally and I'll do these scenes where I'm just like, and everybody's like tip toeing around me and then they'll, they'll cut and I'm like, yeah. So anyway, tower last night, various stuff. Was that off putting lyric, we're working working that way or you do you work a different way? It's very calm. Just no, this is all going to be proud to change. It's about to get real calm. Real leading man. Real sexy. Right. Where the peanut gallery also asking me a question. Go ahead. I forgot the question.

Speaker 5:          10:49          Was this your first time acting with Teraji? It was. And then how was that?

Speaker 6:          10:57          It was a great experience. Um, I never thought that this moment and this opportunity would be in my career. So it was something that was a surreal, still beside myself a year later. So I'm working with, with Toronto was great because I know from seeing her own empire I've seen on our work before. Yeah. I was just like, okay, I got to come prepared. I gotta make sure that, um, didn't, I didn't know she was that intense. I had no idea. She was intense. I, I like to believe that her characters are different than the person, so I didn't think of her as cookie. But, um, the professionalism that, uh, that she brought to the set was second to none. And um, I came prepared. I'm always prepared. I like to believe that. But then when I saw the level of professionalism after one could think, you know, you could just relax

Speaker 3:          11:54          because I've made it, you know, got a big show, you know, you could come on and just like stop a set because you know that one hair is out of place, not the thing, but it was never that. It was like, like what you see is what it is. Yeah. I was very thankful, but I know really I your check?

Speaker 5:          12:09          No, no,

Speaker 3:          12:12          we didn't really get a lot of time together because it was so fast. She didn't want to spend time. She um, there was a disclaimer to not spend any time. Well no, that's kind of remarkable though because while the, the, the movie sidle characters you really, that's about the relationship between your character. Robert, fix this cause this is called Virgo for you. I also know you're a, you're a stickler for details. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          12:38          Yeah. He, I'm going to say this. I don't know where you were in the question, but I just have to begin my presentation. I never, I had never met lyric before. I didn't know. And I trust Tyler. So he says this guy's great. So of course I Google and I can call my guy from finance them. Okay. But they know, you know, cause it's all about a chemistry. You know the great thing about this is that you know, whether the chemistry was there or not, it was okay because we really didn't like each other for the part of the film that we started. You know, cause they start with the kids first plank us and then we grow up. So by the time we're, we come in as ourselves and the character in a movie, we don't like each other. Like the, the relationship has fallen apart.

Speaker 7:          13:21          So I wasn't like, I, you know, the chemistry didn't really have to be there as if we were madly in love, but it still helps to show a pass that there was, you can see the chemistry used to be there something. Right. And so when I met him, I remember the first thing we did for me is the eyes and his eyes are so like he was so vulnerable. Yeah. Something in his eyes so strong, but yet he could break in any moment and that's where that character was. And not just as like Tyler where to find him a year later I look up and he everywhere. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          14:00          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          14:02          Fortunate to lay eyes on some amazing talent before they, before they hit. And he's definitely one of those things. And I think that its features going to be so amazing because, because he is an incredible actor. He is. Just what he brings in the vulnerability and I mean he's leading man material. Yeah, absolutely. And unfortunately I don't see a lot of bad anymore, especially in men of color, so, but he is definitely that. And if, and I can tell you when you're, when we're going down casting, trying to cast a movie and you start looking for the leading man that lit up, I lead a man of color. That list is really short, really short. So he definitely should be on that list.

Speaker 5:          14:36          My checks don't have them while I can I, can I tell you my favorite part?

Speaker 3:          14:45          Sure. [inaudible] is the, for the, the second I think is a second scene or something when she's in with a therapist,

Speaker 4:          14:52          there's a camera move that I did that, that it's just nothing special. It's just on low on a track and it just pushes in on her. And it's about a four minute scene that I didn't want to cut. I didn't want to edit it at all. I want it to be raw so people can see the brilliance in this woman. I mean, I, so that scene is uncut. She's sitting, she's sitting there on the sofa doing this long monologue and she sets up the whole movie. But it shows you how brilliant, what, what, how broken she has is as an actor. It's incredible. It's incredible. And I love it that way on purpose. So be nerve wracking, hopefully that, that scene, it's so sad.

Speaker 7:          15:25          Why you scared the hell out of nights. It scared me when she saw it back to your site because it's like, who is that? I'm like, well, I'm gonna tell you why as an actress doing television is scared me because we didn't cut. Right. He was like, no, I need this all in one take. And we only had for three days to do it. It doesn't hold my whole part of the film. We shot in four days. The whole movie was done in eight days. We have to protect this man because no, seriously, because he can, he can read a lot of jobs. Yes. He's a lot of people don't, well, you know, let's just set up, we don't want miss the ferry to come. I'm missing, but I do do. I'll go out there. There will be a lot of haters. No, I won't because he's getting, I mean, you know, so many people think their jobs are important, but you know, we won't go there. Let's keep talking about the movie. But um, so I was so nervous because I had so much dialogue to say and I didn't have the luxury of cut. Oh, can I do, can we just pick it up from here? And it was like he needed all of that dialogue in one take, but that's when that theater training came in. Yeah. Because I wanted the audience to see when you

Speaker 4:          16:36          throw an accurate or role and you don't cut, you don't cut like work for those of you on our cutters, you jump to a close up or you jumped to a side shot. He jumped into the chat. It's one shot pushing in on her as she delivers. Like it's chilling. And if you don't know who Melinda is in that moment at the beginning of the movie, you won't. Yeah. The, the other character though, Robert, I said to till lyric as we were coming in and I said, I actually thought that character that you wrote was the most complicated one because it's, it's through his character that you shift perspective. And that's the really, one of the great things about the movie is because you think it's this movie about, you know, trust and betrayal and you know, there's this, you know, steadfast woman who is yet this unfaithful man and this is revenge.

Speaker 4:          17:23          And actually it's a different story. It's a different, because if you notice in the beginning of the movie, it's told, we can't tell them the room has this room scene. I don't think that they have. So you're trying not to no, no, no. I just started to set it up though in the beginning of the movie, she, she is telling the story from our point of view, right? So you're in it from her point of view and then there's a shift where you go, wait a minute, wait, there's this. Right? What is she saying? Did that really happen? And was that true? And you realize that as you're watching the film, that there are two perspectives to this is like in every relationship that goes bad, there's her side and there's his side or there's his side, his side, her side, her side. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          17:59          And then the, and then there's the truth. And I, and this was born out of it,

Speaker 4:          18:03          out of me counseling a lot of friends who have gone through things and I would sit down with them and that I would be friends with him or friends with her. And then we'd sit down and have a conversation, uh, separately. And they saw two different moments that both the tore them apart. And I was like, how could this be that? And I would drive, I remember really trying to get this one person to see this other side of it. And she couldn't, she would not allow it because what it would mean is that she would have to take responsibility in her own and what she did wrong. So yeah. Yeah. Right. That was my, there were a few Aha moments and that was definitely an Aha, Aha moment when it switched perspectives.

Speaker 1:          18:39          And it's so easy how we're so quick to jump on the girl's side because y'all do that though. Do that. You'll get all your girlfriends and you get your, you get your girl nation to come up against. He did it because he wrote a movie like that. There's always another side. Just just I, I,

Speaker 4:          19:04          I'm pretty good about taking a moment and stepping back and like even when I can remove the emotion within myself, I'm be like, okay, let me just look at this from both sides because a lot of times people run out on relationships that could have, could have been really, really good, but they couldn't remove themselves from the middle of the emotion. If you can take yourself out of it and step back for a minute and go, okay, maybe I could have handled this better or maybe I could have did this, but first thing you ask yourself is, what did I do wrong? Own your own stuff first and then you can work on fixing it.

Speaker 1:          19:36          Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, come, come back. I have never heard anybody say they were going along to best. Fascinating goal. That's the new movement. Be a synagogue, Girls Bill Gurley. Agrimonia know how to spell that. You don't understand lyric lyric looking just like I said. Okay. Cause I moved really fast but he came here but the camera Andy does. Okay. And everybody get ob. It makes her gut is right brain Raylynn's okay, let's go

Speaker 4:          20:41          lyrical code when you go. I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          20:49          Maybe I'm sorry, I need to explain cause I'm the director. Let me explain to you what, I'm sorry. I just thought you got it. But yeah, yeah, I you do them out of sequence also. Right? So yeah, this was, this was the, I'm sorry

Speaker 7:          21:01          I have to say this, we have totally taken over your,

Speaker 1:          21:05          I know I did my homework. I was watching like youtube clips in like all sorts of things. Anyway. It's all right. Wait,

Speaker 7:          21:19          Fillmore is, despite saying he shows up and all hell breaks loose. Me and my sisters jump is a yes.

Speaker 1:          21:27          But it was

Speaker 7:          21:28          crazy because he had Tyler again, his brilliance, he had all of these cameras set up to get all of the angles. So this cut out six, six cameras. So we had the crane shoddy out of somebody with a steady cam on the track. There were cameras everywhere. This is unheard of and a feature. You do it for five, 10 times to get all of those angles. We did it. What two, three, two takes at the most. Um, and what he would do, we would start the fight. So if I got body hair

Speaker 6:          21:57          wasn't, it wasn't supposed to be a fight. Yeah, it wasn't enough.

Speaker 1:          22:00          It ended up [inaudible] high was because he never read that in the script. I don't know.

Speaker 6:          22:07          It wasn't, it wasn't a fight. It was, it was a disagreement.

Speaker 1:          22:13          And then

Speaker 6:          22:15          after, after I tell her what's happening, I leave to go about my business and she decided that it's not going to go like that. It's going to be a fight. And it ended up on the front lawn of the house. The scene is supposed to be in the house.

Speaker 1:          22:31          Well, that scene and I thought like, I'm like, wow, that's real. That's, but this is no, this, this is one of those moments where I didn't fill him in. It was not filled in. We talked about it, but that's what, I'm sorry. We were all in the same way. That's one of my questions was how much did you improv? And that wasn't clear. It was good though. It was. So that's what I enjoyed about his dad to beat his ass on the first day and all that. And I would say, I would say hold and they will stop right where they are. Why does paypal and we would have to freeze like that and he was like answering or you have to set the cameras up, but it, it works well and it keeps, it keeps the actors in the moment. Yeah. And me being an actor, I want to be in the moment. I want to, I didn't want, I don't want to sit and do 5,000 takes of something and I don't want to go and get it in. It can be two, three created a models I'd be on a Pallette is terrible. You have created it. Is

Speaker 6:          23:35          that it? That is a bit of sweet of it. After you do something like that and you show up on set, yeah. You're like, right. You know it's go. Yeah. Cause we were sitting, we were doing

Speaker 4:          23:46          15 pages a day on the, on the actual recording, 15 pages a day or you don't understand what that means. You have to understand what they shoot on rate on a regular, a Hollywood picture. They've shoot two pages that they at the most, sometimes three. If they get to three or four, they think they're going really fast. And we were at 1516 pages a day. So yeah. Yeah. But that's how you normally work, the efficiency of your production. Yeah. It's kind of astounding. Couldn't do. You could do a television series and a day. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can do a movie. This one was done in eight days. Yeah. Yeah. We shoot the haves and have nots in a day. And if, let me use wrong, we shoot in a day, but, but a lot of that is, it was about

Speaker 7:          24:28          a lot of that and we've never done television.

Speaker 1:          24:35          That's how you get a job. But you're on the, you're on the biggest show on television right now. Let's,

Speaker 7:          24:42          that's coming to an end at some point.

Speaker 4:          24:44          Just enjoy the ride. It's just going to be around for a long time. We'd know we shoot, we shoot him date, what? But what happens in that, cause I have a studio in Atlanta and part of me building this studio was so that I can do that. I can, I can go from sing to sing set to set all on the base. I don't have to travel across the city. I don't have to go from stage to stage. I built this world for me to be able to do that. And, and now it's become a world where other films are coming to be filmed there. Let's say a black panther and universal shooting

Speaker 1:          25:13          condo forever

Speaker 4:          25:15          versus shooting their HBO know, walking dead is shot. There was a lot of things that are shot. They're now so, so it's a world that I created that allows me to move that fast. And I have a good team. I bought a bunch of green folks that have never done anything that wanted to be in the business and taught them so well that now they're breaking off and going onto other films. But, but having all these young kids and a lot of them people talking about inclusion rider, I need a non inclusion writer cause I got everything

Speaker 7:          25:42          body they already, that's amazing. He actually goes to, when he told me on Saturday, he said I go to colleges and I hire these kids that the industry is not going to hire. That's why he's so blessed because he just, he gave me my quote amount. I don't know how many people read my book but they don't understand what quality is. I never had a quote to be paid. Like when I did all those movies, y'all saw men up until I did the first movie, I can do bad all by myself. I was working with adequate, which means they were paying me chicken feed basically.

Speaker 4:          26:18          Where'd your quote this Sally, you and moves used to but this has changed but whatever your quote is this like what did, what did you, what's the highest amount of money you've ever gotten paid and whatever that number is, that's what they based you on. Well this is what we'll offer you. And a lot of those numbers were a lot lower. So we set it then as at a higher numbers higher than you ever had. And even with this one I than you've ever had. So it, it, it changes the financial picture for the actor and actresses. So, and being able to do that for her and a lot of others.

Speaker 2:          26:47          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          26:51          no, no, no, no, no. He was there. He was very generous with, he's so cool. So cool. I just want to hang out in his pocket. Just go wherever he's going. Let me go on now. And Larry Quick. No real tall, no real talky.

Speaker 6:          27:08          You were very generous and it's, uh, it's, it's refreshing to be in this crazy business and to work with people who you're not second guessing their, their, you know, their, their purpose and their reasons for what they're doing. I was just, just a good feeling to be in that environment.

Speaker 5:          27:24          Yes. I will always work with Mr. Tyler bear.

Speaker 4:          27:28          Well, it sounds like once you go, Tyler, you'd never go back.

Speaker 5:          27:30          Well, what should they do? Really just,

Speaker 4:          27:36          Oh, so it was, it might have just remained, just it just, it goes when you win because for me being a person that, especially being a black man in this business, and this is not about racism at all, this is just about race, understanding that the value of our own people and letting us know, treating us all well, letting us all, oh no, I mean if you walk, if you came to the studio right now and you walked through the campus, cause it's a 330 acre campus and 12th sound stages there and in the city of Atlanta and you walk through the campus and you see these kids in their faces and, and I, I know every one of them meant to shake their hands and the two to empower them, make them feel, I feel you, you have to just drive through the gates to really get it.

Speaker 4:          28:15          But that the energy and the spirit of what is happening there, I just wanted to, to permeate all over the world. And I look at, you know, for 10 years I was the only one out there. The person of color doing, making film and doing television for a long time now. And I took a lot of attacks because people would come to my shows looking forward themselves in my basket. They're like, yeah, this shit ain't day. Hey that ain't me. They didn't represent black people. That ain't so I took a lot of hits for that. Right. But the, but the issue with it is this, the fighting the fights that I was having, like paying people equally and behind closed doors, telling people that there are, there are many of us who have stories that need to be told. So to sit here in this seat and see a Esra on her show and to see empire and to see Donald Glover on Atlanta to see a Black Panther and Ryan Coogler, I am celebrating man. I'm so happy that this moment has arrived for so many,

Speaker 2:          29:09          but I caution but I caution them. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          29:12          Cause I called a lot of people in success. I said come, let's sit down. Come to Atlanta, come, let's sit down and let me talk to you. Let me explain to you about ownership because that is the way you really changed things. We, this'll be a great wave and then it'll go away. Because if you look back at history, we've seen this before, right? This wave of this African American call, everybody loves everybody

Speaker 5:          29:31          for seven years. Then it call the seven years. That's what I'm is his birthday. It's a cycle of seven years, seven years, seven years. We get all my money. I can't walk in and it's seven years on. Yeah. And then, and then it goes away. It's like I said, but we hope that it's massive.

Speaker 4:          29:46          Does this owners, this is what I'm trying to give everybody that I meet with or talk to about ownership, may owning all of my copyrights. Me Owning all of my shows, me owning every movie, me owning everything has put me in a position where where not only can I have a studio where 9,000 people that went through the gates to come to work last year. Wow. But also to, to have generational wealth for my son and and his children. And if they're, if they manage it right after I'm dead and gone, what that means is it's passed on to so many people. So if you want real change, real change comes with ownership. As long as you're renting the house and somebody else owns, owns it, they have the power. So that's what I'm trying to get a lot of, a lot of us to come together to understand and I'm, listen, I'm an open door's open. Come on

Speaker 5:          30:30          Laura. I want to own some stuff. When you got all your own, that's fine. Don't yell. Stop. I want to own my own your stuff. You already own it. You just said that I will come some stuff together. Oh yeah. That's not what I mean. Okay. You know what I meant? Let's collaborate. You can help me o Lord, how much longer I got the VOP

Speaker 3:          30:59          you guys are at, you guys are pressed for time. If you, if you're game, we'd love to take a couple of questions from the audience before we leave. And while Googlers are lining up either at that Mike or is that mine?

Speaker 5:          31:11          The hand. I was like,

Speaker 3:          31:16          um, I wanted to ask one last question. Going back to the themes of the movie, it seemed like you were, you were, you were not just writing a movie about trust and betrayal and relationships, but you were actually talking about and poking at some big myths and stereotypes about the strong black woman or the angry black woman. Um, could you talk a little bit about that? Was that the, was that the intent or was you just, were you just like thrown in there though? The

Speaker 4:          31:50          people, when people say things like, this is always fascinates me, because when, when I'm writing, I'm literally listening to what the characters want to say. Hmm. I'm not trying to make a statement. I'm not trying to, to, to, to make a point as much as it is, let's, let's hear what she has to say. And the more I wrote, the more she showed up, the more she said. What I realized this moment is about is for all of those people who can't let go for all of those people who can't forgive, for all of those people who spend their entire lives looking at what happened with the one that got away rather than going forward to see what else is out there for them. Because what happens a lot of times, especially with women, is this is they, after a bad divorce, they feel like they have wasted the best years of their life with someone.

Speaker 4:          32:28          And that promise was supposed to be forever. And the anger and the rage of that kid can become bitterness and fester and destroyed the person. So for me, my hope and when people, the takeaway is don't be her, don't be harsh, don't be her life goes on and whatever, it didn't happen with you and this person there, there's somebody wonderful is you're missing them because you are so stuck on this and you've got all these people passing you by. You can't even get to it. And the happiest people I know are the ones who came out of a divorce no matter how ugly it was. And then ended up finding the person of their dreams like, oh my God, I'm so glad I went through that because now I know how to treat you. I know how to be there. I knew and I know how to, how this is how to make this work. So yeah. Great.

Speaker 6:          33:14          First question. All right, thanks for coming everybody. My question for you, I think you hit on an interesting subject in that the two sides of the relationship is a common theme in your movies. Kind of like the counseling. Is that something that's really present in your personal life or is there another reason why you think that's a common theme in your work?

Speaker 4:          33:31          You know what happened for me, I, I will. I only wrote about experiences that I knew or had some, some something similar in my own life. But what I found when I looked back at some of the work now, the ones that I can look at, cause I can't look at all of them, a deal moves. I said to going, I can't watch it. But, but what I've found is when I'm, when I'm writing about, when I'm riding a black woman and when I'm riding her struggle, when I'm writing or paint or anyone for that matter in any of the pain and what she's going through, I realized I was talking to my mother because there's a little boy watching the things that she went through. I was hoping one day she would get it. So if somebody sees something that I've written and, and it changes their life, which has happened where people, there have been women who have sent me emails, they've been in terrible, horrible relationships. But after seeing, uh, uh, I got this letter from a family that said, you did attend and an hour and a half, what we've been trying to do for 12 years, my sister's leaving an abusive relationship. So that kind of, that's what, what, what it's about for me. So I realized early on that I was speaking to her from the little boy that I was. So I don't know who I was talking to do for this one, but there we are. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          34:41          Great. Hi. Thanks for coming. I saw proud Mary by the way. I thought it was.

Speaker 8:          34:49          Yeah. So, um, you also, I saw also, so one of your interviews where you were talking about how they don't want to bring black actors abroad and they think, oh, you don't sell abroad. Um, get with Tyler with you like your studio and you're like basically owning the whole vertical. I think it's really powerful. And including like what you said about generational wealth. I'm doing something similar in real estate. So I wanted to ask two questions. One Tower, do you see yourself expanding more into the movie industry and like been doing television, basically taking over some more and to Rashia we're going to see you.

Speaker 1:          35:24          Um, I'm pretty much in every area. I am moving towards my own streaming service though. I am moving towards. Yeah. So that's what I, that's what I'm working towards. But, but when you talk about movies not traveling internationally, this is something that

Speaker 4:          35:38          we've been battling for many, many years. That's why the success of the success of Black Panther spoke to so many levels. Having international success because we have been told for years that bed people stories with people of color don't, don't translate. They don't travel overseas. And we've been trying to debunk that myth

Speaker 7:          35:54          for awhile because it's totally a myth. I mean, I was in China filming for three months. China. Yeah. And you know, China is a very controlled, a country is communist still. Um, and you know, you can't really watch movies there. So they have these stores where you can go get all of the DVDs from everything and it's black market, you know, you don't really go to jail for it. And Kevin, unless they decide to stay. Yeah. You don't get no money from it. I saw every last one of my movies there. Yeah. All of them I saw, not easily broken there. Right. Okay. That movie, I don't even think did 700 theaters here, but it was in China. Yeah. So, you know, I don't understand that. True. It's not true. It's just that you have to spend money to make money. You know, if you, I have a personality, I know I sell over there because empire took me over there and I was in a room, 1500 standing room only.

Speaker 7:          36:51          They didn't call me cookie. They call me Taraji Henson is, was in Paris. And I, they didn't know I was in the audience and lead Angela sitting on this on the stage. And they, um, they said they, they asked, started asking a lot of cookie question and he's, and he said, well, why don't you ask her? She's here. When I stood up the entire room stood up and started applauding. I cry because I cry because they lied to me. I haven't been new China. Tell me, these people just met me during empire. So then we finish the Q and a. I go outside, they are coming up to me with every jacket of all the movies that I had done it right. I was so in my feelings that entire trip,

Speaker 4:          37:30          that's our next battle. That's our next time to prove that, that we do so in international markets that that is the next battle. And, and, and, and you know the thing about it, of what you have to understand about this, this is, I really do not believe that this is the racism. I really do not believe that. What I believe is, as you just said, you spend money to make money and, and somebody has to make the initial investment in going over there. Will Smith was brilliant when he took me over a, he was doing seven pounds. He, I was like, I want to break it and break in over there. Said, come, come, let me explain something to you. So we went to [inaudible], I went to seven territories with him and watched how he worked at and he had, but he had a a way in from, from, uh, wrap and fresh prince so long before. So, so it's, it's, it's just we're getting there. It's a slow thing. It's a fight. But we've got to, we've got to convince more people to spend the money. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          38:19          Just what if it fails, I'll lose my job. But somebody has to have the balls to take a chance to take a leap of faith because it's going to blow. Like it'll happen if you just take a chance. Right. If somebody just takes a chance on me

Speaker 5:          38:37          next week,

Speaker 7:          38:46          Rajiv, thank you so much for coming. And um, your role in empire. Like I mean I've started watching the beginning of me of my husband love, we have to be a part of this week. This is just so powerful to see just all these different emotions in this depth, in this character that, you know, growing up like there was a few examples but now it's just overwhelming. It's so amazing. What the choice. Um, but you guys mentioned something like this lie of like not being able to sell. And I think back to the point you made about payment, right? Like how you know the statistics black women and like it next women are making so much less. And what are your thoughts on the transparency around that? Cause you just mentioned that you got a quote in the beginning and the transparency on being able to say there are people who are willing to pay me for what I'm worth, so I don't need to accept that from someone else. How do we change that? Like with more transparency around people who are doing it. Right. Okay.

Speaker 4:          39:37          Well I tell you what's changing in the industry right now. You can't big, they don't go off quotes anymore, which is great. So at whatever, whatever, whatever, a movie or are you off like before you can call it a page and a goal. Okay. What's a quote? Oh she made this amount of money on the last movie, So, okay, so, so you, I'm going to offer that now with, with everything that's happening with equality and inclusion and diversity, the, the industry standard is you cannot ask what someone's quote is, which is, which is a good thing. And a lot of ways it's slowing down a lot of the negotiations because people don't know what to ask. So what did what to offer. So they're starting really, really low now. But, but it also sets, it erases that moment of I'm going to pay you based on what your lasting was as opposed to I'm going to pay you off on where you are now. What's your worth is and what you're doing.

Speaker 5:          40:21          Okay. So the here's where all my hard work for 20 years come in. We got, cause I know one thing I can do, I can open the film, I can get you what you paid on your film back. I know that much now with the help of the studio, I can get you even more. So you gotta pay me now. That's right. Thank you. Cause I'm a Black Cup. Hey, we thought that you guys are here. Thank you so much.

Speaker 7:          40:54          Um, so my question is about your past history together, working on other films. Um, so which one was your favorite that you guys did? My favorite is the family that prays. So I just wanted to know what your favorite is and then also what is the difference or your preference between working together as actors and just acting versus directing. Cause I know you do both Tyler. So what's your preference? What are the differences?

Speaker 4:          41:15          My favorite is this one. We've done it here and once you see it, I think you know why? It's just the level of growth from, from a family that prays to this. I'm proud of the level of growth that I've experienced, but also just, I love being an eye. I love acting with her, but I much rather director because I'm, I'm, I want to be behind the camera and I'm leaning toward more and more that way. Oh, I as time goes on, but, but working with her on this with was just, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          41:41          It's actors enjoy working with them. It doesn't matter. Cause if he's been in front of the camera, not that I'm saying, he's also directing himself too. So,

Speaker 4:          41:51          and I, and I can't, when I'm directing myself, I can't have as much fun as if I'm just directing the film. So

Speaker 7:          41:56          yeah. Thank you so much. Yeah. Yeah. I do enjoy you better when you're just directing.

Speaker 3:          42:02          Oh, they just so much for coming in. This is so fun. So you're talking about I'm all your long days on set and being really efficient in that time. So it was just kind of curious like what are your non negotiables when you first show up on set first day, like what do you need there and what kind of do to rejuvenate yourself and like reenergize

Speaker 1:          42:25          you want me to go get you a ride or do you want no kidding. She had, she had a requirement of crab legs. No, talking down to you, don't you? I don't require much. I don't, I don't mean just crab legs and one eye rolls or Matt check and see rose. All your techs, they're all day long as you get that right. I don't care what's in the trail, I get it myself. I know. Right, right. I don't, I don't have any crazy requirements. What I asked

Speaker 4:          42:50          just cause, cause I just, I just did a film recently where, where, um, I ended up paying for a lot of stuff myself because, because they didn't want to basically, so, so eh. And I'm okay with that because I'm, I'm okay to go and improve myself and show you what I can bring to the table. So I don't have all the, I cut a bunch of crazy requirements. I don't need a lot. Just I have a bag with my own stuff in and then we go from there.

Speaker 3:          43:16          And then what do you kind of do at the end of the day to like rejuvenate and like get ready for the next day? The smoke weed.

Speaker 1:          43:22          Oh No, no, no, no. Really, no, no, no. I thought it was a shock for me. For me. I know you don't want those elite shot, is that right? No, no, no. I've never, I've never done, I've never done drugs, but I do have trouble. I do have trouble sleeping.

Speaker 4:          43:41          So, um, so what I, what I, what I started doing was having some buckets and then I realized this could be a problem if you keep doing this. So right now what I'm trying to train myself, he has to let them calm my mind down enough to go to sleep without, without anything. But I did try. We drink once this a friend of mine, she said, you've got to take, try this to help you sleep. Because she had stayed. She had tried ambien and that she would, and this was working, this was perfect. This will help you sleep. So I'm like, okay. I tried it, took a shot of it, didn't nothing happened. Next night. She said, well take two and nothing happened next. I just didn't take three because you're a big guy. Maybe say start took three shots at that. We'd drink. It was a pink lemonade. Do my legs,

Speaker 1:          44:20          my leg started growing. I couldn't open. I couldn't, I was trying to pull my mouth open. It wouldn't open. Then she facetimed me and I was hiding behind the camera for that. God,

Speaker 4:          44:30          if you get me out of this, I will never

Speaker 1:          44:31          ever touch this weed stuff again in my life. So what owl? I relaxed. I just lay there until I fall asleep. Let last question. We've got to go. Sorry. Nope, we're, we've talked to about it was the last question. Sorry. We have, we can't, we can't let it go real quick. Okay.

Speaker 3:          44:51          Questioning Kinda changed, right?

Speaker 1:          44:54          You have, what can I can, I can, okay. All right. So first off, thank you all for coming. Uh, that ain't no question.

Speaker 9:          45:03          No, I am really quick. I just want you to be thankful, be thankful. So a two part question, really fast one. Uh, like although I know I look like Ryan Coogler I am not as talented as he. So are you going to have any or do you plan to open up and actually start having some screenwriting classes or things of that nature that we can maybe attend if we want to start getting into your industry. And then the second thing is I do you have any plans to come to Broadway so that we can increase the amount of black faces that we see there as well?

Speaker 4:          45:36          I think, yeah, I'm definitely going to a startup incubators where we have system where we have talent once the studio is completely finished being built where we bring talent in from all over the places, writers, directors, producers. Cause cause you know, I'm 48 and, and I'm going to start slowing down. So I'm looking for the next wave. So definitely, definitely going to do that. And as far as Broadway goes, I'm thinking about working on a one man show and finally, finally taken on Broadway. So I'm, I'm, I'm thinking about doing that.

Speaker 3:          46:02          Why would first, so come see my one woman show first and then,

Speaker 1:          46:07          okay, great. Great. All right, cut.

Speaker 3:          46:12          Um, well my question originally changed cause you went to your extracurricular activities. No, I'm just putting it, what's it called? I was going to say like, do you, what's your favorite, but anyways, oh that's a good question. Is for lyric, right? I kind of wanted it to bring the attention onto you, so I liked what you did, what she's got to have it. I was hoping that a little Nola was going to pick you, but uh, it happens. How do you, how do you like playing the love triangle role? Like I feel like you're always involved with like multiple people.

Speaker 2:          46:49          Let me ask you, what's your personal life and your answer?

Speaker 1:          47:01          That's it.

Speaker 3:          47:05          I did not mean to put you on blast.

Speaker 6:          47:10          I don't mind playing those characters because they're real characters, right? People could relate to them. Um, I like, I like real, I like raw, like, you know, moments where is it? It takes over and it's not you being cerebral about it. So, uh, like to you said earlier, if I'm not, if I'm not scared or nervous about, then something's wrong. So I like when I'm nervous and scared and, and I'm entering a new territory I know nothing about, which is why I had a lot of fun working in this environment. Um, cause it was really scary. And um, it is because as an actor you want to, you want it, you want to be professionally. You want to know that your abilities, Eh, you know, you, you have the ability to get the job done.
