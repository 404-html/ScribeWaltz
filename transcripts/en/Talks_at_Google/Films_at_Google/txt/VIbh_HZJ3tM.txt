Speaker 1:          00:02          [inaudible] we just finished watching Mr. Holmes.

Speaker 2:          00:07          So based on a novel, a slight trick of mind by Mitch Colon, Mr. Holmes reimagined Sherlock Holmes as a real person who's adventures have been turned into bestselling novels by his friend and partner, Dr. John Watson, now old and failing and health. The famously rational detective is forced to engage for the first time with his emotions as his mental powers dwindle. So I loved it. I thought it was very, very good. Um, and both of you, gosh, you're, you're acting awards, your accolades go on. I've got, you know, I could print pages of these things. I mean, you're not so much

Speaker 3:          00:40          where'd you do get them? They do Google. Do not use it.

Speaker 1:          00:49          So what, what drew you to both to, to this film? What was so unique about it? The money. Okay. Or lack of it.

Speaker 3:          01:01          You've heard of independent movies? Translated means cheap.

Speaker 1:          01:07          Well, I'm an, I'm sorry, I've started talking first.

Speaker 3:          01:15          It's a, it's a wonderful part. And, and the, and the actor of my generation would have jumped at the chance to play Sherlock Holmes in his prime and then Sherlock Holmes and his decline. I mean, you know, two performances and in the same film it's um, it's a bit like doing a Gandalf the grey and Gandalf, the white. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:42          they're the same but different and uh, so that, but

Speaker 3:          01:49          Laura will tell you the script arrives and it says it's from bill con don it your life stops while you recover, breath and then you opened it and know you're good to say yes because it's bill and who we both worked with a very happily, I think both been number that initially that my feeling is if it's, if a script looks like a film or play that I would like to see, then I then I get intrigued. If I read something on that, I think I, I really wouldn't want to go and see that then I don't get involved. But in this case,

Speaker 2:          02:33          the thing, Laura, same for you. First off, it was bill Condon, who is, you know, our, our friend and, and director and there certain directors who you will do anything for. You have such good experiences working with them that they whisper your name and you will show up for two lines. I mean, not you do you do anything for them and bill is certainly one of those people. So it was bill in combination with,

Speaker 1:          02:58          right. You know, and

Speaker 2:          03:00          then on top of that, Sherlock Holmes, and I've been a Sherlock Holmes fanatic since I was a child. So, um, so the comp those three and it was filmed in England for God's sake. So all of those things combined, it was just, you know, kind of too good to be true. The money though. No.

Speaker 3:          03:18          Yes. So you said you, I'm here we are. We're doing this for free. God bless. All right. Because we want you all to see this room and you've seen it for free. The beyond this particular audience. Um, yeah. You, you don't go around talking about a film that you haven't enjoyed making an, haven't enjoyed watching. Uh, we vote. We both feel strongly about it and I love it.

Speaker 2:          03:51          Well, you said, Laura, you said yes. You said that you were a big Sherlock Holmes Fan since childhood, right? Right. So, so bill Condon comes to you. You weren't planning on doing anything for a right? No, I, I had a baby a year and a half ago. Oh, I'm such a baby. A sweet little boy who's madly in love with Anne. And I, uh, Bill came over to meet the baby and we spend a little time together and he said, so what do you think you're going to go back to work? I said, well, I'm not, I have no plans. And he goes, okay. Okay. And then the next day I got an offer to do the movie. I wasn't planning on going back to work, but you know, for bill and you know, I, I, I, you know, got myself off the couch and strap the baby to myself and we flew to London and that was that. So did you know what Ian was attached to it beforehand? Was that part of the decision or would you have taken it otherwise? Well, it was certainly an added bonus because Ian and I have been sort of fond acquaintances for maybe 20 years, but have never really spent any time together other than through our mutual friend Armistead muffin. So,

Speaker 3:          04:57          and we were both in the television version of [inaudible], right? I mean, yeah. So, um, I've played a tiny part in one of the episodes and we didn't meet, but yeah, technically live work.

Speaker 2:          05:09          Yeah. So we've known each other through, through Arma said for a very long time. So I was just happy to be able to have the opportunity to claim him as my own friends, which I was able to do. So that's been a real joy. Well, you've both been nominated for Academy Awards when films you've done with bill Condon. So did that have any part, like I guess you're friends with, with bell from long time ago and you've worked with them and God than monster is years and years back. Um, so how much, how much did working with bill have in your head towards your decision in coming on to this bill? Oh, it was, um,

Speaker 3:          05:49          you okay. You, you, you, you wouldn't want to play a wonderful part unless you felt there was something going to guide you. Right? Yeah. Good par. Part of the wonderful part is, is that you're not exactly certain that you've got to be able to play it. And, uh, yeah. If you are, you're going to need help and bill's there to help.

Speaker 2:          06:10          Did you approach this as two completely different characters? Like the, there's the, the real life Sherlock Holmes who's aging and frail and then there's actual, I drew that

Speaker 1:          06:20          for the man.

Speaker 3:          06:29          Well, the vet, they are, they're the same person. They've got the same name of the, the, the sort of look alike, but one is in his prime and one is in its decline. And, uh, it's not as difficult as it,

Speaker 2:          06:43          but there's the, there's the Sherlock Holmes in his prime, that doctor that Dr. Watson has painted him to be. And then when he actually is, so there's in essence three different characters. No. Oh, good. Sinking. Yes,

Speaker 3:          06:58          of course. You caught me certain when a Sherlock Holmes said, I'm nothing like the character that, uh, uh, Watson portrayed the, that the, that he's right. You may be wrong. That's up for the oldest judgment. Is that four characters, there's a multilayered moving.

Speaker 2:          07:14          Yes, it was. So Mrs. Monroe, the character has never appeared in any Sherlock Holmes stories before. Have you, did you enjoy that fact that you had like a clean slate or would you have preferred something to be there? I didn't care one way or the other really. It was, she's, she's, she's, she's got spirit, this Monroe, you know, and she's been through a lot and she's tired and she's scared and she's grieving and you know, there's just a lot there to play. Right. You know, so, and the fact that it's a new constellation of people around a Sherlock Holmes that we haven't seen it. It's fun.

Speaker 3:          07:57          And uh, uh, it being a British town, of course, it concerned with class social class and there's this, there's a privileged man, right. Homes just taking advantage of is Brian and his capacity for hard work. That's true. But you're just feel life hasn't been too difficult for him too, to find himself in the position where he can be fulfilled but pour owed a working cold.

Speaker 1:          08:28          No. Oh

Speaker 3:          08:35          No, I got it absolutely wrong. So it was a lot of makeup for Mrs. Monroe. Uh, yeah. Doesn't have the advance. You just had to make her own way. And she's a widow and she's got a a little boy. She loves him. It's just trying to do, trying to do her best but against the odds. And so, yeah,

Speaker 2:          08:54          and the fact that this takes place

Speaker 3:          08:56          after the war and thinking about all of the women who were war widows and what that did to an entire generation of women who lost their husbands, who then all of a sudden had to be employed and in areas that maybe they weren't qualified for. I mean, misses Monroe's not the greatest housekeeper. She's clearly not a good cook and she doesn't enjoy it. You know, that these women found themselves having to do things out of desperation in order to support themselves. And, and if they were lucky enough to have children, um, you know, they had to raise their children on their own. So it's, and I had never sort of a why I had never thought about that, but I, but I hadn't, you know, that whole, and all those women who then had to, they had to move, they had to migrate. They couldn't stay where they were.

Speaker 3:          09:39          They had to give up their homes. They, you know, it was a, it was not an easy time. I lived in the north of England and his relative to safe parts of the country during the Second World War. Uh, and we, we had, um, uh, did they call evacuees a mother and two kids came up from London. That's the husband behind a firefighter. And they just came and lived with us for a year stored. One of things that we did, uh, and homes has just gone through the wall. He wouldn't know that the war it happened. As far as he's concerned, he's just been, I've just be, his husband lives come to an end. And what does he do? He goes off to Japan not to investigate the Hiroshima that comes in as a surprise to them that they'll, that used to give you some, that they plan to keep himself alive. He's a really, really, really selfish purse. Right. Uh, and so I think, I think Mr Monroe's bitterness is absolutely understandable, but homes is, selfishness is not right. Uh, and it's nice. Moran, it's a tad isn't it? At the end they come together, she gets some sort of security. She gets her son's love back as it were, and um, and homes discovers that he's got a heart and then they hold hands done.

Speaker 2:          11:00          So speaking of, of the family unit, what was it like working with Milo Parker? He's a 10 at the time, right? I think it might've been 11. I'm not, I don't, I'm not quite sure. He's a dcis. Tiny, sweet sprite of a boy. And uh, he is, he's just adorable. He's got that face and um, Oh god, that face that, that face that can look very, very old and very, very young at the time, you know, and he's, you know, I've been very lucky in that. I've worked with, I don't know about you, but I've worked with wonderful children. You know, there's that old saying never. We don't work with animals and children and, and I, I've really loved the, the kids that I've worked with and my low is from a wonderful family and has, comes to, came to work everyday cheerful and wanting to learn and happy to be there. And, and uh, you know, I had a great phone with Milo.

Speaker 3:          11:55          You flirted a lot with the makeup

Speaker 1:          11:59          roommate.

Speaker 2:          12:04          If anybody in the audience has questions a step up to these mikes. We're, we're running a little short on time so we can cut to the audience Q and a pretty quickly here. Um, yeah, watching, watching Milo, I believe. Uh, it's always, it's always so interesting to me because I feel like with a child actor with a story this deep that, that children, children, actors and maker can make or break a story for me because they're either like indicating or they're being the character, right? So I think he did. There's no question here. I'm just telling you, I think he did an extremely good job.

Speaker 3:          12:34          He did. And I'm, uh, I will say, and I hope if Marla, which are here, the, she, he wouldn't take it wrong. You know, when you're acting, you concerned with yourself that, that that's it. That's your responsibility. You shouldn't be worrying about other people. And what I was worried about Milo, cause I, although I was getting the performance and he was responding and doing what was suggested and I thought, I don't see this performance is really quite as vibrant lit on the moment as it should be. Well, I was wrong and I shouldn't demean bothering him out, man. I should have been getting on with my, my own performance and learn something from that. So I was surprised when I saw it. Uh, it was the same one, a, a great English actress, Sibyl Thorndyke who did very few firms but was in Nazi Olivier's film called the sleeping prince, I think, or something like that with Marilyn Monroe, Monroe. I did these, are these names familiar to you or not?

Speaker 1:          13:41          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          13:43          Not Simple Song. No. Perhaps, but a certain amount of Monroe and that she was Sundeck sands two friends and the dreaded, but this woman can't act. I'm talking about Marilyn Monroe. She's not giving you a performance. I can't hear this absolute disaster. And she saw the firm and realized that her own performance was the disaster because it was too big for the camera. The, the genius, which was a of the relationship between Marlyn Monroe and the camera, which unmatched really had passed by. Uh, even the Eagle. I have an, uh, an experienced actor and I've, I'm afraid it was a bit like that with me and Myla. Anyway, he's a star now. He's working with Spielberg, isn't it? Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 2:          14:37          Sure. Thank you both so much for being here. I really enjoyed the film. Uh, and fun fact, whenever I'm asked the question of if you were to have lunch with one living person, um, it's there, Ian Mckellen. So I'm like

Speaker 3:          14:50          my one, uh, I think

Speaker 4:          14:52          back to when I was a musician in high school and I had these moments that I would call really poignantly memorable, um, during a performance, whether it was a certain string of music or a certain or a certain piece that gave me kind of, you know, Google apps on the IPAD. I have a checkered past. I played the Tuba for many years. There was an orchestra and I had these moments and I was wondering if each of you would share a moment in your acting career where, you know, you may refer back to a scene that you performed in and every time you watch it you get those, you know, hairs on the back of your neck stand up. That was something that was very poignantly memorable to you.

Speaker 2:          15:28          I can't stand to watch myself. Oh yeah. I just, I just can't, I can't take it. Or how about in the moment of that in memory of the theater is, is, is it totally different situation. Um, I just, I have a very hard time watching myself. I love watching everybody else in the movie, but I'm the, um, but for memories of, of being the theater, there's a bunch of them, you know, and they don't happen very often, but when they do, and they usually happen within like ten second periods of feeling like, oh, that everything aligns perfectly. And there's this wonderful sense of system of, of suspense where you've completely stopped working on the play and the place completely working on you and it served as, carries you through in a way of really is thrilling. And I did a production of the crucible with Liam Neeson and I think they did. I have wonderful memories of that. That's my answer.

Speaker 3:          16:22          Yeah. Well, the film close to my heart, uh, is one that I helped to write over the age of William Shakespeare, but she's the said that, and I also produced it. And without my efforts it wouldn't, we wouldn't have raised the funds to make it. And so I [inaudible] I hadn't at that point really played much within a success for the cinema. Um, I, I did have the idea that the first, the opening speech of the play on the film, uh, now as the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by the Son of York should be a public speech, uh, to his brother, uh, newly made king. And of course he wants to be king himself, Richard, but we don't know that is not in those opening lines. And halfway through that rather than long speech, I knew from having paid it in the theater, there was a t a change in tone. The public speech suddenly turns private. I met the owners. Shakespeare could do this. Yeah. I mean, you catch your breath when you're doing it every night and you realize this is the moment when you got to take the whole audience into your insides and, and, and, and uh, let them know that. All right.

Speaker 2:          17:48          And I had the idea that

Speaker 3:          17:50          that halfway through the speech in the movie, we would go from the public situation to enter the most private place of all really, which is the place where you urinate. So suddenly in the middle of the speech, uh, the public man is, he's, he's deformed his undoing his flies and having a pee and when I, every time I see it, and I don't say that up, but I think what I'm really excited

Speaker 1:          18:19          yeah.

Speaker 3:          18:24          Sit on my a website I think.

Speaker 1:          18:28          Yeah. Over here.

Speaker 5:          18:30          Um, I have a question on how much leverage do as an actor do you have of changing things in the script? For example, like along the movie we learn that hey, show homes learns that logic alone doesn't really solve the problem it solves in on paper, but not really salt because the woman died and the husband was really angrily looking at homes and homes feels guilt and related that he hasn't really solved the case. So in when he went homes does is isn't quite the contrary to what you would probably expect an like Sherlock Holmes to do. I would like Sherlock Holmes to say, Hey, I learned something to do and apply it to a new case rather than, that kind of like was a let down for me. Like, hey home. So the hero, like I was like thinking of that and they're, oh no, why is he on get taking on so much guilt and running away from everything? Um, as an actor, if I just say hi, did you get the script and say, Hey, I'm not going to play this home, so I'll probably going to change it. He should be a hero.

Speaker 3:          19:35          Well, I started acting, uh, and I've gone on acting with total respect for the script. Uh,

Speaker 1:          19:50          that's all you have to say. Yeah. I mean, we are acting.

Speaker 3:          19:53          We, we don't initiate it really rare circumstances. We rather do anyway. And if you're dealing with Shakespeare, this is the map the master. And if it's checkoff Anton Chekhov, even in translation, these, these are the words, this is what you have to play with. And it must have this, if you're doing a play by a, a new, uh, a new play or an old play much, the authors long dead, you must rehearse it with the assumption that any minute now he might come back from the bathroom and say, what you doing? And that being, so that's my training, uh, that, that site, it's the same one. I read the script, the other film. No Way.

Speaker 1:          20:41          Okay.

Speaker 3:          20:41          Do I have confidence that I could contribute anything to a script that's been gone over maybe for two, three or four years by a writer?

Speaker 1:          20:49          Uh, and

Speaker 3:          20:52          however Lord of the Rings I, I had to, I had him my, uh, pocket. Sure. Out. And sometimes when I'm striding across Middle East, the, the, the, the GAM catches and you could see that inside here is the, the big thick three volume paperback at Lord of the Rings. Because I was always referring to it. [inaudible] seem to be detraction, not you've missed out a line here that I never got my own way. And uh, uh, and I did point out to him that a Gandalf in the book never says you shall not pass. He says you cannot pass. It's not as good as it. So we have time for one last question over here.

Speaker 2:          21:53          I know, I know. So I guess my question is kind of serious and now I feel bad that it's the last one.

Speaker 3:          22:01          One other, there's one other person behind her. Okay. We did two more questions. Yeah. Do you talk to your people? I'm okay with that.

Speaker 2:          22:08          I was just wondering, uh, so Siri and in the movie you're playing like Sherlock who's like a bit older than you are like 20 years older than you or something.

Speaker 1:          22:22          Yes.

Speaker 2:          22:22          Uh, sorry. I was just wondering if like playing characters who are like pretty old and I thought Sherlock was going to die, if that like gives you any sort of existential crises

Speaker 3:          22:36          or if it's because that's how I would react. I Dunno. What was the question? Did playing someone old make you existentially scared? I find the older I get, the less scared I got. I've had, I'm not scared of dying. I'm dying is a part of life, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          23:00          Okay.

Speaker 3:          23:00          I'm frank to solves up lots of promise, but you know, I just, dude, I don't have you died a lot as an actor. Not a lot. No, but as you get older, you'll know. Yeah, no, I'm died twice that I can think of. Yeah, there you go. Don't do it. There's more, more troubled marriages that I've done a lot of time, but I've, but I've died twice, but I, I've done quite a lot. And it's a puzzle. It's a puzzle just to what to do because I haven't actually seen. And the body and the animal

Speaker 1:          23:43          die.

Speaker 3:          23:46          Well, we've all seen actress dying. I'm it. And I think what would be wonderful to do on stage is for you to sync. Got The actor has died. It just managed to say the last line of the part and then didn't year die on stage. Did he? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. And um, I ran, Ryan died onstage. Few people of it. Yeah. But the trick of it would be that he hasn't really died, but he was holding it.

Speaker 1:          24:29          Okay.

Speaker 3:          24:29          I did. I did see a David Bradley and the road shows national sales or production of Henry the fourth part, two by Shakespeare. And he's playing the old king. How does she mom seen long specie and who said that he had to a day he had to die now. So he leaves the stage to die. And I don't, I'm witnessing my friend David Bradley, he's dying, not going to make it to the wings. Um, when they, when the Messenger came and said the king is dead. Oh Wow. That's wonderful, isn't it? Maybe you imagine if we could act height that all the time. Guess the answer your question. Does that answer your question? All right now for real. Last question.

Speaker 6:          25:25          Okay, thanks. I just love this film so much. It was so good. And one of the things that blew me away and I'm going to have to go away and think about is all the levels that we saw of both reality and the direction of the narrative. Because Laura, your part, you were the beginning, the middle and end in what was the films present time. And Sir Ian, you were had a nonlinear existence and you had to decide for yourself as an actor what was real and what was not. So I guess are those things that that drew you to this and and in condoms work you see this a lot like in gods and monsters as well. There's what is reliable about memory and how do you deal with that?

Speaker 3:          26:05          Sure. Hi. Good. That's why she has a playwright that's play right now. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, it's, um, it's, um, bill condoms, men for movers. I can just think off the top of my head. Got Gods and monsters. Uh, Kinzie. Um, the, um, um, uh, sounds moving on the fifth estate. Yes. This the state. Uh, and now Mr. Holmes, I'm the essential cat is brilliant,

Speaker 2:          26:46          uniquely, uh, achieving.

Speaker 3:          26:51          And I bet mad

Speaker 2:          26:54          bill wants to know where that comes from. Funny isn't it?

Speaker 3:          26:58          And Amanda who likes nothing better than to a director, a musical. I mean, he's doing a beauty and the beast and the iron minutes. I play a clock, but I'm this, I'm that matter of, of memory that, that, that has all, all the parts of it. And A, I don't know. Um,

Speaker 2:          27:16          I'm not sure I could, I could answer it. There's, there's something amazing when you work in this is, I think one of the reasons why we love working with bell. We can look at a script, which is sort of like a blueprint for us. It sort of like an architect who does a blueprint, a score for musicians. It's, it's sort of the basic thing that we then go into and we try and are our brain sort of works like chess people. We can sort of look through it the way that someone who's playing chess can go from move to move to move to move. But what bill does is that he has not only a narrative mind and an understanding of the technicalities of film production and also what actors do, but he has a cinematic mind and I am constantly amazed at how he tells a story cinematically and thematic Lee is this stuff that you've just, and how he ties, you know, the visual and the the thematic together.

Speaker 2:          28:07          And that's what really great filmmakers do. And it's always sort of, I mean cause we're not aware that that's happening when we're working on it. You know, when you see we work at scene to scene, to scene, to scene, and we have our own arcs and we see, you know, hopefully you think beyond your own arc and how does my character help this character move into the next scene and all those sorts of things. But then I, and then when you actually see a movie that's visually also told in the way that only film can do, you know, it's really, you're like, oh my God, I had no idea. That was like, wow. So, and that's certainly, you know, this movie was the first time I saw it. You know, it's, it's so visually beautiful. Beautiful. So it's, it's uh, it's been a joy to be a part of. Yay. Yeah. Before we say goodbye [inaudible] can I say something please? No, nothing to do with Mr Hubs.

Speaker 3:          28:58          Okay. Um, when that, when that, when that was a land, mmm. And I wanted to know something. Okay. Uh, a fact or

Speaker 2:          29:21          a definition perhaps definition is relatively easy.

Speaker 1:          29:27          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          29:28          Because we have a dictionary. My dictionary at home is one of the, my most precious possessions. I, I love it.

Speaker 2:          29:35          Read it again about something that I couldn't access at home and we had lots of books that

Speaker 3:          29:41          have, I would catch a bus into town, the number two or the number four and hope I got the times right and go to the library and it'd be a reference library of course. And I would stand in line there, Joe speaking alive, everything was conducted in whispers,

Speaker 1:          30:03          have you got to book, come sit down.

Speaker 3:          30:14          So I'd sit down and 15 minutes later she would have done her job and she would have gone and collected a series of books which she thought might concern the answer to my question and their beer, you know, a pile of books. And I think there's some times brought on a trolley and I was given a desk and I was allowed to sit at it. And I'm speaking, no marking the books of course, no indication, no little posted, most new, we just had to go through these books and maybe I'm the seventh book outward, find what I was looking for.

Speaker 1:          30:42          Hmm.

Speaker 3:          30:43          And then I had to catch the bus back home.

Speaker 1:          30:47          Google.

Speaker 3:          30:51          It's the biggest change in my life. Uh, and it's a change, I think, without any regrets, except you never have the joy of doing all the work yourself. You know, when you finally get that in the book and there it is and it's yours, you'll never, ever, ever forget it. Those are the people who do all the words.

Speaker 1:          31:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          31:28          do you go to the light,

Speaker 1:          31:33          ladies and gentlemen? Laura Linney and Sir Ian McKellen. [inaudible].
