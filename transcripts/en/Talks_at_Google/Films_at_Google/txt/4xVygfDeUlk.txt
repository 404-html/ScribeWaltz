Uh, so, uh, this is a movie completely about your character Dory and you've been characters, right? Uh, thank you. Uh, and uh, but so York, yeah, go ahead. Out. I'm dory.

Speaker 2:          02:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:12          And so, but you were huge cheerleader for this film for years on your, uh, on your show.

Speaker 3:          02:17          Thank God I had a show. We would not be sitting here had I not had a talk show. So

Speaker 2:          02:24          talk about

Speaker 3:          02:25          to intimidation. Yeah. He finally called and said, uncle, he's like a, all right, we'll do it. Let's do it. It was this, you said, I was just kidding. I was like, no, I'm not interested. No, it was a, it was started. Is, is I seriously wanted a sequel. I was like, they make SQLs for every other successful film. We won an academy award for crying out loud. So where's the SQL? And then it just got to be a joke and then I just gave up and I was just, well, I'm just going to keep going because it's funny. But uh, and then it worked out

Speaker 1:          02:54          and then 13 years later, so Andrea, you brought this back 13 years later. So when did that idea, I want to push it again when you make these movies that you see them so many times. So I'd seen finding Nemo about a hundred times before 2003 even finished. So he just stop watching. And about eight years later, it was 2011 they wanted to put it out in three d they put me in a theater and I watched it like an audience member for the first time in a long time. And I walked out so worried about dory. I was just like, she's going to forget Marla Nimo. She won't know how to get back and I don't know where she's from. And I think that yes, she's got abandonment issues that I know about as a writer. So it like suddenly it was just all, it just all started to bubble up after that. It's, it's unbelievable. And it's, it's wonderful thing. I've seen it. It's, it's

Speaker 4:          03:37          otherwise, as long as you're here, you make the third one before we die.

Speaker 1:          03:42          Oh, okay. Oh well I want, I want to get to you actually about your character to Marlin Marlin's back. Um, and we have the new voice of Nimmo birthday up there. Hayden. Hey, say hello to everyone.

Speaker 2:          03:55          Hayden Hayden's

Speaker 1:          03:58          actually 30 plays a really good nine year old, like you guys didn't know yet. And so l a Alberta, your character Marlin is back obviously. And it's interesting cause it was really, really great to see you now have a completely different dynamic with your son Nemo. And now Marlon is much more particular dory who wants to go find your family. So can you talk a little bit about where Merryn is at the stage and,

Speaker 4:          04:25          well, I know he doesn't agree, but I thought that Marlin was in love with Dory. Okay. I mean it, I just figured that, you know, whatever makes the seats were heard. Marlin's lonely and, and, uh, you hadn't found anyone else and she's lovely and you know, why not? But, uh, I think we have the next seat and say there's your third. Um, but you know, it was great. I Hayden's terrific. Alexandra Gould who played the first one, he's 42. I actually was in weeds with him after he was Nima. Roy played his grandfather in weeds, so that was sort of interesting. Talking about pot with Nemo,

Speaker 2:          05:13          you know,

Speaker 4:          05:14          but a Hayden's wonderful and you know, like a modern, divorced family. Here's the new kid.

Speaker 1:          05:23          There we go. It's gone. Great. Uh, so ty and Katelyn, you guys play new characters in the film. So we have, uh, Bailey, which is your character tigh and then designate. So tell us about your characters.

Speaker 4:          05:35          Um, we're buddies. Yeah. Uh,

Speaker 1:          05:39          basically, uh, Bailey and destiny are, uh, two people that Dorian lists to help her find her folks.

Speaker 4:          05:49          People. There are two people dressed in whale and whale shark costumes. It's like an abstract kind of a thing

Speaker 3:          05:58          we were doing. Did you dress in wheel costumes when you recorded this? Didn't need to do for the only line moving. It was exhausting. It has been so hot. It's really hot. Yeah. You're Bailey's a big Beluga whale and a destiny is a giant whale shark and they're kind of a brother, sister relationship and they get on each other's nerves, but they're very sweet and they ended up, uh, trying to help dory out.

Speaker 1:          06:25          Great. And we have an exclusive clip we're going to play here in just a few minutes, uh, with your two characters. So what, bring that up here in a little bit. Um, but Ellen, so you know, you're returning to the character of Dory. It's a really, really emotional story about her trying to find her parents. So, um, you know, when you first read the script, was there anything that you were able to bring to the scripts or tell Andrew, I'm looking for this and the character, I want to go this direction?

Speaker 3:          06:46          Um, no, I, I mean, this guy is a genius. This, I, I'm not going to tell him how to write a script. Um, I mean, when I was in the room I changed a lot. But I, yeah,

Speaker 5:          06:57          no,

Speaker 3:          06:57          but you know, that's what's great about it. The script is fantastic. The script is what it is, but it's, it's open and free enough that you do, you know, 50 takes and, and you can then he did you just do whatever you want to do and he chooses, they choose whatever it turns out to be the best one. So it's always the first.

Speaker 1:          07:17          But you know, it's four years writing this thing. I mean, so we're doing, but there was over 10 drafts of this story done over that time. And they know that what we're working with them and you also adapt to the actors once their cast. So you're, you're, you know, I'm learning just as much from them and we're rewriting to play to their strengths so that it's like hopefully comfortable shoes almost. And they, and, and you just, it becomes a little symbiotic at a point. And Eugene, you play Charlie. Yes, that's correct. Other of Dory. Yeah. So what can you tell us about Charlie and oh, well it was a, it was exciting to play a, a dad who has a child not doing strange things with pies.

Speaker 5:          08:00          Uh,

Speaker 1:          08:02          that was a big plus.

Speaker 5:          08:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:05          That was me. That was like your first question in the

Speaker 3:          08:08          yeah, write that out.

Speaker 1:          08:12          Does dory eat baked goods? No.

Speaker 5:          08:15          Uh,

Speaker 1:          08:16          no. It was kind of a, it was a very charming, well, I was just, I was honored to be included in this thing and no question about that. And playing a dad, uh, you know, uh, have a child who is, you know, kind of memory impaired so to speak. So there, you know, there it's a, it's kind of a very funny, very amusing and, and there's something very heartfelt about playing, um, you know, a dad, um, where, whose child is off somewhere. You don't know what happened and you know, will they ever be able to, you know, how will they function because she has no memory, a short term memory. So, you know, um, it's, uh, it was interesting and complicated and fun and exciting. I mean, that's a real powerful part. Two and hit it and I'll get right back to you. But Andrew and Lindsey, when you're creating this story about you, you, it's very much of a comedic effect in, um, in finding nemo where you have Doris character with short term memory loss, but it's a real disability in, in life and you really, really hit it home in this film.

Speaker 1:          09:24          So was that, I mean, cause she's really struggling with it. You see in the beginning of the film you see it throughout. So was that a point that you really wanted to drive home and yeah. Well she's the main character. Once you have a main character, it has to be more depth to them and they, and you sadly are sort of forced into a bit of a straight man role when you were in the main character will the thing that it was always great about Doerries that I always knew that tragic side of her, that was always, uh, I always knew her optimism and her caregiving and her candy spirit with somewhat her armor to protect herself from the sense of loss she had. So it was just sort of flipping that on this film.

Speaker 3:          09:56          It was, it was great too, because I remember the day that you, uh, there was this the scene where I had to explain what short term memory loss was and how to explain it. And that was one of the Times that I could just go and talk about what, what to, how to explain it to someone was hurt.

Speaker 6:          10:13          I mean, it was funny and heartbreaking at the same time. And I think that's kind of what the movie really leans into on this one that it's like it's charming and, and that is dory and we kind of, you know, we were always trying to walk that line between the charm that was dory and that is Ellen. And then also the, you know, the kind of tragedy really of it and, and making sure that we never lean too, too far one way or the other, so that we felt like it was being really true to this character.

Speaker 1:          10:38          No, it was a delicate balance. I mean, that's what it was like in the beginning. The movie, you first, your initial reaction is to laugh. It's like, oh, that story. And then it starts getting deeper and you're like, Oh God, I don't like, it's, it's really, really intense. So, uh, Hayden, the new voice and Nimo, um, pretty exciting from my hometown of Chicago. So welcome here to California. Um, so what's it like to be an email?

Speaker 7:          10:58          Um, uh, it's very fun being able to pretend that I'm just a cute little fishing. I'm not, yes. And I'm not just me. I actually get to pretend that I'm something that's a very good idea and very fun to do.

Speaker 1:          11:14          Yeah, no, it's your were wonderful in it. It's crazy. Cause I was, when I was watching it and I actually didn't realize the first one, the trailers that they got a new voice, I was like, well of course it is 13 years later and you, you pull your sounded exactly like them. It's it, it's great. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          11:26          He's like the Darren of bewitched, you know, like he had to show your folks watch original Darren and it's really tough.

Speaker 1:          11:34          And so a lot of this takes place in, which is a great thing because you can finding an email, you'll see the characters going through open water and oceans and everything, and you have different apartments. But now you're in a marine institute and it's so for you, you, Lindsey and Andrew, when you guys were there, there's a lot of creative ways of how the characters get around the park. But what one of the most complicated scenes as a producer, Lindsay, you're just like, really?

Speaker 6:          11:59          Honestly that was the, it was when Andrew came and was like, so we've come up with this new character and he's an octopus. And I said, I'm sorry, what? And he said, he's an octopus boy. He's a step to posts. So you get one less technical. He is a Hank the octopus, no doubt is the hardest character. I think anybody at Pixar has ever done and took two years. I mean, normally our characters take kind of nine months start to finish. And this took two and a, he took two and a half years just to build and rig. Um, and so that was one where I was like, really? Does it have to be an octopus? Could you maybe not? Maybe turtle? No,

Speaker 1:          12:37          already have that now the front plastic, the first shot took six months to anime and we're, we're never going to get finished at this rate. But fortunately ready got smarter and faster. Gotcha. And what environments where some the most complicated ones cause you see them in pipes and

Speaker 6:          12:51          it's, it's actually, if you watch finding Nemo, you'll notice that there was like only three shots I think, where we allowed Andrew to put the camera in the corner of the tank of the dentist office. And it's because of the reflection refraction talking to people at Google and youtube. So I feel like I'm in a people, you understand me? Um, so it's, and it's really hard. I mean, we, we intentionally didn't do that because the computer couldn't do it and we had to direct it and fake it, all the lighting. And so the new renderer are actually allowed us to do much, much more. And we took do it everywhere. We basically, he did it everywhere. I'm like blue. Yeah, every possible container has glass and reflection in itself.

Speaker 1:          13:30          Gotcha. Um, and so, you know, are there any, you know what Andrew I loved was, you know, I remember watching, I'm a huge Pixar fan animation fan and I love watching in the first one some of the making of it and you kind of tacked onto this, um, flashback thing and the first finding email where you want to do flashbacks and kind of tell the story through that. And it's a great plot device that you used here throughout the movie as well to kind of tell Doris story. Um, was that something you immediately knew that you wanted to do? That is an 11th hour idea that saved our butts on this movie. We came up with it last fall, but a lot of people don't know Nima didn't come together until the last six or eight months. Um, like all the pieces where there we just didn't happen.

Speaker 1:          14:08          It didn't have them lined. Right. And so I feel like this movie is in good hands in a weird way because it did the same pattern. Um, but yeah, the first movie, all that tragedy you see at the beginning of finding Nemo, all that loss was actually flashbacks that were doled out. And it just didn't work. You didn't sympathize with Marlin. But once we saw his tragedy at the front, we moved it all the friends and something, all the lines we'd always had played fine. Everybody empathized with them. Um, and then this was the reverse. We have too much information at the front. And then when we doled it out and made it memories that Dory or she has and is triggered, she goes, it became like the inverse of the first movie in it. And it just felt right. And it was Jason Bourne.

Speaker 6:          14:45          You can take that into your own life. Start every conversation with your saddest.

Speaker 7:          14:52          It works.

Speaker 1:          14:55          And so now we're going to Q, a, uh, exclusive clip here from finding dory. So let's clear it up.

Speaker 7:          15:03          Can you please keep it down over there? My head hurts that my neighbor, he was brought in with a head injury. I know you're talking about me. Destinee uses echolocation but I've overheard the doctor's time writing every word you're saying about me. What's echolocation? Well, Bailey's head is supposed to put out a call and the echo helps him find objects far away. I'll put, apparently he's still healing now. I know you're talking about me. I really can't echo like I have this conversation again. I get my head very hard out there and see how it's falling in his head is supposed to be big. You're a Beluga. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          15:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:47          So ty and Katelyn, those are your guys' characters. Uh, Bailey and destiny. Did you guys record it altogether to get some of the dynamic and Improv and we did. That was,

Speaker 7:          15:56          that was fun. We got to do two or three together is, you know, mostly you just in there by yourself with these guys. Right. Again, um, but we got to do a couple together and it was really fun because we're actors. We're used to working with these spies by the way, are amazing and they're too smart for us though. It's much. I'm always looked on people. Yeah. Yeah. She was looking for an idiot. That's your phone one. That's right. It makes me more comfortable. It makes me feel smarter. Um, yeah, that was actually,

Speaker 8:          16:24          that was new for me. I, I, I haven't done a ton of animation, but the chances to go in and be in the room with, well, Katelyn in particular who was so funny, um,

Speaker 7:          16:35          it's all, you know, the whole process is so collaborative.

Speaker 8:          16:39          Um, obviously we're not really tinkering with any of the major writing, but these guys were just so smart and so much changes as you're doing it. Um, the, when we were able to do it together

Speaker 7:          16:50          really felt the freedom to play around a little bit and see what else.

Speaker 8:          16:54          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          16:56          that's great. So we're going to bring up our, uh, one of our youtube top creators smoothing to ask him questions that he got from our social media, a social media handles. So let's bring him up.

Speaker 7:          17:09          Hi, check, check. How's it going guys? All right. So we asked a lot of our youtube subscribers and the youtube people's out there some questions and a lot of them were coming toward you,

Speaker 8:          17:20          Andrew.

Speaker 7:          17:22          They want to know how you go about selecting

Speaker 1:          17:25          voices for your movies. Oh, well, you know, everybody knows the term that the camera loves them. They're very photogenic. But I like to say there's a term with a microphone. Loves them. There are people that just have voices that you can just hang a character on and sitting in front of you. Or five amazing example. Six, I'm sorry, I can't count today. Six examples was either the one you weren't yeah,

Speaker 7:          17:46          yeah, I wasn't thinking year. My girlfriend is not loving. Sorry. There's five people in front of, you know, four, no, wait a minute. Say One guy who just tries super hard,

Speaker 1:          17:59          a hard working guy, but it's true. Like when you want it. Like I, I was started out as an animator, so I really recognize like when you hear a voice that you just, you can't help a project, a character on, you can't help it. Like want to see a acting from out of, out of, out of, out of a different character. It, it's a it. And so you end up with these lists sometimes. Um, uh, Ellen herself as somebody I wasn't thinking of at the time when I was really an early days of riding on finding Nemo and then I heard her off of the television set and boom, you know, it, it's suddenly matched. I'd been a fan of Albert's, you know, ever since I can remember watching going to all of his movies and listening to his comedy albums and sorry, just waiting for the right role to fall for that. And then Katelyn, same thing. I'd sort of been a fan of her voice and tie and a hate and I discovered, and Eugene of all these are people that I've just been fans of hearing and I just go, they would be perfect, but you're just waiting for the right.

Speaker 2:          18:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:55          Character that you're coming up with and hope that somebody else hasn't grabbed them before you do.

Speaker 2:          18:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:00          What's the other thing too, on Youtube? A lot of us are one man production teams and a lot of us do animations. So there's a lot of people are wondering how do we start off? Anybody that wants to be involved with animation, the process, just out the gate. What would you recommend as far as programs for anybody starting out? God, I don't know. I mean I'm too old now. I don't, I don't know. I started out with Pencil and paper. I still use pencil and paper. I don't know if anybody knows what that is. But all of the school like stone age stuff. Yeah. All I can say is it's so easy. I mean, now you can make a movie in your house. Like, like I get to steal stuff like when I did it, you know, to like get them to get movies made and my backyard stuff. But so I'd just say like do it. Do you grab whatever you can and do it. Like there's nothing stopping you. So just do it. Oh, this is for the cast of all the new characters. Excluding yourselves. Who's your favorite character in finding dory?

Speaker 1:          19:58          I'm a Hank fan is rude and you can't choose. You can't choose yourself to that question. Can we move on to Shrek?

Speaker 7:          20:04          Yeah, that'd be good. I'm studio. Uh, I mean this one was popping up a lot. Uh, we can go on to, all right. What about other animated Disney films, if you could be,

Speaker 1:          20:15          and any of those other animated Disney films, or what movie would you want to be in?

Speaker 6:          20:18          I, I'm a huge fan of all the Pixar movies and particularly all of Andrew's movies. I was a huge fan of Wally and all the toys, stories, those are just, I watched those before I had kids and then I, my little boys love those movies. So those are the ones that are always on. And so when I got the call about this, I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't care what I'm playing, but yes, whenever I'd like to get the candles sticker go and beauty and the beast.

Speaker 7:          20:42          Nice.

Speaker 1:          20:46          Broadway Virgin. No, not matinees. What, what about you hate in any other movie, Aladdin, Lion King, any of those that you'd want to be in?

Speaker 9:          20:55          Um, I don't really know if I'd want to be in any other movie besides this one.

Speaker 3:          21:02          Yeah, you're checking

Speaker 1:          21:05          Buenas Ellen, what about you?

Speaker 3:          21:07          Uh, same answer. I would never, this is the one I thought dory was great in finding email.

Speaker 9:          21:14          I'm joy

Speaker 3:          21:16          site out would have been fun. I like joy that, uh, I mean I'm very happy being dory.

Speaker 1:          21:24          Eugene. Anybody?

Speaker 1:          21:27          No, I, I, you know, the thing of it is really these pictures, all the pictures are animations are so incredibly great that, and the process is so much fun to do. I mean, I don't know if anybody really understands exactly what you do when you're in a studio, but it's really quite amazing. And when you get to work with, you know, incredible, incredibly talented like genius people here, uh, where are you kind of just give a line and they, as you're giving the line and the in the, in the, in the scene, they kind of know they're making changes as they're going, try it this way, try it this way. And it's all happening in milliseconds and it's just like, it's an incredibly exciting way to work because I got to act with Diane Keaton. So that's probably why he's on a high. I know my wife isn't here today. Um, yeah, so that was a, that was good. That was kind of a fun too. But yeah, I I, you know, I would say it's just, it's a really fun way to work doing animated films and when the scripts and the stories or as as exciting as a finding dory, then you know, you're, you consider yourself very lucky. Okay, awesome. That's all the time I have for you guys. Uh, we have some crowd questions later, but I'm going to toss it back here. Thanks so much for your time guys. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          22:52          Nice teachers.

Speaker 1:          22:57          Thank you Suzy. So we're going to take some audience questions. I think they're going to start lining up here. Um, here we go.

Speaker 2:          23:06          Yeah.

Speaker 9:          23:07          Hey, you hear me? Yeah, I kind of want to ask a question of everyone, but I'm going to focus on dory, so don't be offended. It's all good. You're all cool. So my question to you is in finding dory, when are the mantras for me was just keep swimming, which is, I'm a plus size, health and fitness motivators. I help women like me starting to engage with fitness. So to me it's about the journey, bracing the journey. Just keep moving no matter what happens. Just keep going. Well loving who you are in the body you're in. So what I'd be curious to know is what is your life lesson coming out of finding dory? Did you have that moment that just keeps swimming moments that really stood out to you? Um, well, my life is, that's my motto as well. That's my motto, I think. Okay. It's yours and I'm now we'll share. So sorry to know, steal it from you second law suit. Oh, I'm aggressive. Um, well it was, it was kind of like

Speaker 3:          24:01          my motto. It wasn't completely my motto.

Speaker 2:          24:03          Okay. Um,

Speaker 3:          24:07          because I think if anyone knows my story, it is, I had to just keep swimming. I, you know, my life has been a lot of challenges and a lot of the different curves and uh, and uh, roadblocks. And so I think that's a great, you know, I didn't come up with Jessica keep swimming, but it has turned out to be something that a lot of people can hold onto and use in their life. And so I would say that just everything I think is, I'm, I am so blessed and lucky that that's part of my character that I get to say just keeps, keeps swimming for whoever you are and whatever you're going through.

Speaker 9:          24:41          Well, thank you for that cause it's a big life changer. So thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          24:46          Thank you. Ready next. Awesome.

Speaker 9:          24:55          Hello. I just wanted to know what your favorite aspect of working on this film has been, whether it's recording, fleshing out the story, promoting it, et Cetera, of anyone you've had the big you've had probably the most to from. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          25:11          Uh, it's honestly, working with the actors is probably my favorite simply because they're sitting in front of me. Um, no, it's, it's actually because it's the one part of this process over four years that's spontaneous where you're actually doing a lot of give and take in the moment and you're kind of, you're in the now and you're just reacting. And, uh, I find that so exciting. I get very little of it waking in an animated pictures, so I'm pretty hungry for it when we do these sessions. I know they're grueling, they're long, these guys stand around for four hours and they're just on the whole time. So they're basically doing a one person show. And a lot of them I know I've said that it's the most tiring thing they do simply because there's no breaks built into it. And, um, but um, it's, it's pretty invigorating. It's pretty exciting

Speaker 2:          25:57          to me.

Speaker 9:          26:04          Hello, I'm Christina cal from the channel back girls ball. Um, this question is for everyone. A lot of people in the audience, including myself, are content creators here at Youtube. And I just would like to ask you all what advice you'd like to give us with building our careers.

Speaker 1:          26:22          Get Super Lucky.

Speaker 2:          26:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:26          It's weirdly lucky. Oh,

Speaker 9:          26:28          that's a horrible advice. Horrible advice. Well, someone asked a question earlier about to Andrew about how do you animate something and you know, I would say the answer

Speaker 4:          26:44          is the same and match a story. You start with that, you start, you're a content creator, so you don't start with the actors. You don't start with the [inaudible], you start with a story, you start with the content. And if you have a great story, it can fit a hundred different ways to tell it animation, it can fit live action. So you know, think of great stories, just stories that you haven't heard. I would say that's a basis to start with.

Speaker 3:          27:20          I would say authenticity. I think whatever. I think when you, if something's happened to you in the same thing that Albert's saying, if you have a story, you're probably not the only person with that story. Whatever it is. And sometimes the best stuff comes out of the hardest stuff and the worst stuff that you've gone through. So if you've actually experienced something, I don't think anybody should hide any kind of truth. So whatever you have witnessed or experienced or gone through, find a way to express that and find a way to stay. And I think people read truth and authenticity and I think that's the most important thing for establishing anything.

Speaker 4:          28:00          And even if you don't have something, you must have a horrible uncle.

Speaker 9:          28:06          Thank you very much.

Speaker 2:          28:07          Okay.

Speaker 9:          28:14          Hello. Um, so I know a lot of you have experienced with Improv and just being quick on your feet and I was wondering how much room there was for improvisation. It seems like a lot from what you've been saying, but how that improvisation, uh, affects the process and the final product and how it might be different from other animated films as it was with finding dory.

Speaker 4:          28:40          Well, I don't Dunno, compared to other animated films are, are different. Some are the Simpsons that I've done. The whole thing was Improv'd. There's always a solid script here. And the thing about Andrew is that once she gets those words, if you're willing to keep going, he'll take every word in the English language out of you. So you know, by the end of the day you've given a lot of choices. Hopefully there's some choices he didn't think of and then they have to, the thing I'm most grateful for is I don't have to listen back to these recording sessions cause after 9,000 takes, I just took you chew

Speaker 1:          29:28          every, every person here. There's at least one or two lines if not more, that are in the finished movie of things that they came up with on the set that I would have never written. So,

Speaker 4:          29:37          but you know, it's generally an animated films I think generally welcome because it's at the stage where it's still, you're not coming into a finished movie where you have to fit the exact words in a mouth. So they generally, if you can do it, they welcome it.

Speaker 9:          29:55          All right. Thank you so much. This is a question for Ellen and Dory. How did you learn to speak?

Speaker 3:          30:11          Well, that's very good. First of all, um, I was in Hawaii and there was a woman who was staying in the house next to the House that I was renting and she was doing yoga and like crazy yoga on rocks and, um, and listening to whale sounds like, I didn't know you could buy that record, but there's a record that just is whale sounds. And uh, and I was listening to it and I just, it just was like the most, it was the weirdest thing I'd ever seen in my life. And I just thought a wave is going to take her out any minute. And it didn't kind of wanted it to happen because it was just so weird that she's on her head on a rock. And, um, so anyway, I just knew what a whale's sounded like. And so, uh, I didn't think I'd ever need to use it in life, but I did.

Speaker 1:          31:04          I was so scared to ask her this. I thought this is going to be the thing. This is going to be the sub Nima. This isn't gonna be the thing that makes me go, okay, I'm done. I'm not in this movie anymore. I'm out. And I'm like, would you be willing to speak well? And she told me this whole story right away and then just went right into it.

Speaker 3:          31:18          Oh, I can speak whale. All right. I've been waiting. Yeah. So that's it. And it's a, it's not easy. I mean, you did it very well, but if you have to do it a lot, it's very, uh, it's, it's tough on your vocal cords. You have to kind of warm up.

Speaker 1:          31:31          Caitlin had to do it a lot because her care characters, the reason dory knows how to speak well. So

Speaker 9:          31:36          yeah, it did it a lot. They'd look at me and go, um, one last thing. Okay, let's just do it. Give me some tea. Thank you. Thanks. Hello. My question is for Ellen. What was the craziest moment that have been onset when recording the movie, Finding Dory?

Speaker 3:          32:03          Uh, the craziest moment. I don't know if there was a crazy moment, but uh,

Speaker 9:          32:09          yeah, when your back went out you couldn't even stay at your back.

Speaker 7:          32:11          Well, I don't even remember that we didn't give it to the senior. So what happened like this stand up right before you came in,

Speaker 9:          32:18          do like a four hour session with us and we were like, we're really sorry. Could you do one more?

Speaker 7:          32:22          That's right. That's, well it's, I don't know. It was crazy. It was sad. Sad, sad. One of the saddest. Do you want a sad moment are crazy. Yeah. I forgot. And then I literally, I had to still do it time. I got in that horrible accident. Yeah, I remember that time when I was so crazy. Crazy.

Speaker 3:          32:40          Crazy. Ellen. Yeah. Um, I was going to say a, this is just an excuse to complain about it, um, that they, because dory is always either left behind or catching up to people. So there's a lot of hyperventilating like breathing really just, you know, it's that or it's like scream like a lot of those. And you'd think that once, I just did that, you could use that throughout the whole film. Right. But I had to do it all the time. I had to like in a just like, do you, don't you really have the already, so there was a lot of that. And when you see this film and you should see it many times, um, you, you will see that I don't do it that often in the film. And I don't know why

Speaker 7:          33:21          that was like your first comment that was like, that was like Ellen was like, I really loved it. Where was all the gasping and paper ventilating? Like literally that was her first question. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          33:31          Like where is it? So it's in the toys. Yeah. Yeah. I see. That's how they get ya. Thank you. Thanks. Okay.

Speaker 1:          33:46          Hello. Hi. Oh, who came up with the idea for Sia to cover unforgettable. And how did that all come about?

Speaker 3:          33:53          Oh Gosh, we know who exactly what we,

Speaker 7:          33:56          you always wanted the song. I just, that was always

Speaker 1:          33:59          said. They gotta have one syllable. That's the only thing I care about.

Speaker 7:          34:01          Just one. And we don't want to know what she looks like. Yeah, no, but it was, the song was always there. Like you always wanted that song at the end of the movie and you were new. We knew it was going to be covered.

Speaker 1:          34:12          Originally we wanted it Robbie Robertson and Robert said, Robert, it'd be amazing. Robbie Williams, the head actually covered, um, beyond the sea on the first movie. And so I wanted it to feel like that same sort of complimentary modern day singer plus an old classic and see you

Speaker 7:          34:26          pretty much at the top of the list. We were talking to you

Speaker 3:          34:30          in a session and they said, we need this, the song is going to be unforgettable. And um, they said, we're thinking of Sia. And I got my phone out. She was like, let's see how fast we can make this. I said, I'm right now. And so I texted her and she's like, are you kidding me? Of course I would love to do that. So it was like that quick. She just was so excited. So

Speaker 7:          34:50          turns out when you know islands and generous, you have to be a friend of Ellen. And it happened pretty quickly. I was texting the CEO too. That's a thing is she was texting with me when she got that text and I was like, all right, go. Ellen needs you.
