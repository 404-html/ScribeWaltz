Speaker 1:          00:08          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:13          I want to welcome all of you all to Google and to the youtube space. Um, I can't imagine that anybody doesn't know who these people are. We got Chris Webber, Lisa, Leslie, Nate Robinson,

Speaker 1:          00:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:29          4 times Olympian, five times, all star, three times, slam dunk champion. The list of accomplishments goes on and on. Next. Nate, the only one's ever actually done that.

Speaker 1:          00:50          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:52          um, but we're not talking about a number of things today. I'm excited to be here. I'm Nelson voice by the way. I work at here at Google and I'm thrilled to have the best seat in the House with these lovely folks up here today. Um, so everybody knows, I think that, uh, uncle drew in theaters nationwide on Friday, of which all of these folks are stars. Uh, it's going to be exciting. I saw the movie last night. It was incredible, um, in very, very funny and all of your digit thing. I will tell you that for sure. Um, just to give you all a little bit of the premise of the movie. Um, there's a, a gentleman who under unfortunate circumstances is unable to feel his team at the Rucker. So for those of you who don't know Rutgers, a playground tournament up in Harlem, happens every year.

Speaker 2:          01:34          It's incredible. A number of historic players have come out of that. Uh, but there's one player in particular played by Kyrie Irving who has the opportunity to go ahead and field a team, uh, from the past, if you will, to come back and play the Rucker once again in hopes of winning the championship. And that's when all these folks come into play. Um, it's based on the character of Uncle Joe. You all, some of you may know based on a Pepsi, uh, created digital episodic, uh, that was very popular and ultimately became a movie, uh, with lion's gate, our friends at lion's gate. So to that end, uh, you know, this question is for everyone. How did this come together? Right? How did it go from kind of an episodic to a movie? And did your agents reach out to you or did you guys actually audition?

Speaker 2:          02:21          Uh, how did it work? Well, Lisa definitely audition. I'm gonna let her tell y'all stories. It's awesome. Her story is pretty cool tomorrow, but, uh, I just booked hiree until you told me. Yes. So every, every game that we had, I played against them. We, you know, he's at the Fredo mine and I'm like, [inaudible], so can I be down bugging them every time you check it in the game, Bro, I'm serious. We're up. So, uh, you know, then he hit me on Twitter. It was like, were you serious about, you know, being in a commercial? And I was like, yeah, of course. Of course. And, uh, and that's, that's how, that's how I'm here. The origins for next. Okay. Lisa, what about you? I got it. My agent called and that they are

Speaker 3:          03:00          doing, they were shooting for uncle drew and there was a part for Betty Lou who's played the wife, a preacher and Chris Webber place preacher. And he hadn't had the part that time at that time, but I was going to be the wife. And Betty Lou obviously has to get buckets at some point. So, you know, I wasn't concerned about that, but I'm like, okay, so tell me more about Betty Lou. Betty Lou has to be in her seventies and I'm like, okay, got it. So I get off the phone with my agent and I go out of my closet and I go shopping a little bit and I came up and I was like, Babe, I was telling my husband who I called Babe. I said, Dave, been harder for me to get this part. I'm going to have to go in dressed as Betty Lou. Like they have to believe I can do this. So I went in full, full. I was Betty Lou when I walked into, when I got off the elevator, I was bent over hunched. Hey Baby. Hey y'all don't, I came in and talking to everybody. Oh yeah, Betty Lewis here. And can you just get the producer? No one showed up because they said they needed me to come full, please. You better move.

Speaker 1:          03:58          So I just walked in being Betty Lou.

Speaker 3:          04:02          Oh, everything with my bible and a Joe.

Speaker 1:          04:07          My agent called and said, I got the park fiery character in the movie. And what about to print? And she didn't tell you about her thought how stock is going to stop short.

Speaker 4:          04:25          Exactly. Uh, I got a call and I think that the part was already cast it and I knew that they were part of it. And of course I'm big fan of native, don't know Nate and Lisa is probably the out of all the athletes private acting along this and modeling all this stuff she did. And so, uh, I've been in the church my whole life. He's just going to ask you about that because my father is like a deacon in the church. My mom was a choir director, someone who kids would get whooped, visiting the church to come back and have to sit up there and all that stuff. And so it was, uh, you know, it wasn't a better role for me than to be a basketball player, which, you know, I played basketball and then to emulate some of the passages I knew growing up. So I tried to take them along with some great movies. You know, you know all the other guys that have done it and hopefully, uh, it's, it's, you know, when you say it a good movie, I'm thinking of the audience. They're like, yeah, right. Because that's, I think we all knew it had the potential to be Super Corny, super bad,

Speaker 1:          05:20          terrible. And uh, know the answer to that get, what did I get to keep my brand reel?

Speaker 4:          05:35          The script was funny when I read the script, I was laughing out loud and I was like, you know what, this is going to be funny. So in the movie or at night, it was good that it came up like that. Now, I mean, I had the benefit of being at the premiere and you, you brought a little extra something to it. I will tell you that, oh, I'm not going to give it away, but there's a scene in the church that you all will remember free.

Speaker 1:          05:52          Amen.

Speaker 4:          05:55          So a little bit more about the movie, right? I mean, I think the kind of

Speaker 2:          05:58          underlying foundation about what's there is the pure love for basketball. Um, can you share with the, with the audience and the folks here today, the moment that you fell in love with the game?

Speaker 3:          06:11          Well, you know, I didn't fall in love with the game initially. I was not as sporty girl. I was really more into like I don't want to get hurt. My cousins, I had two amazing, I have amazing girl cousins who were like tough. I mean they're running, they're kicking butt and they're playing football with the boys and I was on the side like, do you guys need water? Like how is this not really, really know this is true story. I mean I was the cry baby of the family. Like I'm not, I wasn't really tough. But basketball for me really found me. I think it was more my destiny because I started playing in the seventh grade and I only played basketball because there was a girl who was in the ninth grade who was so popular. I'm like, why does everybody know her? And her name was Shay and she was on the basketball team and at that I want to be popular.

Speaker 3:          06:56          Hmm. So I'm going to play basketball, but I had one rule. If I fall down, I'm done. Thank God I did not fall down. Our team went seven and Oh, I won my first trophy. Smaller than this cup. No lie. And that show you have a say you get a trophy. I fell in love with, I got the trophy, the trophy to gold medal. I mean the fact that you, that was it. And I really fell in love it and I put in so much work and I realized that it would open up doors. I could get scholarship to college. My mom was not going to be able to afford a division one school. Um, and so then it started to make sense having good grades and playing basketball. I was really in education. Very nerdy. I know. Then look like it. No, just good. I was really into school. I really loved school, but basketball just opened so many doors that I had to stick with it. Beautiful. Beautiful. And that is your championship writing, is it not? What's this one is not. Okay. This one is my top 20 w NBA players. Of all time. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          08:04          on top of all that to the other ones are too healthy.

Speaker 2:          08:10          Nate, what about you? When did you fall in love with the money from me? I was brainwashed at a young age man watching Michael Jordan. I mean that's as a kid, you know, that's all you saw on TV for the most part. Uh, you know, it was watching guys like that that helped me, you know, believe that, you know, there is a way for me, a little guy from Seattle to, you know, make it to the league and I was just, I'm, I'm, I'm a different animal. I would just hungry as a young kid, 10 years old. I just, I just knew what I wanted to do. Yeah. Since that day and after that I just never looked back. Yeah. You were still hungry, man. Yes. As you want a mix. I'm a diehard fans. We can use it. And what about you, Chris? And he was killing when he was on the Knicks to, first of all, it made be a real humble too, because he could gone to a pro in football. That's why I want to stand up. Cause

Speaker 4:          08:56          I think basketball shows you, it's not about your size, but it's about your heart. You look at AI as small athlete. One of the nicest killers I've ever known in the game. And these guys, one of the best athletes the League has ever seen. I mean he's won three dunk contest or great, uh, DB and could have gone to the league. So he, he definitely was a different animal for me. I wanted to play football, I wanted to, that's what I want it to be a football player. And I fell in love playing sports in the street. You know, like we had a neighborhood that had a bunch of kids. So, uh, you know, in the summertime it was on two square running basis, like playing games. And so I just fell in love with sports. I just fell in love with friends and competition, that camaraderie. And I've been this height since ninth grade. So yeah, my body told me like, you do this, don't go over there and football, are they going to break away? So, you know, it came natural, but I always want it to be an athlete.

Speaker 2:          09:49          That's awesome. I didn't, didn't seem try out for Seattle. I tried out for to see how yeah, they gave me a little, I wouldn't call it a semi semi. Yeah, it was pretty cool. You know, I got to work out in front of Pete Carroll, the owners and a Russell Wilson was there. That was pretty cool. He gave me a football, signed the football for me. So yeah, I'm more of a, um, I'm more of a fan a lot of the time. Like I get, I get geeked out scene, you know, different athletes. Pretty cool. Good stuff. Speaking of players, right, as you guys were, as the movie came together, were there any other NBA or w NBA players that, uh, you know, tried to maybe join the cast that didn't work out or what would you have liked to have seen in the movie? Uh, you mean as in take our spots?

Speaker 3:          10:35          No, not in taking your spots. No, there, there weren't any other players. We played against other players, but there weren't a, other than,

Speaker 2:          10:45          I think Gordon was the only other NBA player. Right? Yeah, yeah. That was it. So assuming there's a sequel and I hope there would be one, who would you want to see join you all in the movie? Well, Kevin Duran was at the premier. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          11:00          And I told them after the move, because before I was like, I know what you're thinking. I was like, it's not going to be corn. He trusts me. He was like, all right. And then after he was like, Oh man, I love it. I'm in, I'm in part two. I was like, I don't tell me bye. I'll be your agent. I want to go.

Speaker 4:          11:15          Who are you? But, uh, you know, it would be fun to have Kevin Duran. I mean, to dress up, you know, we're all 70 years old plus in this movie. So, you know, to dress up and have some older guys, it, it, it'll be fun. Definitely. But I think our crew, the fact that we were all athletes, the fact that, you know, we're used to being vulnerable, we used to working hard. We used to ask him for help, um, that, that really made it a collaborative effort. The fact we didn't want to let each other down. I didn't want to let Betty Lou down and boots didn't want to let us down. And so it was uh, it was really unique. They say when you retired you missed the locker room and not the games. And I think that's true. And I got the locker room with these guys and know it was, I feel sorry for our

Speaker 5:          11:54          director Charles Stone, cause I'm sure it was like a professor teaching a

Speaker 2:          11:57          uh, uh,

Speaker 5:          11:59          a kindergarten class cause we were having fun every second, every second. All right, let's hurry up. Take the take an after that he would pull out a backpack with music and all the extras, it'd be dancing. He's like, oh no. Slow down. It's not. But we have fun. Definitely set the whole, the time.

Speaker 2:          12:15          So you mentioned two things. I want to talk about a little bit more. Uh, so the makeup, oh man. Talk a little bit about that. Cause I mean, it was full on transformation for all of them. I kind of, uh, for the first time I called my mom, I'm like, mom, I'm sorry for mega funny you for Phnom Maaco for hours. It sucked. Like literally is sitting there hours doing the makeup. I'm like, man, so this is what takes women's soul. Tell my girl like I feel you. So, uh, it was, it was tough. A little difficult for hours for my makeup, cause he know he had to cover all the tattoos and stuff for me. But it was, it was, it was still fun. Once I got the four hours out of the way and [inaudible] care of there, I'm like, yeah, when, when do we start? Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, it was long for me. Same experience.

Speaker 3:          12:59          Yeah. And women were a little bit more accustomed to being in a chair and not quite two and a half to three hours. So to get ready to be Betty Lou and have the prosthetics put on. I tried to think of it as being in the spa, you know, Tom down Sunday. And I would put my headsets on the wireless ones and take it behind my neck. And then I watched insecure and game of Thrones. So this was last August. So you know, I have to finish up the season. Right. So I just watch that every day until I had to have my eyes shut. And then, you know, I was good. The heart, I think the hardest part is probably taken it off cause I'm like yeah cause we had to wear wigs. Well yeah we all have wigs also. You know, I'm like listen, edges are really important. I mean I'm like listen, cause they, you know, they want to put blue. I'm like, okay listen, this is a movie but I need you to just pin this down and pin this down and Betty Lou will be fine. Uh, so, but the takeoff is a little strenuous because they have to basically exfoliate your face. Oh Wow. Yeah. And that's scrubbing it. And I'm like, listen, we need to look good. Chris had some little bit of rehash. Actually I think you had the biggest struggle.

Speaker 5:          14:08          I felt like I was getting burned with acid base is like I'm trying to me like I'm burning and it really hurts and my neck is coming off. But it was three hours and uh, weren't used to the makeup chair and still that switch him to my face cream actually. And this was an every day. Some beauty lessons every day. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          14:27          Like you guys have to moisturize boys, you need to moisturize. I didn't even know what does that mean? Where like when you leave here you need to the cream on and I come back, you know, fresh face because I've got a book and they're like, you don't have any irritation. I'm like, no guys, you'd have to moisturize it. So important for your life. Rhodan and fields guys look me up.

Speaker 5:          14:48          Green juice, word makeups coaches right now. Healthy

Speaker 2:          14:52          makeup coats. We had a green juice every morning. We do manage Kale, blueberry, Lisa Cobb was, you know, and thanks for keeping. I'm the mom. And you also mentioned the fund that you all had on set and the dancing, um, I'm not going to give the whole thing away, but there is a dance battle in this movie and I just wanted to kind of get the real, get the real school. So, so who's got the most skills? Nae [inaudible] me, I just couldn't wait to start the deadline. May, can we hurry this up like this is, this is my thing right here. Like the music, the fun it was, it was for, who surprised me most was Reggie Miller because he couldn't dance a lick and he would, he got out, he got out there, really show what he can do it. Reggie, we were currently practicing at our lunchtime there.

Speaker 2:          15:41          But the funny thing here, the funny thing is during lunch we are literally in our makeup, but we can't take our, our makeup off. So we're literally having conversations like this. But it was like funny. I was, I was telling us, he was like, Bro, this is funny. You got to tell an MBA story. I mean, I remember when I used to dunk on shack and I'm looking at him when you look like a real pretty sure Chris around you're looking at, you know, it was, it was pretty cool. Just the whole dancing and getting Reggie, you know, ready to dance with zero money. He was nervous the whole time. My gorgeous. Just enjoy yourself. I said just you're in a mess. You're good. Nobody even knows to do your days. But he did a great job. So you put them through a clinic? Yeah. How do you get them right ready to go to weddings and stuff.

Speaker 5:          16:24          He was socially awkward. Like you don't want it here. If I hit you with a back strain. Has Anybody at a party, what have you,

Speaker 2:          16:38          Nate dance class 101 too funny. Um, in terms of anxiety and all of you have done some level of acting, right? First pro game or first day on the set. Which one was more nerve wracking first program? Yeah, for sure. For me. Yeah. First pro game for sure.

Speaker 5:          16:58          At least you get a second take and you can mess up your check in the Cayman Lodge and why your first game you, you're done, you're gonna get embarrassed, period. That's what is going to be. So yeah, I'd much rather do that then in the first game.

Speaker 2:          17:10          I hear that, I hear that. So we'll, we'll pivot away from the movie for a second and talk a little bit more about kind of a career and life stuff, right. Um, what was the most challenging time in your career and how did you overcome it?

Speaker 3:          17:26          Oh Wow. And use this

Speaker 2:          17:28          dag deep. Huh? Most challenging time? Probably I would, my

Speaker 3:          17:32          career was when I was at USC, um, as a college student. And I would say it was challenging because I went to USC and it's a school that is a private school that students are known to be a little bit wealthier than the average. And so I remember there being times where I didn't have like a lot of money as a student athlete and you know, like you'll have five bucks and you're like, okay, I'm an order a Burrito, cut it in half. And he this half at this point and he, this happened the other time. There were times where I remember that, but I also remember thinking like, this is not the way it's always going to be. Right. But I really, I wouldn't say I enjoy my struggle, but I understood when I was in moments when I didn't have that, you know, it was up to me to figure out ways and to find a way to make it, and it wasn't my mom's job.

Speaker 3:          18:21          You know, once you get to college, it's like you gotta you gotta figure it out. You've got to figure out how you're going to make it, how you going to be successful. And that's why lean so much on my education and getting my master's in business and just really wanting to make sure that, you know, I would never be in that situation again financially. Oh Wow. I'm so blessed and thankful. I, I love the, I just feel like we have so many opportunities and you have to keep taking them in now with social media and just so much information at our fingertips is there's no reason why people should not be doing what they love to do their job. They lift. I just haven't had five jobs. I overdo it because of what, probably my struggle. But, um, you know, that's the compensation I think I make

Speaker 6:          19:01          sure Nate, Chris, anything to contribute to that challenging time? I would say mine, it didn't come until I got to the league, to the NBA really. Cause you know, everything's been hard for me. So being a little guy, sure. You know, so, but the hardest one thing when I got to the NBA was like, they wanted me to be somebody that I wasn't. And now for me that was the hardest thing because I was just like, Yo, I just thought as a kid I just want to play basketball, you know? So, you know, they were big on, you know, attitude and the way you add behavior. And it was just hard for me. I'm like, Bro, I just want to hope. I just, I'm happy to be here. You know, every game. It was like different superstar Vince Carter today. All words, right? Like this is crazy.

Speaker 6:          19:41          So I was just enjoying the moment. I was enjoying the moment. So my biggest struggle was like every, every day. It was like, all right and you got to chill, like blah, blah, blah. I'm like, you guys are so worried about everything other than basketball. And I didn't understand that. So that was, for me, that was the hardest thing dealing with, you know, being a, a starter and a player that you play all the time your whole life and come to the league and you're just coming off the bench. Some games you don't play. That was hard. That was really hard for me. But I enjoyed the ride. I enjoyed the ups and downs and roller coaster was fun. It was challenging and I had the best seat in the house every night. That's all I had to switch. How I thought the process of not playing. I'm like, you know what? I'm going to just embrace this. You know? I'm going to just embrace, you know, me not playing and then I'm gonna just get on everybody's nerves, ass jerseys. I need shack, I need your jersey. I was going to ask every different person for their stuff to keep me, to keep me, you know, where I needed to be. So absolutely right. Chris, what about you man? Like you just said, it's been a little coasters and I think that for me it was my rookie year because I was having

Speaker 4:          20:47          success, but at home, people in my neighborhood was going through things that I couldn't help them with back in the truck. So it was a little bit of like survivor's remorse and you know, you have to take responsibility for the choices that you make. But some of my friends, uh, at that time, they choices that, you know, I'll never see them again when they were killed or, or whether they're in jail for the rest of their life. And so, yeah, here it is. You know, you're reaching the dream and you're making it and you're loving it. And, uh, you know, when you're younger, sensitive, you should be sensitive all the time, but you're young and you're wondering why you and why not them, you know? And I just remember the whole season. I don't think I enjoyed it as much because I was living at home and my mind wanting to bring them with me and will, and then to see all of this stuff and things I've never seen.

Speaker 4:          21:37          It's the most exciting time in the world. And you have people you can't see it and don't realize, listen, you, you know, you, you can do whatever you want. You know, it's, I just met somebody out here and it's doing great. And they didn't even finish second grade. They just had a hard work at the look. You can do it, you know, more stories and inspiration. I wanted to take that to them and let them see it. But it was really hard at that time to, to find that balance. You want to save the world and all your friends at one time and it takes a while to sell. For me, that was tough. Having success reaching a dream and in the kids that I dreamed with. Hmm. You know we veered off at a point of a dream and it was like, Dang, I wish you could bring me with, so that was tough. There was talking. I hate it and I can relate to that area very well.

Speaker 2:          22:19          Um Oh we'll say man, I've got like four or five questions. I wish I could ask you, but we're gonna make sure that we spend enough time letting some of the folks in the audience asks you some questions. But before we go there, we're going to do a little speed round. Oh it's, you guys want to play games? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I told him cause all of you went in this one. So this is, this is going to be a, it's not fair cause she always wins the games we play seriously. But this is a, this or that. Throw out two things and you just go, don't think about it too much. Just choose one or the other. What is our answer? The answer is one or one or the other. You'll see.

Speaker 7:          23:05          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          23:16          we're going to start with Nate and we're going to go to Chris and we don't keep going back around. All right. Dog or cat? Dog. Oh, Mac or PC? Mac. Text or call. Call. But I'm lying.

Speaker 7:          23:35          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          25:39          let's open it up to the audience. We've got a microphone over here.

Speaker 2:          25:43          Hair.

Speaker 3:          25:44          Oh, y'all can't be shy. Thank you. Come on now we up here. I've got more questions I can ask. I don't want to call it. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          25:49          that. Thanks so much for coming. This is pretty much like a dream come true. The question for all of you, who was your favorite person to play again?

Speaker 2:          25:55          It's been why play against? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          25:58          Oh, to play with. I mean either way

Speaker 4:          26:03          to play a gifts for me, our have to shea, it was Michael Jordan one time we would play him in the playoffs. You have 54 points, maybe something like that. And I looked at Jawan, my teammates and in front of Jordan and we will work out when I was like,

Speaker 5:          26:17          oh, he sold his soul to the devil. He's not supposed to be making these shots. I know. Trying to get them off and I really thought like he sold like he may stuff, man, they do not. It's not humid

Speaker 4:          26:27          possibly. So it was great trying to take him down knowing that it probably wasn't a chance that you were going to do it. So I stayed a great Mike Resort.

Speaker 3:          26:36          Yeah. I think that would say Lauren Jackson. I enjoy playing against her cause she was, she was really a tough player to guard and stop and we had so many battles and yeah, she was, she, she was, she's the real deal. I mean from between her three point shot and her ability to score inside was the most challenging to stop their pick and roll and shopper inside. And she could block my shot only on one side. I had finally figured that out. I'm like, Gosh, she getting my shot. So I had to go left. But um, she was the most challenging player. I think I play it again,

Speaker 6:          27:08          uh, from, you probably are person cause I was a little guy growing up watching another little guy like change the whole league. I don't understand like what he brought to the game. Uh, he was okay for, he made it okay for people to be themselves, you know? And then for me, I hit a game winning shot over him, changed my life forever.

Speaker 7:          27:32          Thank you

Speaker 8:          27:35          sir. Thank you all for coming. Um, I can think of highlights of, of many of you, the things that you all have done, but I'm just interested in what's your best highlight or yourself.

Speaker 6:          27:47          Oh Wow. I could help.

Speaker 7:          27:51          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          27:54          I would say for me my best highlight both say mom, my children, uh, that maybe more so than basketball. They, they're a part of me there, you know, I'm trying to shape them to be the best, you know, people they can be growing up, you know, sports education wise and just living life for the full list and what it is. So for me it would be my children for sure.

Speaker 3:          28:17          That was such a great answer. I was, I thought basketball initially when you asked. So basketball, just in terms of highlights, I mean it's one thing to represent, you know, my city and state to have played in Los Angeles for the Los Angeles sparks my whole career, but to have represented our country is definitely the highlight for me to put on the red, white and blue. And I know we weren't like in the service, but it feels like you go into a war when you play against other countries. And to come out on top, just a little backstory, our USA team actually lost to, we lost in a world championship to Brazil and as you know Brazil, like even in soccer, they're very animated. They cheer. So there was so animated and this is the problem. They put us on the same bus to the game and back. Right.

Speaker 7:          29:07          So on the way

Speaker 3:          29:10          that home team USA, and it was one of the first times I got to the national team. So I was one of the younger players at that time. They had made a bet with their coach that if they beat team USA, which is a really big deal, that they could shave his head. Yeah. So they shaved his head on the bus while we rode back with him. So that level of disrespect I've out, we will never lose, not always to Brazil, but we had never, you know, cause we ended up with a bronze metal for the world championship, which is like, I don't even know where that metal, if I accepted

Speaker 1:          29:41          does that or not

Speaker 3:          29:44          bratty. But the highlight then is to go on and win four gold medals. I have also have to world to gold world championship medals in, nobody ever talks about but to go on and win, go for the rest of my career wearing red white blue is a highlight for me

Speaker 1:          29:58          though USA. Oh it was awful. The clippers out his hand, thrown it off.

Speaker 4:          30:11          Um, wow. Uh, I'd have to start with baby playing in college and playing with the group of guys in the Fab five or that time. And um, the reason why you don't need talks about his mentality and if you get to know Nate, you know, he's still that 10 year old man. He's still a beast when it comes to sports in this mentality. But to be at that age, I think all you guys understand, or maybe you're in that space now, to be free mentally, to know that the world's against you and Tim embrace it and to take it on and, but not be bitter enough where you've experienced thing and it, and it turns sad. It's more so like an embracing of taking on the world and playing with those guys was just so much fun because we were on the same page. We all were dumb, young and naive and believe we could do it all. And that's a great place to be when you work hard, you know? And so, uh, I would just say being with those guys every day, having them affect my life and who I was and doing those true friendships and uh, and then the highlights, dunking on people too with those guys. And I know it's a lot of fun. Thank you, Lisa. I'm surprised you didn't say that. Dunk.

Speaker 3:          31:22          Yeah, that's other people's highlights.

Speaker 1:          31:23          Yeah, that's true. Right?

Speaker 8:          31:29          Hey, thank you guys for coming and stopping by here. Um, so fast forward, you know, 50 years from now, a hundred years from now, uh, if you could have one game that your great, great grandchildren could watch of yourself, which game would you pick and why?

Speaker 3:          31:46          Oh Wow. Wow.

Speaker 1:          31:48          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          31:52          Say I'm the, I have not a lot of games in my whole career where I have triple double, but I do have one in particular where I had 10 blocks and I, I won defensive player year. I loved playing, I loved playing defense. It was, you know, playing both ends of the court of course. And people know about the scoring, but I really loved defenses. So I have one game where I had 10 blocks and I would, if for my son and daughter who plays sports and plays basketball, I would like for them to see that game because I think that game was just so complete, whether it was scoring or rebounding and blocking shots, but the defensive effort and it was a championship. So that was really important. But yeah, 10 blocks, that's pretty good. Right?

Speaker 1:          32:37          [inaudible] get that out of here. Yeah, that game was pretty cool.

Speaker 4:          32:44          Uh, 50 a hundred years from now when our kids to see you said, or great grandkids, great grandkids. I always say, uh, I would say, I think I had 28 points, 13 rebounds, but it was in a game. I call a time out at the end of the game. And I will have, I was showing him that because I would want them to know you're going to go through things in your life, even when you did your best and uh, you won't win. Maybe you'll make a mistake, maybe you'll lose. But look how good of a game it was. Look how it turned out at the end. And hopefully they will see, wow, that was the most dark moment. And hopefully it would have asked the question, what did he do after that? You know, me. So hopefully that would teach them to have a great game.

Speaker 4:          33:25          Do your thing, kill it. Do yourself when, if you run into a, you know, a big speed bump, go ahead and cry. Get Out of your system, get around some people that love and support you. Forget it and keep moving. You know, even the best guy, he's like, Lisa talked about our 10 blocks. I bet it's fun for her to think about it now because when she was a player, she's so competitive. She didn't think about a best games then cause she could always know I can get 11 blocks of 12 blocks. And so hopefully through that they were seeing our dad was a bad man. He made a, a mistake and look at that and then wonder how you get through it. And hopefully that would inspire them to never worry about the, you know, worst moments, even in the best times of their lives.

Speaker 6:          34:03          Yeah. I'm gonna say for me, uh, when I played with the Knicks coach, I had a coach named Mike Tony who sat me down. He didn't play me for a whole month. I never forget this. Uh, he sat me down for a whole month then give me a reason or nothing. And I'm the one new years I will, I called my mom, I'm like, mom, I need you to come. You know, I need somebody there with me just to, you know, see if real familiar face somebody that I love and my mom's like my best friend. So I, Florida, Atlanta, and uh, I took her to dinner, we went eight and I ran into the coach. Uh, I ran into Atlanta hawks coach and he was like, you playing on what tomorrow? I was like nine and been playing for like a whole month. So it was like 14 games. He sat me and uh, he ended up putting me in a game the next day and I ended up having like 41 points. We won the game, went to over time and the whole time I kept my mom, Sharon,

Speaker 1:          34:57          so loud. They're like over everybody gas, right? Nate Daddy. Oh yeah, like the whole, I'm like, yeah. I was like, that's mom dukes. You know, as a kid I always, you know, you hear that,

Speaker 6:          35:10          that reassurance that mom is there, you know what I'm saying? For me. So, you know, I would just, I just played that game for her and it, it changed my life because, you know, it was a big story. Sports Center, you know, a coach send you down for a month, you know, I worked out hard before the game, ran bleachers still did my workout. So that would be something I would love for my grandchildren know, like even through, you know, you go through adversity, you just stay ready no matter what because when your number's called, you know, I could easily just not been ready and just say whatever or even told him, no, I don't want to go in. I just say, you know, I'm going to take full advantage of this. I'm gonna see where it gives me. I said, God, just don't let me make the first shot because it's a wrap. I make this first one at the, you know, sitting down a month. So that was for me, that'd be probably the game coming in and helping my team and we want to, that was a big, that was a big deal. And all my teammates supporting me, they showed me a lot of love. It was pretty awesome. Thank you guys. We're going to take one last question.

Speaker 9:          36:05          Hey, awesome. This is awesome. So it looks like uncle drew is a movie about old school guys teaching the young ins. What's up, right? So when you were young, what's a bit of advice that you received from somebody older, wiser that helped you in your success in life

Speaker 4:          36:19          with me? The first day of practice, uh, I was drafted by golden state and I was so excited to me Chris money. So he's like one of the best shooters I was seeing on New Yorker. Talk like this, you know, I'll tell you where I've come over here. He cannot, cannot understand him. I'm excited and I wanted to just be around them. I bought a place where he lived. I just wanted the card and he had, I wanted to be around. And then the craziest thing is the more than shooting more than anything else after practice, he brought me into the training room and he said, this is what I want you to do every day. It was a hot tub and the Koto you said, I want you to go two minutes in the hot tub, two minutes. Nicole took two minutes from the hotel.

Speaker 4:          36:55          I'm like, come on, you don't need to stretch when you're young, you can do everything. And then I found myself doing that every game it through all the injuries. I found myself 15 years later doing that, what he told me. So he really taught me how to take care of my body with nutrition. He was at the end of his career and telling me all that in the beginning really helped me kind of at least focus my mind and be ready to listen to my body and stay prepared the whole time. And I think he had a big influence on how I take care of my body hot prepared in the summer because he was relentless in his training. And I think that was the basis for, you know, having a, a pretty good career for me,

Speaker 3:          37:30          for me. Um, as a kid, I think, um, my mom was my biggest inspiration and she shared a lot of things with me being a single parent, raising three girls. She would, and then just being so tall, like I was, I've been taught all my life. My second grade teacher called home, it was like, they, you realize they says taller than me and the rest of the chosen. And my mom's like, yeah, well what's the problem? You know, so, you know, my mom was like, I'm six to her dad's six, four. And she said, oh, okay, we'll excuse the call. So being this tall all my life, um, having my mom be so positive about, you know, my posture and sitting up straight and that, you know, some people grow on the inside and some people grow on the outside and our family's been blessed enough to do both.

Speaker 3:          38:15          So don't be ashamed of being tall and you have to stand up tall. And you know, there was a lot of that when you're tall and people ask you every single day, do you play basketball? And you're like, no. Like, why do you, I don't understand the association with my height and, and basketball. So for me through just through grade school, it was always this barrage of questions and people talking about my height and it was really annoying. When you're a kid you don't really get the whole comments and stuff. So my mom was always constantly dropping in these seats of building me up and making me feel confident and comfortable in my own skin. And I think that the biggest takeaways that she would tell us was small things. Like you can't receive anything with a closed fist. So always have an open hand and helping other people, you know, we're all God's children.

Speaker 3:          39:03          Just, just really a, a voice of love and positive positivity that eventually my sister and I were always like, we're our mother's daughter. Because all we do is if somebody says, oh my God, this headache is killing me. No, don't say that because it's not killing you. You just have a headache this moment, but you're going to be better. And then, you know, everything is like this whole positive affirmation, but I love it. And the other thing she would tell us was the seven P's. The seven p's are proper prior preparation prevents Piss, poor performance. So the seven p's with simply whatever you want to do, whatever you want to get out of life, you got to do it. You got to work hard, but you're going to get out of it. Whatever effort you put into it. So if you're going to do it or did your mom say, do it right there. Don't do it at all because you're going to go back and do it anyway in our house. So it was all of these positive affirmations that my mom kept getting, my sisters and I that I felt helped mold me into being able to accept. I didn't, God knows, I didn't know I was going to get to six five mm.

Speaker 1:          40:01          Like this is ridiculous. I'm like, you know, stop. What are we doing here? You know, cause six

Speaker 3:          40:08          like six foot in the sixth grade. I know, I know, right? Sixth Grade I was six foot, they got, my teacher was six two and there's other ones are boys, Samuel, he was six foot. So I'm like perfect. And the tallest people got to be the line leaders. I was so excited cause it's usually the tallest or in the back.

Speaker 1:          40:25          You guys don't feel me, but listen, this is like a struggle here, right? His people [inaudible] exactly. You're always the line leader. Right. Who made up that rule.

Speaker 3:          40:40          So anyways, so all of that was just, I feel like my mom being so positive and knowing ahead having to fruition because her growing up in the 60s being tall, it was just like, what are you doing? Like who told you you could grow? We're going to have to get shoot shoe boxes for you. She goes, you know, it was a negative thing and parents and people made negative comments about tall women. So I'm thankful that my mom gave me all of that positive affirmations and for all the tall women in the room feel good, represent, keep your head up high. We are just queens amongst the people. All got tall people problems

Speaker 1:          41:19          was the other one will come from my mother's.

Speaker 3:          41:23          Well she really, uh, she really wasn't the vocal. She led by just showing a three jobs to care. Three kids are all on her own, and I just, her just hustle

Speaker 6:          41:34          and grind every day. And she just, and she smiled doing it, you know? So, uh, my mother had been working for Boeing for like 30 years, and you know, she's, she been a janitor for 30 years and she's never complained a day in her life. And she just goes. So I just, I think that's where I get my hunger and drive from miss from higher for sure. Thank you. Thank you.
