Speaker 1:          00:03          The toxic. I'm Kevin Valcon. We're here with the suicide squad cast, so let's welcome them. Yeah. Are you guys the real versions in the mini versions of you guys? Cool.

Speaker 2:          00:24          A huge blockbuster hit coming up this summer for you guys on August 5th so thank you guys all for being here. David, this is your movie. I'm just absolutely phenomenal. And you know, it's, it's essentially a film about a villains brought out of Arkham asylum and jails, all orchestrated by Ed Amanda Waller played by Viola Davis. And she gets pretty during the film. But so people were going crazy with this, with comicon and it's, you described this movie as bad versus evil, which is really interesting. So you need to talk about just what's the difference between bad and evil,

Speaker 3:          00:56          bad and evil. Uh, you know, the thing about evil, it's like a, it's like pornography. You know it when you see it

Speaker 1:          01:04          like, oh yeah, that's a ass dad is definitely, but at the end of the day, look, it's, it's, yeah, sure, these are the bad guys, but I think could flashback. That's a good way to start. That's a good way to start. Yeah, finally. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:27          No, no. Look, at the end of the day, it's, you have a group of a bad guys. He's a super villains, right? But they do have good hearts and maybe they don't know that about themselves in the beginning, but along the way they discover that and they actually see the good in each other, formed this incredible family, and then go on to do some wonderful things together and you know, maybe save the world in the process.

Speaker 2:          01:46          Awesome. And so will you play dead shot, big popular villain and Batman's know gallery? Why did you choose dead shot? So it would, they probably had your choice of superheroes, I would imagine, or villains. And so why did you choose this role over any other?

Speaker 4:          01:59          Uh, actually I didn't, it was

Speaker 1:          02:02          mighty awkward.

Speaker 4:          02:04          No, Dave came in, he pitched everything. I loved the character of Diablo. I was like, Yo, that's crazy. And Dave was like, dude, you did shot.

Speaker 1:          02:15          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:16          Oh, okay. Okay. Uh, you know, but really we all, we all see everybody signed on without a script, right? Nobody knows. So there was no script. You know, I had just seen fury and I knew David's work and he came and pitched the idea. And really as a, as a testament to David, we all signed on with, with without a screenplay. He pretty much laid out the characters that he saw for us in, in his mind. And we all signed on. It became a family with like sort of a kind of a, a, a loving, uh, malicious abuse, abusive father, right?

Speaker 1:          02:56          Yeah. Normal family

Speaker 2:          03:01          and Margo, you play a Harley Quinn, so it is absolutely phenomenal. You nailed the character. Um, it's, it's, she's really insane and you get to see the origin story of Harley Quinzel and it's, it's really, really just amazing how that's done the film. But what was the toughest part about getting her writes about? Just saying, oh, I found her,

Speaker 5:          03:19          uh, I mean the physical training and stuff started six months before we started shooting. So that stuff was more mechanical and I knew it was something I could learn if I put in the hours. The hard part was, um, finding the vulnerable side and not being scared to like, I mean the rehearsal process. I'm sure you guys have heard David has a pretty rigorous rehearsal process that everyone has to be involved in and, and it's super painful, but um, that, that side of it was tricky. And also trying to figure out the dynamic with the joker. I just couldn't understand why she was with him when he tries to kill her all the time. But it's your voice. The voice was hard to get to. I didn't, it, it's hard because the only portrayal of Holly's voice is super, super high pitched and animated and comical. But when you're doing a David Ayre film, there's going to be like really deep, gritty pots as well. So we needed to find an in between ground.

Speaker 2:          04:08          That's your Jay, uh, your character of El Diablo. It's without spoiling anything, the dynamic between you and will's character of Deadshot is interesting because you see in the trailer as well where it's, he provokes you a lot and you kind of want to contain your powers it seems like. And he just wants to bring them out.

Speaker 6:          04:23          Well, there's a, there's a really a, an important part of the film where, you know, his backstory is revealed and he's afraid to really open that side up because, uh, he did something horrific and this, this new group of people is becoming his surrogate family and he doesn't want to destroy them the way he's destroyed other people. So yeah, it's, it's interesting to sort of see that and be revealed, uh, during the course of the film.

Speaker 2:          04:51          Gotcha. Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:52          No saying it could be, is it, was it just his character is the most powerful really out of all of us. And he choose, he doesn't want to fight. And uh, that, that's, that's, it's such a beautiful thing. And yet you haven't seen the movie yet, right? You guys haven't seen it. Okay. So yeah, so I was making sure I was about to do it. Joel Ketamine show. Tell him how to tell him how it ends. Joel is great. It's really good. This is his, his nickname is spoiler alert. Well, Joe will tell any face. I can't say that I take the mic. When you were talking about, I was like, did I say that in the interview? But I tell him about his backstory.

Speaker 2:          05:37          Gara Gara you play a in Tantra switch, your character is as scary as hell. It's crazy. It's, you play dual roles. It is, it's crazy. And janitors is absolutely crazy. And uh, you know, you played archeologists. Yeah. So he played an archeologist and then, yeah. And so, um, but then in chapter it's like takes over your body. So we won't reveal how that happens. But, uh, what was it like playing just one of the creepiest villains we've seen? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          05:59          The dates. I don't think she's not scary. She's just a little daddy. I'm just saying she needs to go off or something. Um, I mean, I had a great item, had such a wonderful time, especially playing two characters. Um, it was just, I think the only thing I've found is difficult was that hair makeup. Every day. I still have dot. I'll never know how many hours. Three, three, three. I mean, I didn't go through as much as I'd Warlow but it was more the, the scrubbing at the end of the day, it was the layers and layers of blocked up dot. Just fine.

Speaker 2:          06:27          And you guys, you guys had a really good dynamic on the set, right? Cause it was, you guys had a group text going on and was like, suicide, suicide squad for life.

Speaker 7:          06:34          Your suicide squad. Yeah. It's still going. Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          06:39          yeah. Well no one's getting agree to these anytime soon. No.

Speaker 7:          06:41          Oh yeah. And Tattoos. Yeah. So it's tattoos, Dave. Oh, he got the squad? Yeah. Joel, show them yours. Joel has this biggest one. The biggest one will did that one. I did that. Why did that one huge, huge mistake. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          06:58          We're asking wheel. So when are you getting your rank? And he's like, oh, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow again

Speaker 7:          07:03          at rap rap. Yeah. Rap. Yeah. I don't want to get it. Why are we shooting? But Margo brought the gun though that you didn't you bring the Tattoo Gun. Oh, let's do it. No, no, no, no. This is the problem. This is the, I say all the time, this is the problem with 40 year olds. Hang with 20 year olds. It goes wrong. It goes wrong and it ends in the hospital.

Speaker 2:          07:31          But it wasn't so bad cause you did Joel's cause I think Joel you asked for the Tattoo.

Speaker 7:          07:36          Well we were all going to get them and then I was like yeah we'll do mine. And then when he started I was like what the, what's up? Thank you. Can you describe it as like watching a drunk baby fly helicopters were exact descriptions of that. So yeah, I didn't want to, I didn't want to do it, but everybody was so excited. You know, I got wrapped up in a moment. I'll do it, I'll do a joke. And that energy that he had right there, that was the energy he had while he was tattooing

Speaker 2:          08:10          crazy stuff that happened on set year. You're shaving off people's eyebrows. Yeah. Margot's and you're helping shave at gyse beard. Jumping off Karen's Harris. So what, what does that with your, your process is amazing, I think is all this stuff that was coming out of this set of how you get inside people's heads. So where did that develop? What like did you start with that when you first started filmmaking or did you

Speaker 7:          08:32          okay. In the Navy I did cut hair in the navy,

Speaker 2:          08:38          you know, I cut hair on the submarine. So, you know, I've, I've used clippers before, but it's part of the process. It's, it's like a, you grab someone out of rehearsal, you know, alter their look, throw him back in. It's a little bit like being in prison I guess. And uh, you know, they get mocked by the other prisoners, so it just helps, uh, helps them get there.

Speaker 4:          08:56          We're in the rehearsal

Speaker 7:          08:57          space and he left with Karen and came back with her scalp.

Speaker 4:          09:03          He walked in with like the hair. It was like, oh my God, it's a garden. We it to Margo. And she didn't like that Karen, his hair was midway down her back, you know, and it was beautiful and we're like, Oh wow, it's beautiful David. Say, dude, come here, clip, clip, and just cut her hair off. I was like, Yep.

Speaker 8:          09:22          Ah,

Speaker 4:          09:26          and all I could do with this. Take a picture of it on the floor.

Speaker 8:          09:29          Okay.

Speaker 4:          09:32          Post this Karen. Okay. You play, get them boomerang. And, which is probably one of the funniest parts of the film. He's the most hinged on hinge character. So can you talk about just developing that character in his, his crazy psyche?

Speaker 7:          09:45          Uh, yeah, I had to go pretty, pretty crazy. A undergo a pretty crazy trends, uh, transformation to a, to find him. It's a stretch. I'm obviously nothing like the character. Um, keep it together at all times. Uh, find it hard to step out of my, out of my shell. Um, and uh, so it was, it was pretty intense man. And uh, it's, it's been hard to shake off, you know, what's it been like about 30 years now?

Speaker 4:          10:19          Now here's the thing I like, I've, I've done movies with, with actors before. I, you know, I've had love scenes where, you know, you use all day long, you're shooting a love scene with, with someone. And I've still managed to see GI naked more. That was like, dude, just, you don't just put some clothes on man. You don't have to, you don't have to be naked and you're outside. Do you know you're outside? We're outside doors. It's November. Well it's a damn clothes on.

Speaker 7:          10:52          You got to stay out of base camp, stairway from the trailer, stay on sad at safe on set. There's grownups there. You got to base camp. Anything could happen.

Speaker 4:          11:01          Yeah. Well I hear there's a story where you chase David at the end of the shooting naked and he just sprinted away from you at the end of a 20 hour shoot day. Me, me, me, me and me and Jay, we were in giant trailer and a, and Gi was in the shower and um, and David comes at, peaks his head and the trailer and he's like, hey dude, what's going on? And the Gi comes out of the, out of the shower and he's only wearing a towel. And as soon as he sees David, he just, he drops the towel and David just instinctively just like darts out and tag. I was Diego's second boy and try just takes off running and he's chasing David like terminator style, but make it around the whole studio parking lot and then is a predator. You don't run from him. Instinctual things happen.

Speaker 7:          11:55          It happened when they smell blood. We have Karen Karen's voice. Like, Hey, I never got him. I never got him. Oh, David wanted no parts of it. No. And I come out, I come out my gym like what it's going on. No, no GI. I don't put that on him. The end game there. What were you going to do if you did catch him? I, no, I mean I didn't think about that. We would have found out when I, when I get on and David David told us later, he was like, I was just trying to find some glass on the ground that I could run over this slowing down. He was barefoot.

Speaker 4:          12:38          Yeah. Now this, this, uh, this cast was a thoroughly and perfectly chosen role by role, uh, perfectly for what, what are, uh, personalities can, uh, uh, accurately display on camera. Yeah, I think it was that pretty, that was pretty good. Right. People, right job.

Speaker 7:          12:59          Yeah. And there's no transitions. No segue. But Adam, nothing I can do for that. There's no, there's no right to quit around it. So speak. Speaking of penises.

Speaker 8:          13:13          No,

Speaker 7:          13:15          get out of I, there's no way Gary, keep talk about this. Jesus, the development of your characters, uh, just with your training and

Speaker 9:          13:25          got it. Training. The best thing about it, me and my wife become, became more bonded because I said Babe, um, David, uh, called and uh, he wants me to learn how to use these ropes

Speaker 7:          13:44          and here we go. Bear rope. Bad rope. No, we're very much in love. It brought us closer.

Speaker 5:          13:52          Can I do to tie the knot?

Speaker 8:          13:55          Okay.

Speaker 4:          13:55          Views expressed by the suicide squad are not necessarily the views of Warner brothers pictures, right.

Speaker 8:          13:59          Will Smith.

Speaker 5:          14:03          Well, Adam was wailing during treating.

Speaker 7:          14:08          Yeah. Air Squat even. Right. It was embarrassing. Yeah. They were hard squats, man. I think Adam, we are,

Speaker 4:          14:16          came in and Jai, I think Dji, Margo and Karen were like the most already in shape. You know, like they were in shape. They hit the set ready and the rest of us kind of had to get in shape and, and Adam was, Adam was like this. Adam was here.

Speaker 7:          14:36          Yeah.

Speaker 8:          14:45          I love this

Speaker 1:          14:54          one. Squat for today. Hey Adam, what are you squatting? Gravity man. Wicked heavy. Black Day to day.

Speaker 2:          15:09          So Garrett, Garrett, how about your trading? Cause I'm guessing it wasn't like that.

Speaker 5:          15:12          Yeah, well I got trained by Guy Norris, my stunt double or Molly Ong and Richard Norton who have worked on Mad Max fury road. So I got the best training in the industry. Um, I didn't have any prior experience with sword fighting, but we did a month and a half of preproduction. I, no, no, no. It's funny because in my audition email it said you're going to do a little bit of martial arts, some acting, and then if you have a sword lying around at home, just bring it just in case. I was like, who? Who just has one? But sure enough, I did have a friend, yeah.

Speaker 4:          15:52          With this, this is Karen's first movie. She's, this is the first movie she, Yep.

Speaker 8:          16:02          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          16:02          Pretty, pretty much all downhill from here. Starting from the bottom.

Speaker 2:          16:09          Well, you're phenomenal at getting down to get down to, um, so I want to go to go around and what are your character's greatest weakness or weaknesses? So we'll start with you. Well, you could actually, David, if you could do Jareds because he's not here for Jared Leto for the joker. But let's start with you. But your greatest weakness, your character,

Speaker 4:          16:24          a character's greatest weakness. Well, what's interesting about dead shot is he looks at his love for his daughter as a weakness, which is really interesting when you talk about, you know, good, bad and evil, right? So in his mind, he considers his daughter his Achilles heel. God, if it, if I didn't love this girl, I could just kill people and not feel bad about it. But I got this chick now I feel bad when I picked miss this guy. All right, so it's like, it's flipped in his mind. What, what is good and bad and right and wrong?

Speaker 5:          17:03          Um, I'd say June, like you got to cut it yet

Speaker 4:          17:06          it was an accident, but it was really cool.

Speaker 5:          17:08          I think so. Yes, I do. I tried to us. So I'd say June means weakness is probably the enchantress and the enchantress is weakness is probably June.

Speaker 1:          17:16          Well, I thought about that. Farm ditzy.

Speaker 3:          17:26          So the joker's weakness is probably a Harley Quinn and it's definitely a love hate, uh, you know, relationship. And I think that he hates study, loves her and would never admit that he loves her and he doesn't even know that he loves her and he doesn't even know that he's capable of love. And I don't think any of us are sure if he, if he even is capable of love.

Speaker 5:          17:44          I want to know David's weakness.

Speaker 1:          17:46          Oh yeah. Not Us, us,

Speaker 7:          17:51          you guys. Um, Holly's weakness. I mean the obvious answer is the joker, but I think it's actually his self esteem and that's why the joke is her weakness.

Speaker 8:          18:04          Okay.

Speaker 7:          18:05          Uh, Diablo, his weakness is probably his family. Simple as that,

Speaker 8:          18:09          right?

Speaker 7:          18:12          Yeah. I'd go with the same kind of theme that flags, weaknesses, uh, is his love for June or honey, but that's awesome. But that's also strength. It's also strength. Absolutely. Strength. Strength to, it's like, it's two sides of the same coin.

Speaker 5:          18:33          I think Katana's weakness is her willingness to, you know, sacrifice her own life for justice. Or you know, for a husband.

Speaker 7:          18:44          Yes. He was in a sword. Euler, Jeez, I can't do this.

Speaker 8:          18:54          Yeah,

Speaker 7:          18:59          he's in. He's in, that's the word. And don't think you just know that. That's now Adam Guy caught up. Yeah. Damn it out. Um, I mean, this guy over here like spoilers all the time. I mean, really, we all work so hard and then I like that comes along and just ruins it for everyone. I mean, slipknots is just women. He, he likes and he likes, time them up, gets caught looking at women. That's basically it. No, no, no. Not, not Adam. Slipknot to character.

Speaker 8:          19:38          Character. Okay. Um, women.

Speaker 7:          19:47          Boom. Right? He's got a Bruno, he's got, got a weakness for plush toys.

Speaker 8:          19:57          Weak at the knees.

Speaker 7:          20:00          Well, a suicide squad is out August 5th, Friday. I'll get spit this week. It is absolutely phenomenal. We cannot think guys enough for being here. Thank you guys so much.

Speaker 8:          20:08          [inaudible].
