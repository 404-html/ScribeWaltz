Speaker 1:          00:06          I am really, really excited to bring on stage Rochelle Brisco who was an HR people partner here at Youtube. We've got Teraji coming on stage who, I don't think it needs an introduction. We've got Robin Bissell who was the writer and director of this very amazing movie, the best of enemies. And then we've also got Dominique telson coming on. Who produced this moving please

Speaker 2:          00:25          from them.

Speaker 3:          00:36          Well, as you can tell from that, very warm welcome. We're so excited to have all of you here. Um, everyone has just seen an amazing clip from the best of enemies. And this was four years ago when we first heard that you signed on to Raj, you to be part of the film. Um, can you tell us a little bit about the process, you know, when you see, when you saw this, what made you decide that this was right for you?

Speaker 1:          01:03          Well, Danny Strong, um, co Creator, one of the Co creators and producers of Empire gave me this script when we filmed the pilot for empire. And then the show became a big success and it was hard for me to, you know, schedule my schedule. I had so many scheduling conflicts. And then, um, it was after the 2016 election, I noticed that the racial climate change drastically. So I called Danny and I was like, we have to make this movie and we got to make it now. And at the time I was already slated to do, I'm proud Mary on my hiatus. And so he was like, you already have a movie. And I was like, I don't care. Make it happen. Make the dates work and I'll give up my entire hiatus. And that's what I did.

Speaker 3:          01:48          That's fantastic. And Robin, you'd produce some amazing blockbusters, sea biscuit, the hunger games Pleasantville. But this is your directorial debut? Yeah. Like for you, what made this your first, how'd you choose [inaudible]?

Speaker 4:          02:04          What was the story I'd first heard about in 2005. And so I had been really anxious to do something with it at the time. You know, as a producer you have to find a writer and a director and do all that to have something come to fruition. But after the hunger games, I had been thinking about wanting to, because I started out as a singer, song writer way back in the 90s. Um, and so, you know, I fancied myself a creative, so I'm, so after the hunger games, that was my time. I thought about directing and this is the one thing I just been wanting to do, just tell the story regardless of how I was involved. And so I sat down and I called my friend Danny Strong, said I'm going to start writing this. And uh, I did.

Speaker 3:          02:45          Yeah. Yeah. And what about you Dominique? Had you worked with Robin or Teraji before? How'd you decide to produce? No, I hadn't, I hadn't worked with either one, but, um, actually what another one of Robin's friends, Matt Berenson, I think they were tennis partners, is what he told me. Said, yeah, my friend Robert gave me the script. So he read it and then he sent it to me. And, uh, when I read it, I was like, I want to make this movie. Um, I, I just, I just fell in love with the character of Ann Atwater. And of course, like everyone else, Google did that she really exists. Is this really a real person? And I'm just was fascinated by what she was able to do, um, in her community, um, with, with, with this film. And then it just in her, in her life at, you know, as a woman, uh, you know, in this, in this town. And so I, I made it, my goal is make thanks for doing it. Not just did she exists, but I understand some of you had a chance to meet her before her passing and 2016

Speaker 4:          03:50          so when I, um, I'm sorry, did I interrupt you? Do you know of another second half of the question? Um, yeah. So, uh, right after I, I re optioned the book cause I had let the option lapse in 2009 I reactions book in 2013 and I beelined it for Durham and I called Ann and she was very open and, and she was in the hospital at the time. She hurt her knee. Um, and so we just started having lunch and talking and I'd go back and then I kept going back. And then bill Riddick also who's still alive, I just started spending time with them and um, you know, Anne was just sharp as a tack till the, literally up until she passed in 2016. It's a big regret. We didn't get to get it done before because she was so excited at first. She was so excited that Taraji was going to play her, I mean beyond, um, and she was just so excited for the movie to yeah, really a wonderful woman, really wonderful and really gave me a lot of perspective, uh, as a filmmaker into not just herself, but what it was like in the 50s, sixties and seventies in, in the south end.

Speaker 4:          04:55          Great Perspective on CP wasn't alive anymore. Uh, and seeing it through her eyes allowed me to three dimensionalize him more. So yeah,

Speaker 3:          05:04          we got a few of them. I mean the families, uh, came on set and, and were there, Bill [inaudible] was there during the Charette, you know, so, you know, he, he helped a lot cause you, you know, you watch this and you go like, how did this happen? He goes, when I met them, I couldn't stand either one of them. They was both nasty. And so it was, it was kind of great to see that, that perspective. Cause it again, three dimensionalize the story that, that Robin had written in his, in his screenplay. Um, and then they all came to this, the all the, um, his children and grandchildren and her children and grandchildren came to the premier that we had. We had a screening in Durham for them and they were really, really supportive of the film, which was, which was great. That's amazing. Um, yeah, it, it definitely comes alive. It's three dimensional, you feel every bit of it. And one of the areas that really struck me was just how extreme there are

Speaker 1:          05:58          some of the scenes and it's this very severe optimism matched shortly with severe pessimism. And for you to Raji and you, Robyn, how, how do you embody that in a character and, and create that as a director? Uh, I mean, well I couldn't really add too much because Anne was a really a real person. Um, I just listened to a lot of the stuff people say about her, uh, that she was a powerhouse. Roughneck Annie, a CP all would always say you could hear her before you see her. Um, she had a big mouth, you know, so, you know, those, those are real specific, uh, descriptions of a person. And that sounds like somebody that doesn't take no for an answer. That sounds like somebody that, um, that gets things done, you know. And the fact that she went up against so many powerful white men and she was unafraid, like she was fearless.

Speaker 1:          07:03          She would die for the cause. That's how important it was for her to leave this world in a much better place than she found it for her children and for generation after her. Um, and she wasn't rich. She wasn't a rich woman. She, she had no money, but, uh, she had compassion in her heart and she was a true Christian cause as Christians, you supposed to love your enemy. It's hard to do. But she did it, you know, um, she just didn't back down. I mean, Cook Gracious. I couldn't imagine just when I, when I, um, had to get hurt when I had the physical lies are, I just imagined her when she gets, she moved with a purpose, you know, this is a woman who whenever she's moving, she's moving with a purpose and I just imagine a locomotive, you know what I mean? And if you get in her way, she's going to steam roll you.

Speaker 1:          07:57          So I just thought about things like that. And, you know, at the time it was so desperate, you know, it was like her, the, you know, poor people and black people in particular in that community, their backs were against the wall. You know, what happens when you back somebody up into a corner, they come out swinging, you know, and, and I just kept that on board every time that, you know, she wasn't just fighting for herself and for her children, she was fighting for the next generation, you know. Um, and that's a heavy weight to carry.

Speaker 4:          08:29          I, and she was just talking about their backs are against the wall and what your question was, which was the juxtaposition of pessimism and optimism. And you know, we live in such a pessimistic time now. You know, we talk about how we first heard the story years ago and it was relevant then. And, and I think that, that this, you know, in these kinds of times, and then, you know, the smallest bit of hope really can save you even in an hour or a day, you know, have the smallest bit of hope. It's like, oh my God, it might be okay. And that the embrace, they embrace optimism, even when the, it's a terrible, you know, landscape. And you know, these people were the same way I think. And, and, you know, we talked about it, we were charging and I, and Dominic were talking about last night how, you know, these weren't just, you know, they were poor and they were in a small town derms of relatively small town, but they were leaders within that town, you know.

Speaker 4:          09:21          And so it's no accident that it's, there was a trickle down effect from some people who had change of heart. You know, I mean, generational, we've been meeting with CPS family and his kids and grandkids is no hate in them. I mean, they're wonderful people. And that stopped because of an stopped him. And so it's, it's, you look at these people, Bill Riddick was a leader and Atwater was a leader who had, people would follow her to the ends of the earth, but she had her own ideology as far as shutting herself off to certain conversation. CP obviously on the wrong side, but he had a lot of people that would follow him. So Bill Riddick was able to work on Ann Atwater to have a resume and a little c, little bit of some of the bigger picture because she had made such a difference in people's lives.

Speaker 4:          10:08          And this will allow her to tap into CP who was another leader. And she knew if she could tap into him, maybe that would trickle down. Right? And it's because it's courage of leadership is courage of moral courage. And you know, that's what we're missing today. I mean, you know, do you know, there's plenty of leaders, we know plenty of our people in Washington who know there's a gun problem, who knows? There's a problem with a in law enforcement, right? We know there's a racial problem. No, there's a climate problem. They know they're not stupid, right? But where's the courage? Where's the courage to lead, you know, the right way. So, yeah, we have to dig into that ourselves as people. Um, I'm going to ask a little more personally because you know, I did spend 16 years in the beltway, so I'm going to stay away from that for this conversation. Um, but in your own personal experience, is there something that you drew from or thought about when you're agreeing to be in produce direct this story?

Speaker 5:          11:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:11          I guess for me it was just, um, what made it so important for me and why I gave up my entire hiatus.

Speaker 4:          11:23          She never lets me forget that.

Speaker 1:          11:26          Is it because, um, I mean, you know, you see this world and as an artist I feel like it is our duty to reflect the times. That's, that's what we're supposed to do with artists. And I take that responsibility very seriously. Um, art has changed my life. I have looked at a visual painting and it has touched me to the core or shifted my perspective or something, you know, artists that powerful. So whenever I pick roles, you know, some may be for fun, but a lot of them, if you pay close attention, uh, it's examples of something to leave for our kids or a message to change a group of people's perception on another group of people. You know, the more stories that we tell, the more we are aware that different stories and different people exist. And until we don't have to make stories like this where we have to put a mirror up to society and say, Hey, not looking so good, clean it up, you know, and then we, we, we will continue to make these films. They're important. This is how you push humanity forward. So this is why I did the film. I felt that it was like a great responsibility of mine as an artist.

Speaker 3:          12:37          Hmm. And, uh, I guess as a, as a producer, when I, when I read the script, um, I had, I have three daughters and they're coming up in this world and you know, it can be, it can be tough. And S, um, when I saw this example of an out water, that's the message I wanted them to know, to have that hope that look at this woman and she was fierce and, and just kept going and had the courage to do what, what really no one else, what no one else did. And I want them to have the hope that if you, if you put yourself into it, maybe there is hope, hope for change. I mean, you know, she was known as Rough House Annie, but in order to reach CP, she had to step back from being rough house Annie and found a new way.

Speaker 3:          13:20          She had to find a way to, to, he says this all the time, but to his heart and soul and that's what she, what she did. And actually that takes a lot more, more courage than it sometimes is to just kind of, you know, be rough house. So, um, I, I love this film because of that. I want, I want them to see that and I want the world to, you know, to, to see this film. And by the way, last thing, as a producer, I love having diversity in front of and behind the camera. And we did that in Atlanta and uh, we had a great crew and it was a real family on set. And I think part of the reason is because of our diversity on set, even though we were dealing with a rough subject matter, you know, we could look around and say, you know what, w w we can, we can do this together.

Speaker 4:          14:03          Yeah, I mean, for me, uh, initially was, um, how, you know, I kept thinking about how we put labels on each other, you know, and it's weak. We define each other and like little catch phrases, you know? And without even knowing each other, I do it too. I watch TV or, you know, I get angry just like everyone else. And you put up these barriers right away when you get angry. And I learned to be a better listener. I think through this process. Um, we, you know, as artists, we don't always get to make films that are entertaining and are relevant or, and have this kind of, you know, power message. Sometimes we do. It's okay not to, but you know, and so, um, for people, you know, be in this two dimensional world, we're not really listening to each other. And we know that when you make a movie,

Speaker 3:          14:52          you know, you get to put, you know, your people are in a dark room for two hours just listening and not talking. That's, uh, that's, you don't get that opportunity very often. Right. And so if we can do it right and have people engage and become emotionally invested in, in the real lives of these characters, and then we can say something that we want to say and what they wanted to say, that's a, that's a huge platform to be able to have, you know, and that, that, that's why, um, it, it, that's why I love doing this. I mean, really. Yeah. That's the hope that I felt. I mean, being fortunate enough to get a chance to watch the movie and recognize that maybe yeah, maybe it's possible to have real severe differences and somehow get past that. It seems like from your answers, you all really believe that it's still possible for people to be diametrically opposed and on very different sides of the line. But to make a change today.

Speaker 1:          15:51          Absolutely. I mean, God is very clever. You know, I'm, I'm not going to preach to anybody today, but, um, I mean if you believe in a higher power, God, I like to say, um, if there was only supposed to be one race, all God mighty God, it would only be one race. God is very clever. We all are here. We look different. We come from different backgrounds, paying attention for a reason, and it's for us to figure it out. That's our job on life, in life, to figure it out, to work it out. And unfortunately we have this thing called social media and it has driven a big divide between us because you would think, yeah, I can have a great conversation on Twitter, but it goes sour each and every time. I just see a bunch of people dragging each other. No one's really listening for understanding. Um, and it's a world of clickbait real quick. Soon as you hear one thing, everybody jumps on and they're believing and it's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey. Just from one phrase, everybody believes this and it's just like, it's like, it feels like it's chaos, but it's up to us to get it together and, and figure it out because we're here for a reason.

Speaker 3:          17:04          We are, we are, we are. I say Amen to you. Um, you know, I am tasked today with, you know, I had a girlfriend say, you guys going to talk about this amazing film, civil rights and mental health. How are you going to do this? This is Teraji this woman does everything. Yeah, no, yeah, we're gonna make this work. And you know, I, I recognize this, this period for you. You've done things in this space, you know, our civil rights era for African Americans with hidden figures and now with the best of enemies. And, and your father grew up in the civil rights time. Did, did he share his background stories with you?

Speaker 1:          17:47          No, it was rough. I mean, he's, he, um, one time he had, I mean my dad who I was, she was alive to tell his story, but you know, Vietnam vet, um, uh, come, coming back with mental issues. So he had a couple run ins with the law that landed him in jail, in and out of, um, the mental institution. You know, anytime you go to war, you never come back the same, you know, but my father was an open book. He didn't hide anything from me. Um, and he was very open and honest about his mental state, you know, um, he was able to really work through it and overcome it all. But, you know, it was a huge adjustment after coming back from Vietnam. It took a while, you know, but, um, I like again, I mean, you can't grow if you sweep everything under the carpet.

Speaker 1:          18:36          And that's my pain for the African American community. We have generational trauma that we don't deal with and we're walking around as if everything is okay and it's not, we're walking around of, of, of generations of, of, of issues and trauma swept under the carpet and we're standing on top of it as if everything's fine. Yeah, you're right. And it's, it's generational. It's impacted some things we don't even know are in effect a affecting us because it's so embedded in us, we don't even know. Yeah. And I mean, and outside of your artist's career, I mean, last year you opened up a foundation. Yeah. And your father's name [inaudible]. Can you tell us about its mission? The mission is to, to, um, work with the recidivism and prison systems. Um, because no, you know, you know, the prison system is not really a place for reform or to, uh, get your life together and be implemented back out into society.

Speaker 1:          19:35          A changed person. It's really nice to keep you there. And it's unfortunate because a lot of people, they are having mental issues and they shouldn't even be in cages. Um, and then, you know, we have to, I said I was a substitute teacher before I booked baby boy and became a, a a an act, an actress, you know, that was my gig and I mean for, I made it, you know, uh, but I took it very seriously and I chose to work with special education children and in my mind, I thought that meant a disabled children in wheelchairs, you know, that can't eat or dress themselves. And I get sent to Crenshaw and I get him in a classroom with all black boys who are labeled special Ed. But nothing's wrong with them. They can walk, they can talk, you know, they smart out the mouth and I tell them, let's start our work and they do this. I'm special Ed. I can't do that.

Speaker 1:          20:32          So just because they have this label, they already have a low expectation of themselves and they believe it and it broke my heart. So then, you know, that's stood. I carry that with me for so many years and all of this success. And so when I came to launch this foundation and I was like, we need counselors, not just counselors, but professional therapist, psychiatrist that can go into these schools and recognize that these children are coming from traumatic experiences at home and we're expecting them to learn. Another thing that ha that I've been carrying for years. Uh, when I went to this acts, same school, um, the children are taken me down a hall and they're like, Ms. Henson, look, it was a shoot out here last night and they showed me the bullets and the bullets and the wall. And I'm like, and they're walking around like, this is normal.

Speaker 1:          21:24          So you see what I mean? This is, we're expecting these children to come home from, God knows these experiences they're having at home trauma and they're traumatized trying to come to school and learn. And then when they don't focus in class, we slap a label on them and say they're special Ed. But we don't try to understand why. When I started talking to these young boys, one was found, um, roaming around by the train tracks, which is in the backyard of the school by the way, which is another issue, trying to keep them, you know, a focus. Then they got a train running through the backyard every day that you know, a whole lot of issues. But anyway, he was roaming around the train tracks. He got picked up for shoplifting at the seven 11. He was trying to get something to eat because his mother was on drugs and his father was in prison. How does that make you special ed?

Speaker 1:          22:17          You can still learn. You just have trauma at home. So we need to implement a psychiatrist and, and who are in, in these schools who can recognize the trauma and give these children the proper care that they need as opposed to just labeling them special ed and getting them ready for the prison system. So we're dealing with that. And we're also giving away scholarships to young African American children because see, we don't talk about it at home is taboo in our community. So a lot of times our kids don't even know that this is a field to study it. This is something I can even go into because we're not even talking about it at home. So we need more African American and not, it's not even about a color because I see therapists, you know, I need it and it's okay. I'll be the first one to tell you it's okay to not be okay.

Speaker 1:          23:05          But, um, it's not even about a color is cultural competency. So if you, I can, I can understand another, uh, cultures, uh, problems if I take the time to. But see, a lot of times you have these therapists who are coming from other countries or, and they just want the car to come here and practice. So again, you have these people in these positions that really don't even want to be there. So it's a lot to, it's a lot to cover, but at least we're talking now. At least we're talking. Yeah. Thank you for helping that conversation. You're wondering why and that we're, or you're not. Well, you know what I wanted to Razi to play her. Exactly. Call

Speaker 4:          23:45          me the cookie lady cookie lady. Go and play me.

Speaker 3:          23:52          Yeah. This, this is, this is a modern civil rights issue, you know, in communities now. Um, the, the difference in a time of crisis from an appropriate training, you know, deescalation, we have this now with officers to recognize the difference in violence and mental health. It's something that, you know, we say civil rights era but were still living in this right now and, and mental health isn't, you know, something that's just stigmatized in the African American community, you know, across countries, communities, classes, there are stigmas associated with talking about it, addressing it, um, sharing that it's okay to be okay. Um, for you all, I mean, before or after this film, have you ever had to confront these, these stigmas around mental health, around needing to get help, encouraging someone to get help and have, how do you all address it?

Speaker 4:          24:51          I, my sister went through a terrible divorce and she, she actually went through something for a while. There was the first time in our family that we had to deal with that and you know, my parents are from the old school, you know, east coast. You know, I grew up in suburbs kind of sheltered and um, you know, they didn't really want to talk about it and I, you know, I was like, what do you mean it's okay, we can talk, but this wasn't that long ago, you know, and everything's fine. But it was, um, you know, uh, there was a stigma, you know, if for us it was, you know, everything was okay. Don't talk about, well that's no good because then we're not asking for help. It's okay to ask for help. And I think that's the, that's where the, any kind of stigma hurts.

Speaker 4:          25:31          It's that you don't ask for help. Asking for help was everything we see. I mean, we've had what, a couple of high profile suicides lately, you know, just the last couple of weeks it's been horrible. And that's trauma and tries. She's talking about trauma, you know, our brains are so fragile or emotions are fragile. There's, there's trauma we don't really know about. It's not just coming home from war, it's not, you know what I mean? And so I, you know, I can't begin to understand it, but I do know that when you get rid of stigma, people will ask for help, you know? And, and as a father, I have two boys, one's here at Berkeley, and I tell him all the time, you know, if it's okay to ask me if anything is the matter, you know what I mean? Don't, don't be too strong or don't try to be, you know, so is is is, I'm sorry this is something that gets under my skin and, and, and, and so many people need this help but it just seems like it's set up and designed to make it as difficult as possible for you to get the hell I'm talking even within the Sag insurance.

Speaker 4:          26:28          That's something I'm ready to tackle. Like why is it that I can't use my insurance to pay for my psychiatrist? Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 2:          26:46          Yeah. My psychiatrist broke that down to me. She was like, you know, you have this amazing insurance program, Blue Cross Blue Shield Blue Shield does cover me, but for whatever reasons I'm outside of network for Sag. Go figure. Like what are we doing here?

Speaker 3:          27:06          We are fortunate and blessed to have you all a few tackling these issues on the screen off of the screen. Thank you for being here. This, you know, we could talk about this for a while obviously, but you know, for our audience, for, for all of the audiences out there, if I could ask each of you to, you know, as a final question, uh, what do you want people to take away from this film? I want people to see you, the film and you know, you know, be inspired, you know, be inspired, be inspired to look at your neighbor. I think we were talking before about, you know, Twitter wars and whatever, but you know, if you really have to look the other person in the eye and really have a conversation, you know, maybe there's something we can do with that. Um, and that's what I hope people are inspired by, by Ann and what she was able to do.

Speaker 3:          27:58          Um, and my s you know, by the transformation that CP made and have hope that, that maybe we can, we can come out of this and the next generation is left a little better off then. And then ours is right now. I mean, honestly, I'm looking out at your, at your audience here and it's, it's wonderful to see. I, when I started working corporate, it did not look like this. No, we're youtube. But you said you feel proud on the stage to have the back, you know, behind the scenes. This is us, this is behind the scenes and we're proud. A lot of people put in a lot of work. Graduation is, I, I've, I've worked corporate jobs. This doesn't look like this. And you know, it's just so, so that's what I, that's, I hope that this is possible because of that. She doesn't even know this, but when I came to the country, I didn't speak English, so I got put in special ed and then they, and then I was like, I just didn't speak the language. Just didn't, then I had to get tests. There's nothing wrong with me, you know, just, just teach me English is crazy. They will,

Speaker 2:          29:01          you ready for the prison

Speaker 3:          29:06          bag that she's in the movie business?

Speaker 4:          29:13          For me it's the same thing. Like there's so many things talk about this story, right? We can talk about it all day, like you said. But really what worked here was a charette, right? And um, and so what Dominique was saying, when you, when you sit in front of someone, even if you start arguing, you're not going to argue forever. You really let down your defenses when you, you're not as aggressive when you, you know, you see people in road rage videos now, which I've watched a lot on youtube cause it's really fun. Uh, but, but I've gone through these really me. So, uh, you see what people say to each other when they're behind that the glass, you know what I mean? But you stand up and you walk to someone, you're not going to say those things. You know what I mean? Some people I guess, but you know, and so you sit down and you start talking to people and oh, you have children.

Speaker 4:          29:59          Oh you like this. And Oh, you went to school here and all you grew up here, he started forgetting your differences. And you might still have them, but you can talk about it respectfully. You can find common ground. It's not brain surgery. It might be brain surgery to get us all together. But once you're there, you let that and you let down your veneer, you know, and you just start seeing each other as human beings. It's just what happens. So when I was encouraged, you know, and we were just coming out on April 5th I think we will all be encouraged. Thank you. Thank you for the movie. Thank you for your foundation. Thank you for this time today. Thank you for having us,
