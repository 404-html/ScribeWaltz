Speaker 1:          00:03          Everyone, uh, welcome to toxic Google today. It is my absolute pleasure to introduce Sir Ben Kingsley and Patricia Clarkson for learning to drive. Let's hold on

Speaker 2:          00:21          anywhere you'd like

Speaker 3:          00:22          stage. Is this working? Oh, it's working. Hello. Whoo.

Speaker 2:          00:30          Google.

Speaker 1:          00:34          I'm diggity diggity uh, so thank you so much for joining us. Your latest film is learning to drive. Do you mind telling us a little bit about it? How many of you've seen it? Good. And the rest of you will see it when it comes out this yesterday, right? You will flock and you will take all your friends

Speaker 3:          00:54          and you will scream and cheer when our names come up on the screen. Um, uh, it's a beautiful story about, uh, uh, two separate worlds coming together. It's a woman, a of fierce intellectual in New York book critic, uh, who pretty much has everything but forgets to realize you has everything. And, uh, her husband walks out on her and into her life comes, um, this exceptionally beautiful and, um, patient and kind and admirable man. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:33          Um, emphasis on exceptionally and sexy and amazing and extraordinary and one of a kind.

Speaker 3:          01:42          And, um, uh, and, uh, through, uh, the process of learning to drive shit 50. She's a hardcore New Yorker, never driven. She learns to drive for the first time at 50. And of course she has a the one and only Sir Ben Kingsley is her teacher and she learns, uh, and they learn many things because he's on a, uh, a new path. They both set out on new paths and the paths collide and come together. And in a, I think a unique and surprising ways.

Speaker 4:          02:16          I think those of you have seen the film will allow me to describe the form as a poem. So I have been referring to it all day as a poem. And at the beginning of our time we see a woman in complete distress, almost completely destroyed by the disintegration of her relationship. And at the beginning of the poem that's called the first stanza, um, she hates men. She will never trust men. She's lost her faith in man. Now, for those of you who've seen the film, and those of you haven't, I will go right now to the end stanza. Oh, the film where, because of her relationship with this man, she's able to say something very special. Now the heavens will in our poem, the heavens will look down and see a woman in great distress who's lost her faith. And the heavens say, I know what we'll do.

Speaker 4:          03:20          We'll send her this warrior, this pure Ma'am silent. That's what she needs. And by bringing them together in, as Patricia will tell you, a very confined space, a car, a little vehicle, um, which, which, which is rather like the ferry in the archetype of fairy man who will meet you on one bank of the river, puts you in his little boat and take you to the other bank of the river. But wa on your voyage, you realize as you step off his boat, I've learned something. Something's changed in me forever. The gift of the ferry man is that he is, or she is a great teacher, a great giver of life and an a show or of the way. So when we get to the end of our poem with this particular fairy man, she's able to say from utter devastation at the beginning, you are my faith.

Speaker 4:          04:15          So that's a remarkable journey. Um, that lasts the whole length of the film. It's very delicately handled verse by verse by verse. If I can continue calling it a poem and, um, the unlikelihood of the pair. Is there salvation? I honestly think that if Wendy had said to somebody in our office, I'm in great distress, what should I do? She got all the wrong advice, particularly from your sister, um, uh, in the film. Um, and if, and, and I, um, I am in the throes of, in anticipation of an arranged marriage, uh, and learn from my friendship. Uh, sorry. He learns from his friendship with Wendy, how to bring his Punjabi wife who's terrified of New York out into the world. And I think how to love her. I think he learns how to love her through Wendy too. So it's, it's quite, uh, uh, quite an extraordinary,

Speaker 3:          05:14          but I think at the end of the day, it is a, uh, uh, a beautiful story about adult friendship, about true profound meaning and, uh, of, of a real friendship and a, a, a friendship that, um, has changed them for the rest of their lives and end it ends in just the right place. I don't want to ruin anything. It ends in just the right, there won't be a sequel.

Speaker 4:          05:44          Well, if there's enough money, but now, uh, let's talk about faith for a moment because that is such a huge part of it. And I think, I think the character of Wendy is definitely someone who in the beginning it's just completely lost her in men. Not,

Speaker 1:          05:58          not in the religious sense, I mean, in men and men. But also I think there's a, isn't there a moment where she just goes, I'm, I don't believe in God. I'm mad at you, or God bless. But yeah,

Speaker 3:          06:07          no, I don't think when he was ever particularly religious woman, but I think, I think faith in general, I think she's lost trust and belief in and a lot of life, right? Suddenly, you know, a woman who was often the smartest woman in, in any room, um, top of her game, uh, a major critic in a tough city. And suddenly, uh, she is forced to go from a incredibly, very valuable intellectual life to this visceral, um, uh, life, this life that is uncomfortable for her to be in. And she has to navigate her way out of that. And, uh, it's a journey. I, I relished. It was not easy, but it was a journey I relished taking.

Speaker 4:          06:57          I think that they are connected by words, their love of words. My father in the Punjab was a university professor. My character's father was a university professor and I, to my character to a Donavon sing was a unit, a university professor in the, in the Punjab. And He, he has to migrate away from his homeland, a terrible loss. But he does take with him in his DNA that need to teach, that need to hand something on that needs a slight, that needs a slowly alter for the better the lives of others. So, um, there's, there is a commonality in the intelligence and that's very, very important. It is, it is a film dealing with two people of equal intelligence who meet, greet and salute one another. Uh, as, as loving friends.

Speaker 3:          07:52          It's nice to see a film about smart people.

Speaker 1:          07:55          Um, yeah, no, it's, it's wonderful to see that. But it's also, it's interesting, it was interesting for me to see this character and your character who it's his faith is such a whole part of who he is and he's very unshaken in it for most of the time. But then there's this event in his life with this impending marriage that maybe does have an effect on that. And so what was that sort of, that journey like for you? Ooh,

Speaker 4:          08:18          I was very fortunate when I was filming Gandhi in India to have, um, uh, seek, uh, bodyguard driver who drove me to the set every day, who protected me on set all day and drove me home in the evening. And he was a man of amazing stillness, very protective. And, um, I, I certainly drew upon my acquaintanceship with him over those months, um, on, um, on my portrait of a, of Darwin. Um, I think that, um, we must be careful of the word faith. I think that his faith allows him to be still, it is not, um, a, a faith that needs to be historically demonstrated. It's, it's not, um, it's not external. It's not externalized. Um, there are scenes in the temple of, of, of great stillness and dignity and family unity and enormous respect. We were allowed to film in a Sikh temple not long after six where were shot in their own temple.

Speaker 4:          09:26          So that was a huge gift. And by Osmosis, by being with my wonderful driver body guard, by being with my one or two seek friends with whom I'm, I'm quite close. And then of course, our dear Harpreet Singh tour on the sell to who, who put my turban on everyday quietly dig it, man. Make a gentlemen. I would like to make, uh, forgive me if I'm wrong, I'd like to make a slight generalization. I feel that if you know one Sikh gentleman, you know them all because there's something extraordinary, Lee consistent about their moral compass and their ethics would, would, would you, would you agree with that?

Speaker 2:          10:06          Yeah. Good.

Speaker 3:          10:09          I can go home. Thank you. But no, I, um, I must say, um, uh, you know, as you know, I was, it may have been attached to this film for a very, very long time and I love the character character of Wendy, but what I will say is in, and this story in this journey, but one of the most beautiful aspects of shooting this film was getting to know the Sikh community, getting to know her preach and, um, uh, an awakening to, you know, to this incredible and beautiful culture and the fact that they embraced, uh, this film and embrace her. Ben. Well, who wouldn't want, Sir Ben playing you? Come on. Um, uh, but that was valuable and incredibly comforting, um, for all of us with the film that we had them, we had their blessing, so to speak with this film. And, uh, but it was, um, uh, a beautiful lesson and, and, and journey for me, one that I will carry for the rest of my life. Getting to know the Sikh community. It's, um, very, uh, it's a very, very beautiful thing.

Speaker 4:          11:17          Whilst we, Patricia and I have been talking about this phone, a retrospectively revisiting it, um, I find that I have many thoughts about the film that I didn't have one, I was shooting and I've just had one city.

Speaker 3:          11:29          Yeah. Right now. And there's this, hold on and it's this, your Wendy, the very modern meets

Speaker 4:          11:39          the very ancient, yes. He who will not cut his beard. Yes. He who will not cut his hair. He will always wear a turban. And he who carries a sword. It's as if,

Speaker 2:          11:50          yeah,

Speaker 4:          11:50          he's traveled. Thousands of Sikhism hasn't been with us that long, but hundreds of years to be with you. And he learns, you learn some ancient truths from him. And I learned some modern truth from you. And I hope to impart them to just lean my, my, my arranged bride. Yes, I know. Yes. That equals yes, it's, it's in New York, but the heavens look down to someone in distress and say she doesn't want a modern guy. Let's not send them modern guy. No, let's send a warrior from the past. Uh, and I, I think that that's just hit me sitting. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          12:28          But you are, I mean, that's, that's the beauty. And what I love also about the film is as strong as the Sikh community and the beautiful life that is present in this film. At a certain point. Um, this film is really just about two adults. Uh, at the end of the day it is about two people, um, who have different cultures, but even the cultures fade. And it really just at the end of the day is about two people finding a better life and a better self. And, um, I think that's what cheers me most about this film is that it is, um, at the very core of film about humanity and, and how we can cross divides in subtle and simple ways. And, uh, I, I hope you find that and see that in the film. Um, that's a wonderful point. And, and as you mentioned, it's about two adults, but at least in the u s like learning to drive is a very, it's kind of a landmark of this, this journey into adulthood. You know, getting your driver's license is something, I think every 16 or 18. Now you're all once and it's this badge of honor, but these are two people who've passed into adulthood, you know, and now they're kind of facing these maturity decisions that are, it's probably putting them back into this kind of like teenage place of mine almost. Um, you know, how did that play into it at all for you guys? Did you see that as a part of the journey or was that just kind of a Oh, yes. I mean,

Speaker 4:          14:07          learning to drive both learn, um, uh, the, the enormous amount of information. I think the number of times at Donovan sing asks when d questions, what should I give her? How can I talk to her? I mean many, so many questions in subtly disguised or quite, you know, quite quite overt. So the, the, the, the, the two way flow between them, uh, um, both learning and bringing them mature. Mine's two baby steps,

Speaker 3:          14:41          but it, it, it is also for me, the real true physical act of driving. Again, s as Patty, my driving had lapsed. Sadly, I'm, you know, I'm was born in, raised in the great city of New Orleans, and my father taught me to drive at 16. Um, and I was a driver. And slowly as I became more and more new, Yorker became more Wendy's. So, and I lost my ability to drive. And as, and we, when we arrived at this film, I really had not been driving and you know, Serbinis trust that I could drive him through the streets of Manhattan. I thought, oh my God. I said, Oh my God, I'm driving Gandhi's

Speaker 2:          15:33          [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          15:39          Oh, I was very passive. But through the course of shooting this film, I became a better driver. And through the course of shooting this film, I realize so many things that Wendy had to learn. I mean it was life and art mixing in, in, in his vast and fabulous and precarious ways. Um, oh, driving over the Queensboro Bridge, uh, everyone was like, didn't you have a tow truck? Didn't you have a stunt double? I was like, you look at, uh, but in the course of shooting this film and truly learning to drive again, I learned all the lessons that Wendy had to learn. I had to learn, have to listen, to look, to pay attention, to be present, to take in the world, to be selfless to, you know, to read the signs, to read the signs. And I realized, Oh my God, I haven't read a sign in so long.

Speaker 3:          16:50          I haven't looked up and taken in the world right in front of me in so long. And it was a very, it was a very powerful experience for both of us shooting this film at all. Jenny as aren't. Cause when life and art, when they do coalesce, it's quite an extraordinary feeling and journey. Ah, it's beautiful and it's at its best. It should always be like that. Yes. You will. You always hope for that when you're shooting a film to come out the other side, a better person having more knowledge. Maybe having, you know, a new lover you always once, I did not move.

Speaker 3:          17:37          I mean, you want, you want to have taken, you know, you want at the end of this journey. But I mean, I'm making light of it, but it was truly a, a profound experience for us at the end of this film. It was, it was difficult to leave them behind. We went to do a talk at AOL and, um, we saw the end of the toy. We saw the trailer or something together. Yeah. And we both thought, oh, we missed the, in Darwin, we missed them. Uh, I have a very dear friend who saw the film the other day and he really, he loved it. He's an academic, he's brilliant. And he said, I, I want to have coffee with Wendy and Darwin, not you and Sir Ben,

Speaker 4:          18:25          Wendy and Darwin. What we, what we hope as actors, because I'm skeptical of messages. I have to be honest. I think that sometimes if you, if you respond to a question regarding what do you hope for, what's the message of it? Clutters you. So all I all I would like to say in terms of this film, and I know Patty agrees with me, is that audiences, audiences who see the phone, we'll have thoughts pop in their head that they would not have had had they not seen the film. That's all we can hope

Speaker 3:          18:59          for. That I think is that's what we can help for. That is somehow makes you think about something you hadn't thought about before. And, you know, I know that this is a film starring two people who are not 25, but I will tell you something. I've had my nieces and nephews, I have 10 of them. Oh my God. It's why I didn't procreate. It's enough. There's enough of us. Um, uh, and they, they were surprised at what they, what they felt about this film been there. Like they range from 25 to 34 or something. And so I think, um, this is a film that can resonate with people of all ages and all cultures and all backgrounds and, uh, we've played a very diverse audiences and they have responded. So I, I hope, um, when you see it, those of you who have not seen it, I hope you, it takes you somewhere.

Speaker 4:          20:05          When I was, I think I told you this story, um, when I, when we were with the Hollywood foreign press, Gosh, was that yesterday or the day before? Where are we now? We're on a whirlwind tour then we're in, we're at, we're in, it says it that Google got it. Um, the Internet. I am Palo Alto. Fuck. One of the, one of the, the very last into interview of the day and had done several, um, was a young woman probably in her late twenties, early thirties, from Belgium. And I started, um, as I introduced our talk, as I introduced myself to you, I started with that idea of the poem and have the woman in total distress, lacking faith and trust in men and the heavens, looking down and sending her the warrior. And I looked up, whilst I was talking, tears were streaming down her face and this was on camera. And I said, you know, for the s for the sake of you and I in this conversation story, please keep that in your broadcast. She said, well, the, there's no choice. Of course I will keep it in my broadcast. This was, this was this, these are the generation that you're alluding to. She found it deeply, deeply touching. It just hit a nerve in her, which is very gratifying. Yeah. It's great to make girls cry.

Speaker 1:          21:35          I don't have any Oscar nominations. I can't cry right now. I'm sorry man. I don't know how to follow that up. Um, I'm gonna, I'm going to talk about New York for a moment. Okay. New York is a wonderful city and it's also one of the places that one, it is terrifying to drive in. Like I used to live there and it's, I, I do not want to drive over the bridge. I was terrified for you guys in that moment. Um, but it's also one of the only places in the world where I could probably see something like this happening with this culture kind of meshing and where yes, it's just totally normal for all of these, you know, groups to cohabitate and stuff like that. But there's also this kind of moment of discrimination and, and you know, raids on onward I is living. Um, I think it's something people often forget about. Um, that happens, you know, I think maybe we focus a lot on other immigration issues. Um, but it's one of those things where you think, oh, New York melting pot. No. Um, so, and, and you guys got to shoot in New York City. Um, so what was, you know, did that add extra to it? It actually getting the students end up in front of a green screen as you mentioned it, it adds a lot.

Speaker 3:          22:43          We had, you know, when I was first trying to get this movie made, you know, everyone was like, well, could we shoot this in Toronto? I was like,

Speaker 1:          22:51          yes, let's drive around Toronto. Um, uh, someone actually said, I love this film. If you cut all the driving scene, I will help you make this film. But I think we have to lose the driving seat. Thank you sir. Thank you. Good day.

Speaker 3:          23:16          But yes, New York was essential in a crucial part of it. And the cacophony of New York is, uh, only can be the cacophony of New York and, and the streets and the people. And, and it was essential that we were there, but yes, we did face, you faced certain challenges every day, uh, as

Speaker 4:          23:38          I did just until it just sharpens your resolve to make a beautiful film and, and to rise above it. I'm, and then a little bit of Darwin was a, you know, taught me because I didn't hear this abuse that was yelled at my character w just before our most crucial scene. But some of my colleagues on the set dude, and they were very distressed and, and I said, come on, come on, tell me. I heard something, um, what happened? And they were very reluctant to tell me. Um, but in fact, two guys, uh, shouted across to me whilst I was in the dealership, uh, helping Wendy by her red car and, and they shouted, he should be buying a fucking camel, not a fucking car. And, um, it's hard to say that it's very distressing for the crew, but actually I thought, well then that's why you're here. This is why we're making the film. Come on. That's why you're here. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          24:40          no. So you know, you, you, you, you, you think that, uh, all of New York, uh, is, um, uh, advanced. You want to believe you live, live in a, uh, in a, uh, a city that, uh, ignorance, uh, it has escaped ignorance, but it hasn't, and it's ever present. And it's, um, it's now the biggest problem in my, in my opinion, that we face in the world today. So, um, so you've, you've talked about this earlier, but you guys actually were in a car, um, that creates a certain sense of intimacy for characters, for actors, and you've also worked together before. So was it easier to kind of slip into this relationship between these two characters are,

Speaker 4:          25:31          here's a paradox because we weren't together so intimately.

Speaker 3:          25:36          I Dunno if you saw a movie, we didn't call it a log. We played lovers in that film.

Speaker 1:          25:46          You did move your hands on that one. Seriously. I had the first day go on Patty, go pick up my life. Um, I met Sir Ben

Speaker 3:          25:59          and then we got naked and shot. There's the sex scene. That was the first thing we shot. I mean, Isabelle just threw us together. Best Way to do it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          26:07          Yes, it was before lunch, but he did it,

Speaker 3:          26:14          you know, it bonded us. It gave us, uh, uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          26:19          that's a lot. Whoa.

Speaker 4:          26:23          Paradoxically, uh, what it allowed us to do because we, you know, we trusted each those scenes demand huge trust and respect from one another and we therefore knew the level of trust that we had and we'll tap into his actos. Therefore sitting the car between

Speaker 1:          26:44          takes, we hardly spoke,

Speaker 3:          26:46          we kept it very separate. We, because we knew one another so well we, and we have a great trust and uh, but we wanted to make sure that savanna and patty didn't blur the lines with Wendy and Darwin, that it was because the beauty, the beauty of this film is it's very subtly work a and charted and finally etched of when the lines blur with the two of them. And we had to be very careful that those lines blurred in the appropriate times. And so we really, we could trust one another enough. It was a very quiet shoot. We would sit often in silence in the car, in between takes

Speaker 1:          27:31          that would trouble some people that there and we completely trusted to be, could be totally in repose and still between takes, which was a great gift. So, yeah, no. Um, so the, some of the other cast members aren't here obviously, but, but what was it like working with them? Because a lot of them you've worked with before, um, did was that it's just an easy way to kind of also slip into this sort of familiar relationships.

Speaker 3:          28:00          Yes. I mean I um, uh, you know, having been with this film for so long, I had, you know, dreams of the people I was hoping, and I love Jake Weber who played my husband. We did this little film called when to go together. That was this little tiny horror film director by, uh, Larry Fessenden. We did it many, many years ago and I thought he was just the perfect mix of handsome and academic and uh, just a fine, fine actor, really fine actor. And um, and so it was a real treat to get to work with him again and grace gummer um, I met her six years ago and six years ago I said, if and when I get this movie made, I want you to play my daughter and thank God she still looks 18, her good jeans. I was like, thank you. Uh, but she's a beautiful, stunning, a young actress. And I was thankful that she did this and you've got to work with gorgeous Serita, terrific, gorgeous. Those were actually some of my favorite,

Speaker 1:          29:11          almost uncomfortable scenes just in the sense that he wanted, I felt like he wanted so badly for her to fit this kind of archetype, bird or mold that maybe Wendy was influencing a little bit, much too quickly ahead in his expectations yet. But it was, it was wonderful for just to see someone who was willing to step back and try. Um, and then she goes to college and she, you know, she is led out into the world by her friends, by motto meets or in the supermarket and goes to her house.

Speaker 4:          29:42          So, um, she does, she does take those one. She in turn takes those baby steps to being a liberation. You got woman and I think she'll make it. I think she'll do it. She had some gumption and with the support of her husband. Yup. And Yeah, you get a sense with Serena that she can kind of do anything. Yeah. Yeah. I feel coke, but some, I mean I think the thing for me with those was, um, this, this interesting non-existent language. It was a language barrier but it wasn't a language barrier and the scenes were very interesting to watch in the sense that, you know, it's, it's somebody who wants this other person so badly to communicate yet is having trouble communicating maybe the emotions and what they want out of their partner themselves. Um, I don't know if he felt that way at all or is that is just a beautiful acting exercise where you have a very narrow corridor of communication between the two characters and therefore as actors, you have to, you have to be so accurate into getting that on film down that tiny parameter of communication that it absolutely is this also where beautiful too.

Speaker 3:          30:49          Isabel question at our director that we both worship and we love her. She's Kathalyn and she, uh, she shoots with such a delicacy and intimacy. You know, she's the operator at like Soderbergh and there's very few directors who are operators, but she gets behind that camera and she's able to, you're never quite sure sometimes where the camera is. So the scene is just about life. It's not about just blocking it out. She rarely blocked something out in a very strategic way. She just, and it gives the scenes a delicacy and an a true intimacy and that, that we owe to Isabel

Speaker 4:          31:29          porch the camera and exactly the right place every single time. So that we as the actors never have that anxiety. Well, you wonder whether or not the director has seen what you're trying to do. Get it. It was not happening. Sometimes they miss it completely or they bring them their own agenda and their own narrative and it doesn't, they're not filming what's there. And Isabelle films, what's there

Speaker 3:          31:56          and she, she never misses anything. Not a thing. It's crazy there to watch her shoot. It's, it's art too. She puts the camera on like a Bungee cord and it swings in and out silently. It's, it's, it's something to behold and it's her own style. Yeah. And the DP is behind her and she just, she starts to move and swoop the camera on this like almost like little arm. Yeah. And it's hitting on, uh, engineering and art. It's engineering and art and it's, um, something we love. Yeah. Um, so we'll take audience questions in a moment if anyone wants the lineup. Um, so I, I have to ask,

Speaker 4:          32:40          do you yourselves drives and if so, what was one of the memorable moments about learning to drive? Well, because you know, I become a commodity, therefore I'm driven. I'm driven to the studio. I'm driven to here. I drive less and less and less. Where I do drive is in, in Oxford. Sherry is the English countryside narrow country lanes. It, it happens to be farming country. So if I'm running an errand in, in my vehicle, so it's a land long wheelbase, Land Rover. It's a really tough, beautiful car. Um, I'm running errands, they're working, they're moving Matt, tons of Hay. They're moving livestock. They've got combine harvesters. I've learnt to be alert to the narrow corners. Anything could be horse riders, anything could be coming round it. I've learnt pullin Polin they're working like the guys passed. I love the etiquette of driving in the English countryside is really something beautiful.

Speaker 4:          33:41          I don't, I, yeah, I don't really drive anymore. I drove for this movie and I joked with my father that maybe when I come home to New Orleans next time he'll teach me to drive again. And he said, I don't think so bad. Huh? There's not enough red wine in the world. And I think my final question before we had the audience is, um, what do you think was the most rewarding part of, was it just getting this film made for you or has it been the journey afterwards or it's telling the story to people is a joy for me. Um, we're storytellers and to have people touched by moved by amused, by entertained, by what we do for a living. It's absolutely glorious.

Speaker 3:          34:30          Uh, there was one moment early on when we were shooting, you know, like I said, this has been a long journey for me to get this film made and one day in pretty much the first day and when we were both in the makeup trailer and I was sitting there and I was talking about Wendy and my hair and what we're doing in makeup. And I looked up and I saw Sir Bannon is beautiful turban and he looked so extraordinary and there he was. He was Darwin. And I looked at the two of us. I thought, oh my God, it's, we're here. He's here. Ron is here, Wendy is here. Um, we made it, we, we've got the, we got this movie made. It was a remarkable moment that I'll never forget. Wonderful.

Speaker 4:          35:25          Come on guys. Any audience got da, we got one. I have a question. I wondered, you've played these extraordinarily diverse roles recently and I wondered if you had anything that was discovered about yourself during these roles of playing people from other cultures. You know, what, what we, what I discover, uh, is not necessarily anything from the character. I'm playing because my job as a portrait artist is to put oil paint on the canvas. In other words, it's pretty well a one way street with some tiny exceptions. But what I learned about being a, an actor in the out in the world is the politics of the film set. Because I can tell you now every version of human life is alive and well and present on the film set. And it's not just patty and I, a lot of people behind the camera who are trying to make something beautiful with you and for you. And sometimes they really get it wrong. Um, we won't mention that the department that consistently got it wrong, but boy did that tax our patients that what, what it teaches you is to read, read the signs from the film crew patients and understand that everyone is doing, giving it their best shot. And I learn a great deal from my journey as an actor and not necessarily from the characters I've played, but from the process itself.

Speaker 2:          37:05          Thank you.

Speaker 5:          37:09          Hi, uh, uh, it's been a pleasure listening to you and, uh, I promise I'm going to waste a movie. Okay. But I'm gonna to take this, just one chance to say to serve Ben, thank you so much for your great, uh, acting in the movie. Gandhi. Uh, it's one of the most popular movies in India even today. And I have two kids who are a bit small right now, but when they grow up to an age, I'm going to like play this movie for them because it tells so much about India and I'm a great man. So thank you so much and I want to thank the organizers here for giving me, giving me this opportunity. Thank you. All the best. Thanks. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          37:51          Thank you. Thanks.

Speaker 5:          37:57          So Patty, you've sort of mentioned a few times that you've been wanting to do this movie for a long time. It's, it's spends something to spend on your mind. So how did you, how, uh, what was it the, that um, gave you the idea of wanting to create this movie?

Speaker 2:          38:13          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          38:13          well, there was a beautiful, um, essay by the Great Katha Pollitt. I don't know if you knew, she has been, um, is she, uh, I'm sure some of you do. But, um, she, uh, she had this beautiful essay, semi autobiographical in the New Yorker many, many years ago. Uh, and I read it and I resonated with me even many years, many years ago, and I thought it was at once, uh, this, the humor and the pathos in equal dose and sometimes simultaneous. I, I just was taken by it. And, um, I then found out that a woman named Dana Dana Friedman had option the story and turning it into a store, into a script. And that Sarah Koenig, she had written this script and then they came to me and I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. I said, oh my God, I know this story. I love this story. Um, that was long. I joked that I was an ingenue when they first brought me this to the script, but, but I, um, I, uh, I just loved, I thought that the meeting of the minds of Katha Pollitt and Sarah Koenig Shin, I thought she would be captured the, this story, the essence, the heart of Katha Pollitt in the story.

Speaker 3:          39:30          And yet she opened it up and made it her own and a beautiful, a beautiful journey, um, of these two people. And so why, you know, that last line, I say one of the, pretty much the last line I say in the film, you know, you're my faith. And I had to remind myself of that, that line almost daily, uh, uh, that I had to have faith that, that someone would, would believe in this project that someone, that all the, the, uh, the, the movie gods would bring everybody together at the right moment. And that some person would say yes. And that's what happened. A man named Gabriel Hammond and his brother Daniel Hammond, we're starting a new production company and they're young. They're like your age. And these young men could have chosen any film. I mean, a film with storing hot young stars, you know, with models in Bikini's running around.

Speaker 3:          40:35          Um, I can't believe I just reduce, um, but these young men chose, uh, to make this film. Uh, I went to dinner with Gabriel Hammond and we had a three hour dinner at my, my hangout. I live at this restaurant called Cafe Lou in New York. And he met me there and we sat in my booth and we talked for three hours. We never once talked about the movie. We talked about his life, his mother, his mother had passed away. He loved the movie pieces of April. And we talked about life and love and growing up. And at the end of that, the three hour dinner, he said, I want to make this film. Mm hmm. He said yes. Just took one person. Oh, good question. Um, you talk about reading this article in the magazine. How did that come about? I did you just pick up them? No, I, I, I'm obsessed with in New York. I did tools. No, I'm obsessed with the New Yorker. I, I read the New Yorker, uh, I, it's an addiction. Um, but, uh, here we go to jail.

Speaker 4:          41:58          The Light, the manuscript that when did it leaves in the back of the carb. Yeah. Is there a possibility ability that you might have missed reading that story? Just, you know, you may not have got the New Yorker on that,

Speaker 3:          42:09          that additional, that's very possible. Yeah. But I didn't, yeah, that's the important thing. Yeah. I read it and I saved it. Well, I save, I had, I had boxes of in New York or I wouldn't know the New Yorker. I wouldn't throw them out. I eventually people said, petty takes the New Yorkers out of your hands. Just give me the New Yorker and giving me. But I, um, I, I, I did, I did happen to read this story and I, um, that's really how it happened. But it wasn't that unusual because I, I was, I always read the New York. Right, right, right.

Speaker 5:          42:49          Hi, thanks for coming out today. Uh, I had a question sort of on acting mythology. So, you know, it seems like you're both very, uh, in tune with these characters that you play and you know, as the movie, the completion of the movie and then you move on away from it, it wouldn't do you separate yourself from those characters that you played and sort of become Sir Ben and Patty again and move on to other roles.

Speaker 4:          43:12          The W when I was at school, I studied physics and there is a law in physics which, which, um, confronts elasticity. And the law says that if you stretch something beyond its point of elasticity, it's point of elasticity. I have a physicist to hit nodding on my left. It will not shrink back to its original shape. So although we throw ourselves into our roads, we have developed a technique. We have developed boundaries, which we alluded to earlier. And we are, there's something in our DNA, in our, in our reactive bodies that says, well, if you go there, you will have passed your point of elasticity and you will not shrink back. And fortunately, um, I know it doesn't always happen. There are some actors who will get terribly distressed, uh, they resort to drugs, to alcohol to compensate, to try and get back to, to cope with this rather dangerous thing that we're playing with. We are playing with that point of elasticity. And, um, for me, because I have a rather forensic approach to my, to my work, um, it, it does, I know the is shrinking back. I can feel it even, you know, after every take, after every take, it has to come back for me. Some people like to stay in the stretch zone all day. I come back to me and then take a jump to the next, to the next take.

Speaker 3:          44:47          I think, um, uh, for me as, as I work a, the emotional life of a character, I, Eh, what is essential for me is to marry it to the emotional life that I have. So I have that well available and readily available. So it is, it's difficult at the end of each day when you're doing very emotional scenes. It's never easy, but if it's easy, you should, I've often thought if it's ever easy, I shouldn't be doing this. Um, uh, but I will say when a movie is over, there's a small part of you. For me that's always been given away that you'll never get back. And it is, um, it's just, that's part of the, that comes with a job in a way. It's just, it's a small little, there's something you've given away. There's something you've sacrificed in some way for this. And it just, it, it's just, it happens.

Speaker 3:          45:51          And I find I've now learned to find peace with that and realize that, you know, the recovery process is, uh, it's, is, is slow, but it does, it will come. But it is more info when, when you end, uh, these projects, it's, it's for me. Um, I just finished doing the elephant man. I did it on Broadway and then I took it to, with Bradley Cooper to London and I just closed the play two weeks ago. And here I am in Palo Alto and I haven't quite mourn the loss of Mrs Kendall and that whole journey with the elephant man because I came straight into doing press and maybe that's good. Maybe I'll just, I won't have that, that, that mournful process. I don't know if you, when I get home to New York after all of this, I'm going to sit in my bed and drink bourbon. I don't know. I think I'm probably going to do a celebratory Bourbon, you know? Okay. Celebratory Bourbon.

Speaker 4:          47:03          Yeah. Anyway, thank you so much Bryce. He mentions the word sacrifice in response to your question, but also there's another word that you could also apply, which is that you share and you share with audiences. And that's why that young woman cried because you are getting amazing responses from people who are sharing what you do. So I don't sacrifice would go into the vacuum. Yours doesn't. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          47:32          no, no. I mean it's just, it's a very life affirming. Well, yes. I mean you give up a part of yourself for the greater good. Yeah. That's what it, oh, no, it's a beautiful thing. Beautiful. It's a beautiful thing. I mean, when it works, there are times when no, I mean, in this film, the response we've gotten has been, um, it's, it's been, it's been great.

Speaker 6:          47:59          I have a question. Um, so I guess one of the things that being accomplished actors who gives you is a very strong platform to have influence across the world on masses. I'm a Sikh and I want to tell you this is a movie Debbie celebrate, um, in our community. Um, one of the things it does is it helps some of the lesser known religions kind of highlight. And the question I have for you guys is do you at a personal level have a humanistic goal of when you play a such rules, does it satisfy an innate desire to do something for the humanity, you know, across that cuts across geographical lines, country lines, and you know, it's going to be celebrated perhaps more so in a vase, smaller section of the the world. Um, you know, and still be able to sort of have the influence.

Speaker 4:          48:52          I think that we are distant descendants from something tribally, absolutely essential. And that is that we are descendants of the ancient, ancient, ancient storyteller who used to light a fire and get the tribe around him or her and comfort them in the night. Tell them very reassuring, beautiful stories. So that they would have the confidence to know that the night would pass, the sun would come up again. And I'm sure in our DNA that both patty and I are distant, distant, distant descendants from the healist Sharman storyteller. I'm sure we are. And certainly, um, uh, W I think we're aware that, that you drop a pebble into the water and the ripples can be extraordinary. Um, I don't think we strive to do that, but I think it comes with the job. Would you agree?

Speaker 3:          49:51          Yes. But I have to say through what you just said, made the whole nine years that journey worth it.

Speaker 2:          50:01          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          50:09          Hi, I'm patty. This, um, this film clearly has been a very long coming goal for you and now that you've finally achieved it. I was just wondering if there's some other project that you feel just as passionate about that is next on the list. Yes, I do. I have another, I have another long journey of a film, uh, about, uh, my next journey is to make a movie about this fabulous woman from the forties, thirties, forties, 50s named Tallulah Bankhead. If you don't know who she is, Google her. Uh, uh, she was, um, quite a character, a brilliant, funny woman, a great actress. And, and, uh, Phil did, she really defined the word Joie de vivre. And, uh, she, uh, she broke all the boundaries and broke all the rules in Hollywood. She's just someone I've wanted to play and you have to have a very deep voice. And, uh, and I'm, I'm, I'm pretty much there. And, uh, so, uh, it's just, she's a woman that fascinates me. Um, she was, uh, omnivorous and a carnivorous. She was, she, uh, she wanted everything in life and every person, male, female, she, um, I'm, I'm looking forward to, that's the next journey. So beautiful script. Uh, I'm in the process of getting that together and to make that very cool. Thank you. Wish me, please say, hopefully it won't be nine years. Good luck. Thank you. Well, thank you

Speaker 2:          51:52          so much. [inaudible]. Thank you both so much for joining us today and I hope everyone enjoys the film very much. Thank you so much. You guys.
