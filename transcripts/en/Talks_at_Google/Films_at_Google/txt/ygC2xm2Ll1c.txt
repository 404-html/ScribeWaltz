Speaker 1:          00:06          Well, thanks again for everyone coming today. I just want to thank our guests in our panel here is the first we have Andy hidden our VP and chief ethics and compliance officer at Google who will be hosting the panel next to him. We have Jeffrey Brown who an Academy Award winning director, film producer and screenwriter. So Jeffrey's dedicated his life to working with organizations and an effort to help stop trafficking and helping victims. And one of those organizations who works closely, closely with is courageous girls and on a project that is called the India and Nepal project, which we'll be talking more about today. Uh, next to him we have near Jet Nick who, um, uh, graduated from Cambridge University before training at the drama center in London and sold, she played Anita a survivor of trafficking and as a result of her work unsold, she's become an ambassador for children's international international and they're taught not traffic campaign. And to our far right, we have Sylvia Vasquez Lovato. She is the founder of courageous girls. The organization Jeffrey is working closely with on the India and Nepal project. They worked to help survivors of sexual violence and find their inner voice in the strength. And in addition, she's a technologist working for paypal, helping to re humanize money for those who need it most. And she's an avid mountain year, uh, who was the first female Peruvian to summit Mount Everest. So thank you all for being here today. We appreciate it. Uh, well can it to Andy.

Speaker 2:          01:27          Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for your part in the, in the movie and in their response to the, the, the horrible situation that it portrays. Um, Jeffrey, I guess it's a broad question, but how did you end up making a movie like this? I mean, it is, it's not obvious to me how you, how, how these things can, how you, and this came back. Can you talk a little bit about that? Yeah, so my, my dad is a pediatric epidemiologist who, uh, worked all over the world for care, save the children, UNESCO. So I grew up in many different countries and uh, saw children who were at risk. And so I'd always wanted to make a film and I, I became a specialist that's a director in getting young performers to do incredible things. And so, uh, you know, when I read this book, I felt like this would be a really powerful entry point for people to learn about a terrible thing that's happening to the world's children and that I could bring people in with a film to help address this. And can you talk a little bit about bringing people in? How many, how'd you pull people together to make this a reality?

Speaker 2:          02:37          So we, uh, we had many, uh, investors who became part of this and uh, a large group of them live in Seattle and they actually formed a, they came with us to India. They went to meet the survivors. I knew right away that the, the way to make a true film is to immerse everyone in the reality, our, our crew, even on investors, we introduced them to children who are survivors. And really nothing has ever changed my life as dramatically as meeting 2000 of these kids who had been brutalized in brothels, in Kolkata. And in India, in Mumbai, and, and, uh, Kathmandu and they, Paul and meeting these children. I, I, I walked in, for instance, in sunlight into a rescue facility. And I, you walk by a very old guard, tiny old guard with a very old gun, a rifle, uh, which is older than the guard.

Speaker 2:          03:38          And, and then you look to your right and you see this cage attached to a room. And in that cage where two girls, one was about 13 years old, the same age as Lakshmi in the film. And she was terrified. The look on her face was like a wild animal with her back against the wall, looking for a way out. The girl sitting next to her with slightly older, she was maybe 15 or 16. She had been at sunlight for a while and she was tenderly talking to this girl. She was saying, my name is so and so. These are clothes that you can have. And uh, I am, you can just call me Dee Dee, Dee Dee and Hindi means sister. And what she was really saying is, I'm your family now and you can count on me. I'm there for you and I'm going to help you through this.

Speaker 2:          04:26          The girl who had was the young girl had been rescued half an hour before she had just come out of a brothel. And I will never forget the look on this child's face. And I realized in that moment, these were my kids. I have to do something to help them. And uh, across India, their price, 350,000 children who've been rescued from sexual slavery. And so the two things that I realized after going to many of these nonprofits that they need, because the problem is these kids are not going to be able to go home. Their families won't accept them. They're villages one except except them back. The shame and stigma, um, makes these kids orphans. They are alone in the world. And when they age out of the NGO at 18, they have to have vocational skills and they have to have some inner healing so that they can have real relationships again.

Speaker 2:          05:25          And it's almost like they die in this process. They become numb, they get PTSD, they don't trust anyone. They shut down. And, and I arrest is an amazing way to bring them back. It's a, it's trauma informed Yoga, new drug. It actually comes from India. It's an Indian yogic practice that is being widely used in the Va. There are now a hundred veterans who are trained in Irs Yoga Nedra who are deployed and training hundreds of thousands of returning vets and they're getting off their meds, they're sleeping. And we're beginning this process now in Nepal and India with amazing women. There are 10 women in Nepal who are trained in art, art therapy and these are survivors and we're training 25 in Kolkata and Mumbai. And these are trained, uh, survivors who are trained as dance movement therapy teachers. And so with IRS as well as those other modalities, they're going to reach hundreds of thousands of these children and young women to help them come back from the dead, recover their lives, be able to sleep at night, get out of that low self esteem, depression.

Speaker 2:          06:37          And we're also doing vocational training work. Uh, we're bringing vocational training to the NGOs and we're, and we're bringing, um, work to helping businesses that employ survivors expand. So those are the, those are the two programs that I'm really passionate about because I feel like without the inner freedom from fear that these kids can get from IRS and without vocational training, then they're not going to remain free. They're going to remain in this trap that they've fallen into. Thank you. Thank you. Sophia. Can you talk a little bit more about your role and, and healing some of the victims? Yes. And thank you very much.

Speaker 3:          07:15          Thank you. Um, so I'm a survivor of sexual violence and I have found my healing through nature climbing and um, you know, sometimes things are, it's perfect timing and I started my organization to try to help young survivors on that end. And then I had the opportunity of meeting Jeffrey and I saw sold and I was completely moved. So I decided to connect traffick survivors say Nepal. And I was there actually the first time we screened, sold in Nepal until like late 2014 and there was a group of about 10, 15 survivors sitting behind me and the imagery through the whole movie, they were crying. And when they finish just in managing them, they all started embracing themselves. Um, and you know, several of them reach out to Jeff and told that, thank you for sharing my story. It was really, really powerful. And so I had the opportunity of working with them, bringing them to base camp of Mount Everest and actually through iris, give them that opportunity for them to reconnect that strength.

Speaker 3:          08:15          And I was very fortunate of seeing how this worked for some of these young women. Whenever dusk will be coming into light, you would see them starting to shiver, feeling uncomfortable. They couldn't close her eyes. I mean, just even the imagery of them, you know, having a good night's sleep. And that's what I really started introducing to them and he was so powerful to see the impact that he could have. Um, I don't think we have the chance to show a couple of photos, but we were able to see, I mean after we started working with a small group of young women, some of them were able to take them into some of the shelters and that was just really powerful. We had, but it um, a German I risk practitioner who was living in Kathmandu at the time. So she was able to kind of start doing a very basic entry level and yes, to see the effect of what the entry level of virus date on that just gave us that hope. Just imagining being able to bring these at a much larger scale, which is exactly what we're going to do. I mean, what we're doing right now, I'm trying to get these three sessions where we're bringing actually the train the trainer of old trainers of virus. We're bringing in a woman who is extremely specialized. It's going to be spending a lot of time in Nepal and in India and just being able to empower this. And this is some, it's an amazing modality that he's got to make such a huge difference.

Speaker 2:          09:39          Thank you. So your jet, uh, first off, an amazing data. Thank you. So I, I can't imagine how you can make them movie like this and not be affected by it. Tell us what was the effect of doing a film like this for you?

Speaker 4:          09:59          Yeah, well, um, I met Jeffrey, I'm totally by chance in New York and um, I didn't know that trafficking existed in the way that it does and I didn't know that modern slavery existed in the numbers that it did. So first of all, just meeting Jeffrey really opened my eyes to that. And then, um, you know, as an actor you really need to embody characters, um, who a lot of their time, their experience in life is completely different to what you've experienced. Um, and so you have to empathize. So when we started shooting, before we started shooting the movie, we actually met with survivors and um, I met with two women who are in their thirties and they had been trafficked when they were 13 and 14 and they were one of the lucky ones who actually got out because it's such a, it's actually a, you know, it's a very rare story for these girls to get out.

Speaker 4:          10:54          But I couldn't believe the difference between them. Um, one of them when I met her, she was in her thirties but you could still see the suffering. It was just written all over her face. And she had, she had had children but she had gone into sex work in order to support them because she didn't have any other opportunities. Now the other woman was just completely different. She, I've never seen anyone shine so bright, like I didn't know like 10 times what you would think of movie star shines. Like, like her eyes were sparkly. She was smiling, she was joyous. She was so happy to be talking to us as actors because she knew what we were going to be doing with this movie. She knew that it was going to be powerful and she did like a dance for us in a song for us.

Speaker 4:          11:39          And what they both had in common was their strength. Both of them were incredibly strong. But I think what this second woman had found, she had married a taxi driver who she was in love with and um, she had had kids and I think through life somehow she had found heating. And that is where I think I rest is really, really powerful and that it can help these girls actually find that heating so that they can go and so that they can flourish and to go from that level of suffering to that much light and brightness. I, I just found her amazing. Um, but it was the strength that they had that sort of really struck me. And I thought that's what I want to bring to an eater. Like I want to bring that kind of strength to her. So, um, there was one day on set and it's a really simple scene.

Speaker 4:          12:26          Like I put on makeup every day, like, you know, like I put on clothes, like, you know, it's just something that I do every day. Um, and in this scene we, um, I was forced to put up makeup on a 13 year old Lakshmi and it was the first day that she'd been in the brothel and I knew where she was going. I knew what was going to happen to, I knew where she was headed, I knew why I was putting this makeup on her. And I have never ever felt so much rage on a film set in my life. I was incensed. It was, it's this tiny thing. I was just putting lipstick on a go, but I was so angry and in that moment the penny dropped and I was like, oh, that's her strength. I was like, that is what we need to strength as she has that fire, she has the anger, she has that defiance and she stands defiant until the end.

Speaker 4:          13:11          You know, even her last line in the movie, I've always wanted to travel. She is defined and she's sort of like cracking and very darkly humorous joke at the end. And, um, and I absolutely love that about her. So I really learned that I think that's exactly the way we should all be in this fight. We should stand defiant and we should, we should be angry and we should be incensed by what we've seen and what you guys have seen today. Um, and we should use that anger and we should use it to really do something about this because this can't go on. Um, so yeah, I think, um, meeting Jeffrey's sort of really changed my life and gave me some sort of purpose, um, um, in within this cause. And um, yeah, I've never met anyone who works so tired to sleep against those. So I really hope that you will all join us in it as well and that you will feel that way. I can see from your eyes that you have been affected so much by seeing the movie. Um, so yeah, thank you for coming on a Monday afternoon in your lunch break. We really appreciate it.

Speaker 2:          14:17          Thank you. And it's these, the resilience that you spoke up, that's really what we saw across the board. These children and women are, are very, very strong and given a chance. Uh, they are the fearless ones that will go forward and make change. They will get the laws enforced. They will become the survivor advocate leaders. Uh, that's what's happened in the U S and, uh, in the nonprofits. The staff are often survivors themselves and they're the ones helping to rescue others and helping to heal others and empower them. And so it's just about really helping them get empowered and I rest, we'll do that. It will liberate them insight to step up to their full strength, their full power. For those of us who aren't familiar, I rest a little bit about what that is. So it is, um, it is a yogic breathing modality where you, you breathe and you focus on different parts of your body and it works on the two hemispheres of the brain.

Speaker 2:          15:24          And they've done studies with the veterans that have been using it. And literally what happens with Traumas, it stores in many areas of the brain, but the brain thankfully is very elastic. When people have PTSD, their brain actually shrinks. It changes shape physically and after IRS. It relaxes and goes back to the normal, full shape. It, it, the contraction releases. And what happens with Traumas, people get stuck in fight or flight mode. They get stuck in being hypervigilant, always having their adrenaline on getting triggered by all kinds of strange things because of the trauma that they had, like a door closing that might just set them off. Uh, and IRS is a way of welcoming fear and facing it and in a really tender, loving way and breathing into it. And the first instinct of all of us is to avoid fear and avoid, uh, the feelings.

Speaker 2:          16:28          But what happens with IRS is you go into them, you let them come up and you let them dissolve like clouds. They just pass through ultimately. And it's a really powerful, simple, tender way of healing people. Thank you. Any questions from the audience? What role do you see for corporations in supporting this cause? What can corporations do and what can employees do to potentially support that too? So there are two levels of slavery. There are two types of slavery on the planet. There's sex trafficking, which happens to very young kids. And you just saw a movie about that and that's what we're, we're addressing. And then there's labor trafficking. Both need to be addressed. Jeff and his team are working on corporate responsibility, making sure that slavery is not in any of the supply chains that are bringing products and equipment into Google. Uh, all corporations need to do that going forward.

Speaker 2:          17:33          They need to make sure that their suppliers are free of slavery in the supply chain. So that's one very powerful thing. The other powerful thing, it's giving it a voice. Uh, if we can get this, for instance, to Twitter, Facebook, other companies can, that can amplify the message of modern day slavery. That's a very powerful thing. People mostly walking on the street do not know that there are now 21 million or 45 million slaves on the planet earth. Most people don't know that. I didn't know that before. I read this book and an option that the next day and started getting involved in this issue. Now I'm very educated in this issue, but previously I was largely ignorant. I thought it happened to a number of people in other countries. I didn't know it was so prevalent in my own country, in my own backyard. And it's about sort of learning, teaching yourself what it is and then finding ways where your heart feels called to address it.

Speaker 2:          18:29          My heart feels really called to helping these children survivors because I feel like they're going to be the change makers. And we've seen that, uh, 10 survivors testified to Congress in the u s and we have something called the t visa, which, uh, is a way for survivors not to be sent back to their countries of origin. They can remain in the u s because of the TVS that, because 10 survivors testified to Congress. So that's an example of survivor voices making real change that, did that answer your question there? They're more, you know, there are a lot of organizations, a lot of our partners on our website, so@themovie.com you can see they're wonderful organizations doing great things both domestically and in other countries. So you just have to find out where your heart fields called to to take action and serve. Thanks. Um, I was curious, what's the reaction in India and Nepal to the film?

Speaker 2:          19:27          So you heard a little bit about Nepal. Uh, we showed it to about 500 people in Nepal. Uh, ministers of government survivors. Uh, the laws changed after the showing of the film. It's much more difficult now for someone under age to cross from Nepal and to India. Uh, you're required now to be with a relative, uh, an immediate relative of your family if you're crossing and you're under age, but they're still government officials that are rubber stamping a certificate saying that this is not a 14 year old. This is an 18 year old who is free of her own volition to go to India. So there's still loopholes, uh, but it's gotten better. India, we haven't actually brought the film to yet. Uh, we hope to air it on television in India. We're translating it into Hindi and Bengali. We just received a grant from a philanthropist to do that.

Speaker 2:          20:19          And we have organizations on the ground in Nepal, India and the western Bangol who will take it into rural villages, the most prevalent areas where children are traffic from and show this film there. And part of what we're doing with the vocational work that we're, that we're beginning to do as well is to reach out into the rural villages where the children are traffic from and do some of the vocational work there as well. Because the issue is, is poverty. And another part of it is the inequality of, of women to men. Um, those two things are very much, uh, what can make trafficking very prevalent.

Speaker 3:          20:59          And I just quickly want to add that, you know, one of the problems or one of the challenges is that for many of these girls, the shame that happens after they feed rescue, sometimes they can get back to the vintages. So what iris is going to be able to bring is cutting through that shame internally through that trauma healing, there'll be able to gather that as strength in order to be the more stronger advocates of what's happening. I mean, the words coming from survivors, it's incredibly more powerful and the passionate that they will have. So that's one of the abilities. That's one of the advantages as well that they feel has created in at least a little bit in the fall. And we'll have a, but in India, um, I did, I went to a really small screening of sold that we did as part of a film festival in India. And, um, uh, we're, we haven't yet, um, translated into Hindi or Nepali, although, and goalie, although we're planning on doing that. And so I went there with the English version of the film and, uh, we had, um, maybe around 50 to 100 women come from the local villages in this very rural part of India. I remember freaking out and I was like, oh gosh, are they getting time to stand it? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          22:02          I was worried about how they would relate to it because of the language barrier. And I was sitting and I could see the audience when I started paying the movie and they just went boom. And um, these, these women from these rural villages just kind of locked into the movie. They understood the story and at the end of them, at the end of it, so many of them came to me just with tears in their eyes and they understood the message of it. And so in terms of raising awareness about the issue in these rural areas where, where girls do just get picked off, I thought the film played really well there and it was really powerful in the message, reached them regardless of the fact that it was an English. So I think once we do get it translated, it'll be that much more powerful as well.

Speaker 2:          22:47          And we've opened up quite a few Indian film festivals all over the world. And uh, the response from the Indian audience has been really embracing. We, we've won quite a few awards and Indian film festivals. It's been wonderful. Audience awards and things like that. Uh, we have to wrap it up because of a livestream. So Jeffrey Nicha. Sylvia, thank you so much. Thank you. Very powerful brand. Amiable. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          23:09          Thank you very much.
