Speaker 1:          00:06          Welcome to toss to Google, I'm highly not. And then today

Speaker 2:          00:09          half the well known actor, but now director, writer and Songwriter Bradley Cooper in our myths to discuss his directorial debut film, a star is born, which he also co wrote, produced and stars in

Speaker 1:          00:24          along with the Fabulous Lady Gaga who herself was here, wants to move forward. Dave Chappelle, Sam Elliott and other stars. So, but uh, you've just seen his story. So I think we're going to invite Bradley on stage list.

Speaker 3:          00:46          Hey,

Speaker 2:          00:47          one of the nicest, hardest working people in Hollywood. You're very real. You keep it real. You've had an arc as an actor that has been impressive both on in theater and, uh, numbers, uh, for Academy award nominations, I believe Baptist and so forth. But you've entered this new realm of directing. So you've kind of gone from what we would call around here, an individual contributor role, the act, wow. Two leader where you have to have a vision and you need to fire people. And then you have budgets and you've got technology. So were you at little bit scared going into all this or how did it all roll out?

Speaker 4:          01:27          You're, you're absolutely right. The first of all, thank you for having me. It's such a pleasure to be, oh, it's hardship

Speaker 3:          01:32          to how you can really,

Speaker 4:          01:35          no, it's Kinda, it's, it's insane. Insane. And I was able to get, you were kind enough to invite me this lead to the Google camp when we showed the movie, which was really cool.

Speaker 2:          01:44          Everyone was buzzing about it. That was very great. Not a dry I heard. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:47          My daughter loved it. She is not the movie, but it's a big pool there. Um, uh, um, you're so right about budgetary issues and timing and all and all, all of that stuff. But I actually loved all of that. Um, I love to actually having a, you know, dipping my toe in all of those aspects of it. And I think that's because you're right, when you, when you have a vision and you want to see it through, I would feel very odd if I didn't, if I didn't have a part of the, it's cause that's part of the road. And how wide it is and how, how you know where the velocity picks up. You want to have a say in everything because it winds up the finished product is right now, now belongs to you. So I very much was a part of all of that and I couldn't imagine not doing it that way.

Speaker 2:          02:35          Anything really surprise you about that process and journey? I've seen so many interviews of the type cast coming together and saying we had a magic experience working as a team working as a collaborative creative group. It wasn't so much scripted as enabled by a clear vision of the story and your just freeing up lady Gaga,

Speaker 4:          03:00          Dave Chappelle to play their parts in ways they said they'd never experienced before and of course it's lady Gaga, his first film debut. So I think it has, I think that's, I've heard them say that that makes me so happy because that's what the goal to create an environment where as you all know, when you feel safe and you feel motivated and you also know that you're called upon to bring all of yourselves, that that's the environment that you can really thrive and you go home at night and think, oh wow, that was a really fruitful day. Um, I think because I've been in this business for 20 years, um, and um, I've been in brown all different types of environments in the same setting. Uh, I just, you know, I'm a good listener and observer, so I just watched and picked up everything that works for me. And I just wanted to create an environment which was the culmination of all of the good parts and take all the bad parts out of it, and then hope that in that respect, I could get the best out of the people that are entrusted themselves to me, quite frankly, because that was, I mean, I just couldn't believe that lady Gaga, it took such a huge risk because it's a big risk.

Speaker 4:          04:05          This isn't one of those projects where you're like, well, you know, if it doesn't work out, it'll, you'll be okay. Like, not really. He's not, it's not really this. It's like actually if it doesn't work out, it's, you're going to take a big hit. So, so there was a lot at stake and I'm, and even for Dave Chappelle, that took me like two and a half years to get him. And, um, because he just doesn't do this kind of thing. And, but he was so willing, and Sam Elliott, you know, I've never seen him play a character that was so filled with resentment the way that character was. And he just threw all of themselves into that. And, and then my hope is that it's because they felt that there was that kind of inspiring environment, which by the way, I sort of set the tone, but everybody else has to help create that, you know, every single crew member, everybody has to be on the same page and everybody dictates, I mean, you know, in your work environment, if there's one person that has an energy that's off the whole, it contaminates the rest of the team.

Speaker 4:          04:55          So everybody really has to be on the same page. And you pursued this script for years. I've seen various reports, six years. He said you proceed Dave Chappelle for over two years. So when did you get the burning idea to do the fourth incarnation of a star is born? It was, it was sort of like a coming together of two different things. I always knew I wanted to direct, um, and I would, I'd worked with great directors like David O. Russell or Clint Eastwood, who really allowed me to be a part of their process. I was in the editing room almost every day for silver linings playbook and Jay Cassidy, who was David said, or he, he and I worked together on this movie. Um, so I'd, I'd, I'd always knew that eventually I'm going to have to stop just saying I'm going to try to do and actually do it.

Speaker 4:          05:41          And because I knew that all these sort of compositions cinematically would always fly around in my head. And I was at a Metallica concert, um, and I was an, I had met Lars Olrick and, uh, like the night before, and I said, well man, I'm a huge Metallica fan and a, and he said, well, come to the, come to the concert tomorrow night. So I found myself 12 hours later standing behind his drum kit or Yankee stadium, and I can see the sweat on his back and I could also see the scope of the crowd. And I thought, this is an incredible composition that people don't get to see. And that was the, that was the, the, the birth of the eye, the subjective idea of always being on the stage four in the movie. So in the movie were never in the crowd. Um, so it was just like little ideas like that.

Speaker 4:          06:24          I thinking about fame, like what fame can be, um, you know, Paparazzi and you know, you can watch TMZ, but what is it? What's the experience like in, to me it's so it's sonic and it stayed this cacophony of noise where it's like, and then silence and that's the opening of the movie is your, your, your thrust onto this, into this thunder dome with this guy. And then all of a sudden you're into this very small, almost like coffin, like environment. And that, that's an emotional juggernaut for people. Uh, so that was something I thought of early on. And then there was just this property and Warner brothers had and it, and I thought, oh, I can explore all of these things. Family Trauma. What happens if two people actually love each other? There's no infidelity. It's actually true love. And even with that, it's hard. So these are things I wanted to explore. And then this property was perfect because it had music and you can't hide when you sing. And I thought, well this is, this would be the great way to do it. So really was, it was really a combination. I didn't think, I never, I never ever thought like, you know, it's a thing people should do the fourth, the remake of a stars definitely didn't do that.

Speaker 2:          07:34          And this is one like none other. So we're all going to pay money to see it. Um, you can't hide if you sing, you just said that you didn't hide. You studied boy, you took voice lessons for 18 months. You learn guitar and uh, Lady Gaga required that you take all of the, do all of the singing live that you weren't doubling it. Yeah. So what was that all like?

Speaker 4:          08:03          Well, the music is a character in the movie, you know, it's not like with the movie takes a break and then all of a sudden there's a song, it actually has everything to do with the, with what's going on. It's almost, it is a scene. My favorite scene of Lady Gaga is actually acting wise is the final song because you, we watched this character go through the grieving process through the song, which I just, that's what a, what a feat. Acting feet. She did. So it would have been, we had no choice but to sing live and that's much easier for her. And I thought, how the heck am I going to do that? And you know, cause she, and the other thing is she's the real deal. I know I had the nuclear power of the movie. It's like, well at least I have this.

Speaker 4:          08:42          I can, if the movie sucks, at least there'll be like 10 moments where she's singing and it won't be horrendous. But I knew I had to lift the rest of the movie up to her level. So you believe it. Otherwise, if you don't believe me as this character, you don't believe we're really on stage seeing in front of people. If you don't believe that Saturday night live, then there's no way I'm going to be able to allow you to enter into this world and learn about her. So there was really no question that that had to happen. It was great that she felt so strongly about it as well. Um, but it added, I mean it's part of the DNA of the film.

Speaker 2:          09:13          It's a beautiful story of Jackson main of Fading Country Music Star with the alcohol problem and Allie who you discover and encouraged and you see her rise through the film. So

Speaker 4:          09:25          20 when you say country stars. So when we started, uh, writing it, I was trying to figure out where he was from and I quite honestly thought like maybe it's country cause I could kind of like kind of fake saying and like maybe get away with it. And then as I kept working and starting to like fall in love and create this character, I swear if we had like six more months, he would have been like completely heavy metal,

Speaker 3:          09:45          like a cat guy.

Speaker 4:          09:48          Harder and harder and harder. We've talked about this actually what Genre Jack's music is because it's definitely not country, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          09:56          Twain when you speak and kind that ruddy red face, that looks like you had too much.

Speaker 4:          10:01          But even with the twine scotch. That's a good question. So in terms of his voice, that was the hardest thing actually was lowering my voice just about an octave. And I wanted to pick an act, a voice that, that you couldn't place geographically. And Sam Elliott wound up being the, before I even thought about writing the role for him, the voice that I studied. So I would get all of these tapes of Sam Elliott and abuse was, and then it got him and then, and then I was doing it and it, cause he's, he's born in Sacramento, which you never know he's from, he's from California, but his mother was from Texas, so he's got this odd accent that you can't really place. And then I was reading Bruce Springsteen's autobiography and he was talking about stealing his father's voice. That's what he did as a kid. Nice to always want to be my dad. And I thought, oh, what if Sam Elliott is his older brother? And he stole his voice. And so that's how that whole thing happened.

Speaker 2:          10:48          Wow. You're so you both visualize and you have auditory things going through your creative process. Yeah. It sounds like speaking about, um, auditory, there's someone in the audience who gradually lost her hearing as a child and has, is impressed by how accurately you portrayed the frustration and denial. Many people experience when losing their hearing. So her question is, do you have any personal experience with hearing loss and how did you study to portray that aspect of the role so authentically? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          11:22          Hmm. Oh, well, I'm glad that you thought that it was the person here. Hi Bradley. Nice one. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          11:31          Um, I'm glad you felt that way. I was born and here's the other thing. When you get to write the movie, you can just cheat all the time because you just do everything that's real to you. Like his choice of drink is crazy personal for me. That's my dog, Charlie. That's my real dog. Um, a bunch of my friends are in the movie, um, who I went to Grad school with and the hearing loss, I wanted him to be like a prize fighter because in the other versions of the movies, he's so obsessed with fame and this fames dwindling. And I didn't want, I had no interest in, in investigating that. And also people today, everybody makes money touring. And a lot of these bands that have been maybe huge back 20 years ago, it was still making a lot of money touring. So the reality was he's fine.

Speaker 4:          12:14          Um, so it was more about what's, what's the wear and tear and it takes a toll on your body. And I interviewed and spend time with tons of musicians and the thing that happens is hearing loss. That's the number one thing that goes, which makes sense. Um, but I was born with a clause to youtome in my ear drum and it was removed. And then I was kind of a car. I would always jump off a high places as a kid. Don't ask me why. And I kept puncturing it. And so I had all these operations, like five operations. I have a hole in my right ear. So when he's telling her that story in the bar, that's me. That's all real. That's like, so, yeah. Um, and so I have, I don't have hearing loss, but I that when I have ear infections, I hear that tonight is sound, so I know it very well. Um, and then it was all about in the mixing stage, creating, recreating that sound sonically for the audience. So I'm glad you felt that way. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          13:06          Beautiful. You talked about in one of the interviews I saw you just want it to be in this to create and make it real. So the backstory, you bring a bunch of friends, some graduate school friends from uh, New York City city. Yeah. There's the, I just studio the studio. And you've been collecting people like Sam Elliott and Gaga over it,

Speaker 4:          13:28          period. I did a TV show alias and two of those actors are in the movie run Rifkin and Greg Rumberger.

Speaker 2:          13:32          Wow. Yeah. So that can just be happenstance. So you've been collecting talent and ideas. Yes. Um, what was the moment you knew you could make it real? Was it when Warner greenlit it or was it just when you knew you had enough conviction about envision for this film that you could pull it off?

Speaker 4:          13:53          I think it was working with directors who were allowed me to be so collaborative with them. I think if it wasn't for David O. Russell, there's no way I wouldn't have had the confidence. But he really, it was like going to film school doing those three movies, particularly the two movies, a silver linings playbook and American hospital. Um, and I really got it and, but, but even when I did alias, I would, I hated La and I, and I like knew no one so, and I only worked three days a week and I just moved there for the tea, this television show. So I would just spend all my time on set and in the editing rooms and I would get everybody's dailies back. I would take them home. And that was when they were on VHS tapes. So I was always fascinated by the process. Got It. Um, so I think it was just a constant, you know, just sort of, um, uh, you know, listening and observing.

Speaker 2:          14:37          It's once Ferrell Williams came to visit us and he said, you know, you people are creatives, you just do it with your mice, which is actually a cinnamon for coding I guess. But there is some analogy editing and uh, knowing what the end product you're looking for. And it's a very technical process from just the

Speaker 4:          15:01          according to sponsors to color. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          15:05          Are you expert at that at this point or is that something that is also in its own way, a collaborative effort?

Speaker 4:          15:10          I mean, everything's a collaborative effort, but um, no, I, we spent months and months, I mixed every single car exhaust in this movie. Yeah. Because the, the, the film itself is one musical element. That's how it's all rhythm. Everything is rhythm and joy in life and, and, and especially a film. It has to be one musical elements so that you're not, you know, you're not bumping up against the guard rails while you're watching it. You feel like you're in good hands. Those are the best movies that I like to watch. This I just, Oh right. I, the rhythm is very, is very set. Um, and you create that in the editing room. That is where you create it.

Speaker 2:          15:42          And then you had the bold move of actually filming at Glastonbury and Coachella, which at Glastonbury in the UK, the biggest festival music festival needs every summer. What was that like? That's a real, that's a real deal.

Speaker 4:          15:56          And that really came out of necessity, which I'm sure you're all aware of it, you know, sometimes, you know, an idea comes out of what you can't do and that we had a limited budget and limited time and I thought, well, it has to be real. And I watched so many movies that had recreated live performances and you can really smell when it's not working. And uh, I thought, and actually Terrence Malick had just done a movie about songwriters and I had happened to see the trailer and I thought, and I said, oh, he's, so I called him and he was having, he was kind of to talk to me and he said, yeah, I've jumped on. But it's very difficult. But so that gave me the confidence that it's doable. And I go to Glastonbury every year cause I'm a huge music fan and that's how I knew them and they were, they let me go on. But that was crazy. We had four minutes in front of 80,000 people in the pyramid stage and it was a, it was, yeah, it was really something

Speaker 2:          16:40          looking at it this way out onto the crowd. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          16:43          but just getting real, just getting back for a second to what you were talking about earlier. That's one of the things that I really do love about the movie is when he, when Jackson says to him, the boy in a talent comes everywhere, but you know, everybody's got talent, but having something to say in a way to say it so people listen to it. That's a whole other bag that, that's something that we all have the ability to do. You know that if there's one thing that I hope people take from the movie is that they go, yeah, fine, what is it that you want to say and how do I want to say it? Um, and the Metta that I think is that lady Gaga did that in this movie and I was able to do that, that we helped each other do that in this movie.

Speaker 2:          17:17          Very cool. Um, there's something about determination and grit that has to go into pulling off something that's epic, but also you kind of jumped out of your actors skin and, or the place that you were fans for these past 20 years have had you as an actor and theater performer into this surprise. He's also a great director. There's a lot of press around you, just the shots close in shots, lingering shots, like just intense visual experience. That is all of a sudden you are on in your first go at this. Of course you've been in film for a while, but talk to us a little bit about that journey that it, did it require grit, self-belief. Did you ever doubt yourself and are you surprised now at the reaction of the critics and the press around wow. Like it's a new Bradley. I figured it,

Speaker 4:          18:18          you know Ellie, because van said if you're going to audition to play a cowboy show up with the horse because people only know what they see. So, so for me it wasn't a shock because I've been thinking about shots since I was a kid, you know, and observing movies and seeing like, and the movies that I love, his form always follows function and arbitrary cool shot. If I'm watching a movie and then I'm aware as I'm watching the movie, Oh, that's a cool shot. I'm, to me that's not enjoyable. As a, as a viewer of a film, I want to, I want to sort of afterwards when I'm thinking about how I felt emotionally, I said, oh well Martin Scorsese, that was one shot as they went into the Copacabana. Oh Wow. Right. You know, that's, that's the, that's the goal. So there's no, so I, you know, it's, and it's all character based for this movie.

Speaker 4:          19:01          Jackson takes his hat off when he's on stage, he wants to avoid the camera. She doesn't even, she's not even aware of her talent, but the movie's telling you in the beginning, she comes out of the bathroom and she's in the center of the procedure. She's on the stage already, even though she's in the bowels of a, of a, of a building in the bathroom. So you could do things like that cinematically with shots, but it's all based on story. And then by the end of the movie, he can't avoid the camera anymore. So when he's in the bed with her, the cameras right on top of him that he can't escape it. So the hope is that you're feeling these things, but you're not quite sure why, but it's because I'm manipulating it through the choice of the shot. And that's, that to me is what's fun about telling a story cinematically. That's the whole point. Otherwise, I never would have tried to direct a movie if I didn't have a point of view of how I wanted to shoot it.

Speaker 2:          19:46          I asked you earlier in what we called the green room, um, whether you're still playing to sing, uh, play the guitar and you said there's one song you want to go finish in the studio. So talk to us a little bit about that journey and whether you do it in the shower or you're gonna get

Speaker 4:          20:06          you come to the studio permanent. I did sing shallow in the shower, the hotel the other night. I was like, can I still sing that song? It was okay. I think when in the shower, it all sounds good, doesn't it? Um, no, I don't think, I mean, here's the thing I love about what I get to do for a living is I get to enter into a world like, like a sociologist, you know, and, and learn about everything and, and soak it and not just cerebrally but also since Suriya Lee and then then then get to transferred into some sort of ritualistic performance. So it's a wonderful way of learning. And this was incredible. It took four years, six years when I thought it, that's when I was at the concert with Metallica. And the truth is I've been lucky enough. There's something else that I feel that obsessed by now.

Speaker 4:          20:54          So I'm Kinda my, my head and my heart is somewhere else now. And the, and I only know how to do this if I am completely in love with it because as you said, it's true. It takes a tremendous amount of work. I mean, I edited the movie in My house, thank God because we were pulling 16 hour days for like six months. Wow. And um, and I just had a kid so there was that too. I'm always wondering if she's going to like grow up in like, oh cause of the, cause we, we edit, it's loud. It was right below her bedroom and I thought, oh, she's going to hear this music for like the first six months of her life and what her, she's going to like hate our music or love it. Yeah. Um, so, so I don't, I don't know how to do anything to this degree unless I completely love it. That said, um, I absolutely enjoyed singing, but I hope that what I want to do at least for the next decade or two, is to make movies. Um, but there was that song too far gone. That's in the, the cop far. And I only wrote the first verse and Chorus. And I had the other day I had this thought of the second verse and a bridge. So I'm going to go,

Speaker 2:          21:52          he's a songwriter. Multitalented you, you just said you are a bit obsessive. So what are you obsessing about now? I don't want to say because if it doesn't happen, all right, but hopefully you'll like it in five years. You know, a number of us have watched your career and know your characters so well. And I remember a wedding crashes you played so effectively it despicable guy. It was that football game. Yeah. And it's like put his tie over when he would beat somebody up, it made no sense. Just like sweat messaged Ohio. Well, what's your favorite character that I played as a Jack Jackson

Speaker 4:          22:42          to say, I think it's still a Joseph Merrick when I did the elephant man. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. That was a year long run on Broadway. Broadway in London. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          22:52          That's a lot of effort because sometimes two shoes day. So you made a specific choice and making Jack Jackson's character and alcoholic and a drug addict who's more rows and verbally cruel, but he's not violent. So someone has asked this question, it seemed to me you were pointing to the power of words. Could you talk about the development and nuance of building that character? Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 4:          23:17          To me, he's a, I mean it's for you now, but to me, he's a character who's, who's stuck at 13, 14 years old when that traumatic experience happen to them and everything comes from that. And he hasn't cultivated any other aspect of his life except for his music because the world was telling him this is what is important. That this is what we want from you. And he was able to share that. Now he's 43 and we meet him and he could tell his body is starting to take a toll, has hearing, and this gets old if you don't cultivate the rest of your life. Um, but he, to me, he's somebody that, that's what he loves and he still has an interest in people and music and, and love of the work. Um, and that's why he's the sort of blown away by her, but he's nothing.

Speaker 4:          24:00          He's an I, you know, I don't seem as cruel at all. In fact, the only really cruel thing he says is that horrible thing he says in the bathtub, but she doesn't even remember cause he's so he's intoxicated. Um, but even the way he says that it's almost in this, it's not an ad. It's not in an aggressive way. It's, you know, so, so I never saw him as, as he, first of all, he's also not a word Smith. He's not somebody who talks a lot, you know, he chooses his moments, you know what I mean? Um, I just, I, I feel a lot of, um, I care about him a lot. I just wish that he was taking care of more, you know, by his older brother,

Speaker 2:          24:39          you know, by himself too. I think that's an important lesson to us all. Once Allie is discovered, um, we do see Jack's hesitant reaction to her transformation. What should we understand about alleys reaction and also like lady Gaga, his own experience in that character transformation, which doesn't really parallel her own. No, not at all. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          25:05          The main difference with the other movies I think are these two characters that that's where we're sort of circling around and the other movies, the male character is, I'm jealous of her fame and doesn't like that he's losing the spotlight and she is a character who sort of an ingenue and looks at the world. The world is my oyster. I Dunno what's going to happen, but this is all great. These two characters, it's a guy who doesn't even think about fame. It's a byproduct that he's had to deal with. Um, he just cares about sort of, I'm trying to find a pure moment to fuel him. She's somebody who's 31 years old and has been told by the world or by corporate music driven by men that her physical appearance does not merit her song writing ability. So she won't shoot. They don't want her to sing the very songs that she's written.

Speaker 4:          25:52          And so she's relegated to singing in a, in a, in a bar and a dark bar and singing a cover, not even her own music. So that's a totally different character. That's a character who's just about given up, but she can't quite give up. She still has that need to perform, but it's, it's, it's in this, it's tucked away in this little corner. And so that's what I loved about this story is these two characters meet and when she's thrust into this world, that is the, the con, you know, the, the mechanized world of music in a way. Um, she's, she's taken a different direction, but we were, I was always conscious that she still had a voice in it. You know, when they have that fight in the bath though, she says, yeah, those are my lyrics. You have a problem with my lyrics. You know, her manager wanted her to go blind and she moved, went red. You know, she still had a choice, but she did sort of lose her weight as one does, but a wayward road, a career. And I always thought thought that was a shortcoming, you know, is that just because she's doing something else doesn't mean that it's not as truthful. It's just the road is very winding.

Speaker 2:          26:54          Our target's going to be aired on Youtube, which has on any day more than a billion and a half, uh, viewers around the world and the big hair and big plot point in our movie. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'd love to just ask you what you think this, the platforms that we have now, these technical platforms, but youtube in specific, how has it enabled to creativity? How, how do you view it? Do you spend time consuming content on,

Speaker 4:          27:25          I mean, [inaudible] they're a device. The, in its best form, what, what these platforms and technology has given us is the, the, the means by which we can, uh, create story in, in various forms, which is incredible. Um, I was talking to somebody a yesterday in Dallas about, you know, what took Stanley Kubrick six years to develop because he wanted to have some sort of flowing shot you could do with your iPhone now. Um, and then the, and then you could post it. And the fact that that you can get content out there is, is this incredible. So it kind of goes back again. You just have to figure out what it is you want to say and how to say it because of the means by which you can tell that story are at our disposal. You know, it's almost too easy. That's the other thing about shots. It's like, but form to me at least form still has to follow function. It all still has to do with what is it that you want to say and how do you want to say it? And then use technology in order to help you know, convey that.

Speaker 2:          28:18          Well, Bradley, thank you so much for having something beautiful to say. And the way in which you say it in a star is born is, uh, is people are reacting in rapture. It opens October 5th. Uh, we can't wait. Those of us weren't here to see the preview, to see it live, and I just want to thank you for coming to Google and thank you. Thanks. Right?

Speaker 3:          28:42          Yeah.
