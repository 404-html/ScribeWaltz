Speaker 1:          00:05          Please round of applause. Welcome to the stage director and star of a quiet place.

Speaker 2:          00:08          John Krasinski. I'll use all the stairs. Thank you. Hey everybody. Hello. What's up?

Speaker 3:          00:22          These are huge thing. I know the time now I'm blinded, but I know the time. The last thing I ever saw was the time.

Speaker 1:          00:32          So, so many ways that that could tie into what we're going to talk about. It's the best way to tie it all in. Yeah, no, it's hopefully, thanks so much guys. That was great. Appreciate it. So this is really new ground, uh, Standard John Rhe creature feature, pretty different. Take on things that you've done in the past. What do you mean talking about it? That's the funniest movie of the year, guys. I don't know if you're going to love it, but then also taking on the directorial role, uh, cowriting creditors, co-writer, but more really rewriting the screenplay to get it to take place. Uh, how was it for you to broach this genre? It was, um,

Speaker 3:          01:10          it was really scary, but it was really, uh, exciting too. I mean, for me, um, it's, it's the weirdest thing. I actually, nothing will ever top the office. Right? So it's this thing that was the first experience I ever had. It gave me all this opportunity and I just felt, if I'm honest, I just felt like I needed to earn it and I needed to deserve that amazing opportunity. So I tried to go out and do all these new different things to push it because I know all my friends that came up with me would do the same thing. That's really what it comes down to. And so for me, it's just about, and I'm so lucky to have this opportunity to say this because some people, most people can't, but I just looked for the stuff that really hits me and moves me. And so it seems really weird from that poster.

Speaker 3:          01:51          But this is truly a love letter to my kids because this whole movie is about parenting. And what would you do for your kids to protect them? And again, I know that poster does not say that, but when you see the movie, I read the original script by Beckon Woods and the idea is so great. I was, I have never been into horror ever. Like I was so scared as a kid of horror movies that I've never really watched a lot of horror movies. And so when I was sent the script, I definitely thought there's no way I'm doing this. And then I read the, uh, the idea of a family that has to remain quiet. Um, and you have to figure out why it was such a compelling idea. And then when I started to read it, it was just all about family. It was about this, these parents trying to do everything they could for their kid.

Speaker 3:          02:33          And the truth is we had just had our second daughter three weeks before I read the script. Listen, I cry at anything. It doesn't really, not that much of a compliment that I cried reading the script, but I was a wide open, you know, vessel of emotion and tension and I was actually living through what this family goes through, not the creatures part, but you know, trying to keep your kids safe and alive and are you a good enough person to be her dad? Like all that stuff is going through my head. So when I did do the rewrite, that's where I focused that I thought I could actually be the perfect person to do this because I was feeling so emotionally connected.

Speaker 1:          03:04          Well and it's great that you think of it that way and there are so clear on that messaging because it does really feel aside from all the creatures that are around it is this sort of coming of age drama. There's this great father, daughter dynamic, great father, son dynamic, uh, saw the movie. Um, um, how was it to sort of put the horror and the creature stuff aside to really focus on that and dig into, hey work, we're going to deal with some really heavy issues but also the world around us. It's crazy.

Speaker 3:          03:40          It's this thing. The truth of the matter is, and um, Greg Daniels who created the office, I remember there was one day where he said to me, your job is not to deliver these lines. Funny. Your job is to deliver these lines, play the truth of the moment. And the people think it's funny. People think it's funny. And if people think what you say to Pam is emotional, then it's emotional, but it's up to them. It's not up to you. And that sounds like a tiny bit of advice, but it actually changed my entire career and certainly was the reason why I did this. I mean, truly if he had not given me that advice, I wouldn't have done this movie because if someone said go direct a horror movie, I'd say, I don't know. I don't know how to do that. But what I did do is I reverse engineered it exactly as he taught me, which is your job is not to scare people or make the movie scary.

Speaker 3:          04:20          Your, your job is to make a movie honestly and tell a story that you really connect to and you're confident with. And if people get scared, that's up to them and you realize he's absolutely right because of the family dynamic. You actually are more scared in the movie because you don't want anything to happen to that family member. So again, I mean truly, uh, you know, I learned everything from the office and certainly Greg Daniels advice. There was the reason why I felt confident enough to do it. That said, I am also a super nerd when it comes to this stuff. You know, I remember my dad when we were little, one of the best bits of advice he ever gave me was, you know, one of the most confidence things you can say as a person is, I don't know. And so diving into this, I knew a lot of what I wanted to do and I knew a lot of what I didn't know.

Speaker 3:          05:03          And so I had to go out there and I had to a watch scary movies. So if you look at my iTunes for the last year, you'd think I have a problem. Um, and I just watched all the scary movies I could. The first thing I realized was how ignorant I've been to not participate in this genre world. I mean, some of the best movies I've seen in the last few years are genre movies from get out to the which to the Baba Duke to let the right one. I mean there's so many good movies. So I just became such a huge fan and took it all in and then creature design just dove deep into that world and it was just really, really fun actually to stay. I love stepping outside of my comfort zone. I remember as a kid I wasn't the best basketball player, but there was like that, that idea of like put me in and if I screw up, never put me in again. Um, and that sort of how I feel about life, I've taken on different genres and tried different things, but I'm fully confident with the fact that if I do it wrong or I'm not good at it, don't let me do that, please.

Speaker 1:          05:58          Well, I, I definitely think I did. A lot of people saw the movie, had the ability to see it. The people who were crying, the ones that you saw it last night. One of the things when I saw you don't really hide the monsters. It's not like a jump scare kind of, you know, some of that that takes place. But really it's, it's a masterful use of tension. And I think back to like, uh, like the concept of checkoffs gun, there's so much great foreshadowing and sort of like little glimpses and little hidden things that then pay off in such a big way. Uh, you know, playing a, wearing multiple hats, hymns, acting in it, and also having written it and directing it. And did you find it difficult to embed that stuff, navigate that stuff? Uh, from both sides of the glass? Uh, on the Lens?

Speaker 3:          06:43          Yeah. It's one of those things where when you do this as a new experience, you don't know how it can go horribly wrong. And so you just commit to what you know. And so, I mean, you're mentioning that the, the gun idea, it's, it's that thing of I just knew what would scare me. And I also knew that story wise, what would be interesting to me. And I thought that the conceit was so brilliant that you have to just set it up all along. I also remember I wrote the script, a promised land while ago that I wrote with Matt Damon and we went to the marketing department at focus features. And first of all, the guy scared the hell out of me because he was like, I know everything. I know what states you're popular in. I know what states hate you. You want to know that stuff?

Speaker 3:          07:23          And I was like, definitely not my, uh, my ego cannot handle that. But what I do want to know is what's the biggest misconception, uh, in your opinion of audiences? And he said the biggest misconception that the film industry has is that audiences are stupid. They're very, very smart. They want to be challenged and they want to go on a ride with you. They don't want to be told everything. Again, I took that and put it in here. So all the things you're talking about. I remember thinking, wow, I mean if, if we could get away with all these subtle hints that later you feel you earned because you're like, I did see that tiny thing in the first act and it pay it off at the end. That was great. I didn't want to confuse anybody, but my, my instinct was go with as little as possible where people feel excited rather than go with, okay guys, here's a eight minute preamble of what happened. This is a diagram of what everything looks like and where they came from and all that stuff. It was really fun to have you be as an audience member, as freaked out and nervous as to what's going on is the family is

Speaker 1:          08:20          right. Yeah. The film doesn't really deal with the backstory hardly at all. Um, I did have one bone to pick, which was comes the opening slate and just says like, day 89. Yup. It's like less than three months and everything in the world has gone to shit. Yup. Uh, they were quiet. Not a lot of credit to give to humankind. No less than three months. But

Speaker 3:          08:41          it's funny, but you actually nailed why I made it such a low day. It's like it happened quickly because, you know, for me, alien movies are always about what does the aliens, what do they want? What's the grand plan? And I thought, and I'm sure there, there has been, uh, alien movies that are just about predators or, or, or whatever. But my thing was, what if these aliens just landed and they don't want anything. They just want to go for it, you know? And so it's like releasing wolves in a daycare center. There's just no contest. You know what I mean? So it was sort of one of those things of like, Hey, let's get into a war room and like, decide what the, oh, everybody's gone. Yikes. You know? So that's sort of what I thought is what, that's, that's plausible too. You know, everyone's like, did he just say wolves in a, that, that'll be played back. Perfect. That's an interesting, uh, daycare center. A very able bodied 30 year old. Sorry, sorry, I did not mean the horrible version that you thought. Um,

Speaker 1:          09:33          it's, it's an interesting layer that I hadn't considered the sort of how much we flounder over choosing decisions and making decisions in a moment like that where I just didn't want the president scene of like, what do we do? Right, right. Because the president was just, you know, people are just taking a different times and so we talked about the parenting layer, but it also, I was curious if there's like a living in New York layer, obviously, you know, you're very well known actor, creative person in the city is, when did that thought ever cross your mind when you were making this up? Like having to navigate this city without the massive monsters?

Speaker 3:          10:08          1000% yeah. You're, you're tapping into my secret idea of how this would continue if it dig did continue. I think the idea of this whole world being explored is really interesting to me. Growing up in the east coast and growing up in Boston, I had to do it as rural northeast. And the reason is not just because I have a connection to it, but also because I wanted it to feel like anywhere, anytime America that if this did happen, that you could place yourself. If you're from Indiana, you can say like, oh that sort of like a farm I grew up in. It just places you in a, I dunno when that way that sort of nostalgic movies do really well close encounters. I mean if you pulled everybody here where that is, you know, actually everybody here would know because you're very smart. But most people wouldn't remember. They'd just say like, I dunno, it's a guy who went crazy in the middle of a mountainous area and I, and I liked that. It's South Dakota, isn't it? That you Googlers nailed it.

Speaker 1:          11:05          Even the, uh, the smallness of it as, as grandiose as the, the environment, as grandiose as the world is, the movie is very small. It really the amount of time we're talking about two days out of these people's lives and, and the area that's covered is a very small, um, did you find that keeping it small helped you connect with the core of the family involved?

Speaker 3:          11:25          Oh, a thousand percent. Yeah. I think that, you know, I'm, I'm one of those people that the more information you give me, the more my mind wanders, which makes me a very annoying person to watch a movie because if you even drop a hint at something, I'm like, hmm, what happened to that? And people are like, focus, there's a movie happening. I'm like, man, I don't know this, uh, this thing over here seems very untethered to the rest of the movie. Um, but, uh, but I think also this idea of family was so much scarier because again, you know, all the cliches are true when you have kids, but like your kids are the only kids who exist in the world. You know what I mean? It's why every parent's like, I think my kids really smart and you're like, I think every kid is really smart.

Speaker 3:          12:04          Um, but it does, it feels very intimate. It feels very much to you. And I loved the idea that this family just decided the priority number one was this unit that it wasn't everybody else. So yes, being on a farm, the idea of isolation that visually not being able to see other houses or see a highway or a way out was really important to me because they can't make it a hundred yards, let alone a hundred miles. I would want to, I almost went into a spoiler do it, but it's talk about the two kids. No, a troop and Millicent seven were great in the film. How was it to work with them? Obviously Noah has a huge reputation already. Reputation. He's got a reputation of, it's like the kid in the back cause like I do movies and Millicent up for a lot of young acting awards. How was it to work with the two of them?

Speaker 3:          12:53          I mean, here's the thing, they, you know, they, I've always heard don't work with kids because they slow everything down. They never get the, they never really understand what they're saying and they don't get their takes. Right. And they have kid hours, which aren't the same full hours that you have. And it just sounded like a nightmare. I had the exact opposite experience. So these kids are not only some of the best actors I've ever worked with, but some of the best people I've ever gotten to know. That's the truth. I mean, these kids are so unbelievably special and you can see it in the movie. And I remember Noah saying something really interesting. He said, you know, the lack of die, of course, he's more articulate than me cause he's 13. Um, but he said, uh, you know, the lack of dialogue didn't give me anywhere to hide the fact that I didn't have dialogue to hide behind.

Speaker 3:          13:33          So what do you mean by that? And he said, well, you know, when you're rehearsing your lines, you think of like timing and how you're going to deliver it. And I was like, obviously you're delivering it. Super Cool. Um, and he said, you know, when you don't have that, you actually have to live through it. You have to be sad, you have to be scared, you have to be happy. And I just said yes. Just to all of that, that you said sounds super smart. Um, and uh, and it's true. These kids were just so phenomenal. I probably ended up slowing them down, but how I found them was, you know, Noah had been on the night manager, which I saw and he was really great. And I know this sounds horrible, but when I, when I knew what I wanted for the movie, I was watching him in the night manager. I said, yeah, he's pretty good. And then there's a scene where, sorry to spoil it. Um, he gets kidnapped and I was like, let's see how good he is with kidnapping.

Speaker 3:          14:18          And that kid does kidnap real well. And I thought, well, he's in, he's terrified and it looks, I'm nervous to walk away and kidnapped him and made him. Yes, that's right. Not In the night manager, just kidnapping, hired a couple of goons. What am I talking about? Are we in 1942. Um, and then Millie was one of those things where we just literally caught onto a shooting star. I mean, she is, it was nonnegotiable for me to have a deaf actress in the movie, right? Um, not for any grandiose PC reason, but literally because obviously the, the performance would be much more textured, honest, because she's living through it every single day as, as a deaf person. But more than that, I needed, selfishly, I needed a guide. I need someone to walk me through this and I want, I love collaborating and I love ideas.

Speaker 3:          15:04          And so I wanted her to come on set and I wanted to know what it's like to be the only deaf person in a hearing family. What's it like? Do you get angry? Do you get empowered? What do you feel these things? And she was so unbelievably generous again, at the time, I think she was 13 when we were shooting. And Emily and I are convinced that she's not actually from Earth, that she's an angel. I mean, she's the nicest, greatest human being. And I know this sounds super poetic, but it's true. I've never had someone taking all of me when they looked at me as I was talking, she's looking at your hand gestures. She's looking at your eyes and your, your facial expressions. But more than that, she's legitimately feeling your essence. She's a wonderfully powerful person. I remember at south by southwest and my mom went up to congratulate her and the translator came over to help translate for my mom or for Millie.

Speaker 3:          15:49          And Millie said, no, no, no, no. I know exactly what this a woman is trying to say to me, which is, it was just so beautiful. So I mean, I'll start crying right now even thinking about it, but it was so nice to have her on set. And then to boot. She's one of the best actresses I've ever seen. I mean, even Emily, who I think is the best actors going was like, no, this girl is the real deal. She's so phenomenal. So anyway, long, I think that's the longest answer I've ever given. Um, were really fun to work with. Did you know AFL before going into the film? Did you have time? I remember, I think in like elementary school in junior high school, we learned some ASL. Um, but no, the answer is no. I was, I was aware of certain tiny bits and pieces.

Speaker 3:          16:28          We learned all the ASL for the scenes and then we learned a little bit to communicate more, you know, more, uh, casually and comfortable for Millie offset. But then all of a sudden the crew started learning ASL. Noah learned, I think he might be fluent in ASL. My biggest regret was not learning more because I was so busy doing so many different things that I wish I had learned more because I know it's, again, it sounds like I'm harping on this romantic version, but watching Millie talked to her mom, I was convinced that there's no more beautiful language in the world. I mean, truly there's great languages to speak, but watching someone paint their ideas through the air is unlike anything I've ever seen. And it plays off really powerfully. Yes. It works as a great boon for the family in the film. Exactly. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          17:10          It's sort of the leg up that they have. Yeah. Deeper level of communication. We'll talk about working with Emily in the, in the film she plays in. Your white is only um, yes, right. The diva. Um, no, uh, Emily, they just cut you out. John was all alone on that answer. Um, we've always wanted to work together. We, we've always talked about it. It's weird because we keep our careers completely separate. We never wanted the story of us being married to supersede whatever story we were telling on screen. So it was hard to imagine that we would be able to find it. Luckily this story is pretty out there, so we're safe. But on top of it, it had to be an organic thing. If I'm honest, when I was doing the rewrite of the script, I knew that I only wanted her. She was very busy.

Speaker 3:          18:00          Like I said, we had just had our second child and she was also doing a little indie movie called Mary Poppins. So, um, she was working a lot. Um, and, and to be honest, I think I was just scared. I think I was just playing scared to ask her. So the truth is I never even brought it up to her. Um, it, she knew what I was doing. I pitched her ideas. She started pitching other actresses that she thought would be great for the role. And the reason why I didn't ask her it was because I sought going one of two ways. One, I asked her and she says, no, which makes her a very awkward dinner. Um, or she says, yes, I'll do it for you. Which would honestly be worse. That would be a heartbreak to me because I've been witness to how intelligent, how classy, the, the unbelievable tastes level she has in her choices.

Speaker 3:          18:45          Um, I just couldn't stomach the idea of her doing anything as a favor to me. I had to let her career be her own. So she read the script when we were flying on a plane one day. She said, you know, do you mind if I read it? And I said, yeah, no problem. Truly not thinking that she would do it. And when she finished the script, she turned to me and she did look sick. Um, and I, I literally went for like a Barf bag and she said, you know, you can't let anyone else play this role. And I turned around, I said, what are you saying? And she's like, you can't let anyone else play it. And it was like she was proposing to me, are you saying what I think you're saying? And she was like, will you let me do the movie? And I was like, yes.

Speaker 3:          19:23          And I was like, hold on. Sorry. I should have played that so much cooler. Um, I dunno. Let's see how you are on tape. Um, what's set up an audition. So I screamed yes, on an airplane and then we were working together. So how, how was it working with her? I mean, the short answer is, um, I finally got to see why she's such a good actress. I remember the week before we started shooting, I went to find an editing bay that we would then edit the movie in. And they actually happened to be editing Mary Poppins at that editing bay. And so rob Marshall, who's a unbelievable human being in a wonderful director, said, when are you shooting? And I said, next week. And he said, Oh man, you're going to see, I said, I know I love her so much. And he said, no, no, no, no, you're going to see. I said, I know I'm her biggest fan. And he said, nope, not until you're in the room when she does what she does, will you know why she's such a good actress? And I thought, wow, what an incredible thing to say and also how dare you.

Speaker 3:          20:19          And um, the scene that's in that poster was like day three and he was absolutely right. I mean, she did one take of that scene. We have coverage of different shots, but the, the big momentous moment of the scene, um, she only did one take of, and genuinely the air changed in the room. I mean, something came through the room and I was totally stunned. I couldn't say anything. The crew couldn't say anything. And then at the end of the take, you literally hear me say, that's lunch question mark. Like, what do you do after that? And this is how good my wife is. She was like, yeah, by the way, what do they have for lunch? And I was like, what? You were just like possessed by the devil and now the devil is not in this movie. I'm sorry, that was a miss phrasing. That is a different movie. This is just creatures, just creatures. Let's expand a little bit more on that. While it's definitely production,

Speaker 1:          21:10          there's a, I recognized very early and one of my favorite parts of the production of the film is the way that you deal with the sound obviously sound is a huge part, but the way it's dealt with, uh, with Millie's character, uh, the way that it's mixed throughout the dynamic level. Yeah. How, how far did you find yourself wanting to push it? Uh, did you, do you think you've got there? Does it pay off for you as the director?

Speaker 3:          21:35          Yeah, I mean, it was really one of the most fascinating parts of this experience. I have always known the power of sound because I did this movie with, the first thing I ever did was I adapted a script called brief interviews with tedious men. That's David Foster Wallace's book that I was in love with. It's a very simple movie, basically a woman interviewing guys and I remember they said, now you have to do your sound mix. And I was like, cool, what does that, and um, we went and mixed it and I realized the power of even just dialogue scenes, what happens when you sound mix, there's a whole atmosphere and all these things. So I learned very quickly, little did I know how far you can go. I mean truly through the looking glass type stuff, you can really lose your mind in the sound design of this.

Speaker 3:          22:14          And I had the greatest people on board, Ethan and Eric, these guys are just so unbelievably talented. And they realized that this was such a huge opportunity because in the movies that we have nowadays, you're completely surrounded by a wall of sound, which can be a bit of an assault on the senses. And weirdly taking the sound out is just as assaulting. It's just as disconcerting. And it was really, really fun to start playing with that and then realizing, let's take a big swing and see what happens. And when you take certain big swings, it's like, Whoa, you really start pushing the boundaries of certainly what I've experienced in the movies before. And that's been my favorite compliment that audiences have been saying leaving is that this is an experience. It's not just the film. I mean you can't get that without sort of, you know, assaulting the senses and all, all ways. And so, yes, I think we, I love what we did theirs. There was always that happy medium of making sure it didn't feel like a sound experiment where people are like, I get it, man. You, you wanted to take us all the way and you want people to remember that it is a movie. It has to be entertaining. So just the idea of playing with these things and, and keeping it entertaining and fun and moving was really good.

Speaker 1:          23:15          Important to me. That's great. How much more of this type of uh, like all inclusive approach would you like to take going forward from here? Is it, is it a big challenge to direct yourself, uh, to get so involved in the production of a movie and then be able to represent the character as well? Yeah, it's so weird because when you look at the

Speaker 3:          23:37          titles on paper, it seems overwhelming. You immediately say, what the hell are you doing? Why would you do this on day one of shooting? And you're like, why would you executive produced help, right. Star and direct. It sounds insane, but, and I, and I mean this, it sounds super corny but it's true. I've never been all in on a project like this in my life. I mean this, yes, it's really exciting for me as a director and career wise it's something new and different and I'm really excited about it. But personally I was so emotional and so emotionally connected to this material because of the family and because of the kids and because of thinking of my own kids and things like that, and having my wife onset that. What you realize is those four titles ended up being my only weapons to protect the project in every facet.

Speaker 3:          24:20          So it became this unbelievable gift that yes, it's a ton of work, but I loved it. How much more would I do? I gotta be honest. I love doing it. I love sort of developing and producing and I'm sort of insane. So I love sort of being crazy with how much work is going on, but I don't necessarily need to do all of them all the time. You know, maybe you direct and don't star. Maybe you, you know, I'd also love to just act. You know what I mean? That that's also really fun for me. It's just, I think I just love exploring is what it is. That's the worst answer ever. Okay.

Speaker 1:          24:50          Have you ever, I was to follow that up. Have you found that the diversification has helped you to transition out of what was kind of a defining role for you as Jim and the office? Yeah, absolutely. But

Speaker 3:          25:02          the truth is, is it's funny, I always want to make it clear that I never wanted to diversify from Jim. I think at the end of my career I'll probably still be best known for that character. And that is awesome. I mean that's an honor. I mean, you can't get a better thing than that. That was so special. It was lightening in a bottle. And I remember till the very last day of shooting, it was lightening in a bottle. We knew like I remember people coming up who are on other TV shows being like, what seasons did you guys start hating each other? And I was like never. I mean truly we were a family till the very end. So that was something that I actually wanted to move and try other things because I knew I could never attain that again. So it was trying to do different things.

Speaker 3:          25:42          And then the, the, the truth is, and again, it sounds Corny, but I named my production company Sunday night because when I first got to New York, I was a waiter and a bartender and whatever else, weird job I could possibly find. And I remember someone saying, the one thing you don't get to do as a working actor, his act, you've got to do all these other things to pay the bills. So my friends and I would meet on Sunday night and we're all trying to do creative stuff. And you realize it was the only night that we could ever talk about plays, movies, books, music. And so we just nerded out on each other and talked about all these huge dreams. And if we got the chance, we do this. And you know, the, these, uh, these crazy Hollywood types don't know how to do it.

Speaker 3:          26:19          And, and it was so much fun. Those people inspired my life forever. So when I did get the opportunity, like I said at the beginning, when I did get the opportunity to be in the office and have this huge opportunity to have, what do you want to do going forward? I just thought of those guys and those conversations than I thought I can't do. I can't just sit back and wait for another comedy or another show to come along that's like that. I got to try to, you know, honor what we talked about at those tables and, and that's why I did it. That's why I started making different choices and trying new things because I thought these guys would 1000% do that if they were given the same chance. Excellent. Excellent. We do want to open it up for questions. If you guys want to make your way to microphone over here a while, they sort of get set and since we're on the topic of the office, Google here is a very big office really. And I was wondering in the time where you're an office, this looks like we're in Star Trek.

Speaker 4:          27:14          I feel like I'm, I'm

Speaker 3:          27:16          [inaudible] up in space right now. Right. I was wondering in the time since the show has ended, if you've come up with any great Jim pranks that you would maybe go back and inactive if you could know that we will take your question over here. I was never a prank. I, uh, growing up, so I was so lucky. The writers of the show were unbelievable. I mean, they've all gone on to create their own hugely successful show so you can genuinely see how talented they were. But coming up, I mean, it was my favorite thing to read those scripts and be like, well, is he? Yes. The like when you read the prank, I think my favorite one was the nickels and the receiver that was just so weird and amazing and it took way too much time and I loved all of it. I love that. My favorite might've been Asian jet. Yeah. Really good one. Randall's amazing. We'll take a question over.

Speaker 4:          28:08          Hello? Hello? Hey, I'm checking the mic. That was a good idea. Um, I'm a big office fan and I'm really glad that you decided to use fruit farms as a set on your movie because totally visualize that. Yeah. Mom in Dwight to come out of the beat, but as a director and a producer, like what sort of decisions go into choosing a set and choosing a location for the film? I know you'd talked about city versus rural, but even within rural, you know, what kind of decision making that you take?

Speaker 3:          28:42          Uh, a lot. It was really a, so I started shooting the show Jack Ryan and we were up in Montreal. And so every, well, to be honest, every day, but on the weekends especially, I was looking at, this is not a joke, I was looking on Zillow for like, uh, farms in upstate New York because I thought, well, if they're selling, then maybe they'd like crazy Hollywood to come in before they sell. It turns out most people do not want that.

Speaker 4:          29:08          MMM.

Speaker 3:          29:09          And uh, and I found this, this house was on an old Zillow listing and so I actually legitimately found the house and then called the studio. They send in someone to make sure that people wouldn't fall into a sinkhole or something when we were doing it. And, uh, and then I met the guys who were running it, these two incredible farming farmers, that family, and they are the nicest people ever. And I said, would you ever have a movie? So then I flew down and met them personally. I had to do it all by myself because I felt like if you're, if you're going to completely change their experience day to day, you to have the personal connection of letting them know that I'm here to do it, not, you know, some group of 300 people. So it was really fun to, to choose that.

Speaker 3:          29:48          So I had a lot to do with it unfortunately. And so does Zillow, I'm glad are also some crazy story about growing a bunch of corn. Yeah. So that farm, which you can't see, I just pointed to nothing. So that farm, uh, nowhere got it. Um, it was a pumpkin farm and it was something like 600 acres, but they only used a certain amount of acreage for Pumpkin's cause we were going to be shooting in September or October and they were the hottest Halloween, Jabari and town. And so when I told them that we needed corn, they were like, yeah, yeah, sure. So some corn and then we'll plan our pumpkins. And I was like, no, no, no, no guys, we're going to need corn. And so they planted, I mean something like 40 acres of corn or something. And just as far as the eye could see. And I will say the coolest thing is when if finally cropped up when we started shooting, the guys came and they looked at it and they were like, this is awesome. And I said, yeah, you're going to go back to corn. They were like, God, no pumpkin. So I was like, oh, okay. Great. Perfect. That's the question from the side. Hello. Hello.

Speaker 5:          30:51          A question about how you evaluate like your career and your best work. You've mentioned how important your family is. Obviously in the industry, there's people you idolize, that you've gotten to meet. How'd you like evaluate? Oh, that was, that was good work. Or like the, the highlight. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          31:04          that's a really good question. Um, if I'm really honest, it's very difficult for me because I don't know, just the way I grew up, it was, I was never the, I don't know, it was just, I feel like it's something about Boston. Boston was never one of those places that you're like, I'm amazing. And people are like, that's so great for you. Usually you're like, I'm amazing. And they're like, get them the one in the back, take them out. Um, it was, it's just a, it was a cool place to grow up because you, you got to focus on what you loved rather than what you loved about yourself. And so, um, it's really hard for me to be like, it's amazing. I think that in a terrible baseball analogy, here it comes. Um, it's that idea of like when you hit the fat of the bat, you know, when the ball connected in a way you don't know what's going to happen to that ball.

Speaker 3:          31:50          But you know, you felt really good about what happened, told you it was a terrible, there's a part of the bat that's fatter. It doesn't matter. I blew it. Basically. I can tell, I can tell when I'm happy with what what I did. And um, I know when we were shooting this that something felt very special for me. And to be honest, the most overwhelming thing about the very kind response that this movie's gotten is goes back to instinctual high school days of like, you have something that you think is cool and you really hope that other people think it's cool too. And when other people go, yeah, that's cool. You're like, oh my God. I mean it's genuinely moving. I mean, when we were at south by southwest the night before, we premiered down there and my wife said, you know what's, what's the one thing you want to take away from this? Just so you're not stressed about the whole thing. And I was like too late. Um, and I said, you know, if, if people cheered at the end, that would be really cool cause it's a kind of a fun experience. And uh, when people jumped out of their chairs and screamed at the top of their lungs, I think I blacked out and only woke up yesterday like I was, I am so genuinely moved and overwhelmed by that response. So I can say I'm happy by the response, but I'm not like, I'm awesome. I'm pretty awesome.

Speaker 6:          33:02          If that was terrible, people are like an record that. Thanks. Um, so one thing, I've only seen the trailer so far and I can't wait. See the movie. Maybe it will be addressed, but you had 89 days to take the batteries out of that space shuttle. What was going on there? All right man. Turn off the cameras. Turn on

Speaker 3:          33:23          the cameras. Um, uh, what you'll see in the movie is, um, when you are putting a situation and they're coming, these creatures are coming. This is just a parable guys. Um, no, the, it's everything is very specific to survival. So, uh, you'll see in the movie that that space shuttle is not something that is theirs. They do not own that. So the, they, there was no way for them to know that batteries were in the space shuttle because they didn't know it existed. And I'm not going to spoil it, but it had, I known the batteries were in it, I probably would've done something about it.

Speaker 6:          33:57          Okay.

Speaker 3:          33:58          We only have time for a couple more, so we'll if we can wrap and fire maybe two on this side, two on this side and you can at the same time. No,

Speaker 6:          34:06          Dwight. Uh, go ahead. Hi. First of all, thank you for coming. Oh my God, this is so exciting. Thanks. Um, I have, uh, basically pop of the paper, a basic question, but did you have any like favorite scene from the office that you like to Rewatch or anything?

Speaker 3:          34:23          Um, I rewatch everything all the time. No. Going back to the other question, I don't, I, I think one of my favorite scenes there are two that I always remember. I don't watch them over and over cause I just play it in my head. Two things really specific moment was when Steve had us over to his apartment and he took the TV and he said, and then when guests, guests come over, you can just do that. I think that's the hardest I've ever laughed in my life. And then the other one is when he dressed up as Santa and had, uh, Kevin sit on his lap. I mean if you watch the outtakes, I would very clearly it was unprofessional person because I couldn't get through that scene. So those are the two that I play back in my head and laugh.

Speaker 6:          35:07          Thank you. Cook one. Hold on a sec. Oh Hey John. Hey Horan good. Um, I didn't know that this movie was about protecting your children and that's really cool cause I'm having my first son when my first child in August. Congratulations. Thank you. That's awesome. So now I want to see it and I'm going to be my way. Um,

Speaker 3:          35:23          tell her it is way easier to give birth and this I promise.

Speaker 6:          35:25          All right. She won't believe you, but, um, I really want to know, I'm getting advice from like everybody and their mother and her landscaper for parenting, but yeah. Cool. They get parenting advice from you.

Speaker 3:          35:36          Oh, that's really, um,

Speaker 2:          35:38          and protecting from aliens and, yeah. Yeah. So when aliens come, you're gonna want to clear out all the noisy toys. Take those away. Anything plushes safe? Um, no, it's funny. I, my number one bit of parenting advice has been listened to no one because it's always a unique experience, but to me that, to walk away, um, no, I, I got so many different pieces of advice that I, I still to this day use one of which is, uh, communicate with your kids. Don't just talk to them and tell them what's happening. You actually have to walk them through it because they see things in extremes. So, you know, instead of saying, you know, don't hit your sister and we're going to put you in a timeout or something. It's like, Hey, so I've asked you three times not to hit your sister in the face, and now we're going to go over here and you have to step away from the game. And they actually process really, really well. And I think that that's a big misconception certainly of mine, was that they can't process, there's so much smarter than you are, and I know you work at Google, but trust me, this kid isn't even out yet, and he's smarter than you.

Speaker 2:          36:44          Yeah, you got it. That seems like a pretty great place to wrap up on the front. You've got, yeah. I want to thank you for, thank you very much. [inaudible].
