Speaker 1:          00:06          Wow. So good to be here.

Speaker 1:          00:11          I, uh, I grew up in Palo alto long before Google existed. And then, uh, I, uh, in Ed Palo Alto High, I was in class, it was the same year as a lease and Brendan Jobs, Steve Jobs, his daughter and we were on the newspaper together, the camping Neely and my teacher, uh, Esther would jet ski. We called her watch, then became the mother-in-law of Sergei Brin. So like my teacher is like the mother-in-law volatile. Yeah. Or the ex mother x a mother. But I hear from the New York Times article that they're, they're all good, that they, they go to the met ball together. It's still and all that. So well, welcome James Franco to Google.

Speaker 2:          01:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Move off a toxic Google and we'll get right into it. So thanks for being here. Uh, so your new film, the disaster artist, which is based on, uh, tell me why Zos uh, weird film the room. Yes. It's the making. Yes. The room is a cultural, we'll just classic cult hit. It's really weird. When, when did you first see the room? I was really late to the room. Um, it's been out for a 14 and a half years now. Uh, he, the story is, he made it, came out in 2003, uh, he intended it to be this great drama. Um, uh, he wrote on the poster Tennessee Williams level drama, uh, which kind of shows what he's aiming for. Uh, it cost $6 million of his own money. Where he got is a, is a big mystery and uh, it's so weird. Oh, marina. Yeah, my phone.

Speaker 1:          02:06          We are, Lorena and I were jogging this morning just when we arrived here. We didn't go, we just like went one direction, uh, just aimless, sort of started at the, at the Ritz and jog all the way down to um, beat street. And he would always, Tommy would always say, well, I made my $6 million from a selling Levi's jeans. And he actually got into the screen actors guild, um, by financing his own commercial for his denim jeans outlet called street fashions. And I know it cause we read, we recreated and the disaster is, but we ended up not using it, but he, um, you can find it online. Uh, just Google it. Uh, he uh, is wearing like a renaissance hat and he's quoting amylase is too big or not to be, that is the question. Come to street fashions can get Levi's jeans, five, five, five beat street and Lorena and I jogged and all of us, we just went into straight line. All of a sudden I look up and there's this, this is just like three hours ago I look up and there's this poster of him in the room. I'm like, oh look what a great sign. And then I realized, oh my gosh, it was like five, five, five beach street. But we couldn't find the thing all we could find his, his poster and this big Levi's jeans thing. Anyway, he, yeah, he so I'm sorry you asked me to a whole other question.

Speaker 1:          03:34          It's freshman, you got to find out. I just ramble. It's cost $6 million. It made $1,800. Its first run. People from the premiere on, we're laughing at it. Um, and unlike other, you know, directors that have these movies that have become colt hit because they're so bad or because people like to laugh at them, like troll to, um, Tommy had the wherewithal to kind of capitalize on that and rewrite history. So where he was completely oblivious to how he was coming off to other people. As soon as people started laughing at the movie, he just became a maestro. Like is as much as he lacked self awareness before. He then was like a car dashing with like the way he can capitalize on publicity. And, um, and he put it in one theater in La, uh, the sense of five and to plate it midnights and it just sorta caught on with USC film students and then built it, built from there.

Speaker 1:          04:41          He paid another bit of Tommy and sanity's he paid for, or maybe genius he'd paid for this billboard on Highland. Um, what was his face? And it was that same image was like, what the lazy eyelid and it said the room. And then there was a phone number. And, uh, I must have drove, you know, he kept it up for five years. That's hundreds of dollars, thousands of dollars right there, you know, and, uh, I must've driven past that hundreds of times and just thought it's a colt or, you know, I, I ran into a friend the other day, he's like, oh yeah, that thing. I thought it was a wanted poster or something. And, uh, so that's all I knew of the room for years and years. And then four years ago, the book came out that was written by, um, one of the other actors, Greg says, Terah who my brother plays in the movie and this really great journalists, Tom Bissell.

Speaker 1:          05:35          And I was just blown away. It was just, you know, it was, um, I love Hollywood stories and this was unlike any other, and I'm just, cause it was so bizarre row on the surface, but at the same time it was, you know, it was the story of anyone, you know, uh, with a dream, you know, the story of, I'm sure the, the, you know, surrogates story. I mean the passion behind it, I'm sure you know, they, they were, you know, at one point there are people who were like, why Google? What is that thing? You know what I mean? Like, and here he was like anyone with a dream and uh, he made it out. I'll be it like very ironically, but it still had sort of the underpinnings of a kind of Hollywood success story. It was interesting watching the movie and then coming out of it and thinking about it.

Speaker 1:          06:24          It's like he came into it thinking this is going to be the best movie ever made, but it was the worst movie. Yeah. Which made it the best movie. And then you're making a movie. It's a phenomenal film about a terrible film. That's a really good film. Like it's very confusing how it kind of all come and together I'm like, it kind of blows your mind. Sets would say James Franco and I'm the only one that like came to the room through the book. That's awesome. Very James Franco. But uh, yes, it, it was bizarre. We w we were talking about it over the past month. We couldn't come up with a of another example of a movie where the director of the movie was acting in it, playing a director who's acting in his own movie and then sort of stayed in character while he was directing. That was my next question.

Speaker 1:          07:15          So you did stay in character while you're directing. Yes, but like there's this great documentary out now I'm on Netflix called a Jiminny Indiana. It's Andy Kaufman or it's Jim Carrey when he's playing Andy Kaufman. And, um, it's an interview, you know, recently was from recently with, with Jim, but it's also footage from 20 years ago when he was doing the movie and he goes so far in the Andy Kaufman and his alter ego, a Tony Clifton that Jim disappears and like Milos foreman, you know, one of the greatest directors ever who did cookies nest. Nama Daz is like cow, you know, by like there's Tony Clifton character, he's like, you know, really gruff kind of lounge singer type and, and, and it's like, you can't talk to Jim. Like you see people like, Hey Jim, that was great today. And he's like, no, no, no. I'm Andy, I'm Andy. You know Andy going so far that like, you know, uh, uh, ambulance was called and, and you know, just like it's all this stuff going on behind the scenes that doesn't even make it into a man on the moon.

Speaker 1:          08:24          It says if he was like doing all this stuff for this documentary 20 years later, like I didn't do that. You know what I mean? I didn't go, I directed is James is just filtered through the, you know, funny voice and all across sites. But like Tommy's direction was absurd. Like we read it, you know, you know, Greg would tell us like when he was auditioning people, he'd be like, okay, uh, your sister lesbian and she just die, go Yay or no. Or that's literally what he said. So like I wasn't doing that. You know what I mean? I didn't go that far. It was just sort of the voice. Can you describe your first meeting with Tommy? Like, cause he's very good traction. They'll be the first meeting with time. It, what was that like? Or when did you first meet him? So you got this, you saw the book, right?

Speaker 1:          09:18          You read the book if you're interested in the room. So then you w what's the Tom? And, um, I, uh, here's the deal. I've played, you know, I think about eight or nine characters that are based on real people. They all have their own requirements. You know, um, uh, I played James Dean, who was a, you know, one of Tommy's heroes. Um, I, I played Aron Ralston who in one 27 hours he got trapped by the Rock and cut his arm off. And those have different requirements. James Dean, you know, because he was a, you know, an actor, people can go to see his movies and see what he looked like and moved, how he moved and how he sounded the same with Tommy. Right? So, but with Aron Ralston, that's not the case. Nobody, you know, yeah. You can go online and look them up, but his care, the, the priority with that character was capturing, you know, with Aron Ralston is capturing like, you know, then tick experience to take the audience on a ride of, you know, really going through that.

Speaker 1:          10:23          Um, with James Dean and Tommy, you know, half of the, you know, preparation is getting down, like all the, the physical behavior and all that. And then, and then trying to sort of, uh, dig up what he was, what's going on underneath. Now Tommy is a particular kind of mystery where he holds on to this facade. It's a very thinly veiled facade where he, you know, he say he, he saw like this and you know, he say from New Orleans and like nobody believes him. I, last night I was on Jimmy Kimmel with Tommy, which was, you know, the university has just exploded right there. Like, you know, the fact that he was on there, but he strangely for the first time, maybe in his entire life emitted and he just tried to like slip it in. I was, my brain was exploding and he was like, you know, Jimmy was like, where are you from Tommy?

Speaker 1:          11:17          He's like, well, you know, I come from Europe and then I go to New Orleans. I was like, wait, what? You're admitting it and, and you never heard that before. That he never would say that, you know, I'm, you know, he had written reviews, you know, not only did he say, you know, when the movie came out, like a Tennessee Williams level drama, he, he wrote these fake reviews like from like nine oh two went, oh Beverly hills film review or whatever. Like Tommy was, oh, the, the raging Cajun delivers powerful, like thriller is. Uh, and, uh, so no, he had never said anything like that before. Anyway, I had to, I had to kind of get underneath and figure out some of, you know, what, maybe I could, I could understand, okay, he's from eastern Europe and you know, I can, you know, get some of that stuff.

Speaker 1:          12:11          I didn't need that from Tommy, but I couldn't go to Tommy now and ask him, you know, what was motivating you when you're making the room? Because he is the master rewriter of history. And now he claims that he intended the room to be a comedy. So, you know, when, in fact she was not true, incredibly sincere when he made it. Right. So, you know, he says about the room now, um, the room is safe place. You can laugh, you can cry, do whatever you like, just don't hurt yourself, you know. Um, so in that way he can still, he can like take credit for being a comedy but also that he's still greatest director or you know, around. Um, so I couldn't go to him as a source, but what I had was, um, he would, he would drive around in his car and I know he was in his car cause I have the recordings, I going to hear him like doing the turn signal and everything like, and he would talk to himself.

Speaker 1:          13:10          This is the nineties, so it was like a mini tape recorder who's talked to himself about all this feelings about, you know, acting classes and being mistreated by acting teacher. And then, and it was amazing. It was like the Guy's journal audio book version, you know what I mean? And like I could see how he would pump himself up for the room. Like there was like one nugget in particular. Like you'd be like, wow, this ochin teach or he'd done, Ha, he took treat me like different than all the other students and whatever he want me to do, he told me to seen in French. Why he, why he say that? Like, and then one time he says, he says on there and Tommy knows I have to take tapes, he calls him the secret tapes. James, I know y'all have secret taste and uh, yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:01          And I say to myself, PR. And he called himself Pierre and then on the tape as if somebody else was going to listen to them someday. This is like 20 years ago, five years before we made the room. So I say to myself, Pr and then he goes, yeah, we'll have her. Sometimes I call myself pro because teacher truly different. But you know, ah, I think he just sends my power and he intimidated as we do that. Whenever I show him, maybe I'll do my own movie or maybe I start a rock band and I become, you know, I make rock album or something. Yeah, exactly. And you can tell from the dry, you know, the way he dresses, like pirate vampire, you know, um, Alice Cooper roadie or something. But, um, but they're right there. It was like, that is the story of the room in a nutshell where it was like people say, telling him he's not going to make it.

Speaker 1:          15:01          People telling him, you know, he's no good. And then turning around, pumping himself up and saying, I will show them and he sorta did like capitalize on it. But what's so bizarre is, I mean, I shouldn't talk about him cause he's, there are a lot of weird people that came out of the room. Um, but other people have come. And like when the room became a cult hit for being so bad, other people came out of the woodwork and tried to take credit for it. And like, no, I'm the director of the room. No, I've [inaudible] it's like, this isn't the Godfather. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, exactly. So when you are, so you have these tapes, you have the book, you have access, obviously him and Greg, when you're talking to them and you're, you're starting to develop the film and you're starting to write it and produce it and come up with how much of it isn't like embellishment and how much of it was like when you were trying to craft a story, you obviously have to make it into a horror film.

Speaker 1:          16:01          We, um, we, we always knew from the beginning, I didn't tell him meaning Tommy, but that's, that's how you, that story in a second. But basically I didn't go to him until later. I'll get to your question, but he did have a scene in the film and you, if you wait till the end of the credits, it's in there. That was in his contract. That was like the Beer Bartol I'll tell you. It was bad. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Um, but the book had this amazing tone where, um, what could have been a series of just anecdotes about how ridiculous to making of that movie was turned out to be a very moving story about dreamers. As I was saying. And so that was always our approach. And so we, um, we didn't hire a Kummete comedy writers. We hired, um, Scott and you said it, and Mike Weber, who had done 500 days of summer and, um, the fault in our stars and just basically we're so good at capturing relationships and also adapting books.

Speaker 1:          17:01          They were really good at that. And, um, we were lucky to get them like fault of our stars had just like beat the Tom Cruise movie at the box office that weekend and they were like hot as hell. And uh, but they really liked the stories we, so that's sort of where it started. And that was our, that was always our approach. And we always, always, you know, from all of the script readings and rewrites and everything, we always hammered home like, this needs to be, you know, we need to create sympathetic characters. This needs to be about the relationship. This needs to be a universal story. Even though Tommy is unlike any other human that's ever existed, you know. Well, you guys, you guys bounced. So other people who saw the film, you'll see like, and I think there's a, there's Mel Brooks had said something when he was making young Frankenstein.

Speaker 1:          17:49          It was, I just washed out on the plane here. So phenomenal. I love her. That's one of my favorite films and I love Mel Brooks. And one of the things he'd said, he goes, if you're going to pair it something, are you going to make something kind of a behind the scenes, right? You really have to, this is a direct quote, but this is kind of the essence of why you were saying was you really have to be passionate about the subject and you have to be pet. You want to make fun of it. You just want to really keep, find the story. And because he didn't make fun of young frankly, he didn't make fun of Frankenstein story. He was pretty good, but he really, really cared about it. Right. And he was able to make and find the heart there and stuff and it gets kind of what you did in a way. I mean, yeah, we can talk to young Frankenstein. Gene Wilder is so amazing. I think. I think what I think also gene is a huge part of that because he's got this weird uncanniness about him where just want to laugh, but he's also taking it so seriously. Even so he's a little scary too. And that, that kind of thing. And um, yeah, with Tommy, like we didn't embellish, you know, we um,

Speaker 1:          18:53          we even considered like pudding footage of the real Tommy at the beginning of the film because anybody that hadn't seen the room might see me come on screen and be like, yeah, Franco, wow. Big swing there bro. Like a little over the top and tell me how you open the phone cause are you open for them with that? That was a really, really smart for people who have, we've been talking heads. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Um, like Jj Abrams and a whole bunch of, yeah. Keegan Michael Key and down the break bride and got a lot of their experience with real actors talking about, um, their experience of walk watching the room. And, um, that was, uh, yeah, it was a way to sort of say, hey, this is real, real people like us. And like, yeah, it's funny having Jj Abrams in there. It was like the, cause there's a lot of comedians that actually are huge fans of the room.

Speaker 1:          19:48          But then having Jj, everyone's in there. We always know like when he gets that moment, like if the audiences with us, cause they're like, oh my God, Jj Abrams is talking about this thing. You know. Um, and it's, it's amazing the people that love like Lin Manuel Miranda started emailing me like, oh bro, I can't wait for your movie that I love the room. Like we were getting, have him at the beginning, but he was shooting Mary Poppins or something. Alignments. London. You as a director, what did you learn from previous directing experiences and from this that you'll, that you learned, that you took to this film that you learned on this film that you'll take to your next film?

Speaker 1:          20:27          Right. Good. Good. Sorry. Got It. I got it. What I did, and I did learn a lot on this film. Um, this has been these past two years working on this and on that, the HBO show, the Deuce have been incredible learning experiences for me. And I'll say it's a very simple thing and can be applied to, um, I think any, any profession and um, especially creative professions. But I basically had producers on both of those films that were, um, better than I was or smarter than I, I was very, you know, more experience in a certain kind of filmmaking or television producing than I was. And you know, and David Simon, I had, I guess you could say a certifiable genus. He's a MacArthur award winner. And, uh, um, and you know, having his writing but also guidance and, and, and his team and everybody on that, you know, just made me incredibly responsible.

Speaker 1:          21:29          I did have to have, I think, you know, I, I've directed a lot and I, and a lot of indie little weird things and some more successful than others, but I think that was my, in a way, apprenticeship. I don't think I would've been able to direct for Hbo if I didn't kind of put that grind in. But then melding that experience with, you know, a very smart and talented producer, um, on both films really helped. And that was the, that was basically the big, big lesson for me, like work with people that are better than I am. Um, yeah. And uh, I don't continue to do that. And um, and I, and I, and I try to, I try to do that kind of pay it forward thing too. I mean, it was one of the reasons I, you know, talk, you know, it was to sort of give opportunities back to that idea.

Speaker 3:          22:19          Yep. Great.

Speaker 4:          22:23          Wanda, where the art is defined by the artist or the audience. Yeah. I'd love to know your thoughts as an artist if, for example, your movie or anything that you created, what to be interpreted differently by the audience.

Speaker 1:          22:38          Yeah. If something I write, write was interpreted differently than I intended. Yeah, exactly. I mean that was the, there were two main aspects of this bizarre story or history of the room that really interested us. A what I talked about where it was a strangely in spur inspirational story of dreamers following their dream. But the second half is sort of what you're talking about where the room was, is not good by any conventional standards. You know, the acting is not good. The writings, it's like as if a alien from another planet came down and tried to depict human life. It's like there, but like everything's all off, you know. And on the other hand, it's still playing 14 and a half years later to sold out audiences. Um, and almost every major city. I mean, I was just in London, like people love it in London. They plays in Paris and Tokyo and it's like, so there's undeniably something that people are getting from this movie. They keep going back to it. And it's not just, I don't, I believe that it's not just the bizarre, you know, creative decisions at every turn. That there's something underneath it. And I think it's partly, you know, Tommy's passion. I think that, you know, the, the magic sauce is that Tommy put his heart and soul into it. Um, now whether it's that

Speaker 1:          24:09          it makes us feel a little superior that, you know, you know, somebody tried so hard and fell on his face and sort of that, you know, concept of comedy of like, why do we laugh it somebody that slips on a banana peel. Well, because it's not us. On the other hand, when I go to the room screenings and especially when Tommy's there, it's not a cruel atmosphere, you know, it's a communal atmosphere and Tommy sort of a part of that. He's the weird with Jewish in that kind of gives permission for the laughter by putting on this very affable arrogance, you know, so that we can kind of laugh. I don't know whether he's aware of what he's doing or not, but I think that's one of the keys to it. And, um, anyway, you,

Speaker 1:          24:59          I think it does, you know, the room does sort of, um, challenge conventional criteria of success and artistic success and that, that in a way, Tommy is a outsider artist, I guess. And, um, and I've watched the room as much or more than any other movie, you know, uh, in, in my life. And, uh, so there's value there. There's, you know, there's something there. And, um, and if art is, you know, a way to reflect on ourselves and show us ourselves and all that, I think, I think the room really does do that. I'll be at in a upside down cracked mirror. That's why, you know, like a fun house mirror. But, um, but it still does that. Yeah. Thank you. And we can only do two more. Sorry guys. So what was it like acting in a movie with your brother? And do you have any favorite moments from this movie?

Speaker 1:          25:56          My brother is, uh, the best. Dave Franco. Um, he's seven years younger than I am. We grew up in, on together. I went out to Hollywood to, to be an actor first and then he came out and um, when he got there, we lived together for a while. He went to USC and then, um, he's like three credits short of graduating. Uh, um, and, uh, he lived with me and, uh, then seduce my two cats and stolen away. Uh, uh, anyway, he for a while, um, for about seven years needed, wanted to get out from my shadow. And I guess a lot of people asked him like, you know, what's it like being James Franco's brawler and you know, that's what he'd constantly here. And so he wouldn't act with me a lot. Um, we did some funny or die videos, in fact in that apartment that we lived in together, um, where I played a ridiculous acting coach and he played my student.

Speaker 1:          26:54          And that was actually when I read the book. That was kind of the seed for the relationship in the disaster artist. And I knew just from, from making those videos that we have the right dynamic in addition to having our, you know, brotherly connection that would be right for the Greg and Tommy. We also had done this, those videos, and I thought that that's basically Tommy and Greg in a way. Um, anyway, I've asked him to do other movies and he said no, partly sometimes because he, you know, again, didn't want to, you know, be considered James Franco's little brother, but other times I guess, cause my movies were too bizarre. And, uh, so finally, uh, I had the, I read that book and I was like, this is the one, he cannot say no to this. Sorry. And, um, and he was smart enough to say yes and, and it was great.

Speaker 1:          27:50          I mean it was incredible. I on the other hand, he and I have, we have not had a fight in, um, probably 20 years. Um, so we get along really well and he's younger than I am, but I, but he's, he's pretty wise and um, I defer to him a lot. So it works out. We should say a quick follow up to that. You could recreate it like 26 minutes, right? Yes. We recreated scenes in our movie and that kind of will connect to the Tommy scene. Um, cause we have it premiere scene in our film and we needed footage to go up on the screen while our characters are watching. Right. And so we always knew we had to recreate some scenes from the room. We threw ourselves into that. That was one of the most fun parts of it. Um, and, uh, we like, you know, everybody, all the departments heads threw themselves into it.

Speaker 1:          28:47          The cinematographer Brandon Trust, like, you know, spent more time like recreating the bad lighting than he did doing his good lighting. And, you know, the costume designer Brendan Aben, like found all the perfect materials for the costumes and, uh, Chris Spelman, production designer, you know, studied the room and the behind the scenes of the room and got their sets exactly. And all that. And then the actors would watch it, like shot by shot, uh, and like mimic every movement and, and Seth Rogan and I actually had practice, um, unintentionally. You know, we, um, we had done a recreation of Kanye west bound to video like yours before. And, and we realized on that, oh, you know, we just thought like, oh, we'll just do like a minute of it. And then we're like, oh wait, we can do this whole thing. Like it's just a motorcycle and a green screen. We can do this whole. And then started really getting into it. So we kind of had practice and so it was sort of our dessert. Like we would, we would shoot our regular scenes in the main part of the day. And then we got done early. It was like, oh, we can do more of the room. Recreation's like, oh, which ones do we want to do now all you're tearing me apart, Lisa, or whatever. And so, um,

Speaker 2:          30:03          yeah,

Speaker 1:          30:04          so we did a ton of them and, and, and then we read, we were so proud of how close we, we got it. We're like, oh, we should do a side by side at the, in the credit. That's phenomenal. That wasn't in the original plan. And so we had it, um, negotiated for Tommy's room footage, the actual room footage. And so we had shot the scene with Tommy, you know, because it was in his contract. He kept insisting that it be opposite me and I kept, I tried to explain Tommy, it's not going to make sense. You know, I'm playing you. What I couldn't say to him was like, Tommy, I know you can't play anything other than yourself. Like he might be drawn on. Um, he sent me this photograph before, three days before he shot and he was like, glasses. He was in Lens crafters.

Speaker 1:          30:54          I saw the glasses behind. He's like, why? Why do you think of glasses for, you know, character? I'm like, they're great man. They're nobody will know it's you. And then he, and then he, uh, had drawn on a mustache in big pan. Right? And so what you, if you like mustache, I grow it on, I draw it on battery. When we shoot, I'm like, I'll give you a fake mustache. So he showed up, we did that scene and then we're like, all right, get that out of there. But then when we were negotiating for the room footage, he's like, well how am I seeing? And somebody told him it's not in there. And he's like, well you won't fudge. Then you'd have to pull my scene in the movie. And we're like, no. And then, and then we were like, oh, it will be perfect at the end of the credits. Yeah. Cause it won't be part of the main thing. It will be this weird David Lynch thing. And he still says to me like we, you know, he saw for the first time at south by southwest and then Toronto in it. Every time it'd be like, y'all, I say my scene, she'll be a little earlier.

Speaker 1:          32:01          Like it's good as good. Leaving the perfect real quick. I'm sorry,

Speaker 5:          32:06          that was in 2013 you wrote this really great book review of it. Does that, yes, yes, yes. Uh, it, it, you described Tommy is being sort of part dreamer part Edward and Park West van Pyre. Um, but you also talked about how you resonated with his story of like struggling to have this creative vision and make it, you know, come through to fruition. Can you talk a little bit more about similarities between you and Tommy's journey?

Speaker 2:          32:36          Okay,

Speaker 1:          32:37          totally. And at the end of the article I, Tommy Wise Oh, same wall. And um, what, um, in the article I said, and I wrote it before I even had the rights to the book, I just loved the book so much and I said, I totally respect Tommy because you know how many thousands or millions of people have come to Hollywood to make it in and they don't. And it's a really hard business, you know? Um, and Tommy God, his movie made against all the odds and I, and I respect him so much for that. On the other hand, he went to work in what I consider a collaborative medium and he did not know how to collaborate. Now look, I totally understand it. Like that guy was told no his whole life. I mean, not even like probably even before the movie business. Like, I'm sure these just, you know, just rejected his whole life.

Speaker 1:          33:33          And so, I mean, especially if he looks like a pirate mixed with a vampire and he says, well, I'm, I'm the nuts of James Dean. Like, you know, most people are going to be like, uh, no you ain't. And uh, and, and so he just learned through the experience of rejection that the only person he could ever depend on with himself and maybe his friend Greg. And so when he got on set, he didn't know how to shut that off. That's self will. And um, and so he did make a disaster of a movie or it didn't make the movie that he intended. On the other hand, you know, as we know, then the little second, you know, chapter of his saga is that it became this ironic success. And so in fact, he could never, he like never hit a wall. Like he's just in some weird trajectory into Tommy.

Speaker 1:          34:27          He talks about Tommy's planet, like he is on Tommy's planet because he never hit a wall. He now, you know, a normal artist would make something. And if he made all the wrong decisions at like wouldn't be what he intended. And then he'd like be like, Oh man, I didn't make what I wanted. I guess I should do it differently next time. Tommy never got that because it became this weird success. Anyway. I always, you know, when I wrote the review I thought, okay, I can relate to Tommy's drive and you know, wanting to get something done. But I like to consider myself a, a collaborative person than I am, you know, I was even up until these past couple of years to a certain extent, but in other ways I too was very self willed and blind to how I was proceeding. And it's funny, like there are a lot I can go, I can Google, you know, a lot my, my name if I want to do, I, I had to, I had to stop googling my name years ago, about five years ago.

Speaker 1:          35:27          Uh, that's a thing by the way. Uh, yeah, don't Google it. You're addicted to Google and yourself. I, I, I've been off at about five years now. And, um, um, but I could go do it and get a lot of headlines like, what's James Franco doing now? What's he doing now? And like, I should have heard, you know, some sort of message a while ago. I did hear it finally and, and it was like, all right dude, just slow down, you know, listened to the people around you that are, that are smart and know how to do this thing, you know, in a different way. And, um, and so I guess what I learned later when I said Tommy wise though, same why he was same, won a lot more ways than I, than I had liked to look at or admit. Great. Thank you. Uh, so we need to wrap up, but uh, in 10 seconds, what would Tommy, how time explained Google. Okay. Yeah. Google, you know what he's saying? He say, I'm in the room. He's like, you know, the, um, the computer business, it's very competitive. If you didn't know or something like that. Yeah. If you didn't know, he would break in and buy, you know, computer business. Very Competitive League. At least some might say it. But anyway, he wrote it. Gotcha. Just a disaster artist is a December 1st limitedly and December 8th, uh, widely. So thank you so much for being here.
