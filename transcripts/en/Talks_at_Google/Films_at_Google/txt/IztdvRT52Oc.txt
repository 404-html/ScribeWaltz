Speaker 1:          00:09          Truth is like,

Speaker 2:          00:12          hey guys, good morning.

Speaker 3:          00:18          How is everybody?

Speaker 4:          00:20          I'm assuming all the giddiness is for me, right? Because that's, Huh.

Speaker 3:          00:24          Very, very excited to have you two here. So many of us have either read the book or saw the film. We had a screening last night, but for those of us in the audience, or maybe who will be watching the recording later and who haven't seen the film with book, Do you want guys want to give us a brief synopsis of the film?

Speaker 4:          00:42          Sure. Why not? Uh, it's, um, uh, it's about a Asian American professor, a complaint by Constance Woo. Uh, and, uh, she's teaching at Nyu and she is dating this guy, uh, Nick Young, uh, who and who gets invited to, uh, his best friend's wedding and Singapore and he invites her along. What she doesn't know is that he's the richest from the richest family in Singapore. So all his ex's socialites, family members are out to destroy this American girl. So, uh, it's, it's a fun, fun romp, but has some, uh, I think some, a deeper cultural messages within at all.

Speaker 3:          01:19          Yeah. And so let's take anti a little bit. Um, so this film is an all Asian cast and, um, you know, here at Google week we've talked about is this is the first Hollywood film with an all Asian cast in 25 years. The last one being the joy luck club in 1993. So, um, what are your thoughts about the significance of this film coming out? You know, in 2018

Speaker 2:          01:41          I think it's beyond the right time. It's, it's too late, if anything. Um, John's been a bastion for, for Asians all around the world and I think now is, is, is a, is the correct time for this. And um, you know, when we were creating and, and, and sort of putting together the film, he literally scoured the earth for the correct actors for each role. And those actors were, were Asians from America, from the UK, from Australia, from Malaysia and Singapore. Um, and to hear the stories of how important this project was to them really resonated throughout the entire costs and crew. We knew there was something special about this, but we, we didn't feel too much pressure because we were such, so in the moment that we were, it was, it was such a joyous kind of experience being the show of all being the star of our insurer. Um, previous to this, a lot of the roles in Hollywood where a sideline does as the lecture characters, no one with a, with a particular voice. Um, but this time everybody had their moment to shine and damn. Did they deliver? Yeah, we've got fantastic costs. Comedians who just, Aquafina

Speaker 4:          03:00          is hilarious. Can Job Jimmy. Oui, Ronnie Chang because Santas, um, so it was, you know, it was, it was something very special for us.

Speaker 3:          03:11          Yeah. And um, so recently an article came out in the Hollywood reporter, um, and um, I think, um, John, you, you were in the, in the article, but there it seems like in back in 2016, there was a big decision to be made. Um, you guys had competing offers, you had an offer from Warner brothers, a studio, and then you also had an offer from Netflix. Um, which would have, would have given you guys a big payday. Can you walk us through why you decided to go with Warner Bros and what was the significance of putting this felled on the big screen?

Speaker 4:          03:42          Yeah. Well, when we started, when I started the movie, um, only a few years ago, it was, um, you know, we didn't know if it would ever get set up at a big studio. It had not been done for so long. Um, there wasn't some gigantic star that could like push it through. Um, and, uh, and so we developed it on our own. I brought in Adel Lim, who's a Malaysian American writer who I'd worked with on a, on a pilot. We got into, into shape that I thought was a really great shape. And, um, then we went out to the studios and what we found was of course, Netflix, uh, they have a lot of money and know how to throw their weight around. And, uh, and I love Netflix, doesn't, there's nothing wrong with that. Um, I just felt like, um, and Kevin and I, and our producer's credit to them, deferred to Kevin and I to make that decision.

Speaker 4:          04:32          We had 15 minutes to make this decision. A Warner brothers was going to pull the offer in 15 minutes. So, uh, they didn't even make, they said we were going to give you, I know this pastors, um, uh, they said they were going to make the offer in the, we had 15 minutes to decide. Uh, so, uh, we had like 21, like different lawyers, agents, everyone there and our, and our, and our producers defer to Kevin and I, and Kevin and I had talked kind of the night before and had to like a heart to heart about like, why are we doing this? What, what brought us together and what we realized and we knew might come down to money. We didn't come. We didn't know it was gonna come down to that big of a gap of money. Uh, so it's a little harder.

Speaker 4:          05:10          I kept thinking in my back yard, could use a Redo. I could use that new thing. Uh, I'm still thinking about it right now. Um, but, but it came down to, you know what, it's important for Hollywood studios to put a movie like this on the big screen because it sends a message, it sends a message across the world. It's still cinema, it's still cinema. And it says, when you put a piece in the museum, it anoints it as special annoyance. It as something worth your time and energy. You have to leave your house, pay, go fight with parking, pay for the ticket, pay for your food, jumped into a dark room, turn off the license. They told me a great story and I think that energy, um, is, is saying you were worth your time. Um, and I think subliminally that means so much and it trickles to all media at that point.

Speaker 4:          05:54          And we knew we were in a position, we didn't need money. I'd done enough films. He had done enough that everyone had done enough stuff here. No one was desperate. And so if anyone was do it, we could, we actually thought maybe we donate a percentage of the Netflix money to great causes for Asian American. And then it was like, no, it's all trying to trickle down to this moment right here. So, uh, yeah, I had sweat things that I never knew I could sweat. But it actually really helped us. And ultimately like when you double down, triple down on something like that, it makes everybody more invested. And now it was on us two pressure Warner brothers to publicize it the right way to market it the right way and credit to Warner brothers they have come through in, in spades.

Speaker 3:          06:33          And I think the important thing is, you know, not just telling the story of the, um, of the Asian American story as well, but you know, growing up in the u s so, you know, not that many films portraying Asians, even on television, you know, constants is in fresh off the boat was just, um, you know, a sitcom with featuring a full Asian cast. And so, um, John, you had a great quote in that article and, um, I just want to share with the group, um, you, you said you wanted to do a film in a way we haven't ever seen Asians before. Contemporary, stylish at the top of art and fashion. Emotional, funny, sarcastic, unapologetic, confident. Why do you think there aren't more films portraying Asians like that today?

Speaker 4:          07:12          I honestly don't know. This is the world we live in. These are the people I know. These are the people I've interacted with, both here in Hong Kong and Singapore and Taiwan. So, uh, I guess I didn't even realize myself that people didn't see this because I already had seen all of it. So, uh, I think it was when I was showing people my pitch and showing my friends, they're like, Whoa, I didn't know this existed. I didn't know this music existed. I didn't know they could be, could dress so cool. And I'm like, what are you talking about? They, uh, so, uh, so I think it was more of like, it was so obvious and I think we all a lot of us know this world. And then, and then also, but through the, through talking to Henry and meeting all these other agents from all around the words, which I did not know, I didn't even know Ronnie Chang who's on the daily show lived in Australia was what was it straight. I just saw him as the guy on the daily show. Um, learning about their experiences was a huge learning experience for me and opened my brain a lot. I didn't know a lot about Singapore either before jumping into the movie. So, um, yeah, I think it was just a, a matter of sharing what we already know and hopefully that cracks the door. Cause I'm sure there was other things that I don't know that we don't know, but people have great stories in history that just haven't been shown in the light.

Speaker 3:          08:26          Um, so Henry, um, there's been some controversy around the casting of your role and, um, it's led to a dialogue of what it means to be Asian enough to be cast in this film. And he said in an interview with instyle, there should be a conversation about it. And, um, I think we should be educating people. What sort, what sort of education do we need to do about this topic?

Speaker 4:          08:47          Yeah. You know, we talked so distinctly about black culture, Asian culture, Latino culture, but there's nothing that is being discussed

Speaker 2:          08:56          about mixed race people and how they can own the, um, their ethnicity. Uh, and so we, we, we sort of fall in this limbo where when we try to speak up, they're like, no, no, no, no, you're not Asian enough or you're not white enough. I was never wide enough for the UK. I was never very good enough for a Singapore, Malaysia. Uh, but I sure as hell wasn't going to let that put me down and not have the ability to own and be proud of my heritage. Um, so I did that very young. Um, and so I've been finding out my entire life. So when that, when that came up, but it wasn't a surprise. It was, it was just a, another thing. But at this point we have the platform to be able to discuss these issues. Um, you know, talking about Asian rights, it's, its, its rights in general.

Speaker 2:          09:44          It's about being, um, Portuguese mixed with Malaysian. Like in Malaysia, in Singapore, there's so much mixed heritage from the Portuguese, the Spanish, the Dutch, um, all integrating into culture. So why can't we be proud of that and why can't we own that as a badge of pride? Um, so for me, um, I knew through and through that I was the right person for the job. There was no question about that. I was more Asian than, than I can possibly describe. Um, and, and, and John John, John, John saw that and I was the right fit for the character. They had extensive searches for every single person. That's why the costume was so good. They wanted to find those voices that could bring these characters to life.

Speaker 4:          10:31          And I think people get confused. I think they think the movie takes place in China or something and cause, cause Singapore, it has like so many different and this and he's all mixed together. Um, and the character nick had to have been educated in the UK. So like when you're looking for is very specific. One I was very, very sure of Rachel. I wanted her to be Chinese American because in that, in the movie she, uh, in the script she talks specifically about Chinese culture and specifically about what she wants to be. So that was a very thing. But for nick it was like, especially talking to Kevin and his real history, he was, this is all sort of based around his life. When you find someone, uh, like, like Henry Golding, it's that perfectly. And we searched all around the world and of course he ended up being in the exact place of the book, told us he would be, he was living in Singapore. We could have saved a lot of money. And uh, so anyway, yeah, when someone's perfectly, well, I think when you watch the movie, all that bullshit argument goes out the window. And originally Henry, I think you were hosts on BBC and you weren't acting. So did it take some convincing for you to like audition for this role?

Speaker 2:          11:45          It took a lot of convincing. Um, I had been a presenter for travel shows and news channels for a good eight, seven, eight years. Um, so I was kinda stuck in that mindset of being stomped and, and kind of could into this category of this is your lane, the sticks where, because you're not going to be great at anything else. That's some of our problems is that we limit ourselves. Um, and the, the auditions came around and was huge sort of noise in Singapore and Malaysia. So much excitement for this movie that, that John was attached to it. Warner brothers had bought these riots, they had such faith faith in this book. Um, and a couple of couple of emails came through as well, do you want to audition for this role? And I was like, ah, I'm not an actor. I'm not right for this. There's somebody out there who deserves this, who's worked hard, um, who's going to represent the, uh, this community or represent actors in general for this really pivotal role. Um, and it wasn't until, uh, a mutual friend Steve Jang and here in San Francisco, uh, put us together. It was our mutual friend on Facebook

Speaker 5:          12:52          that was cyber stalking. John went through my Instagram, he went pretty deep, slid into my dms, pretty much trying not to like anything too fast so that he couldn't see that I how deep I was married.

Speaker 2:          13:10          But uh, but he, he got in touch and we had this amazing hour long conversation and he was in la. I was in Singapore and we spoke about what it meant to have grown up in, in, in all different sort of Asian environments. Him In, in Los Altos here in Los Angeles,

Speaker 5:          13:29          San Francisco, myself

Speaker 2:          13:31          in Malaysia on the east coast. And um, he, he, he was like, I've got two questions, you know, can, can you act and will you read for me? And at this point I was like, there's this, everything is pointing towards this moment and it's, it's ridiculous. If I do not just switch that, that mindset and, and throw myself into this. It's crazy if I don't. Um, and then we went on to the audition process and now my life has completely done a one 80, and I think it's going to be doing some somersaults person. And what I love about Henry too is like my big brother, I'm the youngest of five. So my big brother, he's like six, two good looking, athletic, all the opposite, right?

Speaker 5:          14:11          And

Speaker 2:          14:12          I showed him the movie and when Henry comes out in his white suit attire, so park and it's like this beautiful shot of through the bushes and he's coming out, my brother starts crying, which I'd never seen him cry. He's not that type. He's like, you have no idea. All the years have I felt so, um, so different than anyone else and not seen as as this symbol. And so Henry represents this to so many, uh, uh, at least for Asian men I know, and myself included, to see someone that is an aspiration and inspiration and, and everything in between. A total gentleman of someone from like another Arrow, a movie star, another era. And you could be in any ethnicity, doesn't matter like Henry was. It has, it has this star quality that makes you want to be a better man. And I think that that, yeah.

Speaker 5:          15:02          Will you marry me is what I'm saying?

Speaker 3:          15:08          Um, yeah, so in the film, piglet has a wonderful line like Damn Rachel, it was like the Asian bachelor and as a fan of the bachelor, many amazing life. Yeah. Best lines

Speaker 2:          15:19          a lot that didn't make the car too dirty.

Speaker 5:          15:23          Sure.

Speaker 3:          15:25          So, um, with the cats, it's pretty national. International, you have English, American, Malaysian. Um, so Henry, you're both Malaysian and English. Um, what was the experience like working, um, working in Great Britain are different or similar to like Asian Americans in Hollywood or Malaysians in Asia?

Speaker 2:          15:43          Yeah. You know, in, um, in the UK when you're labeled as Asian, your South Asian, nothing wrong with that. It's just that, that is for some crazy reason. That's a, it's you're, you're either of Pakistani or Indian descent, um, and that's Asian in the UK. So I was always sort of Chinese or, or something weird like that. Um, but they, but over in America, when you're Asian, you're, you're, you're of East Asian, the set. And so for myself, it was, it's really interesting to, to have had the group of such international sort of be people who, like I said, we're, we're swapping these stories of how they struggled, um, in the different areas in comedy, in, in, in sort of the acting and the odds. Michelle Yeoh, uh, for instance had a completely different story to tell. She grew up in Malaysia, in Malaysia, but she was in the Hong Kong industry for the longest time.

Speaker 2:          16:42          And there's no lack of representation there because it is a Chinese market and it's, it's the Chinese demographic. So, uh, John always brings up, like when, when they were first told me, she was like, I don't know what you guys are talking about. The cinema is great for us, but that's because it's, it's so different, but on, on, uh, on, on sort of Western, um, media, uh, representation is a big problem. Um, so that was, was sort of an exchange of, of learning for us. Um, so I think we all grew such a broader perspective and I think that's something that the film really promotes is the fact that you can be of any Asian descent, any, any different ethnicity to, to the one that you've been adopted in, in, in this, in a particular country. Um, be able to be proud of it, be able to speak your thoughts, be able to make your own mind up if of who you want to be, where you want it to go. Um, and so hopefully this, this just triggers more conversation. Uh, it triggers more avenue for expression.

Speaker 3:          17:46          So I don't know if everyone in the audience knows, but father, um, is the famous chef chew and his restaurant is a landmark in silicon valley.

Speaker 4:          17:54          You guys structure here. Um, so questions.

Speaker 3:          18:01          What were your parents like? Were they very traditional? Do they expect you to take over the family business? What did they think when you went to USC to study film?

Speaker 4:          18:10          Um, they're both traditional and very, not traditional. I mean, we were in a Chinese restaurant. They came to the states not knowing a word of English and started this business and 50 years later, it's still there. Uh, and they always, they actually never let us work in the restaurant though. They always said do everything we couldn't do. So they put us, I took drums, sax, Violin, piano, guitar. I was in like tap dance classes. We took etiquette classes. My mom really thought we were going to be like the Kennedys, so she dressed us. She dressed us the same. We took ballroom dance classes, we went to shows in the city every weekend, whether it was opera season, ballet season, uh, our musical season. So we had a very different, uh, bringing in that way. But my, my father was very traditionally Chinese to, uh, didn't want us to drink soda at dim sum table and things like that.

Speaker 4:          19:01          Um, so I had these two different things. My mom was like, go pursue your passions, just be happy. Um, and my dad and my mom also at the same time, it would be like about family first and sacrifice yourself for family. So I'm like, what the hell? I don't know. What to do. I'm so stuck. And that's, that's actually a big theme in this movie of an Asian American going to Asia for the first time and going through this culture identity. I remember being scared, going to school that people that I would smell like Chinese food or that my food, that my parents packed me, the dumplings I've been playing with, like smell up the room. Um, and one day on Chinese New Year, my parents came and did a presentation for our like second grade class and they brought the lion dancers and they brought a red envelopes for all the kids and chocolate gold cup.

Speaker 4:          19:51          And I became like the most popular kid in school. And it was the first time I was like, oh, I'm proud to be as, and then we went to the restaurant every time after like sports games or whatever, everyone wanted the food. It was, it was through to their hearts, through the food really. And so, um, uh, to do a movie about it, which I also never did a movie about my own culture. I then it was always, you know, you don't want it if you're the only Asian in the room, you don't want to just do the Asian thing. Cause I feel like everyone then marks you as that and just silly thing. But it's a reality that you feel. Um, and a certain point, I think online when everyone was reacting to the whitewashed out movement, all that stuff, it made me realize that, oh no, I earned the spot. I don't have to apologize for my spot. I can explore these things as an artist, as a filmmaker, the way every other artists gets to do that. Um, and uh, and look, people are showing up for it. It's a, it's a, it's an a very empowering feeling when you see the result. And this was not guaranteed to have people come out to see the support the other end. So

Speaker 2:          20:48          it means a lot.

Speaker 6:          20:49          Um, so we have one more. When we had our press tour,

Speaker 5:          20:53          the restaurant yesterday, it comes full circle. It was amazing.

Speaker 2:          20:58          Uh, his dad went out to the car or the brought out family photos.

Speaker 5:          21:02          Oh, they took them all off the wall, put them in the trunk so they could show the reporters. They took my awards, they put them on the tables of the restaurants. These were her words when he was like seven years old. It's true, isn't it? 100%. You're cute.

Speaker 6:          21:21          So we organize a Google, um, family dinner. The restaurant is your dad fly your words again? Guaranteed. All right. I have told them not to for many times and then, okay. All right. We might have to organize that later. Um, so we're going to do one more question here and then we're going to open up to the audience. So if you guys have any questions, please line up at the mic. So, um, similar, um, question for you Henry. Um, kind of about your, your upbringing in your career and how your family concerned it. Cause you kind of had a shift in cry. I think your eyes are red on your trained hairdresser. I was a half size for a long time. And then you became a presenter on BBC and now you're an actor. So how, how did your family, you know, I think about this transition and careers,

Speaker 2:          22:01          you know, they're there, they've always been very open. Um, and if you consider sort of back in their day, mixed race couples weren't overly accepted. Um, so for them they've always had a very open mind about most things. Um, so for from what they taught us, it was, it was mainly, you know, be good to, to others, um, try to sort of, uh, promote kind of a wellbeing and in, in terms of, of helping others and, um, don't do any, anything stupid and, and, and be safe. Those were the rules. So when I, when I told him one day, I, I want us to be a chef, they're like, okay, great. Do the chef thing. I did the chef thing for about a week, gave up and then I became a hairdresser and they're like, amazing, like go do that, follow your passion. Um, and so it was a half size for four or five years. As soon as I finished school. Is it true that all the old ladies would want to make appointments with you? So you can say, I have to do so many, so many pounds,

Speaker 5:          23:01          my hands like

Speaker 2:          23:02          bleeding. Um, so, but then, but then I, I was like, I'm going to be, I'm leaving the UK, I'm going to move back to Malaysia and Singapore. I wanna I want to find myself there and I want to get into this amazing industry. Um, and, and they were like, absolutely just, just, just be goods. It can be good to people and um, and just stay safe. And that was, that was them sending me off. Um, so it's, you know, it's having this sort of movie, just really drill home, kind of the aspect of family, the aspect of, um, identity. It's, it's been warming cause you, you look onto yourself, you know, it almost sweet. It sparks something within all

Speaker 4:          23:46          of us. Uh, we never were always sort of going forwards. We never consider the traditions of family or traditions of culture. Um, sometimes it's nice to look back and appreciate all of that. And as of like yesterday, his parents weren't coming to the premiere and we're like, dude, you got to get them to the premiere. I don't think they understand what this is or you got to force them. Your job is to get them there. And so now they're going to show up. So I think they're in for a whirlwind of a day. It's be pretty crazy for it. Um, okay. So why don't we move to audience questions

Speaker 3:          24:19          first one honey. Sounds good. Hi, I'm Connie. Uh, ever since Constance, we're starting to becoming like a thing. I'm thinking about going back constants cause I feel like it's a cooler, Nina, so you can tell her that. But I was wondering, um, John, you kind of touched on this earlier, but I was wondering for both of you, um, how is it shifting from me, uh, environment where I'm not, everyone was Asian and everyone's from diverse backgrounds to moving, um, to a team where most of the cast and crew were Asian. Were there any you'd like expected or didn't expect?

Speaker 4:          24:52          Um, I mean, I've made movies overseas before in London for now. You see me and, um, it's always a little cultural shock as a person just going over there and living there for nine months or so. Uh, this one was our most global, uh, crew. I think they were also during Ramadan. So we had to their fasting at the same time. So I was learning about our crew. It's like a circus. So you, you, you have these very intimate moments with people you don't know yet. And it's very quick. But we became a family. We knew that they couldn't eat till whatever time. So everyone, we had to pace them and then, and then other people were bringing things to the table that you didn't know. Styles and things that since we're shooting in Singapore, in Malaysia about Singapore being educated about, you know, wealth here isn't about size even though we know they, you think Vegas and big columns and big doors, uh, Singapore and the small island.

Speaker 4:          25:43          So like a $20 million place looks like a small apartment. But actually it's worth a lot. Things like that. Cultural things that I had to learn, not just from our crew, from our, our cast. Um, it was a, a, you know what I love about making movies? Everyone asks me, what's that one movie you're going to make that will make, you know, that's when, you know, you made it. I don't have that. When we had movies or something that feels like an exercise for me, a breed, I need to do it. It's like breathing. Um, and this was another one of those ones that like sort of transitioned me into, uh, into a different part of my life where I got to learn a lot from them. Um, so hopefully you feel that in the movie when you walk in, you get to go through the same journey that I did. In a way

Speaker 7:          26:22          I wanted to start by saying that this is like a really important movie for people. Uh, this one of the first movies search humanizing Asians in North America. I say North America because I'm Canadian.

Speaker 3:          26:32          MMM.

Speaker 7:          26:35          On that note, like I look to hear more about casting decisions of the movie. Like Henry, you mentioned that this film allows you to own your Asian heritage and you know, everyone in this room is really how people that I don't like mean to take away from that at all. Like I grew up also in a mixed household, but I do want to hear like Urin John's thoughts that there is discussion within our community that the main male lead is not, not a complete representation of what Asian men look like. And casting like a lead with mixed western and Asian features might perpetuate stereotypes of how Asian, like really Asian looking men still can't be romantic leads even in movies that representative.

Speaker 4:          27:12          Well I think one thing, I had a lot of discussions about this. I think what it's great to have a discussion what a privilege to actually have a discussion about casting Asians as leads a um, and um, and what I found was it's one we've found the perfect person to play this role isn't a very specific movie about Singapore with a person from Singapore and was living in this life and has a British accent and was all that, all those things that aside, I don't blame people. At first I was angry at people for saying these things. Is Barack Obama not black enough? Is Halle Berry not black enough? Like why do other people get why? Why do other people get the okay and so, um, but I actually, I don't, I blame the system itself. I blame that when you've been hit in the face 20 times and then someone comes over and tries to give you five and you duck in and jab them in the abdomen.

Speaker 4:          28:04          It's whose fault is that? It's not the person who's been victimized over and over again. I, I know that feeling. I've been there. Um, it's, it's, it's whatever this environment that we've created and it's a shame that one movie is supposed to define everybody's experienced. That's just an unfair idea. Um, and, uh, so, so I don't, I have no ill will about, and I think it's a very healthy discussion that we should have and it's nice to have. Um, there's other discussions like, can you, can you hire a Japanese person to play a Chinese person and vice versa. And Meryl Streep can play any ethnicity. So why do we have to say that this is whatever. I Dunno. Um, so I think it's just a discussion that we have to make the decision on our own for, and my hope is that this movie, um, because we have, it's a book, so it has very defined characters and we cast accordingly.

Speaker 4:          28:56          We saw so many thousands of people all around the world. And I had to, uh, there are people that I could not hire that were great, um, uh, for roles, uh, but not in this movie because they don't, we just don't have them. We only have a certain amount. So I hope that this actually gives more movies, opportunities to get out there. Cause I think that's the bigger picture. Um, uh, what's the Bruce Lee about? A line about when you're, when you, when there's a finger pointing to the moon, don't focus on the finger. Um, focus on the, the enormity of this moon that we're headed towards. And I think, um, we want other filmmakers and other writers to be telling great stories so we can broaden this out. And there's not just one character we're looking on and be like, well, why doesn't that represent all everybody?

Speaker 4:          29:38          Um, so that's what we hope and that's why when see you guys, when I meet the journalist that we've met in the past where we would go to youtube and see all the youtubers and all these creators, it gives me a lot of hope because they are writing the stories and coming up with the things and having the expertise, uh, to, to expand this dialogue. Um, and, and yes, let's have the dial. Let's go. This is, this is great. Um, but at the same time, let's focus on the bigger, on the, on the bigger destination that we're headed towards. Terrific. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          30:08          Hi. So I think you started touching on some of this a little bit when you talked about can't, you know, represent all of Asian American, this one film. Um, I do want to have you expand a little bit more on that. So it's clear that the film holds important significance and, um, it's really momentous for the Asian community. Um, there are, of course, you know, criticisms around the film not actually being representative enough of the vast diversity that exists in Asian America today. Um, some of sad, you know, it perpetuates the model minority in some ways, which is a damaging stereotype for the Asian community. And some of sad, you know, like you said, this is one step closer to where we want to be and where we want to go. Um, so just want to hear a little bit more about your thoughts on that and how, um, how you might respond to some of those ideas.

Speaker 4:          30:48          Well, my first thing is watch the movie and then maybe make a opinion about it. I'm mostly, people have not watched the movie. Maybe they read the book and which has very specific things, but that's not the movie. Um, and then when we watched the movie, then let's have a conversation and listen, this is, this is the point of, of, of movies is to have a conversation. When I watched joy luck club, my dad got us all into a van. We didn't know what movie you were watching forces to go into this theater at the earliest showing 10 in the morning. Right.

Speaker 5:          31:20          Save the money, I'll discount,

Speaker 4:          31:24          give us some afterwards. And we loved it so much. We were quoting things from it cause we're like, oh, that's like our auntie. I'm not your Auntie.

Speaker 5:          31:31          She says certain things that we like and um,

Speaker 4:          31:34          and for you, and we had like a three hour conversation and that's what the power of movies and um, you know, obviously the d that didn't open up everything for all Asians at that point. It was a success. And I think for us it gave us this, this light, um, and uh, uh, but hopefully this starts conversation that can create other work. Like I sort of said before that that will, um, that will create the platform that, that we need. This is again, not just a movie. We would keep saying this, this is a movement. Um, and maybe that's a little self serving because we have a movie that we're releasing, but the reality is that's where we are. That's what Hollywood is going to be watching that opening weekend. If people don't show up that opening weekend, it's going to be many years before the guys, we're going to still fight for it. Don't get me wrong, but it's just, this could be a really nice jolts to get us jumpstarted. There's four projects at least in Hollywood right now that are ready on the line and they have not greenlit and waiting to see how this one does and in a lot of more stars other than this guy and other than this guy to actually, um, get out there to the world. I just want to add on to that also is that, um, you know, a lot of people are concentrating

Speaker 2:          32:40          on the Asian American view. There's a lot more Asians out there in the world who don't live in America who face the same exact challenges, uh, voices in the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand. Um, but people seem to be thinking that the only Western Asians are American. Um, so it's the voices like Michelle's, uh, like myself, like Ronnie Chang is from Malaysia is Roger Whole, um, jinx from Shanghai. Um, those, uh, tales that should be told in other movies. It's it what, what John said, it is unfair to have though the weight of the world, the weight of, um, Asians in general on, on this one particular mood on this one particular movie. It's like having the world balanced on a pin. There's so much to tell and so many unique cultural, culturally significant stories to expand people's horizons, expand beyond that of just being American, Asian, being a American Filipino American tie.

Speaker 2:          33:44          Um, you know, it's, it's, it's stunning. W we're, we're opening, we're cracking that door open. We're hoping that not only filmmakers but reporters, reviewers, people in all sorts of industry step up and be proud of, of writing stories no matter what Asian ethnicity, even if it's not Asian American. Um, and so we need to look at the broader picture and, and, and, you know, there's no label for, for just being Asian as many subcategories and, um, you know, like how can we just have the love that you see in the movie, you know, that that is the true translation of everything we're trying to do is, is that story of coming together, fighting adversity. And we find it together as the only way we're going to win. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          34:30          Okay. Um, we have one more last audience question. Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Kat John. I'm a fellow bay or native. You don't have to tell you. I watched never say number twice. Nice believer, believer. I see you. And growing up I was told by my family to, you know, pursue a medical position when I got to college or like pursue a tech position. But I've always had creative interests. And for both of you, what advice do you have for someone, especially with my background, our heritage, to really just break out of that sort of internal pressure to really pursue those endeavors. And specifically for Henry, do you feel like in your next role, do you feel pressured to choose a character that breaks the common Asian stereotypes?

Speaker 8:          35:14          Okay.

Speaker 4:          35:14          Uh, uh, Constance, uh, who was with us yesterday, she had to go back to shoot her show. Said something great to when someone asks a very similar kind, she said,

Speaker 8:          35:22          uh,

Speaker 4:          35:24          you don't have to listen to your parents.

Speaker 3:          35:28          I'll tell my mom that.

Speaker 4:          35:32          I guess that's as simple as that. I know it's hard and a, you have to figure out how to do that. But, um, um, the reality is I think we're in and, uh, yeah, I mean that's, that's growing up. That's uh, uh, that's saying, yeah, we're good enough and, and you don't have to have the baggage that your parents may have from a, from another era and another time. Um, men, women, young people, whatever class, whenever it doesn't matter, um, we can, we can determine our own destiny. And now if you're a creator, if you're a writer, if you're a director, my advice is always, if you're a director, you've got to direct. If you're ready, you've got to right. There's no excuse you. Nobody has to give you permission to that. You can borrow a, a phone camera from somebody you can edit on your phone. You can get it on online and get it to people. Um, if you are a storyteller, you tell stories and that's just innately in you and you do it. It's like being an entrepreneur. You can't train someone. They're either starting a business or they're not. You can't aspire to be an entrepreneur,

Speaker 2:          36:29          uh, for myself. Uh, you're talking about my, my next roles and things like that. And for me it was, it's really, you know, being, uh, an Asian lead in, in, in a particularly Asian movie. I'm super proud of that. But my real goal was the normalization of being a different face in, in this big sort of industry of Hollywood. Um, and normalizing the fact that it's an Asian lead, uh, that it's not a particular role that's written for an Asian character. My next film is called a symbol favor. I played Blake Lively's husbands Adda Kendrick's love interest. Um, my name is Sean Townsend.

Speaker 2:          37:14          There's no, there's no, it's not necessary to explain my ethnicity. That's where we need to get to. Uh, we need to get normalize this fact that we have all these beautiful Asian faces on the screen and not have to explain where they've come from or what they're doing there. Um, and so that's the level that we want to. So for me, I just want to be a leading man in these amazing movies and spread inspiration to people who think that they're not good enough, that they, that they, because they were born somewhere else, that they don't belong in, in the country that they are in now. Um, so I think, um, you know, I'm going to be tracking away at that, but that doesn't mean that I'm not going to be taking Asian roles. My third movie, I was playing an Asian in that and that was playing a gay Asian or that I'm super proud of that. And it's, it's, it's, it doesn't matter the sexual, it doesn't matter the race. Um, I just want to be a spokesperson or a role model for, for people who felt like they didn't have that choice. So they can't aspire to be something great. Preach. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          38:24          Today if you guys,

Speaker 6:          38:25          um, haven't seen the film, I highly encourage it. I saw last night, loved it. So be sure to go opening weekend and support the film. I'm sure you, you guys would appreciate that. Tell your friends or your family. It's a great movie. Um, and with that, I know you guys have a packed schedule, need to be on your way. So thank you so much for visiting your call.

Speaker 1:          38:43          Sure.
