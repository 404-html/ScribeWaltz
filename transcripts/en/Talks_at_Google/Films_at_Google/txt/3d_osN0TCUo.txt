Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. Hello and welcome the toxic Google. I'm Kevin Dog. I'm Rebecca Prozan and we're here today to talk about the new movie free held and we have Ellen page and Julianne Moore.

Speaker 1:          00:22          So, uh, you know this, this story is, it's a beautiful love story that tells the story of a true story of a Lowell Hester, uh, who is a very decorated, well known, respected a police officer, a detective, uh, in New Jersey and develops lung cancer and it's stage four and wants to pass her benefits onto Stacy, uh, her partner Stacy, and is not allowed to. So it's about that struggle and that fight, trying to get that approval from the freeholders, this governing council. So, um, very, very powerful story. And I kind of want to talk about, um, just what led you both to this project.

Speaker 2:          01:04          Sure. Um, okay. Well, when I was a, a freehold, uh, there's a documentary with the same name made by Cynthia Wade, which is incredible, and you should check it out and won an Oscar in 2008 for best short subject. So shortly after that, Michael Shamberg and Stacey share producers on the project sent me the documentary and asked if I would like to attach myself to play Stacy. And I watched it and I was weeping. I was so moved and I said yes immediately. Um, and, and then they were very gracious and generous and involve me in the development process. And so we found why not run a nice one or about the screenplay and then Pete solid.

Speaker 3:          01:43          And then Julie. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:48          we're involved for seven years. You're a producer on the film as well. So I'm the casting of just Juliane. So what stage was that then?

Speaker 2:          01:55          That was a, I mean, that was when

Speaker 3:          01:58          we were shooting the film a year ago. And you said yes in February. Yeah. So this time last year we were actually shooting, um, in, in New York, but yeah, it was February when I first met with Pete and talk to Ellen and yeah, so it wasn't that long ago. Really? Year and a half or so. Yeah, I guess there are thousands of same sex couples that have had similar, unfortunately some with situations to this with, there's something about the story itself for the documentary when you saw it that like you just said, like the light bulb went off in, you're like, I have to do this. Wow. Well, the documentary is, is pretty extraordinary. I think the degree of, of intimacy with which you experience it is, is unusual. The fact that they allowed a documentarian in their home every single day that during the last year of Laurel's life is, is, uh, it's, it's very unusual.

Speaker 3:          02:50          So I think you, I think you get a, uh, a palpable sense of who they are and what they were up against and what, and how and what screw Urbanation really means. You know, what, what, what are the costs of, of, uh, of something that seems innately political when you realize that they're talking about listing their house and specifically as it relates to the detective, your character. Um, she seems like, because I saw it on Monday, yeah. That she would be sort of a difficult character to get to know. And to learn about, um, she's complex. Yes. She's a little distant. Um, she's a cop and not someone who was necessarily forthcoming about who she is. How did you wrap your head around that as an actress? Well, interestingly enough, the cop part was the hardest part for me. The relationship part was easy. I mean, you know, that, that I understand that's something I think we're all familiar with, you know, who, how you fall in love with somebody and build a life with them.

Speaker 3:          03:46          But for me, being a police officer was really, really different. And, and of course I had the Laurel and the doc, you know, um, and I, so I had the Laurel who was not well, but I did not know the Laurel who, who was healthy. And that was really provided to me by Stacy Andre herself, who opened her home to us and showed us all these newspaper clippings and photographs and um, and shared her memories. And also Dane Wells who was, uh, Laurel's partner, police partner and boils, brother and sister. And so with all of that information, I was able to kind of figure out who the, who that Laurel was. And, and what was interesting is that, that the, I think, I think because she was such a, she was such a police officer, really believed in justice system, really believed in doing the right thing, that kind of moral fiber or the her ethics. We're, we're truly what drove her to do the right thing for the woman that she loves.

Speaker 1:          04:39          And, you know, is there, obviously this is, you know, based on true story, these are real characters. Is there a sense of fear or you know, real responsibility because you are adapting and you are actually acting as real people who really existed and do still exist? For sure.

Speaker 2:          04:53          I think we all felt a sense of responsibility and, um, you know, wanted, you know, Stacy and Dane to feel, um, safe essentially to, to, to have them know that our goal is to make something as truthful and as honest and as authentic as possible. Um, and so we always just, we would text Stacy or, you know, communicate with her while we were shooting, and then she came to sat for a day she's in, you can see her in the film at, uh, at the end, at a certain point. And Yeah. So, um, I think you feel a sense of responsibility and that's probably what we put most of our thought into, I would say.

Speaker 3:          05:32          Yeah. Yeah. I think you've touched on this a little bit, but how involved was she in the development of the film? Was she, you know, onset? Were you asking her for advice? Like how did that work? She was,

Speaker 2:          05:46          she was really involved. I mean, she a run nice one or spent a lot of time, uh, the screen screenwriter with Stacy and with Dane and with Stephen Goldstein has Steve Carell plays and, um, and then she, we both spent a lot of time with her and she was just so, um, kind to us. And as you can imagine, a lot of, uh, the conversations are difficult and emotional. You know the ones about the good times and the ones about the difficult times and it's all, um, you know, her having to bring that back up to the surface. It's sorta interesting cause she's also seems unwilling to participate through the movie. So it's almost sweet that she, maybe that's not the right word, but that and compelling that she was so participatory. Well I think it truly is a reflection of her love and dedication towards Laurel and Cindy Wade when she's making the documentary. Did ask Laurel, you know, how would you feel if people would want to fictionalize this? Like is that something that you'd be willing to give the the rights to? And she was like, as if someone would want to do that, of course was her response. But um, she was absolutely, I would want as many people as possible and know about our story and what you know, and the community goes through

Speaker 1:          07:02          doing your research, you know, on Laurel and Stacy and their story and Dane and, and everything. You know what's really, you're watching a film, but you have to keep in the back of mind that this actually happened. This is a real story. And what's, what's really gut wrenching to think too, is that not only were they fighting cancer and they were fighting, um, you know, not just marriage, gay marriage, it was marriage equality and they allowed a documentary film and directly to come into their lives. So can you talk about just meeting, you know, Stacy and talking with them about what brought that decision and was like, yeah, we're okay with this, that the last year of my life, our lives together, we're going to do this.

Speaker 3:          07:41          It was Dane who really spearheaded it. I mean, that's what's interesting is that Dane, um, I think came into their lives and, and wanted to have a sense of outrage about how they were being treated and wanted to, to make a difference. And so he had, he began to organize the press coverage of, of their fight. And he was the one that fielded the calls from film makers and, and he, he brought Cynthia Wade to them because he liked the way Cynthia sounded on the, on her, on his answering machine. So I think that, I think probably the least acquiescent partner was Stacy because she was just trying to take care of Laurel. Um, but, but I think that they began to feel compelled to do the right thing simply because of what was happening. But, but I think without Dane, I don't know that this all would have happened. He really was quite heroic and really, really protective of them.

Speaker 2:          08:30          Their story. You talked about this earlier to join, but for both of you, um, this movie is about Justice and Equality and, um, and really same sex marriage or same set and rights for same sex couples. Um, did you think it was interesting that Laurel said time and time again? I'm not fighting for marriage. I'm funding for quality.

Speaker 3:          08:52          I love that about her. I mean, I love that she to be political about something. She was like, she was not there to do what Steven Goldstein wanted, which they needed. They both needed each other. Clearly I'm Laurel and Stacy needed Stephen Goldstein to bring attention to their cause and Stephen Goldstein wanted them to, to, to, uh, move his agenda forward. And they knew that. And I think there was that, there was not, um, it, it was an uneasy alliance. Would they both, they both wanted different things. And, and as I said, the, I think it was, I think it was Laurel's ethics that made her say, no, this is, I'm not, I'm not fighting for a political movement. I'm fighting for what is fair. You know, Edie Windsor, sad, you know, Laurel Hester is a hero for asking to be treated exactly like everybody else. So I think that those, I think those degrees were, were important to her, that, that distinction that what they, that legally they should have had this, it was only a loophole in the law that allowed the, the benefits to be decided by the county core zine just had kind of not close that loophole.

Speaker 1:          09:55          Yeah. And so, and you know, it's such a beautiful, beautiful movie and a great movie where you're asking people who have these certain beliefs, these free holders essentially, and there's millions of them like them where it's, it's, we're not asking you to even just believe in this. We're actually asking you just for your support. Right. And so it's like we're not trying to change your beliefs. If you believe one thing, that's fine. So how were they able to succeed in that with the freeholders where it was like, you have to accept this? You know,

Speaker 2:          10:22          I think it was just all the pressures, pressure every, you know, when it was happening to every county around, um, ocean county. Yeah. You fixed the loophole. And so that, and they were just surrounded and the pressure was strong and they, of course, I called them and say like, you know, this is enough. It's embarrassing. You know? So, yeah, but it was political. Yeah. And it's true in the, if you've seen the film for those who've seen the film, like for example, when the, the certain freeholder like doesn't show up to the meeting. That was true. And he was like on vacation, but he wasn't. And you know, so it's all very accurate to what happened. Um, Ellen, this movie, it's a powerful statement about changing hearts and minds and during the seven years sort of the country changed with the production of the movie.

Speaker 2:          11:14          Um, polls consistently show more support for civil rights. Right. Did that change, did that see change sort of change how you marketed the movie? Thought about who should be in the movie? Anything about like how it was produced or anything about, I don't know. So at all actually. Yeah, I know. I mean, we were, we were always trying to make the movie we're trying to make, which was an honest, you know, reflection of their, their experience and what has been actually interesting and watching it even at the premiere recently, sort of after, you know, a lot of the backlash post, the recent awesome supreme court decision, there was like all of these sort of new, there's

Speaker 3:          11:54          definitely new things that I, I was noticing sort of after a lot of the dialogue that's been happening. Um, but no, I don't think anything was necessarily adjusted or changed in any way.

Speaker 1:          12:07          What were some of your favorite scenes to shoot together and some of the most toughest ones to, cause I, you know, there's this, I love this thing at the beginning, just the, you know, hey, can I have your number? And you know, yeah. Have the writing on the arm. It's so cute. It's like, you're like, oh, okay. You know, when you go there and it's absolutely adorable, you know, and it's in the tray. It's, it's great. So what was the, I mean that's mine, but like what were your favorite scenes to shoot?

Speaker 4:          12:31          It's about Megan

Speaker 1:          12:33          really. So what were some of the elements, but also what were the most complicated? One's the toughest one. The shoot.

Speaker 3:          12:38          We loved it all. We did. I mean, honestly, it was such a delight to, to go to work every day and to have Ellen there as my partner onscreen and off. And I think just being together, um, I never felt, um, we just, when we were just a team, you know, so everything felt like a, something that we were maneuvering. And we were discovering. Yeah. Yeah. You really were. But I mean, that being said, I always liked the happy stuff better than the set stuff. Yeah. You know, I love, my favorite thing was the date, you know, where she brings me with a soda and I have to say, you know, I'm older than you when she was like, Oh yeah, whatever. And then we dance and, and it was just a really fun, fun, beautiful night. Um, and we'd gotten to know each other very well that we shot that near the end of the shoot.

Speaker 3:          13:22          And it was great to shoot a scene where you're falling in love, you know, but also not that I'm trying to run away the conversation, but also even in the really emotional stuff to have, have Ellen there as, as a partner in that same way, just allowed us to, to, I don't know, it allow, we'd had a wonderful shared experience with it and you when it was tough. Well, I can tell you they're going to be a lot of jokes about spike drama for years to come. Spiked, Huh? Oh yeah. Yeah. What's funny is I, I gave that tee shirt to my friends. But yeah.

Speaker 3:          13:55          How has this movie changed you? Both of you. I have a new friend every meeting. No, I can't, I can't, you can't say that about every movie. I mean, I can, I go to movies and I have, I can have great relationships with the people that I work with. I don't necessarily come away with like a new friend and I genuinely did on this one. But I also feel, and this was something that I was surprised by myself, that I don't think I have really a full understanding of what it, how painful it was to be closeted and then have to deal with a public to come out publicly on a, on a, on a big platform to, you know, I don't think somebody said to me, are you kidding? You must've known lots of people have come out. And I'm like, yeah, but a long time ago, I'm old, you know, everyone's kind of been in their lives and it's been, it's been a while since I've experienced somebody doing it sort of. So recently in with and, and, and publicly and

Speaker 2:          14:52          it, and it certainly raised my awareness and deepen my compassion.

Speaker 5:          14:57          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          14:58          no. When you're on the project for seven years too, so did, was, was there a lot of change with you with that and just, just your perspective on everything?

Speaker 5:          15:06          Yup.

Speaker 2:          15:08          Yeah. So I mean, when I was attached to the movie, when I was 21, I was in very closet. I was very closeted person, you know, and be embarrassed to say how closeted I was. And, um, it is, I will say it was when I reflect back, it really does blow my mind. Like how much my personal story did correlate in parallel with the development of this. And that being said, it would have to, you know, it feel wildly inappropriate to be a closeted actor playing this role. Um, and, um, you know, more than that, it is, it's people like Laurlynn Stacy that inspire you to do the right thing for yourself, for your emotional wellbeing and life, and to be a visible person for the community. You know, they dealt with the really horrific situation and really stood up. And, uh, what makes, allows me the privileges that I now have in my life that shouldn't be taken for granted. So.

Speaker 1:          16:06          Yup. And we'll start taking audience questions if you guys wanna start lining up. Um, but you know, another interesting thing, I was watching the movie too and then you have the documentary as well, but in the development of it or the writing of it, um, was there anything that you want to include it in the movie but couldn't because of time constraints or it didn't really match with the film and it was like, this is a really, really important, or this is a really interesting part but just doesn't fit.

Speaker 5:          16:29          There was some, I don't know any,

Speaker 2:          16:31          there were at certain point I feel like the script is, you know, it was longer and then you are limited by your budget. You're limited by the days you'll have to shoot, et cetera. Like I can remember where you did go to the, there was a scene where maybe you haven't even read this telling me

Speaker 4:          16:47          gay audience. It's just somebody. Um, so the, the sure there's things that, you know, you, you get

Speaker 2:          16:58          limited by your resources when you should have loaded budget movie and only have what, 26 days to shoot. Yeah. We'll even like the guys who played the freeholders I think shot everything in a day and a half. Yeah. We're thinking, man, that's horrible. This poor guys, you know, so they barely had a chance to, to, to, to really get going on something we didn't have any time. You just use, wish you had more time. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          17:19          Yeah.

Speaker 6:          17:22          [inaudible] not at, won't ask you a question about the movie, but Ellen, um, there are still deeply entrenched, uh, beliefs about same sex marriage and equality and LGBT rights. What did you learn in your interaction with Ted Cruz now that you've had a chance to reflect on it?

Speaker 2:          17:39          What did I learn?

Speaker 6:          17:40          What did you learn in terms of the perspective of someone that you know, that a lot of us in this room probably disagree with pretty deeply? Like, did you, did you learn anything about that perspective or is just you just disagree

Speaker 2:          17:50          with them? Oh No. You know, I've been making sure with vice that will come out early next year where I've been, I'm traveling around the world and going to different countries and exploring the LGBT community in which the country we've been in different countries. Um, so I've had a year of these kinds of conversations. Typically they're more sit down conversations with people on a really extreme, uh, most of it of course, is focused on the community and people in the community. But yes, we do address those and have conversations with people who are think drastically different. And I mean, very, very extreme to, um, you know, less extreme. And, um, so it's, it's, you know, it's hard. It's hard. I think sometimes too, when I'm, when it's a politician, because you don't, you're not gonna you struggle. They get to have a real conversation. You know, how awesome is it that we live in a country where I can walk up at a state fair and have a conversation with a senator, would totally, you know, speaks to me and gives me the, gives me the time.

Speaker 2:          18:58          But you know, I think it's, it's what happened with Ted Cruz is, um, the outcome was what I expected. You know, I've seen Ted Cruz be asked questions regarding the community before and it's a similar sort of a, it tends to be like, you know, uh, evasive flower rhetoric and distance from one, you know, answering a direct question, shall we say. So it's, it's hard to, it's hard to, I don't know. And it's, it's always a similar rhetoric no matter where I've been. It's the same, the same things are said to you no matter what, where you are in the world. So, um, hey guys, so I guess I actually watched the movie a few days ago and there were definitely some scenes that were super like cringeworthy, especially the ones that involved the freeholders on in a room, you know, like saying that they wanted a unanimous vote and like you heard the entire audience gas when these things happen because they were so terrible. And it really got me wondering how difficult it was to cast roles as such. Or like find people who believed in like the, the message of the film so much, but had to play these terrible, terrible roles of like being these people who are so negative against Laurel and Stacy. So if you have insight on that, that'd be really cool.

Speaker 3:          20:21          I think. Not Hard at all. I mean, and we were fortunate because we were shooting in New York and so that you have access to all these incredible New York actors who live there and who are interested in doing, you know, important movies. And so everybody, all of those guys that, they all have amazing resumes, they've all done a lot of theater and I think they were interested in the project itself. So I don't know that it was, it was difficult for them to play somebody who, um, it was espousing of view that was different from their own. I don't think that it was, I think that they were, I think they were intrigued to be part of a, of a bigger story, you know? And I think that's what we've found with, with our entire cast. And they were there because they really believed in the film. Cool. All right. Thank you.

Speaker 7:          21:06          Hi, I'm so, I also saw the movie on Monday and was just incredibly moved. So thank you so much for, you know, bringing this important story to the big screen. It means the world. Um, Julianne, I wanted to ask, this is I think your fifth time portraying a queer woman in a movie

Speaker 4:          21:27          and you've even,

Speaker 7:          21:32          and I think that's super awesome and interesting. And I just wanted to ask you how your identity as an ally has kind of evolved, you know, through the process of portraying queer women.

Speaker 3:          21:42          Well, um, you know

Speaker 4:          21:48          what

Speaker 3:          21:49          I always say is that it's interesting that that the, my Rez, I've made like 60 something movies, right? And so, um, and, and of all the characters I've played, so I played maybe if, you know, five gay characters or whatever, but that's not even the, the percentage of the population that is gay. So it's always interesting to me or so we know, we don't even really know. Um, that's according to a report that was given from the 50s. So, um, so it's interesting, probably accurate.

Speaker 4:          22:18          That's, yeah. No, but I think is not accurate. I think there's probably more of this what I'm saying under, Oh yeah. But anyway, I

Speaker 3:          22:29          interesting to me that so many people in media will point that out to me all, I played so many characters and I'm like, I don't even think, yeah, I just don't, I'm just, I don't, I don't even find that notable because for, for me, every time I've been attracted to a character, it's just because of who they are and their sexuality has been, um, beside the point. But that being said, it is interesting that every time I am talking about something, I ended up kind of in the, in the middle of LGBT, um, discussions and politics and, and you can't help but evolve when you are exposed to, um, to so many discussions and so many personalizations to people saying what, you know, what kind of skirmishes they've, they've experienced and their difficulties and what it's like to be, um, to be out or to be closeted or whatever. So I do. I do think it has grown my awareness and hopefully, um, my compassion and made me a better ally. Awesome. Thank you. Um, thank you guys so much for being here. We appreciate it,

Speaker 4:          23:27          Huh? The end.

Speaker 5:          23:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          23:37          right now. So thank you guys so much and go see it. Thank you. Thank you. Hi.
