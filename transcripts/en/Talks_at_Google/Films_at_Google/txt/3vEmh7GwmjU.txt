Speaker 1:          00:11          Uh, pregnant women smell soul. Wonderful.

Speaker 2:          00:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20          I'm actually doing a piece on motherhood. Really? Did you know embryonic fluid is actually urine? Let's open that wine. We're having a baby too. Yeah. How far along are you? I'm not actually pregnant. We have a surrogate. I'm Kiki and Wayne and Tina's baby surrogate mom. Did you screwed? Sorry again. Whoa. I think Donna's boning someone else. Okay. Suppose he is. They care. Of course I care. There are five phases of a woman's life. I am in phase four. You have to be a mother. If government and businesses are going to devalue women's work and make motherhood economically unfeasible, why not outsource it? See, this is why people hate liberals. Huh? I made fresh orange juice for Karen. Folic acid. Tina is like a sperm donor. I'm so not like a sperm donor. God, I feel so bad. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:40          Let's welcome to the stage at least Reiner, David Allen face and Madeline didn't know. No, just to get things started. We celebrated International Women's Day on Friday. Did anyone do anything exciting and celebration? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:52          I wish shooting actually. But, um, at the end of the day live in, I made a video. We, I work a lot with equality now, which is another amazing organization. And they asked a lot of different women to make a video about what freedom means to them. And I wanted to wait and do it with live. So, so if you check my Instagram, yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:14          Freedom means to me. Yeah. That's excellent.

Speaker 5:          02:18          And we just did so many corporate presentations. We did a really large global presentation for Sony, for all the divisions of Sony. Okay. And then the day before I did a big presentation for a Carew, which is the children's advertising and online, um, organization. So it was a busy presentation week. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:38          Yeah, I would imagine it's kind of peak season for you guys. So that's wonderful. Um, I actually took the day off of work I not specifically for when I was my father's birthday, but I'm, I got to see him spend some quality time with his grand daughters, which was incredible. Um, so great. So we are here to talk about this amazing film egg. Um, and as I said before, I've watched it a few times and every time I'm catching more and more of the complexity of the characters and the nuances of, um, really both what it means to be a woman and what it means when we consider or find ourselves faced with or decide not to move forward with motherhood. Um, but also what it means to all of those around us. Um, so you know, how our partners perceive it. How are, um, you know, former friends from different parts of our lives perceive our roles. Um, and there's really just a ton to unpack there. But I'd love to hear from Alicia, David, kind of what brought you to this project very quickly.

Speaker 4:          03:36          Okay. We did a reading of it almost 10 years ago and I felt when we did this reading that it's spoke to things, the character said things that I've always thought, but I had been afraid to say and I loved it so much. And at that time it was, they were considering it for the stage and, um, and I just was like, oh my God, I want to do this. I want to do this. And then I got really busy, like first of all, making an actual human being, but then also on orange is the new black and all these other shows. And two summers ago we were on a ferry boat from fire island. And I only bring that up because it was from the town of Kismet. So it was actually kismet. Um, and we bumped into the writer and she said, I just did a rewrite on the screenplay version of it.

Speaker 4:          04:31          Would you like to read it? We were like, yes. And I felt more than ever it was these things that no one was talking about, about the relationship between work and art and commerce and parenthood and career and friendship. And you know, I was talking to someone recently about how we're changing so much in reference to gender norms and how we talk about gender and yet we haven't made those changes around parenthood and how we talk about the roles of parenthood and we have such an antiquated version of what a mother and a father is. And it just hasn't caught up to our world today. And I wanted to bring up some of those issues. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          05:29          It had stuck with us. I mean, yeah, it was, we were actors by trade. We both make a living as actors, which is great. Um, you know, Alicia, Alicia and another partner produced the Wall Street, uh, the female driven Wall Street movie called equity. And, um, yeah, I had just finished five years on a Sitcom and I thought I had a break and Alicia said, hey, you're going to produce this with us, um, you get to be the associate producer. And I said, what the hell is that? Um, it turns out that he runs around putting out all the fires. Right. I learned that. And then, um, uh, you know, we really weren't necessarily sure we want it to produce anything again, but then we met the writer on the ferry and there was egg again and we said, Oh man, it's, it's so good. And I as a man, I love the male characters in it. I love what the male characters have to say. I, you know, I, I've, I was excited about it. Um, even if, uh, you know, even if it's quote unquote female driven content, you know, uh, I was all in. So when something sticks with you like that, you know, you've got to do it.

Speaker 4:          06:27          Yeah. It's interesting to hear that it was like a multi year process. So just kind of sticking until it finds its final form. And I'll also say for me, I like as a producer, I need to, I don't produce something unless I feel like it needs a voice. You know, there's a lot of stories that I'll read and I'll be like, that's amazing. But I know so I know this will get produced. Like I know someone will do this. This is one of those where I was like, I feel like too many people would be afraid to make this movie and I wanted to be the one who wasn't afraid to make this movie. We're glad you did. That actually is a great segway. Mallon, I would love to hear, um, you know, from, from the Lens of the Gina Davis Institute, why was this film so important to, to your mission? Building off what Alicia is saying is that there was probably a lot of people who would pass on this because it's not something that is obvious to be spoken about. And why is that just even more important to be spoken about?

Speaker 5:          07:26          It's important in terms of onscreen behind the camera, which I'd love for Alicia and David to talk about it. And you know, there's a social imperative. So how do we take these kind of societal norms and turned them upside down, um, which they did, you know, beautifully. But from a business imperative, we just did a benchmark study, which looked at 10 years of films, family films, g, PG, PG 13. And what we found is over the past decade, female centric films generated 55% more at the box office. And that change happened in 2016 where female centric films generated 70% more at the box office. And in 2017 it was 38% more through box office. So it's, there's the social imperative, which we're talking about, but there's the business imperative. So it's, it's really, really important. But yet, even still female lead characters, there's still a two to one ratio of male characters to female characters. So that's not what happened in the case of a egg. Um, so it's really important. And then I'd love to throw to you to talk about behind the camera. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          08:41          Mm. So, um, our third partner on this, Michelle gainless who was the president of comedy central on who had left in, was looking into producing her own stuff and who has now started a great production company as well. Um, this was her first piece, you know, off of comedy central. And the thing that I loved about Michelle from the get go, or we loved about Michelle from the get go, was that she was equally committed to hiring all women across the board. So we hired all female heads of every single department. So we have a female, for example, a female writer, female director, a female cinematographer. And I love to talk about her because she had never shot a feature. Not because she wasn't insanely talented, but because no one had given her the opportunity. And I saw a short, she did in Africa with children and a leopard and they say like the two things you should never do or work with animals and children.

Speaker 4:          09:46          And she did this Spec Tech. I mean the film is spectacularly beautiful, but this was her first feature and now she's shot like three more in the past two years. And female sound design, female sound design, female set designer, rube or job had female camera, camera op. Yeah, everything. So, um, editor. So we did all female heads of all departments and then 70% female crew. And that felt amazing. And yes, the women made as much if not more than the men. Um, and it felt amazing. And one of the things that I love to say is there was way less drama than any other set I've ever been on. You know, if we like have that, the gender norms of like women are dramatic and throw a hissy fit, whatever did not happen, there was no drama. Um, we finished our days on time or early every day and we were shooting sometimes like eight pages a day.

Speaker 4:          10:51          Um, and it was an incredible experience and I think my favorite part was the emails from women and young women who this was their first job on a set and they wrote to us afterwards and said like, I've been on a couple of sets in, it's not like egg. Even our production designer recently wrote us and she's like, I still haven't had another experience like egg. And they said, I haven't like other sets weren't like this, but you gave me hope and you made me feel like I can create that in the future. Like when I'm the boss, I'm going to do that and I'm going to hire more women. And that's really why I'm sitting up here with this woman is because way before I made this movie, before I made movies, she inspired me in the Gina Davis Institute inspired me about if you can see it, you can be it both onscreen and off. And that is so deeply important. I'll never forget when I first heard this statistic of when you watch

Speaker 3:          11:54          anything, even a cartoon, 77% of the characters are male, which means any girl watching any media feels like she's a minority. Like that's a ridiculous concept. Women are up 50% of the population, but no matter what they're watching it, when they're watching any screen, they feel like a minority.

Speaker 5:          12:15          And just to add some context to that, our friends had common sense media, uh, do a lot of analyses on a media consumption. So your average tween in the United States is engaging and watching media upwards of six hours a day. And teens are still engaging with media and watching about nine hours a day. It's more than sleeping school, anything else they're doing. So when you think about media impressions and you think about the repetitiveness and how it's being reinforced, they're seeing that, uh, stereotyped media image over and over and over. And it does make an impact on how they view the world, how they view each other. So it's very significant.

Speaker 3:          13:01          Actually, it's a question for you on that because we were talking earlier, I feel like I'm starting to see more female leads, more female driven. We're starting to see a lot of female superhero movies. Is this the case of being hungry and seeing signs for food all the time? Or are we really seeing a shift in the industry?

Speaker 5:          13:19          Well, in terms of this benchmark study that we just did, you know, unfortunately 10 years later it's still a two to one ratio of male carer, male leads, you know, to female leads and women are 52% of movie going audience and we're 51% of the population. So we're not really being represented. And when we talk about people of Color, people of color are 38% of the US population. But in terms of the past decade of film there solely 16.7% and then if you really want to get into the intersectionality of it, which is an a really important conversation, uh, people with disabilities, people who identify as Lgbtq are less than 1% of any character in a film over the past 10 years. The top 100 films from the United States. So we have a lot of work to do.

Speaker 3:          14:17          I'm glad you guys are doing the work. Uh, there's another interesting facet to, um, the film where a Alicia, your character, Tina, is financially leading the partnership. It comes up in a way, um, in a couple of different conversations that she is, um, you know, leading the highest household from a contribute contribution perspective. Um, she's spun as kind of, you know, not being woman enough or not being nurturing enough. And when you compare that with, um, Kiki's who is very needy and very dependent, um, and you know, the men, sorry, David or like tripping over themselves to take care of her. Um, talk about that a little bit about that storyline. I think you should talk about that. Yeah, talk about it.

Speaker 6:          15:07          I think, I believe the line in the, in the uh, film where, um, Tina Alicia's character says is accused of not being nurturing and kind of comparing the women in the room and she says, I'm not nurturing. And just look at, look at her. She's a fucking train wreck. Right? And the power of the powerless woman, no man can resist. Hmm.

Speaker 4:          15:28          Right. And I, and additionally, I, my character, you, you find out in that moment is supporting her husband is, you know, and like how is that not nurturing? And she says, look, I support you wanted to do this. I, I supported that. You want to do this. That's where did that you want to do this? They supported that.

Speaker 6:          15:50          It's never enough. It's never enough. That's, and that's an interesting thing. Um, and it is, it is fascinating to see, uh, the shift in, in society. You know, um, we were talking about this earlier or from, you know, women who are breadwinners in their family and make more money than their husbands do. Um, and in this case, I think it was one of the things I really liked about the film and I read it, uh, even before we made it was a dawn. My character a is, you know, very happy to be the wealthiest person in the room. He's fairly certain of that even though none of us know anything about anyone. Right. But he makes that assumption and a is a perfectly fine with that. And that gives him power over people, especially over women. And so it's a very interesting thing to see the when, when a woman is an artist, um, self assured, um, financially stable, I'm financial independent and speaks her mind.

Speaker 6:          16:44          You know, it's fascinating to hear what people have had to say about, about that character in the film. Yeah. And, and I like that. I and I, dawn judges everyone in the room, um, and we're all judging everyone all the time, but yeah, a little more. So that's what makes it fun. Um, and uh, and dawn gives voice to some of the stereotypical misogyny that we're hearing all the time. And, and I don't like him, but I liked the chance to, to do that so that people will go, oh, or people will go, oh, he didn't just say that. Did he just say that? Yeah. You were a lot of audible groan when, when I get very happy about those. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          17:26          I have to just knowing you, I was, I mean, it was making me laugh at every turn because it was so antithetical to who you are, but it was, it's almost like, and because it takes place in, in this loft, throughout the film, mostly in this main area, you kind of get this insular feeling of almost being in somebody's head and you have all the different judgments or different aspects of, of what could be firing off. And there's a tremendous amount of judgment and it's coming across both genders and it's coming across, um, different parenting decisions. And, um, it really to that. And I'm curious, did you guys have to let go of any of your preconceived notions coming into this film in order to portray these characters? Like how was that for you

Speaker 4:          18:14          to see one, you know, um,

Speaker 6:          18:18          I mean, yes. I mean, yes, right. We owe, as the actors, we always do because we're not, unless we're playing ourselves, then yeah, then we have our own preconceived notions. But character, the characters that you inhabit always have preconceived notions. Sometimes that's your way. And sometimes the, I mean, with Donna Asleep, he's such a judgmental asshole that I was like, God got it. Got It. Yeah, no, that guy. Yeah, we all know that guy. But we may work with some of them. May I probably not here, not here at Google. Um, but we've, we all know those guys. And um, uh, I had, yeah, I mean, and honestly I was on, again, I was on a set that was 70% female and, and fairly invisible unless I was in front of the camera and they don't, and that's not a criticism, it's not a complaint. Um, and I, so I had to set aside my preconceived notion of, Oh, well, I'm, I'm a man and I'm producing a movie and I'm one of the big bosses.

Speaker 6:          19:12          Oh no, but he's going to come on now, let's do, do what I say to do. What up dude, go on, fall in line. Um, not that, not that I was ever that guy, but, uh, I was in a room full of smart women and that things are getting taken care of. And I was kind of like, it's okay if, if I don't have to, you know, at least we're talking about drama. Like I don't have to yell. I don't have to be typically male or loud or to get things done. They seem to be happening just fine and it's okay if I'm not seeing it's because there's no problems, no fire to put out. Like, so I had to kind of adjust what I thought my role was going to be as producer in that way. Right.

Speaker 3:          19:46          What does that change the dynamic of the set and the dynamic of the relationships? Was that palpable too as well from previous films you've been? Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          19:56          Oh for sure. Yeah. You know, um, I love that you brought that up because for me as an actor, as an actor playing Tina, like Tina has a lot more preconceived notions and judgment and um, her way of doing things than I do. Like, I think as a human being, one of my biggest goals is to sort of strip away as many biases as I can. Cause that makes me a more open artist and more able to play the widest variety. It also makes life more interesting. I'm just much more, I find life much more fun if you're really willing to listen and wonder, you know, our production company company is called to wonder fold to be limited like two people full of wonder. And my biggest goal is I grow and age is to keep wondering. Like I feel like people tend to get more and more narrow and they hang on to their beliefs more and more as they age where a small humans like are much more like I wonder, oh I don't know. And I want to stay like that wonder place as long as possible. And I think Tina feels like she knows things a lot more than I do. But um, in reference to the dynamic of the sat, it was very surprising I think to everyone. And I didn't realize what a white male I was married to until we were,

Speaker 3:          21:33          and this dynamic cause by the way they're married. Yeah. It's a really like

Speaker 4:          21:38          evolved feminist white male. But you put him in a room with a lot of powerful women and he's still a white man and he still can fall. Like we all as women can fall into seeing him as such and he still can fall into those, um, stereotypical roles. You know, like we all, we all fall into our roles sometimes on an off camera without realizing it. Yup.

Speaker 3:          22:09          Actually, let's, um, let's roll. Uh, we have a couple of quips. The throw the first clip here,

Speaker 1:          22:15          I forgot. I'm, I'm not, not actually pregnant. We have a surrogate mother.

Speaker 7:          22:21          Oh, oh, oh, wow. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:26          Oh, a surrogate. Yeah. We know a gay couple of weeks at that. Yeah. The guy who did our a window treatments. Did you have to go through all that awful IVF fertility? Snow? Well that's good. Yeah. No I can't. I mean we can, this was more of an option. Okay.

Speaker 7:          22:43          Uh,

Speaker 1:          22:45          sort of a utopian pregnancy, utopian pregnancy. It's sort of a dismantling and restructuring of the traditional family unit. A redistribution of roles to a more shared economy kind of thing. I, you're the first people we've told, we don't really have the wrap down yet. So you can have the baby yourself, right? Yes. I, we can we choose not to. You're paying someone to have the baby for you. Yeah. Perfect.

Speaker 3:          23:21          I love, I love this clip because you come up with the notion of language and you're like, we don't have the wrap down yet. And I think this is something that,

Speaker 4:          23:30          you know, we all,

Speaker 3:          23:32          we all have these judgements. We all have these opinions that we bring with us into certainly family dynamics and this assumption of how things should be or how they can roll off the tongue or not. And when we tend to go outside lines with what

Speaker 4:          23:46          we expect, that's where we really start to get tongue tied. Um, and that's why I love the vulnerability of showcasing your character. Just working through that with exactly the judgments that you would expect. What, why, what, you know, talk to me a little bit about the importance of that language language. Such an interesting thing. And as an artist, there are some writers, for example, who are very specific about language. You know, Aaron Sorkin doesn't want you to change a single word or a period period. Um, and other writers are much more open, reset. Our writer, and this was somewhat open, but interestingly enough, our director didn't want us to change a word. She's like, she felt, and she's, she's written and directed things. And in this case she was just the director and she felt that the writing was so purse precise that she didn't want us to change a thing.

Speaker 4:          24:52          And she didn't want us to Improv a lot, but she wanted it to feel like Improv. So that moment that you just saw, even though I'm floundering for the words, that's actually, that was all written as such and language in our culture. I think we are in this moment where we don't have language for a lot of what's going on in the world and we're creating new language. You know, um, when I was growing up, there was no such thing as gender fluid and nonbinary. And we have a 10 year old and that is such, it just is for her. And that's, um, and that's such a beautiful, miraculous thing because we as a culture are evolving. But this, as I said earlier, like the way we handled parent roles has not of hall like were my daughter knows how to describe her gender fluidity so much better than we as a culture know how to describe parenthood.

Speaker 4:          26:00          And that's to me a problem, you know, and part of what we were looking to delve into, and sometimes it's my deepest tube, why I'm an artist, is that we can express these things and delve into them and art as a way to bring up conversation to then move our society forward. And I think you were alluding to that too, and I'm thinking back to you guys on the boat of this being a story that some people would shy away from because it does unpack those things and you can even see the characters questioning themselves. Am I happy? Is this what I wanted? Was that decision, the right decision for me? And, um, you know, it's, it's just very human that grappling and I think we don't see so much of that.

Speaker 3:          26:44          I mean, certainly Madeline within the industry where there's a lot of glamor and Shane to everything, we don't see the characters really crumble as much on these definitive parts of their lives. Do you have any thoughts on that? Well, when we look at, um,

Speaker 5:          27:00          attributes and careers, only 15% of female characters in TV and film. And this is from our 2018 data, which we haven't published yet, are shown working. Mm hmm. Um, and then 15, 15% just showing, you know, working. Um, and when you look at also the ageism of it, which is another thing, um, in the movie, um, you know, most female characters are shown in their teens. Most of them are shown under 19, only 30% are shown in their forties and only 3% in their fifties. And, and so when you think about motherhood and women having children at an older age, that's not something that's really being reflected, you know, in, you know, in the media. Um, and then when you think about Kinda the caretaking of it, uh, there's very few men depicted as um, caretaking and when they are, you see a lot of the bumbling yes, you know, this silly lazy, bumbling dad and, and we know from our friends at Promundo, but I happened to sit on their board that, you know, changing the dynamics of masculinity and really reflecting that in the media is important because most American fathers want to spend more time.

Speaker 5:          28:23          I think it's nearly 70% want to spend more time with their children and that's their data, not our data. So you know, media is not really keeping up with how our society is changing. Yes. Preaching to the choir, you percent of the dads want to be doing, by the way. Yeah. Well what we've done, well, it's funny, when we did an average, a study on gender bias and advertising, a 48% of the female characters in ads will most likely to be in the kitchen. And the men were at sporting events and driving around in cars. So that's where they were driving around what they're doing. Yeah. We'll get there.

Speaker 3:          29:07          Uh, we have one, one more. Click ahead. Equip number two.

Speaker 1:          29:11          I can see why you guys chose her. Oh, shut up. I'll get you something to put on. Hi, I'm Kiki. I'm Wayne and Tina's baby surrogate mom. I'm Karen. You're pregnant too, right? Oh No, I'm not pregnant. I'm kidding. Oh good. It's always so horrible when you ask someone if they're pregnant and then it just turns out that they're just, you know, fat. Oh, well I'm pregnant and fat. Oh God, no, no, no. I didn't mean that. You're, uh, I know. I mean, obviously you're pregnant. Doesn't she look wonderful? You have such a rosy cheeks here. Oh, thank you.

Speaker 3:          29:54          Awkward. So awkward, but also so relatable. Um, and I just, I think there's so much packed into that one exchange, whether it's, you know, the, the body shaming hypersexualization of Kiki and then there's the, you know, the, the question around is she pregnant or is she fat and why does it matter? And why is this a public thing? When women are carrying that, then it's all they can talk to you about. You know, there's so much packed into that one exchange. Tell us, tell us about the scene.

Speaker 4:          30:26          It's funny. Um, I was, I did a an evening, Liz, I'm totally going off on a tangent because everyone's going to watch the movie. Watched it already, right? That's right. Oh Man. I don't want to like give anything away, but I did a with time's up. I produced an evening, uh, about Rebecca Traister is book or inspired by Rebecca's chasers book, good and mad, which all of you should read. It's really the history of rage and female rage and anger. And I did it honestly because I'm afraid of my own anger. I'm afraid of anger. And so when I, in that wondering way, when I find something that I'm afraid of and that makes me have a pit in my stomach, I'm like, go towards that and go explore it. So we did this evening and we had a lot of different women find a passage about rage are raging to express.

Speaker 4:          31:22          And so we had a comedian who I love because, um, she's a woman obviously. She, uh, is disabled and she is Muslim. And so she, like, she is one of the most amazing women I know. And she does a comedy bit about being pregnant and about how you never should ask anyone if they're pregnant ever because, or parents because people will tell you like they will show you the baby pictures before you can even ask. So you never even, and it's not even just pregnant, it's parenthood because we assume that all women want to be parents. And that's a really big topic of this movie is not all women want to be parents. Not all men want to be parents. And that's okay. A woman is enough whether she's a mother or not, she's more than enough and that we've created this standard and this norm that is completely inappropriate and lets go of any choice for women. And that's what enraged me about it. And it was another thing that made me really want to make movie is I want women to have free, all women's have freedom of choice in a full and complete way. Um, so that's uh, you know, for me with that, oh, mint is about, yeah. Yeah. I think it's interesting how you see the characters evolve from,

Speaker 3:          32:57          you know, pushing each other to each other's edge and then really coming to each other's rescue at the same time. And I think there's a lot, there's obviously the, the motherhood and parenthood, um, topic, but there's a lot to feminine relationships that's explored as well. And I found that really,

Speaker 4:          33:14          really powerful. I mean, that's my favorite thing about the movie is these two women, you know, Kiki aside sort of who are old friends and really believed Dee bleed different things, have made different choices, but are willing to lovingly accept and listen to each other as choices without making the other make the same choice. And that to me is what true, authentic friendship is about. And it was another reason why this was so deeply important for me to make as a filmmaker in this moment because it was, we read the script in like October. Um, the man people call president, uh, became president in January. And I met Christina at the women's March, um, and it, which was the weekend of the inauguration and I found out that she was childless by choice. And I thought, wow, how interesting to make this movie in this moment when women feel like an endangered species.

Speaker 4:          34:31          And additionally, when 53% of white women voted for that human being, um, it's a little bit of a Baltimore thing for me. Um, I, um, I, I realized I wanted to also make art about people listening to each other, even if they didn't believe the same thing. And that's incredibly important to me in this moment. Learning how to listen without judgment or even if you're judging, shut the fuck up and try and really listen and learn something and ask as many questions and try and really open up your heart to what's, what can I relate to here? What can I possibly relate to here? And I think these two women do a really magical job of that. Um, and that to me is what the, the story, the core of the story became. And it wasn't what, I didn't know that that's what it really was deeply, most deeply about until the editing room. Really. Um, but in watching the edit it was like, oh, it's really about being willing to listen and support even if you don't necessarily believe the same thing. Yeah, I think that definitely came through. And in particular, uh, the scenes with just the two of them, then it's very strong. I'm curious your take on that clip we just watched in terms of what you saw there from your [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          36:01          Well, there's a few things. There's one clip that was in the, a little bit of it in the trailer where Kiki talks about kind of the five phases of being a woman. And uh, the second phase is boobs, teens. And she talks about that's when you have your most power. But I'm in the fourth phase and I have to be, you know, just a mother. And then there's the other scene where you first see Kiki and you completely see her, you know, sexually objectified. And, and so when I think about that and I think about some of our new data, you know, female characters are six times more likely to be hypersexualized and five times more likely to be verbally objectified. And I thought, you know, and maybe you can just talk about it, but there's scenes in the movie that do it with such great humor, um, and kind of, you know, point, fun added. But truly that's what we're seeing, you know, in our, in all of our, you know, family films. So I don't know if you want to,

Speaker 4:          36:59          yeah, it definitely was taking a ribbing at it. Um, and that, that five phases, I'm obsessed with that five phases. You have to watch them. One of the most brilliant things I've ever read, or an Anna camp does a genius job of it. And she, I love that character so much because she really, she's kind of doing it to herself. Like she, her choices as a human being, the characters traces as a human being are so fascinating and the patterns she's going into and without, you know, ruining too much. But she's in a relationship with a married man and, um, these, these patterns that we fall into and her choice of what she wears, you know, which is written into, into the script. And we just followed that, that lead that in a, in a way she is choosing this s stereotype, um, and this, um, paradigm of what a woman is. And it's the diametric opposite to what Tina is because Tina's really interested in sort of breaking all those stereotypes. And then Wayne's in between trying to sort of navigate these two women, which is, that makes it all, and that's a very complex part of it too, because each character. Dot. David said earlier about Don, like we all know that guy eats character. We all know that character, right? There's someone in our

Speaker 3:          38:35          lives where there was a time in our lives where we felt like we subscribed to very similar paradigms. So I definitely feel like there's that, that sense of, um, identification that you can have through, through each of those characters.

Speaker 6:          38:51          There's also every dinner party, we've all ever been to gone wrong. And, and usually, I mean, I think we've all been to those dinner parties where someone says something a little bit off and most eyes just kind of go to the plate or someone gets an elbow under the table or a kick and that's, and that's it. Right? And then you just rip it apart on the way home. Right, right. Like on the subway ride home. I can't believe she said that. I want, I know what's her problem was she had a ride to work a day in her life. So she's apoe and he's probably right. And we all do that. And so, but we do it there. Yeah, we don't do it in the ride home. We, we do it there. Right. It's like we're at the table and someone says, why would you say that to me?

Speaker 6:          39:24          The other person says, well, because I think your acts and the person says you don't know me. I'm not. Why would you say that? Like this is an idea of how we want to live our lives on. The person says, well, I don't agree with that. So it's, it's we get to live out that dinner party fantasy that we've all had of like, yeah, wouldn't it be great if you could just tell him like, nobody likes to hear you talk about x, Y, z. We don't give a shit and you know, you don't seem to care about people and what, like it's that dinner party thing that I think, uh, you know, that we've all wanted to talk about and uh, with subjects that we've all wanted to talk about but are a little bit afraid to, like Alicia said earlier, are very afraid to.

Speaker 6:          39:58          Um, and I think that's part of, I hope that's part of what happens in the film. We've been hearing from a lot of people that have seen it, that, you know, they, they have questions, they want to talk. Why did we do it this way? Why do we do it that, you know, and that's great. That's what we want. It's not a, you know, you don't watch it and be like, yeah, pretty little bow. It's not one of those paintings. And a lot of people have said that. I went back and watched it a bunch of times and every time it's different. Nice. See different things in. That's really exciting and rewarding.

Speaker 3:          40:26          Well, there's a moment, there's a moment, there's a scene where as David's describing, it's uncomfortable. It's almost like, I think this way sometimes when you watch Ben Stiller's comedies like you, you're like, no, don't, don't, don't do that. You know, it's uncomfortable to watch because it puts you in that position where you feel that vulnerability of sharing something that you normally would just keep to yourself or share with your partner in the way home. Um, but there's one scene where there's a question that comes out and David, your character, dawn, just goes, well, that's a little personal and we're talking about the most personnel things ever. But there's that, that dry humor to it.

Speaker 6:          41:03          It was a question about money. Oh, right, right, right. Does your boyfriend pay your rent? Like why do you have to move out of your apartment? Oh, right. We've just talked about her uterus or life or relationship or, yeah. Or identity as a woman. And then I say, someone says, well, why do you have to, to the apartment? And I said, well that's a little personal. We all just get along. Again,

Speaker 3:          41:19          that unfolds. A whole other thing is a whole other, thinking back to your last project with equity, well not one on one of your past projects with equity is just the comfort around women and money and certainly women and money as portrayed in media. Um, and we, we talked a little bit about, uh, you know, breadwinning women and primary earning women who are 42% of our nation. Um, and you know, we're not seeing that showcased on screen anywhere. We're not seeing that pride and we're not seeing that kind of expert. Yes, I love it. Yeah. So that's a great segue. What's, what's up next for you guys that you're able to share?

Speaker 6:          41:57          Is there a pardon your next project for me. That's great.

Speaker 4:          42:00          No, there were no men in it. Right now I'm shooting the Deuce, which is so much fun. Oh my God. Where it last season was season two. We, we shot in the, it was the seventies and now in season three, it's the 80s in New York and items, the writing is so genius and I'm so, so, so enjoying it and, um, better things, which I'm also on, just started airing like two weeks ago, I think this week. Sharon Stone is our guest star wars. Oh, that's terrific. A gorgeous scene with her. She was such a joy to work with. Um, and um,

Speaker 6:          42:38          just to keep things even I'm going across.

Speaker 4:          42:44          Um, and we just wrapped season seven of orange and they never tell us when that's going to be out. But my guess is some are, but don't quote me. That could be a lie. And this is the F is this the final, final season? That's for sure. That's for sure. And um, I've definitely been mourning that a little bit, but how does that feel? That's a, uh, that's a light hurts. You know, it, I'll miss the character because she was so extraordinary. And this season is quite epic in its, um, social commentary on what's going on in the world right now. Um, I'm really proud to be part of this season for that map, for that, for that reason. Um, and, but more than anything, I'll miss the people because there are some mixed, spectacular humans both behind and in front of the camera who made that all happen. And I will love them forever and I'll see them forever, but I won't see them as much. Yeah. Not behind bars. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hopefully not. I mean, we never know. Who knows. She still

Speaker 3:          43:52          curious. Yeah. David, what's up next for you?

Speaker 6:          43:56          Uh, if Alicia hires me and our next project, then I'll tell you what that is. We get there. I just did a show on CBS called instinct. Okay. Fun. And uh, yeah, trying to get a job and, and being a hands on dad, that's the most important job I'm very proud of. And Alicia is a hands on mom, but she's been a lot busier than I have, especially since it came out. Yeah. So, uh, yeah, I'm doing the laundry and the dishes and being a dad and, and your building tree forts.

Speaker 4:          44:24          Yeah, we did. We did build a tree house to were power tools involved. So yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          44:27          You Bet. More stereotypic. Yeah. But yeah. Big shoes to fill. Yeah. I don't want to let, what is your season look like coming up with?

Speaker 5:          44:35          We've, uh, we have a really rich research year. We're just about to published the next iteration of what we call the Gdiq, which was generously funded by google.org. It stands for the Gina Davis Inclusion quotient and it's a machine learning tool that automates gender screen and speaking time and actually race for screen time using audio and facial recognition. So, um, we have, we're really rich partnership with Google, so we're really grateful for that. And this year we're releasing not only film, which we have done, but also TV. Uh, so that's been really important for us to, uh, to evolve the Gdi Queue. So that's coming out soon for us. And then as I mentioned, we're partnering, uh, with Pomono on a masculinity study. We're also partnering, partnering with Plan International on a study about girl's relationship to leadership. So we have a lot of really interesting research projects coming out. And then we also are commissioned to do a lot of research. So we've done a lot of research for leading brands, uh, content creators, studios. So behind the scenes, a lot of people want to know how they're doing and so will also conduct a lot of research that way.

Speaker 3:          45:52          So important. I'm so glad to hear it. We are a data driven company here at Google and I think the more you have data telling a story, while it may not be the story we all want to hear, it's telling a certain story and only then can you start to see action and start to measure the progress. What's very, very important work that you're doing. I'm thrilled that we're finding ways to partner together on that initiative. Um, so

Speaker 4:          46:14          egg is available on Amazon and iTunes and video on demand

Um, so thank you all so much with such a great conversation and really looking forward to more success to come.

Speaker 5:          47:26          Thank you. Bye.
