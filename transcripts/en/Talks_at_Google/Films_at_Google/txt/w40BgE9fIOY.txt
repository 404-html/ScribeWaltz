Speaker 1:          00:08          So thank you for taking the time to come visit Google and, uh, we're all just going to kick off with that. You were returning from the first film, Bad moms. I'm not fitting and Christmas is approaching in this film. So where do we find each of your characters?

Speaker 2:          00:25          Okay, wow.

Speaker 3:          00:27          Oh, I'll start. Well, Kiki has much repaired her relationship with Ken. I'll say that. Uh, she stood up for herself, which a lot of times when you stand up for yourself, you sort of set new boundaries and new dynamics in your life, which she's done. Kent helps out a lot at home. Uh, he is no longer a never heard if you know what I mean? So she has a thriving sex life and uh, she's still friends with both these girls. But I think as life ebbs and flows, you go through waves where, you know, the moms felt like they took a part of their life back, but Christmas and the holidays are approaching and they feel like it's just slipping away. All that control.

Speaker 2:          01:08          That's where, Yup. I love it.

Speaker 4:          01:13          So good. Amy, where's Amy? So, hmm. She isn't a relationship. Spoiler alert with, um, with the J. Yeah, Jesse, that's his name. And uh,

Speaker 1:          01:25          that's right. Jay Hernandez. Slash Jesse.

Speaker 4:          01:28          Um, and, and is it a very happy place in her life? She, it has filed for divorce. Everything's great. And uh, you know, her, her mother, her mother comes into town and throws her in for a loop of spiraling out of control and feeling like she's never good enough and that nothing she ever does is good enough and a feeling the pressure to be as perfect as her mother while having these wonderful women, it try to help themselves and her, uh, be strong and powerful and go against the system of Christmas.

Speaker 2:          02:04          Oh,

Speaker 1:          02:05          well, uh, I, uh, uh, Carla, Carla and a Mimosa. Um, uh, Carla is trying, you know, I think if from the last movie, I think his is, is trying on a modicum of thank you. Um, some responsibility in her life. She has a job now, I think she took, she works at, she's an aesthetician and all that that entails at a spa. And so I think, you know, she's trying to have some, a little bit of responsibility. It's just her and her boy. And then, yeah, mom walks in who I haven't seen in years and years. I don't think Christmas in their family was ever, uh, you know, sell a really stolen, really care. Um, yeah. So I think that's where you see her. I was trying to, I think she's trying to have a little bit of responsibility and trying to enjoy these last couple of years with her boy before he goes away to school or wherever or, you know, who is she kidding? He's never leaving her home. Well, this film was directed by John Lucas and Scott Moore, the duo best known for the hangover films. How much were you able to influence the script this time around?

Speaker 5:          03:17          Uh,

Speaker 4:          03:20          I would say yeah, a lot. Um, he was a really nice collaboration. Kind of hate the sound of my voice. I'm sorry guys. Uh, it was, uh, it was all done very quickly. Uh, between the time of, yes, let's do a sequel to, let's shoot the sequence. Who'd would coming out? It's probably been nine months total. And so the guys had a short period of time to write the script in. Um, I would say all in all a pretty good amount of influence, as much as, as they were willing to listen to me talk and talking, talking to rewrites and notes with them. But they're so great and so inclusive and I think they wanted it to be as good, if not better as the first one. And so they were more than willing to sit down and talk to anybody who is willing to, to give them notes.

Speaker 1:          04:03          We were so excited when we heard the, at least I was when I heard the idea of like where the SQL would be sad or what time of the year because there really isn't another period where, you know, Mama's in particular are so expected to make magic happen for everybody else in their, in their lives. And it's like, you know, the current, you know, behind the curtain, she's sweating and miserable. And then there's like an innate comedy timeline of Christmas Eve. You know, it's like inherently you have to try to get to, there's a countdown. So like, you know, comedy wise, we knew and it, you know, it's, it's such a crazy, crazy pressure in for no reason where it should just be, um, you know, this magic time with everybody. And of course it should be fun and it should be fun. And it gets so, and it's earlier and earlier, clearly, I mean, it's October, but it's so clearly earlier and earlier in my Christmas list already, and I've started shopping. I know I start now.

Speaker 3:          05:01          Yeah, I really do. But then by thanksgiving I don't have any Christmas shopping.

Speaker 1:          05:08          I'm done. Yeah. Well, your mother's are played by award winning. Susan Surandon, Kristin brand ski and Cheryl Hines. Did any of you have a role in casting your onscreen moms? Yes. Yes. Yeah. So you were just like, let me think of who I want. And yes,

Speaker 3:          05:25          they were like, but that's, and then they were like, yeah, sure. Write them a letter and you're like, okay. And people respond. It's kind of crazy. So smooth. The directors are very confident, but also like, they're resigned. They're not like gigantic personalities, the jump into a room, but they're confident enough to know that they take all advice and all ideas and they use the ones they like and there's, there's just something sort of beautiful about that. So they listened to all of our Christmas stories, thought about like what we would want our characters doing and then they thought about how they would place that into the film. And I think the same thing went with the moms. They were like, who do you connect to? You? Who would you feel like you would want to work with? Who are you friendly with? Who Do you think is wonderful for this? But there they're really, really collaborative. Yeah. It seems like it was a perfect cast. So, uh, one of my favorite lines is delivered by Christine Baranski. She says, you're a mom. Moms don't enjoy, they give joy. That's how mom had, that's how being a mom works. And can you tell us more about each of their characters and what we can expect?

Speaker 4:          06:30          Uh, there all, no, you go ahead.

Speaker 3:          06:35          Um, my mom is played by Cheryl Hines, who weirdly enough has been a, like a friend of mine for about a decade. So I was like, this is where would you want to play my mom? And we can just add a weird line that you had me when you were like 10 or something. And she was like, sure. Um, so, but so we already had like a, a very strong friendship on going into it and we, uh, we share a similar sense of humor and I sort of idolized her and I was so excited that she said yes and they, the storyline with Kiki, we pretty much wrote itself and that of course Kiki has the issue she has because she had an overbearing mother, like an intensely overbearing mother, a mother that were her face on her sweatshirt often and a mother that like cuts and colors her hair exactly the same. A mother that just like cannot stop living through her daughter and how much pressure Kiki feels and how that makes her sort of neurotic and, uh, unable to set a boundary because she's fearful of hurting her mom. Which, um, you know, I've experienced and, uh, it was wonderful to be able to work in a safe, fun environment with Cheryl who's like one of the best, also improv female comedians we have out there. So she, I feel like brought a ton to it. And I was just really grateful that she said yes.

Speaker 4:          07:55          Um, I had the pleasure of Christine Baranski who came about of me going, hmm, who makes me nervous. And I was like, Christine Baranski, uh, my, my character in the first one was constantly trying to be perfect. Um, and that was her whole spiral of like, how do I, you know, uh, beat the ideals of perfection. So the mother that I get in the movie, it's somebody who is, uh, who has to have everything be exactly the way the public would want it to perceive. So everything has to visually be great. Does it matter what's happening behind closed doors? But you don't air your dirty laundry and everything has to be perfect and the kids have to be happy and it has to be the best. This and everything has to be perfect and wonderful and great. And so I was like, who makes me nervous as a person?

Speaker 4:          08:36          And I literally went, Christine Baranski kind of makes me nervous. And um, and I was like, well, let's see what happens. And like literally that's how it went about. And then I emailed her and was like, hey, there's this little movie. We did call it bad mom's like, I went on a whole thing and she was like, yeah, okay. And that was it. And I was like, do you want to read the script? Like did you, she's like, no, no, that's fine. And then the directors, John has got met with her and pitched her the idea of this character that's a very overbearing mother and you know, all the moms ultimately have a, a reason as to why they are the way that they are, which explains why our characters became the way they became, which is very reminiscent of if you, you are who your parents are in your, you know, whether your parents were, we're constantly driving you and you fought against it and you became a rebel or you went into it and became, you know, Mark Zuckerberg or like whatever version of that you became.

Speaker 4:          09:22          It is true. You are what your parents are. And so in this case, I think this gives an explanation as to why we as mothers are so constantly fighting for perfection. And it also like, I think what they did a great job of in this movie is they give the moms enough behind the curtain time and peel away the onion time where you, it does sort of resonate that like guys, everybody's doing the best they can with what they've got, you know? And that like, it rings true for our characters, but it also, throughout the course of the movie you see like, yeah, your mom is so annoying, but she's doing the best she can with what she got and explains why. Like you no longer resent your parents. Yeah. And let me take that back. I met Larry Page, not mark Zuckerberg.

Speaker 1:          10:03          Hey guys, I apologize. I also mean Eric Schmidt. Uh, we can go down the list. I didn't meet that. Sorry.

Speaker 5:          10:11          No,

Speaker 1:          10:15          I gotta get on this Bob Game Too. You guys. You got your hair looks so awesome. Both of yours. I feel like I'm the odd, odd woman out with this long. Her fuck the hair guys. Yeah. Um, Susan Surandon you guys, it's not so, I mean, I was so excited and similarly I was like, who? There's only one person in the world that would make Carla feel small and that would be her mother. And then I was so excited that at the thought of it being Susan and I wrote her as well, I did Spanish. I was like, oh my God, I gotta I just knew it. And then even just being in a scene with her would be very, it would take me a second because I would just, it would be all those movies would, it was like film Lewis deadman walking rocky horror picture show. So it's like hard to like refocus into, cause she's such a goddess. They all are. We really lucked out with these women. And so yeah, I think in their dynamic, Carla and her mom, it's more, I think they were more like kind of siblings and mother daughter. You know what I mean? There was not a lot of boundaries. Friendship. Yeah, exactly. Well we were thinking about

Speaker 4:          11:19          how you celebrate the holidays since it is a holiday film. Can you share what some of your favorite traditions are and if you are sharing this with your children? Oh my God. Well when I

Speaker 1:          11:28          grew up, we used to have to sing happy birthday baby Jesus on Christmas Eve. I'm not kidding you. My mom would get a case and we would be like happy birthday. And I had so many questions. I was like, how many candles? Like it was so confusing. I have not, I've not pass that on, but that was something we had to do. I don't really sing. Happy Birthday Baby Jesus. Be Birthday

Speaker 3:          11:54          Baby Jesus. And we're all like, just did it. So weird. Baskin Robbins Santa Claus cake. So it was confusing at all. A lot of levels. Even better. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          12:08          I got nothing you got, I know that we can top that tradition that I've passed down. I don't really happen and done. I mean no, cause you know, I'm Jewish you guys, so not to be like mom didn't really celebrate Christmas, but I'm sorry. I also grew up in communist Russia where you don't really sell it, but I do now. So yay. Um, I think like we're creating traditions is the best way that I can explain it. So you know, uh, our kid doesn't, I explain this, she's having a hard time grasping why a man, it's coming into our house through a chimney. So spoiler alert, we're not teaching her about Santa Claus,

Speaker 3:          12:54          not teaching her, but we try to explain to her that there's a man that's coming into the house and she was like, Ooh, is okay. But if you're a kid believes in it, it's great. Oh he's got a bunch of exotic cars on the roof. He's in a jumpsuit and combat boots. But like don't worry kids in a Hyatt because mine is not buying it. Should it does one of them doesn't Harley or Jay Hernandez? Maybe that would be okay. That's where my daughter Mary though, because do I get it? Try to be so honest about everything else. And even like during Easter I was like bunny too far. It's too far. I was like, we play a game where we pretend and imagine this giant bunny brings us an Easter basket, but mommy went to the store and got this for you. But around Christmas, everyone talks about it and you don't ever want to say it in front of another kid because you don't want to insult another parent and like take over.

Speaker 3:          13:43          That's their domain, but like I'm having a hard timeline to them. If I tried lying, I'm really trying. I'm like, see it as totally isin tooth fairy. You name it, but also so like, but then when they find out they're going to go, what else have you lied to me about it? That's what's confusing. It's like, shit, I shouldn't have your right. It lost it. It's when your kids have questions about God, but then you're like, but with definitively like, but there's a tooth fairy. People believe this here. It's confusing. I was babysitting yesterday and extra kid in my house here. Some of the questions that I fielded throughout the day is Santa Claus real and I couldn't say anything in front of the other kid who may dogs. Why is the earth

Speaker 4:          14:28          literally, I was like, no, that was the question, and they're just like painting and they're like dogs and I was like, oh my God, where's my husband?

Speaker 3:          14:37          Sounds like an awesome play date. I'm on Kiki in real life. It's so sad. It's a planet. Well, you're all working moms. And the pressures of being a perfect parent is something that we all relate to. So is there a secret to your work life integration? Uh, and then what do you do

Speaker 1:          14:58          to recharge? I love my, my girlfriends, like my tribe of other mamas and humans than that I love and that we share the same kind of philosophy. You know, you just find your group and um, I cherish that. And then I think the balance, it's really hard. It's hard. Oh yeah. Yeah. I try not to say balance anymore because I can't balance exists. No, it doesn't. It doesn't, it's just, it just, it is really like it. I've always thought like, it really does suck that biologically. Like our chief moneymaking years are lined up with our, like fertility. Like it just blows, you know what I mean? It's just what it is. But it really sucks for us. I'm going to have some more of a mess that let's drink some more and just make the most out.

Speaker 3:          15:52          Any secrets to just recharging, signing off. I mean self care is huge. I think like just knowing when you're feeling frustrated and knowing when you need to call a girlfriend or when you need to even like just tag team with your, like we in our household will be like, I'd be like, I got to switch kids. I don't want this one anymore but doing this one right now because like one of them will be particular. I'm not, I don't want, I want to switch. And then he's like, got it. Totally, totally. And then we switch because sometimes you just need, you just need to know when you're getting higher, your thermometer is getting higher and whether that goes for like, oh it's been, you know, four months since I've had like a girl's dinner, I'm going to do that. Any amount of self care and never, ever, ever, ever beating yourself up for needing self care.

Speaker 3:          16:36          I used to do that all the time and I was like, no, I should be of service and my family. And I was like, no, I can get a manicure like once every six months. Like, that's okay. Do you know what I mean? And not killing myself for it. And also surrendering to the fact that there is no balance. It is only had just have a mantra like just be where you are. Like when I'm at home, I focus on my family. When I'm at work, I focused on work and scroll through pictures of my family. But you, you just have to be where you are. It's really just mindfulness. Like there's no, the balance is such a sad joke, you know? Yeah. I mean I can just talk for the sake of talking, but I actually have to this, yeah, everything that you said. I agree with those. There's no, there's no balance it, but I also don't want it to be like a woman thing. There's just no balance. If you're a working parent, there is a balance. It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman. I am incredibly fortunate and I've said this before and I'll say it again. I do have an amazing partner in life. I do who? Just, yeah.

Speaker 1:          17:31          Ooh, that's right. Who? My partner, he's fucking awesome and I'm not going to shit on him because

Speaker 3:          17:37          he's great. And guess who was home with the kids today at five in the morning when I was getting ready, he was, he was awesome and I, you know, I had to go away for five months to to shoot something and he took the time off from work. He was like, um,

Speaker 4:          17:50          you know, we travel as a tribe as I know you do where one goes, the other one follows with the kids and for five months he was on a flip schedule. So I, you know, we were in Europe so he would work from 9:00 PM to like five in the morning and then be with the kids all day. Never once did he complain and all the time he would go, you know what, I'm so blessed that I get to spend this much time with the kids. And it's the most great, like it's you take it for granted. Having a partner, whether it's you know, hired help or a husband or a wife or whatever, anyone that allows you to just be like, I can't do this anymore. To your point, don't take them for granted. Don't. Because I think it's the one thing that I sometimes forget to do is just simply say thank you. Because as much as I'm like, I'm about to explode, I need to go and lock myself up in the closet for a minute. He's like, Babe, you got this. Go. And I'm like,

Speaker 3:          18:35          okay.

Speaker 4:          18:36          But like you just, I think that we should just be grateful for whatever help it is that you're able to can see whether it's your friends, your girlfriends, your village, your mom, your dad. I feel guilty for relying on hell, never feel guilty about it. And that's the one thing that I think both of you helped me with two years ago because I had the hardest time asking for help two years ago when I, when I did bad moms, the first one was the first time I'm back to work after having kids. And I literally was like, you know, as Daniel Tiger says, like when you're feeling frustrated, step back and ask for help, y'all fucking step back and ask for help. It's okay. And it took me for ever to be okay with it and you and you were the biggest champions of that. So I think you,

Speaker 3:          19:16          it's true. Well cheers to our girlfriends and our partners. We'll go ahead and start taking questions if you want to line up and uh, I guess to wrap up. Yeah. Where would each of you like to see your characters go? If there was a third film to Hawaii on vacation destination. Actually vacation takes a lot of work. No, the bad moms. I feel you planning a family vacation. Yeah. Having everything you need a plane ride. Yup. And I forgot seeing is like a lock up our kids in their car seats once. Oh yeah. Car seat. Strap them on that airplane in the car that you have to run. Yeah, we could go on and on. Great. So we'll go ahead and start with the first question. Hi, thanks so much for coming to Google. It's great to see all of you. Um, my question is how was working on this set of bad moms different than other sets you worked done in the past? Well it does a Christmas movie and we shot it in Atlanta in May and June. So that was relaxing of sweat in places I didn't know could, could gather. I think we were also kind of like, whereas the last movie we had a lot of peers and like we were all very friendly. This movie, we were all sort of like in awe of like the things that Christine and Susan and Sheryl warp sort of bringing and we fell. I feel like I felt a little bit more like a fan girl on this. Not that I'm

Speaker 4:          20:48          not in love with the other women that we worked with, but this just felt a little bit more like, I don't know, like why are they doing our movie? This is so exciting.

Speaker 2:          20:57          Thank you so much. Hi,

Speaker 1:          21:02          I'll second that. Thank you so much for coming to Google tag. Um, one of my favorite parts of the first movie, which was amazing, but the very end where each of you were interviewed with your moms. I thought it was incredibly touching and so I'm transparent of view is especially in the public light to have your moms be there. Um, so with your new stage moms in the second one, did your moms get to meet any of your screen moms? No, my mom did. She got, she happened to be there while we were doing like a gallery shoot or so remember we were doing the publicity and so she got to meet her and shoot that, which was very, very exciting. Yeah. But those first interviews were so dear and remember like, do you remember they ended up being like incredible interviewers. John and Scott are directors and writers actually did the interviews for all of us as a couple, you know, the, the mothers and daughters and it was there pretty revealing. It got real deep in. They're very, Barbara Walters was really well done.

Speaker 4:          21:56          Yeah, no, my mom has not met Christine brandscaping but their historic mom's five feet on a good day. Like if she stands up royally tall, she's maybe five feet though. And like she's tiny. She's just a tiny little thing and you know, because nobody's the tall and beautiful. My Mom's like, that's what I imagined myself as and it's very cute. So they will meet, I mean, yeah, for sure. They're both awesome.

Speaker 2:          22:19          Yeah. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          22:21          I think we have one last question.

Speaker 2:          22:24          Great. Hi.

Speaker 1:          22:25          Um, so thank you. First off for doing the movie, giving us a reason to go get drunk and get all the like weird kind of awkward moms from preschool together represent body moms. Thank you. Get some girl and erotic. Really organized. Um, I loved it. I was just curious which pieces really resonated the most with you? Like, if you could have chosen the characters, like would you have chosen the character that you got to sign? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          22:51          Yes, yes. Without, AH, yeah. Yes. I cannot, I can go on a very lengthy, lengthy explanation as to why. But uh, with the first bad moms, that was me. I literally was like, I had so much pressure that I put on myself, not anybody else of like, everything has to be perfect for my kid, for my life, everything organize and to figure this out. And I literally was going crazy cause I was like, what's a shower? Like I forgot to take care of myself so much so that I need, like I, it was the most perfect um, therapy session was doing this movie. They like both of these films have been like giant therapies for me.

Speaker 1:          23:28          I'd say Carlos is more as my s my spirit animal. Like I wish that's actually reassuring. Yeah. Yeah. I wish, I think we all wish we got a little inner inner, oh yeah. We all have some of her. When I first read that Mila had this script and she called me and she was like, read this script. You Ha you should do this with me. And

Speaker 3:          23:46          I read it and I was like, this is so good. And I was like, maybe I should play the bitchy one. Like I wanted to play Chris, remember this, I want to play Christina's role. I was like, she's so funny and that would be so cool cause like I can be super bitchy. And she was like, no, no, no, you're Kiki Kiki. That's it. And I was like, okay, cool. And then I realized like that's such a Kiki thing to do, to be like, Ooh man, I completed a vixen and everyone be like, no, that's not your essence.

Speaker 5:          24:17          Okay,

Speaker 3:          24:18          thanks for being true to yourself. Well in closing on behalf of all the bad moms like Google, I want to thank you for portraying the realities of being a mom and giving us a reason to have a mom's night out. So be sure to watch a bad moms Christmas out in theaters on November 1st I want a micro kitchen 400 feet from where I am.

Speaker 5:          24:40          That's the best idea. [inaudible].
