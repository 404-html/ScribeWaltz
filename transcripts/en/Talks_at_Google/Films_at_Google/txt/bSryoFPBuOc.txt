Speaker 1:          00:06          Please welcome Brent Haley and Nick Offerman. Uh, thank you for honoring pride, months decor, Google colors. That is right. Thank you guys both for uh, for coming here today. The movie opens tomorrow. Correct. It opens tonight to narrow our, there our preview screenings, uh, this evening, the movies playing at Regal Union Square and that the landmark West 57 so you can catch it starting tonight and we'll be there offering whip crack Rep parte, much like this. Correct nyquil anyway. And they wouldn't be there, but I'll be using foul language because I won't have signed the, uh, the Google contract. You are welcome to use foul language. Here we are. We're all adults in the room. Thank you. So I would love to get into the history of the film. Brett, you are the director and Co writer and of course the Knicks executive producer. And obviously we saw you're in it, you played in it. Um, Brent, probably your best to, to start us off with this. How, how did the concept of this movie happen? How did this even get made? Uh, well we've been wanting,

Speaker 2:          01:25          been wanting to do a, a movie in the music space, the band space for a long time, a big fan of that sort of sub genre of movies. And so I was, you know, I've had this idea for a long time and my co writer, Mark Bash and I had been talking about, and we made a movie called the hero, which with Sam Elliott and nick was in that movie. And after we worked with nick on that film, I talked to mark and sort of said, I think we found our dad for that band movie we want to do. I basically just wanted nick to be everybody's Dad. And uh, so we, we wrote that script and we sort of developed it. We got, we gave it to nick, we premiered last year with the hero at Sundance and we gave it to nick before Sundance. And we're sort of like, put this on your radar, we want to make it this summer.

Speaker 2:          02:11          And we did, we shot it in August and then it premiered at Sundance in January and now it's coming out in theaters. So it was sort of a whirlwind, very quick thing, but we worked very closely in the movie is exactly what I intended it to be, which is a feel good, uh, hopefully shot in the arm of just sweetness and goodness and love. And I was made out of a reaction to just how kind of divisive and miserable the general Twitter feed is right now. So I, that that was our goal and I think we both went into it with the, these intentions of just spreading love and joy and music. So that was the intent.

Speaker 1:          02:56          Nick, how did you, how did you, I guess, fall love with this? Do you,

Speaker 3:          03:00          do you feel like you have to have a personal stake in the, in a script before you take on a project? Well, uh, I really had a great time working on the previous movie, the hero with a, with Brett and, uh, and I loved his movie before that called, I'll see you in my dreams with Blythe Danner, Sam Elliott, Martin Starr. Um, and so when they, you know, and, and they work really fast. Uh, Brett has a really clear vision and I've always gravitated towards independent films because the artists usually gets to have his or her say without the corporate overlord saying, ah, Wah Wah, how can we homogenize this message? Um, put it in space. And, um, and so I was already a fan and I was on board, uh, and then they said, we want, you know, to write you, we want to give you the Sam Elliott treatment on this next movie.

Speaker 3:          03:55          And so I didn't really need to see a script, uh, cause no one, I mean I'm known I'm 47 and no one has done that for me or with me. Um, but then when they gave me the script, I was an incredibly gratified because I haven't gotten to just play, uh, you know, a human being that we see go through, uh, the, the banal scenes in his life, you know, with vulnerability, trying to figure out his conflicts, trying to get his landlady to kiss him. Spoiler alert, Toni Collette. If Toni Collette was your landlord, fair enough. Yeah. Right. You might blush up a little walk. And I think so collect the rent checks. He mentioned that the character is very, it is very human. That was one of the things that, that I would, that I was left with. I've actually seen it twice already. Um, super fan over here and watch out. I want him to be my dad. That's crazy. Yeah. Even though yet I saw a screen yeah. Screen a while ago after Sundance and then I saw it recently to prepare for this, but I walked away. We, everything throughout the whole movie was very real to me in a way that a lot of other movies I've seen habit been in. A lot of it is because like, I'm looking at some movies, like I said, shot in space. So wrinkle in time. Super unrealistic. Right.

Speaker 3:          05:19          Swinging a miss in the realism department. Yeah. So I guess for both of you and nick, how much of of the real you did you bring to this versus like a Ron Swanson type of character or maybe that is the real you, I don't know you very well yet. Um, and then, uh, Brett for you too, when you were writing this, you and mark were writing this, I mean, you're using your sign in red hook. We were talking backstage really that I, everything was shot on location. You had your opening party at the art gallery and you're using real names and real products. How much of that was you guys and how much it was just kind of by accident. I'd want to step too much on Brett's answer, but that's the, it's part of the answer to my, to the last question as well, which is a Britain is his writing partner, market bash, write these really great, realistic human stories.

Speaker 3:          06:13          You know, there's no, they're not high concept. There's no big flashy hook. It's like, here's some people dealing with their shit and, and usually love gets involved and by the end you're like, oh, well if we love each other, maybe things will turn out okay. Which is not a great elevator pitch. These people a face, some, um, some obstacles and they overcome them or not via love. Yeah. Lame. But I mean, I, I suppose there's probably more of this character's foibles and goofiness and human failings. That's probably more like me than Ron Swanson, who is more of a superhero. I mean, he's kind of a cartoon character. No mortal can eat that amount of red meat.

Speaker 3:          07:04          And also he can make an Irish harp overnight drunk on whiskey. You know, he's, uh, he's hyper real. Um, but, but so for this, I mean, uh, when, when you get the script, uh, and I've gotten to from Brett, you're, the work has done for you. Like they make it really easy for an actor because you don't have to figure out like, why am I doing this? You just have, everything is woven into the scenes, the backstories, very apparent. Um, which makes it easy. So I suppose it was out of laziness that I ultimately chose to do this fair.

Speaker 2:          07:44          Yeah. And just to piggyback on that, I, mark and I the, at least these movies that we've done, and I think they're, they go together very nicely. I'll see you in my dreams. The heroin and hearts beat loud and they, they're all about just good people trying their best and I think that there needs to be more movies like this that don't deal in in dread and tragedy and just overwhelming circumstances. There is some kind of unspoken rule that for a movie to exist it has to be sort of miserable in some way or it has to be so big like you say in space or superheros and that's kind of it. To be an nd you've got to be this dark and serious and an overwhelming thing and I don't want that from the cinema. I really wanted something like this that felt good that that made you feel things like people telling me like we had our premier last night in red hook and someone came up to, they're like, I cried like 15 times this moving.

Speaker 2:          08:36          I'm not really sure why. Like I wasn't sad but I just kept crying and I think it's because people can look up there and say, wow, this is something that I can relate to. We can all relate to the idea of leaving our nest, of leaving our parents to go off to college. And we as parents, we can say, Oh, if I have a child that going to be like when they leave, we can all talk about the creative process and what it means to create something. Not for fame and fortune, but for just the sake of creating something. These are things, you know, and there's a beautiful love story at the center of his film between Kirsi Keirsey's character Sam and an actor named Sasha Lane who plays rose. It's a beautiful relationship. It's a queer relationship. It's between two women of color. It or it's this things I'm not seeing in movies like this.

Speaker 2:          09:22          And it's not a plot point. It's not made to be something that is, you know, fretted about this dad rep, you know, accepts and loves his daughter for who she is, a queer woman of color. That's something that I want to see on screen. So you know, they, cause to me that's real. So the, the realism was at every turn of, of creating this project was there to create something that people could say, I believe this. I buy this, this is real. And you know what, it made me feel good. That's the idea. Right. I really appreciate it. That actually, that exact thing that you're talking about. I walked away and it was like, yeah, that whole story between salmon rosy, it didn't matter that like you saw it and it was just totally normal. It wasn't like shaping the plot, which I applaud you for.

Speaker 2:          10:10          I think it was really, really good. Um, but the main character is struggling musician, um, maybe still a child in his own right. Uh, did this character come from anyone you know specifically or just kind of a genre of just struggling red hook musicians? Probably the latter. And he doesn't come from any, anyone that I know. He Shit. He certainly, uh, frank shared some of my musical taste and some of Nick's nick and I both love Tom Waits on unhealthily and there's some good Tom waits forever to Dan and Jeff Tweety who, spoiler alert makes a cameo in the movie if you saw him up in the trailers. So we love Jeff tweedy and Wilco and, and all of Jeff's pans. So there's definitely my music nerdery is within frank. But I think this idea of a, someone who I love this theme of, of someone who tried to do something great and didn't quite get there.

Speaker 2:          11:08          It's a beautiful theme in a, in a great Coen brothers movie called inside Llewyn Davis. And it was, it's something that is really appealing to me, this idea of like, well, I want to do this great thing. I didn't quite get there. So what do I do now? And then this little spark happens between them where their song gets on Spotify and frank is like, maybe I can still get it. And it's so it complicates their relationship. So to me, again, it's just tracking. I think the reality of the, of that character, right, to check, have to get permission from Spotify or oh yeah. Don't really every album cover shown in the film. Every song played every, every reference. You have to get permission. Yeah. I noticed the, there's a couple of youtube videos and like you got to get permission. That was fun companies or persnickety about you using their brand.

Speaker 3:          11:54          Apparently.

Speaker 1:          11:55          You would wonder why

Speaker 3:          12:00          modern phenomenon, Nikki, you just want to give them some,

Speaker 1:          12:05          yeah. Hello. Right side. How's the back? How's the neck line look and not good. It's fine. So you executive produced this, is this the first I it in the first time give you Pete something, correct?

Speaker 3:          12:19          No, I, I have executive produced and also produced a handful of film projects on different levels and it it, you know, it's always, uh, your title has producer in it. It could mean a variety of things. It could mean you kicked in money. It could, it could mean that you texted Ted Danson and got him to be in the movie.

Speaker 1:          12:43          Um, did you do that? Oh yes. That is actually, I thought once a dental lab that you were going to say no, like just as like a thing. Like you could have done that but you didn't, but you did. I did. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          12:56          Um, yeah, that's, I mean that's when you texted Jeff tweedy. That's my main contribution. So Jeff and Ted Danson could doers. Okay. I'm going to, uh, I'm going to lead with that. Is that any different from what you've done in the past? Why, I guess, why decide to, to put forth the extra effort and be an executive producer when you're already like the main focus of the show? Well, it depends. It all depends on the project. I mean, uh, if, if I feel that I can be of service basically and, uh, uh, a film of this size is my favorite size because you can literally see everyone making it together. When you get on a big budget studio film, you begin to feel more like a prop kept in your air conditioned container. And I'm like, okay, bring in the bus driver, uh, for his, you know, his three lines.

Speaker 3:          13:45          Um, and you know, you know, just the prompts department is like 38 people and, but I, I liked to work with a group of people small enough that I can learn everybody's name and you can literally feel everybody making this work of art together. Um, that's usually where I'm more likely to come in as a producer on some level. And in this, uh, I, I uh, I did a lot less work than all the producers. Um, it has more to do with me helping cast it. Uh, and I, I take a morale very seriously. I, I try to act like the team captain, you know, um, I got us cool tee shirts.

Speaker 1:          14:31          Tis true the two two, two tee shirts or red hook records, tee shirt and a Sonny's bar t shirt for day one of the shoot there were Sunny's we were shooting at Sonny's and there were boxes of Sonny's bar t shirts waiting for everyone. And that's the kind of Guy Nick is. That's the kind of tone that he sets on a film like this. There's, there's no to do that.

Speaker 2:          14:52          He bought us. How many ice cream trucks did you get us, but I mean to in any cause I ate a lot of ice cream because that's the idea. It was a good ice cream. You're basically a traveling Google about tee shirt. That's high praise. I don't know if I can, if I can spell all of that. Half my dresser is Google tee shirts that I've never bought. My algorithm might be somewhat simpler than, but I feel like I could ask you almost anything and I'll take a swing at it. Fallible. Google. Um, so you mentioned you touched on the rest of the cast. So this is Ted Danson 20 clip life. Dan Life Danner, of course. Kiersey Clemons. Amazing, amazing actress. She's on the up and up. Really? Like how did you find you fixed it? You literally, you literally texted a couple of these people and they said, don't do this, but how did you find Kirsi?

Speaker 2:          15:44          How did that come across? I mean, I've known, I've, I've been following Keirsey's star for years. I mean, I've been aware of her certainly since dope, if not before. Dope. Great. Mommy called Dope Sundance three years ago. Yeah. Was there when, I'll see you in my dreams were there, so 2015. So I've been, I've been, she's been on my radar and I think she's a superstar. She was in transparent. She was in a easy, which is on Netflix. Um, she kind of do it all. And when I discovered that she could, she could sing, I did some deep diving and I sort of found some like deep cut clips of her like doing grease in high school playing sandy. And I was like, oh, this girl can sing. And I'm a huge fan of her. Uh, and we were nearing, we had had, you know, we were, it's very hard to find the person to play Sam.

Speaker 2:          16:30          I knew I wanted her to be biracial. I knew, you know, it was just trying to find the right person who could sing, who could act, who had the right vibe with nick. And Sasha was cast at that point and Sasha and Kirsi are friends. And when I found that out I was like, oh, we, we need to make this happen. And I just called Nick and I said, I've got a really good feeling about Kirsi. Are you cool if I just make the offer? And we made the offer? And she said yes the same day. So it was something that she just, I think because of Sasha and because of that, it was very easy to go like Sasha, nick, Ted, Tony, bleive and me. Sure. I'll do that. Read script. Yeah. And it's an 18 day shoot in Brooklyn. I can handle that. You know, it was not a big end.

Speaker 2:          17:10          She, I knew she wanted to do something in the music world and get herself out there. And now it's like we've made a movie. We've also made a record. It's very meadow, what's going on because our record comes out tomorrow on Vinyl. It will be on Spotify, iTunes, that'll be everywhere. Who play Google play. Thank you. Where are we right now? Um, yeah. Have Google play that too. Um, but it is exciting that we've made this album, you know, like nick and, and Kirsi sing all the songs, performed all the songs and, and, and um, it's crazy. So I think it's amazing cause cause she has such a dynamic quality. Uh, she's uh, she's a, and when you see you're here, see her and then hear her saying you're like Whoa, it's, and all the vocals in the movie are live. I was going to, we're not, we're not doing like in the trailer and stuff that's, that's play, that's like kind of lip sinking in the movie itself.

Speaker 2:          18:03          When you hear the song being recorded, when you see them perform, it's, it's coming through the actual mic that we did onset. So nick plays a whole song on Acoustic Guitar and sings live in one take. It's beautiful and very, very sweet. And so that was also going back to the, to the realism was was making sure that the audience bought this, this we're not a band is a real band and that it sounded and felt really real and not just like a music video where people are kind of lip sinking. Yeah. You can often tell when people are like strumming and it doesn't quite, yeah, we had to do some of that just because filmmaking is limited in what you can record. And I put everything towards towards the vocals to make sure we got live vocals on set. So sometimes you've got actors, literally they have earwigs and there is these little ear pieces that are playing the songs and nick and Kirsi have them.

Speaker 2:          18:52          I have them in my headphones, there's like 30 extras. No one can hear the music and nick and Kirsi just have to sing and play pretend play and, and like sing acapella. And the audience is like, yeah, this is so good as her, it's really awkward but I'm like dancing cause I can hear it in my headphones and everyone's like, this guy's crazy. But he's, you know, that's the kind of stuff you have to do to make it, to make it seem real. You know, you don't, you know, I took cues from inside Llewyn Davis and, and other movies that I think did it right. So we, we, we did our best on our small budget and schedule them to do it that way. Oh, it was wonderful. And then the songs themselves, she can do it. Compose, he could most all of it. Right. He did with a little help from his band mate.

Speaker 2:          19:41          Uh, Jeremy Bullock, he was a, he was our onset coach, taught nick how to play the electric guitar, helped him through, you know, how to do that. And he contributed some to a few of the songs. But yeah, Keegan is a pretty good, pretty good at what he does. I was listening to his 2009 album, like his standalone have nothing to do with this, like all day on repeat yesterday. So you know, it's a very good tone. It fits the movie. And then the heartbeat beat love the title track. He wrote that in 2010 right? It was a long time ago. It was a long time ago. It was a version. It was a version of it a long time ago. And I love the title. Like, it's always stuck with me and I loved the kind of ear warm quality of it. It doesn't have a proper chorus, it just builds.

Speaker 2:          20:21          And then I'm, I'm sorry you guys had to hear it on repeat. It's going to be stuck in your heads all day. Um, but it has that great kind of quality. And I bought it as something that she could write kind of in a day. So we, we, we started reworking that and figuring out how that would sound in this movie with a female vocal and, and, and I just bought it as like Guitar, like Dad rock meets cool, new young hip, electronic, Indie pop rock, you know, like, it felt like a good mix of those things. Like Red Hook. Yeah. Yeah. More or less. And Nicky said, or he said that you had to learn the electric guitar. Do you know what, what instruments did you know before this?

Speaker 3:          21:00          Um, the, uh, the unplugged guitar. I mean, that, that's my main instrument these days is the Acoustic Guitar, which I play as a humorist. Um, so, but I had never played electric before and it was, uh, it was difficult. I mean, I, uh, the stuff I play is pretty rudimentary and foci and so just to play like rifts up the neck, uh, it was like learning to dribble, um, because my hands didn't know how to do what was required of them. Uh, but Jeremy was a great coach and I had had enough time and I'm old enough to know that you have to put in your practice on the fundamentals. And so, but at the time we shot, I was able to actually play all the stuff I was supposed to. Um, and I, you know, I grew up playing the saxophone. I play a little bit of a lot of stuff, but no one ever asks me to,

Speaker 2:          21:57          he plays drums and bass and guitar, Acoustic and electric in the movie. So He's, he does it. He does it all. Almost all. We didn't get him on the Sax. He's kind of done that before. Yeah. Thank Kirsi plays a synth. Yeah. She had, he had a sampler, the Ableton push and the, and the, and the keys. Yeah, I mean it was that all real, what she was doing as well was like you were trying to replicate it authentically. Totally. Like everything. I learned all about Ableton, Ableton push. It was like a whole new world for me about how to sample and how to, how to create a sample. Like she's not like taking samples from other songs. She's creating the sample on the keyboard, recording it, playing it back. So what we learned a lot and you see that, you see that creative process in the film, you see how these, you know, you can create such incredible stuff by yourself and your bedroom these days and record it and put it on Spotify.

Speaker 2:          22:49          That's kind of the idea or Google play. And that's sort of the idea behind the movies that you can kind of create anything now with technology. You can go make a movie, you can make a song, you can, you know, and get it out there to the world. And if it's good, it's got a shot. Yeah, it was absolutely incredible. And I love breaking it down like this and I'm more of a behind the scenes kind of person. And I love watching it all builds, like in the movie, it just all comes together and it works. Um, and then it's like, what's our band name and we're not a band. Okay, cool. Let's go with that. Yeah. And uploading and Spotify immediately. Yes. Right. Um, what were the rehearsal process is like when you first came in the room? Like was it you and Kirsi and Keegan and the were all just like, all right, here we go. Let's do this. Uh, Keegan wasn't there at the beginning. Jeremy, right for me

Speaker 3:          23:36          was, um, and uh, that was when Keirsey first arrived. We had a few days of rehearsal before we started shooting. And so she blew into the room. We had been rehearsing with Blythe Danner, who plays my mom. Um, and Kirsi blew in and just started hugging everybody and it was like a Rainbow Unicorn had gal into the room. And I mean, I, I can't say enough about Kirsi. I think this movie would have been really good without her. And with her, it's sublime. Like she's, she's just exceptional. Um, she's such a personality and such a beautiful soul. And then she starts singing and your hat just flies off and you're like, oh shit, this is it. You guys got really lucky. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, we, uh, we, we were very gently coach w we both have musical skills to the level that we do, but there's a, there's an element of, of superhero origin story because through the filmmaking, you know, I can play a drum set, but they make me look like I can play a song. Like we create a song like a Keegan Dewitt song and that's a super power where it's like, oh yeah, what do you think about this? As, as though I can casually come up with those riffs, which I can't, you know, that's what I, it was really fun to see the movie and be like, I seem like a kick ass musician and it's really fun. See

Speaker 2:          25:08          that this scene where they're coming up with heart, speak loud and, and see him playing the ref and see Kirsi plane, the keys. That's all happening in camera. That's all real. And we allow that to be really organic and let them kind of put their spin on it when they discover your melody meets my melody and Oh that, that really works. It's, it's pretty fun. And Keirsey's really playing the keys and all that stuff when they're kind of being inspired and figuring out the tunes and the melodies and stuff. It's a, that was again, a big part of it for me just to be like, yes, they, they're doing this, this is actually happening. Well, um, well cool. So if anybody has any questions, you can start letting up now and I'll continue to talk here. Uh, I guess we'll go back to the location for a little bit.

Speaker 2:          25:53          We've, it's obviously a red hook. We've talked about that a couple of times. Why, why Red Hook and why these specific locations that you found? Well separate a, I'll let nick tell his connection to red hook, which I didn't know at the time when first when we didn't, uh, we didn't know Nick's connection to Red Hook, but I live in cobble hill and I have for 13 years. My wife and I lived there and I've just always walked to red hook. It's just what I do. I walk over to Red Hook. When I first moved to, uh, to New York, I lived right on the edge of Red Hook in Carroll Gardens, like right on the BQE. It was really nice. Um, so I, I just would walk over there and I'd go to Sonny's and I'd just walk around the piers and I just loved the feeling and it, it's sort of like this own weird, uh, beautiful and eclectic thing.

Speaker 2:          26:37          And in Brooklyn that's its own thing. It's, it's Brooklyn, but it's red hook. It's totally, it's, it's, it's something. And so there's just, we wanted, we've been, mark and I had been wanting to set a tail there for a long time. We did write another script that was no good, that took place in red hook. And we thought with this one, hey, why don't we have it take place in red hook and go full. And it was great to shoot it baked and she sunnies and just out on the street and called this record store red hook records. It was really fun. Um, so that's why you know that it's like kind of like home to me. We shot in Cobble Hill and red hook almost the whole movie a little bit in Greenpoint, but that was pretty much, yeah. You know your neighbors. Yeah, it's good. It's good stuff. Well, and then nick, what your connection to red oaks? Really interesting, I think. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          27:21          So they did this and handed me the script and unbeknownst to them, 10 or 11 years ago, my wife was doing young Frankenstein on Broadway and we were living on the upper west side. And, uh, the only caveat to her taking that job was I had to leave my woodshop in Los Angeles for a year and a half. And I said, good. I, uh, I'll leave my clients. I've been wanting to build my first wooden canoe, this will give me the chance to do that. So I brought a bag of chisels and hand planes with me as one does as one does. And uh, this, uh, you know, it took a little time to get through Tsa, but I, I'm, I'm charming. Uh, and so I got here and I looked around and the only affordable shop I could find was in red hook and one of those big old brick warehouses down below at the bottom of Van Brunt.

Speaker 3:          28:17          Uh, the super cool, uh, would co op and I got this shop out. The window was perfectly the statue of Liberty. It was a super romantic and dreamy. And I built my first canoe there also Ron Swansons first canoe, um, named huckleberry and, and baked. I stopped at every morning. I rode my bike there every day from the upper west side and just had this incredibly romantic year and a half as though I was in on the waterfront, which is set in red hook. And, uh, and I baked and Sonny's were two of my spots. So it was just a wonderful piece of serendipity when I read the script and was like, oh, this is me. I love their biscuits.

Speaker 2:          29:02          Picked baked, not knowing that he went through all the time. I, yeah, Sonny's Bay, all of it. I had no clue. He, we sat down in La, we had lunch together and I, and we had read the script and he's just like, dude, like I built my first, he knew in red hook, like I'm so connected to this place. So there's some kind of magic there. It's like I, I knew in my heart, like I wouldn't have made this movie without nick. Like when we met and I, we wrote it with him in mind and it was, so there's something obviously kind of Kismet e about that, that, that he had that connection to and we didn't even know that. So he's like, he was, he was made for this, this role, you know. Yeah. I agree. I love how he keeps saying his first canoe

Speaker 1:          29:42          because he's built more than one. Um, yeah. Let's take a question over here. Uh, my question is more about like your roles in sort of like how they fit into culture because a lot of your roles are like very masculine, but they're also super positively masculine. So I just wonder like how you feel about your sort of status is like a super awesome masculine character to like change how a lot of people feel about it and create more positive masculinity in the world.

Speaker 3:          30:06          Well, thanks. So the, the, there are some nice compliments laced into that question. Uh, I, uh, I have great parents. Um, I uh, was brought up with good manners and, um, and I love performing, you know, stories. I tried to pick things that are medicinal in some way for the audience. And so, uh, through good fortune, you know, I've landed some roles that, uh, I've seen the audience accusing me of masculinity. Uh, and it's a weird thing to be accused of because often certain sects of the audience are a little more narrow minded or a little more old fashioned. And so when they say masculinity, it's a little gross or it's a little old fashioned, it's laced with misogyny or bullying or just a, you know, a general, a sense of, of testosterone. And so I dunno, uh, given the opportunity to speak to that, uh, I try to steer people in the other direction and usually if a, if I, anything I say sounds like good advice.

Speaker 3:          31:18          Uh, I'm usually the, the, uh, intended target more than anybody. Um, and so, you know, regardless of what people ask me when they say like, how should a man behave, I kind of answer with my present sensibility of how should a person behave because men are a part of the group of people. And I, uh, I believe we should all be nice to each other and, and treat everyone as equals, you know, across the board. And that's my starting point. I am also aware that I'm human, therefore a dip shit. Uh, and so that's why I'm the, the first intended target. It's, it's something we'll never be done getting better at. And so we should always keep talking about it, especially in front of a, a rainbow colored curtain. My pleasure. That's the quote from today as I'm human. Therefore a dip shit. Oh yeah. Question over here

Speaker 4:          32:20          is first off, awesome casting with mayday Malone as a bartender in this movie. I love it. Um, I have a personal question for things that I like to create. I'm actually going to be building a two benches for my fire pit this weekend. I would love to have a couple of words of advice.

Speaker 3:          32:40          I'll take this one first. Would hammer nails good luck. Now, take it from the master here. Um, well first of all, I, uh, my wife, uh, Megan Mullally, who's on the program will and grace, uh, on television, she also played Tammy to on parks and rec was like just in case. Yeah. Case they didn't know. Yeah. Ps, if you're, if you haven't been to Nancy and beth.com that's the tip of the day. That's her band. She'll knock your socks off. Uh, last night she saw the movie for the first time and, and uh, still slept in my bed, which I take is a great compliment. She said that Brett so good at, uh, at making his movies seem real, which is such a great compliment from her. She has, she has really, uh, exacting artistic taste. So it's, I was terrified sitting next to her watching the movie.

Speaker 3:          33:43          Yeah, he teaches, he texted me like, so Megan's going to see the movie tomorrow and now it's real for me. It's was like, yeah. Um, but, but she also said, uh, bread is so good at casting. And that's why I wanted to reiterate that because it's, it's something that you can take for granted, but when somebody has a knack for it, uh, it makes all the difference. Um, I don't know what, uh, your benches are made out of, but I'll, I'll suggest that you take your time. Uh, go to work sober measure twice, uh, so that you can cut once and if you're using bladed tools, make sure they're properly sharpened. Thank you very much. Past your tools wisely over here.

Speaker 5:          34:33          Hi, I'm so broad. I know you already touched upon the queer elements of this movie a bit and I just wanted to say thank you for including that in the narrative because uh, it was really refreshing to read about this movie and hear that there were queer women who got to survive throughout the movie cause that's not typical. Um, and I think a lot of times movies fall into those harmful tropes because there's just not queer women involved in the production of the film. Um, so my question is how influential work here and Sasha and kind of gunning to like sculpt their characters and sculpt the narrative of the movie. Thank you for that question. And I do want to talk a little bit about going back to the masculinity thing, going back to what it means to be a white, straight male in society and the privilege that comes with that and acknowledging that privilege and understanding that as part of that privilege, we must be putting other people in things and on, in, in media that represent the reality of these situations.

Speaker 5:          35:37          Not as a plot point, not as a trope, not as something to be pushed away or, or, oh my God, here, what, what is that? Oh, what is like sort of doing that, which is so ridiculous. And it was always my goal to have a queer relationship in this film and treat it with no sort of posts. Just saying this is like any other summer romance, which it is any queer person, any trans person, doesn't sit around going all day. Oh God, I'm this. I'm that. They just live their lives. And that's what I wanted these characters to be able to do. And by total chance, when Kirsi and Sasha came on board, they both opened up to mark and I and said, you know, we identify as queer. And I said, well, tell me exactly how I can make this better. How did we do?

Speaker 5:          36:29          And they said, you did pretty good, but they're talking about it. We don't talk about it. We don't sit around talking about how we're queer. We just love each other and kiss and enjoy the summer together. And it was a really big moment. And so we went through each scene with them. We spent a half a day with just Kirsi and Sasha and mark and I being educated. Tell me, tell me how you would want to see this on screen. And we did something that a lot of white men should do more. We listened. And so I hope that you will see this film and I hope that it will move you. And I hope that anyone of of any, any race, any gender, any sexuality, sexual preference, whatever it may be, can just see a beautiful love story between these two characters and move on.

Speaker 5:          37:15          And that's why I'm so proud. I'm so, the thing that I'm also so proud of, his health, Frank's character, Nick's character of frank responds to it and it's, I don't want to give it away. I want you all to go see it. It, it really is kind of quietly radical when you don't judge, when you don't make it something that's bad or something, that punishment is waiting around the corner. It's just love and embracement and that's what we need. And that was my goal. And obviously I could not have done it as well as it has done in this without Kirsi. And Sasha, it's so important to listen to the people whose stories that it is, especially when you have the privilege that I have, I don't under, I have to acknowledge that I do not know what it's like to be in the shoes of someone else. So listening was key and I owe them a ton for that. Thank you. Wonderful. Thank you. Um,

Speaker 1:          38:06          I have a fun question though. Not that, that was fun. Oh, sorry. I was super fun. Fun. I've always wanted to know. And in movies where you see old pictures of the actors, where do those pictures come from? We see a wonderful album cover of, oh man, that one beard. He submits Sukus busted glass night. He saw that it's his old, that's

Speaker 2:          38:36          his old headshot, which is infamous. Just Google, nick Offerman young headshots and wait for it. I'm not going to give it away, but no, nick gave me a ton of photos. Um, and, and we, and we photo shopped and then there's a great playbill of Ted Danson. Uh, and a status status quo. Vadis yes. And that is real. That is from a production that he did on Broadway. The only time Ted was on Broadway and it closed in one night, which fits the character and fit. I didn't know that though. I was like, oh, we're going to use this, that play that he was in on Broadway and then Ted was like, yeah, we did one night I came back to the theater and the security guard was like, what are you doing here? And he was like, I'm going to work. And he was like, no, you're not. He did fine. You guys, you guys are like, Oh, poor ted. He, he did pretty good. Yeah, it worked out. I think so. [inaudible] I love putting that stuff in again, making it as real as possible. And we did some trickery to make, to pull off, uh, his wife in the film and make sure that it kind of, I think they turned out pretty well. Yeah. I mean, we, uh, Brett cast a great actress and we did a photo shoot,

Speaker 3:          39:49          like, you know, which is that, that's a testament to you. It would be, it would have been very easy not to have paid, uh, an actress and instead just gone into, you know, the world of, of images on the, the Google location on the computer. Um,

Speaker 2:          40:12          but we didn't, yeah, we can, we cast an actor and you made the, put him in like nineties and early 2000 clothes and like the found pictures of, of Nick and then recreated the way he was in that photo. So he, he, it was his body and then we took his head from the other photo and put it on with the act. So it looks, it looks really great. It has sort of a very authentic quality. At least we, we, we did our best. Yeah. No facial hair. Nick always takes me for a loop, but it's okay. I'll take that as a compliment. Thank you. Yeah, we're not used to it. Um, yeah. Question over here.

Speaker 6:          40:46          Hello. My question is basically going from being in a, on a show that has like many seasons and be on those actors for a really long time. Uh, what's the difference between having like a smaller project and do you see yourself kind of going more into the indie route or is this something that like you're just still playing around with other things or?

Speaker 3:          41:08          Um, well, it's interesting. I, you know, if you're lucky enough to get, get on to a series a period, you're, you've won the actor lottery. Um, because the hardest thing for an actor is just to get a damn job. And, and you know, the term starving actor is a become commonplace. Uh, you're lucky enough to get on a series. That's good. That's good writing then that's like winning the lottery among the lottery winners. Uh, and um, and so something on parks and rec is such an such a dream a moment. Because if I'm trained in the theater, so you know, I get cast in a play, I, you know, I get a script that's, you know, somewhere around two hours long and you learn it and then you'd do it for maybe some months, um, on a, on a TV show like that. Uh, you get cast and, and maybe they have a few, a handful of episodes written, but if it goes, uh, you all together get to create the lives of these characters.

Speaker 3:          42:24          And it's really gratifying because these really smart writers, uh, they deserve most of the credit, uh, have the wherewithal to say, okay, we're, you know, season four, where are we going to take these people? And, you know, uh, they came up with such positive, beautiful and hilarious things for us to do. And so that's, to get to do that for seven years is just beyond. I, you know, it's a, it's an incredible, um, but it doesn't feel very different than working on a film like this. It's just a different duration. Uh, if, if for some reason a channel like a or a website, I don't know if you, if you know any computer companies, um, if they called Brett and said, we love your movie, how would you feel about making a hundred episodes of it or something, I'm available. Then it would be the same for me to be like, oh, we're going to keep, we're gonna keep following frank in his life.

Speaker 3:          43:28          And it's a, I don't know if my wife and I both choose our projects based on our, our feeling that the writing is good and is somehow going to help us evolve or at least make us laugh a uncontrollably. Those are the parameters. Uh, cause I don't know if children's hospital is particularly revolutionary, but we thought about, we thought it was super funny and we do thought, we did think that it breaks down rules of, of what comedy can be. Um, but I don't, uh, I don't have any particular ambition. Uh, whatever the next good writing that comes in. It could be for the stage for the F it could be indie film, could be studio movie. But probably not because they're usually not as good writing because they've been through corporate. It's art by committee. Um, or it could be a TV series, whatever. I, I'm not particular, uh, as long as I can spend some time in my woodshop, I'll be happy to show up and be

Speaker 1:          44:32          in your project always. Cool. Thank you. If we got time for two more questions, let's take this one. Hi. Uh, so I don't know how like twiddly a movie dose, three hours, something like that, but going from audience to the Sundance in January and do an 18 days to shoot, did it feel very rushed? Does it feel

Speaker 5:          44:53          no, all the time in the world. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. Yeah. Yeah, it was, it was very rushed.

Speaker 1:          44:58          Crazily fast. It was gnarly. Did, do you feel like you kind of miss something or do you feel like you kind of wanted to put something else in

Speaker 5:          45:08          you? You, you always do. I mean, I, I can't, not at not a healthy, um, cabi to look back at the movie and go, man, I should've done this. And I wish that one scene was like that I made the movie I wanted to make and that and that's because I was told, hey, you're going to have 18 or 19 days, you have this much money, here's where you can shoot it, that these scenes need to take place in these locations. Good luck. And so I knew, I knew what I was going into and mark and I knew and so we worked that into the script to ensure success, at least for the level of success at this movie is going for it. It is. People sometimes call my film small films. I don't mind that at all. It doesn't bother me in any way to call my movie a small film because it might be, it might, it was quick, it was cheap, it was a little scrappy, but it has, the themes within it are, are big, are the biggest ones that we talk about love and a father and a daughter and creation and dreams and grief.

Speaker 5:          46:11          These are, these are not small things. These are big things and you just kind of go, you know, it's like I finished the movie on August 31st I knew I had to submit to Sundance at the end of September. I didn't want to have to work, you know, seven days a week with my editor, 18 hour days. I didn't want to do that. My wife's certainly didn't want me to do that. And Patrick, my editor's wife, who has a kid, he, she, she wasn't happy with me for 18 days or for the month, but we did it, you know, we pulled it together. We got to cut to Sundance. Thankfully they loved it. We got in and we finished the movie by Christmas and turned it around. But it's all very fast. I mean, the movie is going to be out to the world and kind of kind of boom, poof, before the one year anniversary of a shooting it. But that's great. That's, I love that pace. You know, once you work on something for a really long period of time, for me as a director, you can get a little lost in it. Unless we want to do heartbeat loud, the TV series I will give, I will give a hundred episodes for that. I'd be very happy to do that. So,

Speaker 1:          47:09          and I would like to add a couple things. One is that Britt, it was incredibly fast, but Britain, uh, I, I don't imagine he ever felt rushed because he knows what he's doing is a very clear vision. And there were things in the script there. There was a very romantic scene where I was riding my bicycle over the East River,

Speaker 3:          47:30          probably on the Manhattan bridge. And I was like, oh my God, they're going to shoot me riding a bicycle. It was like the sky and you know, it'll be around shit. Yeah. And, um, and immediately like, you know, as soon as the line producers started laying out the schedule, they were like, okay, that's cut. Uh, and we were like, ah, okay. But, but when I was doing, and I'll nutshell this, when, when I was doing theater in Chicago, I learned this lesson that I think really applies to art of this size. My theater company was very broke and we did a car chase between a cop car and some bad guys with these two cars that were built out of like refrigerator boxes and with great paint jobs. And we had s cocaine stage hands. It's a Kabuki convention. People in black robes like shoving the cars around and with sound and acting and, and this, uh, convention, the audience totally was got what we were doing and life was with it and like, Oh shit, you know, a fruit cart came out and God tamable ass over tea cup.

Speaker 3:          48:42          And then at the same time, some friends were in a play at a big great theater company in Chicago. And in this play somebody wrote a motorcycle on stage and made us cool entrance on a Harley. And I went and saw this play and I just really noticed the difference between when you have the budget to be like, let's fucking ride a motorcycle on stage. It's, it's briefly, uh, and superficially impressive, but there's no magic involved. So you're like, Whoa, that's loud. That's a real motorcycle on stage. Okay, that's over. But when you involve the audience in the Mechan mechanization of creating whatever the magic of the storytelling is, it's so much more satisfying and I just think it makes better art to place limitations on it so that way I'll have to work together to say, let's tell a story. This is a rabbit, you know, and it, and everyone's like, okay, I'm with you. Then we're together. Where as opposed to being like, check out this fucking rabbit,

Speaker 5:          49:46          I need to limit the limitations that are put on me constantly. As a filmmaker. Do you bring out the best in you because you have to say what is essential to tell this story appropriately. You, you can't be like, well, like you said, like, oh, we can do this. We did. You end up wasting a lot of time on stuff that you're like, well that's pretty, but it doesn't really help move the story along. So you mark and I were like forced to go. What really is going to help this movie. So I, I don't, I don't mind it. I would certainly take more money and more days to make a movie. I mean, if anybody's giving those out. Thank you. Thank you. Final question real quick. You mentioned, you talked about how you all about the big

Speaker 2:          50:28          happy positivity to counteract today's world, but then you mentioned inside Llewyn Davis a couple of times as an inspiration, which I feel like is not exactly that. Yeah, that movie's not, I'm curious what you took from that movie and if there are any other music centric movies that you took his inspiration for this one. Absolutely. Yeah. No, this is certainly not inside Llewyn Davis. I think it does share that theme of being good but not great and not having made it and what that means and the Coen brothers movie certainly goes in a much different direction than than ours does, but I think they actually have similar outcomes because it, it, it, again, this is not the rocky battle of the bands movie where they go and get fame and fortune. This movie's not about that going after that star. Can you find happiness if your dreams don't come true?

Speaker 2:          51:16          Correct. That's what it's about. And I think inside Llewyn Davis, Llewyn Davis is having a very difficult time. I think our characters do find some kind of peace and happiness and love within failure or within coming up short of what someone's goal was. I mean, I'm fascinated by that. Just as an artist, as a person with aspirations, what does it mean to be satisfied by said art is the doing of it. Enough itch it should be. It's hard to not put success and money and fame and all that bullshit on top of it. But that's what I'm after. And so the, the real, the real movies that tonally I think we mixed in and sort of a blender for this would be high fidelity, that thing you do, which I adore. Um, and once probably, and then there's a great Japanese film called Linda, Linda, Linda about an all girl band.

Speaker 2:          52:10          That's incredible. So I would say those five movies with Lou and Davis, she kind of in a blender also. Then the music man. And West side story, you know. Um, but I think that that kind of blend of the realism of once and the joy, like that thing you do is not a, again, it has the feeling that I think this movie has where you can watch it and just go, yeah, I knew that that was, that made me feel good. There's, there's, there isn't anything tragic that's going to happen. You're not, the filmmakers not going to knock you in the face when you turn the corner. It's just kind of taking you on this journey, showing you beautiful characters, interactions, what it means to have gone through something. And that is 100% the goal. And I, you know, anytime you open a movie and you start looking at the reactions and it's like, this is what we wanted to do and, and I hope that you all will go check out the movie because there is conflict and there is resolution. Thank you. Thank you. Cool. Everybody help me thank them for it.

Speaker 7:          53:20          Thank you.
