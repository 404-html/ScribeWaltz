Speaker 1:          00:05          And I have the pleasure of welcoming Alex [inaudible] who is the director of lipstick under my burger. I'm very excited. I've read a ton of articles about it. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie. She's promising to send me a link. So I'm definitely looking forward to seeing the movie. I'm just, we're just going to have a dialogue honestly and Alan Crita is gonna, uh, answer just a few questions and talk a little bit about the movie, but we will give an opportunity at the end for you guys to ask any questions as well. Perfect. So hello, welcome to Google. Hello. I'm be happy to be here. Is this your first time here? It is.

Speaker 2:          00:43          Zen. It's such an amazing gamblers.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Yes, you'll have to get coffee and free snacks and all of those good things before you do that. So first of all, I, I definitely, we were just chatting. I want to extend definitely thoughts and prayers to your family and your community in Mumbai, India, they're dealing with floods justice in Houston. So definitely wanted to extend our thoughts and prayers to your community. Absolutely. So I have been reading a ton of articles and there's been so much Christ around, uh, this awesome movie. But I would love to just hear in your words, what is this movie about?

Speaker 2:          01:23          White Lipstick Gunderman burqas essentially film about for a small down women who lead these secrets do alliance and they sort of searching for freedom. So it's set in one sort of ramshackle building, uh, in this moment on all four of them of different ages and they're sort of, um, uh, living there and they're trying to rebel in. I'm very small sort of visa and the tried to fulfill their dreams. So that's what it's about.

Speaker 1:          01:52          That's awesome. So I'm very intrigued by the title lipstick under my Barca. Talk about that a little bit. Where was that inspiration from?

Speaker 2:          02:01          Lipstick on mine will come actually the, um, uh, the title and, um, the idea of the firm that emerged at the same time. So it wasn't like I am part of the data leader and for me it's a metaphoric title because it really means that, uh, um, you know, women have this while seating desire to be free and begin sort of, um, I mean sometimes even if we feel that, um, society is sort of bound them into southern drawl, let me think that they're not dreaming of anything more. The truth is that they are, so they have like hidden desires and wheel dreams and uh, yeah. So it's, it's just that you can't stop women or no matter what, you don't know what, how many restrictions there are. They always going to want to like spread their wings.

Speaker 1:          02:44          Awesome. So we were talking a little bit about the letter you received when the movie was practically not released or band in India. Can you talk to us about just kind of the verbiage and what was the meaning around the banning

Speaker 2:          03:00          of this movie? So I know in Indiana as a system of, um, certification. So if you have to have your film shown in theaters and then you have to go to this government body, which is a definite with a sense of what though it's not technically called that. So at the end of December, last year after the film had started traveling to festivals, we thought we should try to figure out the India theatrical release and, um, we'd ride for the census certificate and, uh, the, uh, the board. And what they did was they decided to, um, not certify the film. So we had two screenings and both times, you know, and it took many months and they refuse to certify the film on the grounds that, um, and the fitness lady oriented and fantasy above life and all of that. So basically the whole idea was that they wanted to stifle the filmmakers aids made true mom may strongly female point of view.

Speaker 2:          03:57          And it tells the stories of women and then wanting to have agency over their own lives and their bodies in a way that I think they felt was a threat to the patriarchal sort of order. And I do feel that, um, that sense of order of India, uh, you know, bypassing is kind of a decision. They were functioning in a way that they really wanted to sort of perpetuate patriarchy because the popular culture in India is completely molded, uh, you know, by the male gaze. And, um, uh, the typical like Bollywood sort of trope is to have item songs and women who, uh, you know, very peripheral parts for women. And even if you see women, they like virginal and PR or they're like Vampish, um, or they're like mottos, but very little space for real and ordinary women or they're just like objects of desire for mail fulfillment.

Speaker 2:          04:53          So it's just a very convenient sort of way in which women have been portrayed over the decades. And of course that has to do with the fact that storytelling is completely been controlled by men forever. So, uh, and I think like us Indian societies also completely conditioned to consume popular culture through the eyes of men. So everybody celebrates the objectification of women without even thinking twice about we know what is it that they're watching and they're loving and they're dancing to, um, which is fine as long as, as it leased space for an alternative point of view. But I think what the censor board was trying to do was to stifle any kind of alternative point of view. So in effect, they were saying that, uh, you know, for a, this Indian citizens, the only kind of culture they should consume, um, should be a culture that perpetuates male domination.

Speaker 2:          05:42          And I think that is really, really low wrong. And I thought it was very important, uh, for us to call them out on this decision that the mean, uh, which is why I decided that, you know, whatever happens, you know, we must release the film and the producer of the Fed, Mr Brick Isiah and the production company are very, very clear that, you know, whatever we have to do, we're going to do when we couldn't get the film out. And, um, so finally then we, uh, when all this happened, um, it was like we went through a process, we actually went to a judicial body and it took quite a few weeks and you know, having hearings and lawyers and this and that. And finally the decision was reversed. And after long, yeah. Battle. So we applied for the certification at the end of December. I got it in June, uh, this year.

Speaker 2:          06:31          And, uh, the film released in India in July. And just to put it in context, normally this procedure takes about three to four days. Wow. And it took me, so how long does it normally take? So what has been the response in India since the release of the movie? Uh, it's been very, very interesting. It's been, um, uh, and actually the, the thing is that because of the most traveling to various countries, because of like, it was participating in various film festivals since October last year and then this bad thing happened. So I think there was a lot of conversation in the media about, um, and on social media about the fact that, uh, you know, audiences and other countries are able to access the foam but not Indians themselves. So there was a lot of buildup in fact, when the release actually happened. And I think people had all kinds of, uh, uh, ideas and expectations from the film.

Speaker 2:          07:25          So we've, I was quite anxious about the release, but it's been really, really interesting that the people are really, uh, uh, embrace the film. The film did really well, but I, I mean, it's not just in terms of numbers with, I think what the numbers represent is the fact that they've actually so many people who made the effort to go for a film like this, which is a independent, which is an independent film about women. They actually went to the theater to see it and lots and lots of men also went to watch the film. And I think a while the reactions of most women were the reactions I got from many, many women who is very, very new thing in terms of how they felt like their stories have been told. And, uh, you know, there's the stories of their mothers and their sisters and their daughters and their friends.

Speaker 2:          08:04          It felt very represented in that sense. But I think for the men, it was like some men really felt I was a sort of, for the first time they've thought about women like that and they've never, uh, uh, uh, I mean there's just haven't given it a second thought. And they were way more interesting experiences that people report it. Like, uh, you know, some young men who went to watch the film thinking it's just going to be a sex fest. And then, uh, you know, start to feel a little irritated to begin with. And then started understanding the film and then got drawn into the film. And then like this boy, one of the boys wrote to me and was like, he was the first person in the head over up to start clapping when the Filbert over, which was a very like, common reaction that happened with a film.

Speaker 2:          08:45          Like the film would get over and people would just get up and like start clapping and all of that. So I think very interesting. And some men who went to see the film, somebody asks him what for them to go and see. And they would not name lipstick and America. They would be like, uh, you know, we want to see like something done called, it would be like, where's he's a motherfucker. So it, it's been very, very, um, interesting. But I do think that, uh, um, you know, from the standpoint of, um, um, women's, um, uh, I mean the rights for women do like of, of women to be able to express themselves in a country like India where there is so much violence against women and so much discrimination against women and we have a popular culture that keeps perpetuating this vicious cycle. Um, I think the fact that lipstick and my bill can actually reason theaters as a huge victory because I really did feel that, uh, if he had not been able to release it, it would be like, we are seeing that it's okay, uh, for, uh, you know, the sense of what to actually muscle like 50% of the population.

Speaker 2:          09:49          You're saying that we should get the voices of women. So I did feel that there's, Denise was not just about a film releasing, but the idea that well, you know, if, uh, India is a country where, uh, you know, we are promised equality of gender, then definitely women should be as free to be able to tell their stories and share their experiences. Particularly in the context of a country like India where there is, I've, I mean there is such a huge disparity between rights and opportunities between men and women.

Speaker 1:          10:20          So when I, when I be reflecting on the things that I've been reading, it's really been like stories of liberation, right? And all women can really relate to that front, whether black, white, Indian, any racial or ethnic background. What gave you the courage to sort of tell this story, which is really in conflict of what the normal story quote, normal story would be? A in traditional Indian cinema?

Speaker 2:          10:46          No, it's been interesting that you ask this question because uh, uh, the sun does come from very a personal space. I think being a woman who's, I'm an Indian woman, but I've been, I feel I've been brought up with a fair degree of privilege in terms of, uh, uh, you know, education and no one ever telling me that you can do this. You can't do this, you can go here, you can't go here. But I still feel that, uh, you know, there are those things that make you feel like you're not completely free. And I was quite preoccupied with this idea of not feeling fully free and um, and I thought it's so strange that externally I don't feel like there's any obstacle to man, you know, me feeling completely like, uh, uh, having like, you know, like a, a completely free sort of mind space in life.

Speaker 2:          11:35          So I wanted to explore this feeling and then, then I thought the drought, the next lower through world, um, which is very similar to mine, why don't explore it through mill you. Um, whether also external, um, uh, obstacles to a women's freedom and where society has like a strong hold on the rules that women have to play. And also where everything is not as simple because you don't have so much economic privilege. And I thought, why don't I, you know, set this in this world and that kind of world. And I think it was very interesting is that it is culturally a very specific story because it's about one neighborhood in one small, small town in India. Uh, but I think what's been amazing is like, you know, the film is going to like more than 45, uh, film festivals and said Premiere and, um, uh, to begin with, most of the festivals that the film showed at were, you know, they will, not South Asian festivals or anything.

Speaker 2:          12:26          And it was very interesting, um, to see that so many people from so many different cultures and nationalities were really connecting with a film. Uh, having no idea about what life is like in South Asia. I mean, just, you know, having a vague notion but not having like any active engagement. And I think that was really an eyeopener for me, even as a filmmaker, as a writer, and a director that, um, uh, you know, sometimes we limit, we think that if we are culturally specific, uh, we're going to alienate, um, other cultures. But I thought that because it was rooted locally, um, I think somehow, um, about the stories are universal and in, in that sense. So I felt like I was quite a surprise. There may happily surprised by, uh, the sort of way in which the film was a film has been embraced by people like, from so many different, you know, countries, whether it's Egypt project plan or Sweden or, uh, you know, it's showed in many festivals in, in the u s as well.

Speaker 2:          13:26          So I think for me, that was very, very interesting to see how people were feeling a sense of even people like in France and all where, you know, you feel like women, um, have like, I mean, things are not as, uh, as an input, but like everywhere, that sense of, uh, of ownership with the, and feeling a sense of identification with the characters. So I think that was very interesting to me. And I think that reminded me of a very, very important thing that I think a women across the world share bond and it really cuts through like every other divisions with thing. There are so many, uh, you know, sometimes the world seems less a divisive place. Uh, but I really think that there's something though there are many specifics, but I think there is a deeply like shared common sort of bond across a women. And I think, uh, yeah, I think that's something that really realized while seeing people from different countries. What was the film?

Speaker 1:          14:20          I think it was the Hollywood insider describe the movie as a quote, feminist drama. And we could probably talk about the concept of feminism all day. Um, but it's not something you agree with that description being feminist drama.

Speaker 2:          14:35          Uh, I am very happy that, I think it was the Hollywood reporter, but like after that, I think that was one of the first reviews that had come out or nothing off that many other people have described the film as a feminist drama. And, uh, um, I think, uh, I'm very, I'm a very proud and I do feel the reason you want to us sitting here and having this conversation because of the feminist movement. And I feel it's because of generations of, um, uh, you know, women who fought for the right of women to work the right to water, right, to sort of own your own life. Um, I don't think we can ever, um, we can ever like forget that debt. So I do feel that it's very important for everybody actually to own, uh, own the idea of feminism because feminism for me really means, or Oh, situation where, uh, you know, there is, there are equal rights and equal opportunities for men and women.

Speaker 2:          15:30          And sometimes I do get a little, I mean, I feel it's very important. Like I keep feeling it's very important. Explain to people who are like, oh, you know, but, uh, I don't know. I just feel it's such a strong word and I don't believe in feminism. I really want to like explain to them that if you see you are not feminist or you see, you don't believe in feminism, then what you're seeing as you feel patriarchy rocks and you feel like, you know, patriarchy should rule the world. It should just be like mentioned be paid more, you know, they should, women should die because of dowery debts and women should be more or less everything that you're seeing then is what you're saying then is that you want the words to be ruled by men. If you're saying you don't believe in feminism. So I think it's very, very, or I mean just beyond the idea of a film or whatever.

Speaker 2:          16:13          I just feel it's very important for men and women, um, to really own the idea of feminism because I feel, um, uh, until there is a equal of the genders, I feel, you know, like many, many big things in the world are not going to really change. And I feel it's, um, I mean I feel like it's the biggest problem in the one this inequality between men and women because it just really does got through like any kind of countries, any situation. So I just feel that it's very important to coming back to the film. I'm very happy and very proud of people. Uh, call it a feminist drama. I feel, uh, um, it's nice when one's own viewpoint or as a person comes through in one's work. Um, so I don't feel like I set out to be like I have to make a feminist, but I wasn't doubting it be a feminist because of lamb. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          17:05          That's awesome. So the word censorship came up in a lot of my reading in preparation for our chat and of course for me, since censorship just means stifling someone's voice. So what advice would you give to women mean it folks in the room, folks listening to utilize and leverage their voice even when it's times when they're afraid or a times when it's not going to be accepted. What advice would you give?

Speaker 2:          17:31          What I would just say that it's very important to not be discouraged because I feel every force outside of you that's [inaudible] voice is banking on your feel. And they feel that because of feel your back though. And I feel if you can battle that Phil, I mean, Oh, I'm continue fighting. I think that's the only way forward. And sometimes even been in, sometimes we may not. Uh, but I think the most crucial thing is to continue fighting. And I really think they always banking on field because you, every time I feel, uh, whether it's, um, you know, it, it's just that they feel that they can threaten him and you know, whatever in some way or the other, they try to leverage something or the other against you. And this some, not one, not just in terms of censorship refilm but censorship of books and ideas and thoughts.

Speaker 2:          18:18          So I feel that it's very important to, uh, to continue speaking and to continue standing up for what one believes in two country, voicing our thoughts. And it's, I don't think it goes in Wayne and I feel like every drop like makes the ocean. Sometimes I might think that my little fight in my, I don't know, maybe in my classroom or in my little workplace is not important. But I do feel that every battle smaller, big actually comes in the larger scheme of things. So I might think that it's very small and you know, it may affect only me and 10 other people, but I think there's a ripple effect. And I feel when people see one person have that courage, it empowers 10 others to have courage. And when those 10 others I empowered then, you know, it's sort of like a ripple effect.

Speaker 2:          19:02          And I feel it also like creates a sense of network and you know, being able to have solidarity with other people who might be facing such similar issues and all of that. So I think that, uh, it's really, really important. Also, I feel like, I think the one thing that I realized when this entire thing happened is that I was very secure in the area that I live in a free and democratic country. And, uh, you know, like India, so, you know, healthy, bustling democracy. And when, uh, the film was, uh, uh, you know, it was refused certification. I think the thing the thought that really hit me is that I didn't realize or notice as free, you know, and I think, um, and then I also started thinking that, uh, so this is like, it's been 70 years since an air became independent. And I started thinking that, uh, you know, this freedom that was fought for, uh, by many, many people in many sacrifices with me to, you know, get it off the British and become free and all of that.

Speaker 2:          20:04          I was like, we have to reimagine that freedom. Like it's not like what can we became free. We got ourselves a great constitution and it's all good. Like people go vote. I just feel for every generation you have to sort of, we had your own battles and reclaim that freedom. And I realize nobody's coming and gifting me my gender equality and my freedom of expression in like a little bag with a pink bow and I'll open it up. I'm like, oh wow. I realized that I was like, thing is freedom is guaranteed to us by the constitution and gender qualities or I mean the equality between men and women is, is guarantee to us with, until we claim it and make it real. And it's, and that has to be an active thing. It's not like it's a static thing. So I just felt that, you know, like I can't be like India is like this or whatever, like, and this has happened to me over here.

Speaker 2:          20:52          If I'm an Indian citizen, then I should try to utilize my rights to speak up and utilize the system to get me the freedom that I feel I'm on because I am a citizen of this country. So I just feel it becomes, uh, it needs to be a more active process and I feel we need to keep doing this I guess after every few years because we otherwise we just sort of becomes like a dead sort of a space, which I think with cinema in India in the sense of even living with censorship forever and I think with Tony now than the last like year or two years, it's really been blowing up in everybody's face because you realize that you don't have to, I never given independent and we have this, uh, censorship system and nobody was really like questioning it in such a big way. But no, I think it's just like, it's just moving up in everyone's face and lived in like, we do read on one date, but I think it's up to us to actually change the system.

Speaker 1:          21:46          What does this movie mean for girls, young girls? I know it's late oriented, has sexual language and all of those types of things. But what do you think for our girls who are trying to find their courage, find their voice, all of these things that we've been talking about, what could this movie mean for them?

Speaker 2:          22:05          Um, I guess I would want every girl to interpret it in her own way, but if I do, um, and you know, I don't know up to her what she sort of wants to take back from it. But I guess if I had to sort of, um, uh, think about it in terms of thematically, um, I think it's very important for women to put themselves first. I think as women we are constantly being conditioned to put ourselves second, you know, it's always like duty forest and like what have to do with my family falls. What makes, I don't know. Like, so I think that, um, in a sense the film is also about what happens when these four women try to put their own desires and their own dreams before anything else. So I feel as women, you know, sometimes we, we don't even realize how conditioned we are, do not put ourselves first and never give us, give us gift ourselves.

Speaker 2:          23:02          Was that freedom that I think we all sort of dissolve. And I also feel like a sister would like, not that the film is overtly at all about sisterhood, but I feel like if we're watching the film you feel like, um, there may be so many women and I don't know what their stories are and let me have like the heart to embrace them because I do feel, I feel really want things to change. Um, I think women really have to sort of get together and really support each other for any real change to happen. And we don't even realize it. And something like the glass ceiling, um, I feel it's like boys gloves and this whole locker room thing and the golf course for everybody. I mean there are ways that, um, and the fact that, you know, we keep saying that all women are threatened by other women in the workplace, for instance.

Speaker 2:          23:53          It's because women have had such few opportunities. And that may not even be the case, but I feel it's also patriarchal construct that is fed into, I had said, you know, no woman will ever look out for you. No one is going to give you a helping hand because you know, women are supposed to, so I feel like we ourselves need to break through like all of these myths. And I do feel that it's important for us to have that. And I feel like sometimes just share, you know, being, being able to listen to another person's story and giving them that kind of time and having that sense of empathy, um, leads to a lot of change. So I think, uh, for me, I would feel like if you know, for those two as well, actually, whether it's men or women, whoever watches a film, I'm just feel like they can see the four women with all their hopes and their dreams, their laughter, their heartbreak, the ambition, their passion. And at the end of the two was just feel like they do, you know, they're friends with those people and they actually know them. I think my job is a flamingo would be done after,

Speaker 1:          24:54          well you set the bar pretty high lipstick under my burqa. So my question is what's next for you? And I must see that. I wish I was like, I was so clear it was like one next thing. But uh,

Speaker 2:          25:07          yeah, I think I'm like in a state of confusion because there are like two or three things in my head, but I must see them actually were preoccupied by the idea of a women finding themselves and women finding strength. So all the stories that I'm dabbling within my head are about, um, you know, needs a women, but I don't know which one I'm going to really do for us, but they are definitely, I feel like I'm very, very, uh, passionate about telling stories, telling stories about women from a female point of view. And that that's what actually drives me to make films on the way that would not do that. So, yeah. So it's going to be, I mean, it will be about that, but I don't know which one I'm going to. Well, let's see what works out.

Speaker 1:          25:51          Okay, well I definitely want to open it up for sure.

Speaker 3:          25:55          So I'll ask you for a little bit of a social commentary if that's okay. Uh, so we, I think we all know about Yarra, a trouble with the CDFC and, uh, we are sorry about that because we all enjoy good cinema. Um, so I do agree and we all know that India does have its problems, like with its female infanticide, whether it's harassment with her glass ceilings. Uh, but do you feel India has, you know, made good progress for the last 70 years? The reason why I'm asking is now we do see, you know, films like yours or Bar Star mom coming out of Bali board. Uh, the top three CEOS in India or women who are the CEO's of nationalized banks or banks. Um, and you know, we've had very powerful woman, chief ministers, prime ministers, precedent, you know, which hasn't been achieved, even advanced nations. Uh, so I'm wondering if, uh, you know, do you see that we are the same old patriarchy are, are we are making progress or are there really to India is like the urban educated India and the rural somewhat backward India.

Speaker 4:          27:09          Um, that's a very way have a very good question. And I must say, I don't damn fully equipped to answer it, but from my own, I mean I can only express my own opinion. Definitely things have changed I think go once. I mean the many more women are being educated and many more women are um, you know, for instance in banking jobs, um, and many more women in the workforce overall. So, and of course we've had, um, many more female politicians. I mean South Asia has that trend. Um, and earlier at an earlier time you've had many female politicians across South Asia compared to the Western world. Um, but I feel that, um, I wouldn't gloat over that progress because I feel we have such a long way to go. And being a woman who has grown up in India, definitely I feel like there is change and there is progress.

Speaker 4:          28:06          In a normal kind of way. Um, but have things really changed in terms of our women still see if on the streets, if there's still a dowry, is there still marital rape is still illegal. Uh, I mean it's not illegal in India, so, oh, I feel we have a very, very, or long we'd go and I don't know, I feel like while it's good to make a note of various things that are changing, it's not, uh, the change. I don't think, I mean I don't feel like posting, I'd be really very satisfied with that change because I feel they will be a long way to go. And, uh, and I feel like that is still, for instance, even if you look at like the number of women making films in India, it is so minuscule compared to the number of films that are made in the country.

Speaker 4:          28:57          And I do feel many of these things are not specific to India. Like the glass ceiling for instance, is something that is a problem across the world. Uh, you know, sexual harassment at the workplace and things like that. Some things are more specific to India, which is like, um, you know, there's still that stigma attached to being a widow. And, uh, this kind of being very disheartened when a girl child is born. So not to say things are not changing. They are, but I feel not dynamically enough, not fast enough. And in many ways things are not changing at all. So I do feel like, um, um, but degree I feel like we used to be just physical safety of, you know, of, of women and overall the sense of like, even if you'll see the number of women who actually go into any, like the number of women who actually enrolled in a course to study.

Speaker 4:          29:50          And then when you see like the number of women actually pursuing that profession, both authorities, there's like a huge sort of drop. And I do feel even when women are working, it's like, you know, it's like the Labor is not shared in terms of the home space. So I just feel that we have a very, very, or, um, uh, we have a long way to go. And I just feel that, uh, uh, I think I would rather see all the anon stuff because I feel like we can sit on those laurels and they don't. Uh, because even having a had a female prime minister and having had a female president, it didn't change the situation and the grass root level in terms of uh, you know, many things. Visa, we dilute ed educational, the lack of nutrition for a goals and things like that. So I just feel that we really do have a, um, a long way to go. I hope I've tried to answer. And as about doing this, I think there are many, many Indians and there's a really interesting country because there's so much diversity and everybody's reality is different. I do feel it's not that there are not problematic things. Um, [inaudible] uh, upper middle class educated people, I feel like even visa be gender issues, I think that a lot of issues even over there. So I think, yeah, those do cut across classes as well.

Speaker 5:          31:12          You mentioned that like you have a few projects that you're not trying to figure out what's next. So hose, like how was this experience like, how has it impacted your decisions? Like how do you kind of keep it like a, you know, I'm not going to learn these and this experience impact my decisions? Like will you be more like, hey, maybe there's a controversial subject that's, you know, your new next project and [inaudible] given my experience, you know, I should just see away from it for a while. Or, I mean it's easier to say that it will take for the open mind and like look at scripts in that way. But how is this experience like how's it changed you in any way?

Speaker 4:          31:50          I think it's definitely or changed me and it's grown me up. It's been a very long and difficult or journey to, um, to make this film right from the start. And, uh, yeah, and I think that, I think the main thing it's taught me in life is that a do not give up because it was really difficult even getting the film, uh, you know, out there in many other ways and all of that, not just a censorship otherwise, although it's been a very, very long and difficult journey. So I think, uh, uh, it has taught me that you do not give up because I think this feminism, this is my second feature film. I think my first feature film was perhaps easier than this one. But, um, I think the only thing that's clear to me that I should try and focus on, make, you know, making the kinds of films and telling stories that I really believe in because I feel if I didn't believe 100% on this film, I would not have been able to sustain this very long journey that it's taken me to write to the time when I thought of the film, do like writing and getting it into production, finishing and getting, you know, getting distribution, getting released, the wholesome shit thing.

Speaker 4:          32:57          So I think it's just reinforced the idea that it's very important for me to have like complete conviction in what I'm doing because you don't know what like how long you have to keep fighting for, uh, for what you've created. So it's, uh, I mean the fact that I had 100% faith and conviction in, in, in, in the story, in the film, I think that was a really important, and I think that is something I think I'm just nervous about that, that whatever I do, I should feel that a hundred percent conviction because you really don't know. And I am an independent for, so I feel, I don't feel, I mean, I'm sure I will have other issues and runnings. I'm not expecting some bed roses after this. So, um, I just feel that whatever it is, it should be like, you know, something that I really believe in 100% and I can stake my life on it.

Speaker 3:          33:41          I'm sorry I missed the first 20 minutes. I'm not sure if you answered it then. It doesn't matter. We'll answer again. Yeah. I mean, especially in India, it's always been the movies that have been like a major player in perpetuating stereotypes and stigma or they mostly just objectify women and the people, I mean, the general public is also interested in just commercial movies, which like how like, you know, like two or three songs and they just want to have a fun time and that's where all the market is and that's where all the money is. So if the film industry is going to keep doing that, like objectify women, perpetuate stereotypes, uh, I mean that, I mean, for me that looks like the single most important player in doing all those stuff. If that's not going to change, do you think, uh, you know, how, how do you, how do you see the Bollywood or like industry moving towards like, you know, uh, more, uh, focusing towards feminism and stuff like that?

Speaker 4:          34:31          I think you're absolutely right. And I completely agree that, um, uh, you know, a lot of the 10 big Bollywood tentpole kind of films, uh, they really, uh, I think mindlessly they keep, I don't even think that plan is to necessarily perpetuate, uh, the objectification of women. I think they do or don't even think about it. And, um, uh, I do think that it's very important, particularly if look for a country like India because I feel the way we portray love, for instance, talking is portrayed as love. And I feel like, um, you know, cinema and other kinds of popular culture and society, they just keep feeding off each other and that's just how it is on the streets. And that's just like, so you're constantly reinforcing the idea that, you know, a guy will go and grab this woman's arm and he'll be like, she doesn't even know me.

Speaker 4:          35:20          He's like, I love you. And five scenes later, rather than calling him out on his stockish tie behavior, she's going to be like, I love you too. So therefore the idea that is being propagated is that that's how you, you know, go out. Uh, so I do feel that all of it are and way like the fact that we still have something, all the item song of the usage of the word item for the woman I think is awful. And the fact that the camera goes up and down a woman's body when she's randomly dancing to some strange like double meaning lyrics like your chicken, etc. And uh, you know, like it's, uh, and, and the cameras is going up and down her body though it has no connection with the story or anything. And the fact that people are watching it and not thinking about it.

Speaker 4:          36:05          I, I feel it's very, very problematic and it bothers me a lot. I don't, I mean, I think the only thing we can do is to continue to ensure that there are more alternative films out there and hope that people like come and watch them. So I think the very encouraging thing about the release of lipstick and my worker in, uh, in India was that it actually did really well commercially. And people actually came to the theater to see it and nobody was really expecting that. So I think, uh, um, I don't know, it is a sign of some sort of, uh, you know, at least interest in something else. But I think you're right. It's a very, very entrenched system. But I guess, uh, the audience is also like largely responsible because I feel that, um, until people don't start rejecting these films, um, money's always going to be put into them.

Speaker 4:          36:54          So I think between the audience and the studios who don't have that much courage and therefore they keep, you know, they feel it's very safe and it's some money spinner and all of that and they're not even thinking about what is being made. So I feel like actually everybody has to take like a step forward, whether it is a writers were right to continuing to ride these films or directors are continuing to direct these films without any kind of like a critical thought about what it is that they're sort of doing a, you know, so I feel the entire system, whether it's a good geographers, it's like the literacies everyone. So I think like it has to, everyone has to take a step forward. But I think the biggest steps will be taken by a need to be taken by the audience because these films exist because the audience is watching, watching them. And I think the second thing is other studios, the studios really have to take a call that these are not the kind of films you want to, uh, promote. Yeah. But we have to keep fighting because otherwise like there's no future.

Speaker 6:          37:50          So how practical do you think, um, it is for women to put herself first write down? Do you think the society and the family will understand that she's doing this for a reason? Or does she have to win the battle eventually?

Speaker 7:          38:06          Yeah,

Speaker 4:          38:06          I mean, I guess it's different depending on who the woman is and in what case. And it's not, I mean, I guess it's very difficult to all that I'm put yourself first. But I do think it's time that women thought of themselves, not as just the hubs of, you know, or just standing behind somebody, but really about what they want. And that in, in every aspect of their lives because I do feel that, uh, the fulfillment of women as lost on priority in any kind of a scenario, you know, it's always, um, so I don't feel it's, it's important and I think we must think about it, uh, about like the world that we want to leave behind because I feel if we don't make that effort, we are so then like the generation after us will like, so I think we are very odd because people before us Fortive they're taught that we should not even make the effort that women are equally integrated into political life.

Speaker 4:          39:05          Like even whether they have the right to vote. So then we will be still fighting for the right to vote, you know, or the right to like study or whatever. So I just feel like every generation needs to take it upon itself to go a step further so that at least what you look kind of world that you leave behind for the next generation there is, I mean it's a little better. It can't be that the world I inhabited. I wouldn't just leave it in the same way. Like I just feel our purpose as human beings is, has got to be more than just existing. And I do feel, and that's where I really feel that. Um, so if you know, if it's like if I have a niece or nephew or a younger cousin or a younger sister because I'm not a mom, but if I bought a mother and I had a child, I mean I had a daughter, surely I would, it's like the old world learn by example and even the boys. So if I create a more equal, I made that effort of like knowing what women want is also important. Then those are the things people, especially the younger people around us are going to imbibe and then that's what they want to live out. So I just feel like we all have to, I mean, I don't know. That's how I feel that we all have to take that one one step because otherwise there'll be no change and we'll just be, you know, running, I mean just standing in the same place. Okay.

Speaker 8:          40:20          Just wanted to ask a question about their experiences in the film industry. You've worked with like a lot of, a lot of really illustrious people. I'm just wondering, uh, Hsa [inaudible] cognizant chairman for Catia g. So like some interesting experiences or anecdotes you might have to share with all of us or if any inspiration you've drawn from them or just anything, uh, some of your experiences in the nurse tree. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          40:53          Uh, so I want to say that I'm a very non through me kind of person who's looking in the film industry, but I do feel it's important to look at people as people and not look at them in terms of the major persona they might come with. I feel I've learned a lot from Mr Java cause I've been working with him since I finished, um, college. But apart from like the technical skills at one picks up by working on a set, I think, um, I think from him, I've known some major life lessons. Uh, I think as a filmmaker, the first thing I think that he really taught me that it's very important to have your own voice and whether somebody gets it or they get it or like it's harder for you. You have to figure out who you are and what you want to see through in the sense that not that you often has to have a message, but you have to, you have to make a film that is honest to you.

Speaker 4:          41:47          And I think that is something that has really stayed with me and told me that before I was making my first film. And I think that is something that, um, I really feel it's very, very important that it's not because I feel like everyone has different strengths and every storyteller, every filmmaker need not the other person. It's very important to listen to oneself and figure out what is it that I want to see and then see it even though knowing so with me is that I know that I have chosen a more difficult path, but I've done in New England because I know this is what I want to do is what I feel passionately about. So think that was one very important thing that I learned to when the second thing was of course to have the courage to see things till the end no matter what.

Speaker 4:          42:26          And I think that lesson has also really been, uh, a guiding sort of light in my life because I feel many times I haven't been in a situation where I think without that, um, sense of perseverance I may have given up. But I think it's also something I learned very early on, um, through a lot of my interactions with him about not, you know, what, seeing things like senior Phil, no matter what happens to it, I'm seeing it through right until the end, no matter what it takes. So think those are the two leg really important things I learned from him. And I think, um, from Kankana and a wrap, no, I feel like, uh, with me, if I worked with an actor, I feel once the actor has decided they're going to work on my film, it doesn't matter how what they've done before.

Speaker 4:          43:12          Uh, of course I respect the fact that the accomplished actors where I feel we're starting afresh. And I think what I love about, um, a flatland gone going number with is that, uh, they never came with any kind of baggage about how great their past has been or anything. And I think, uh, um, Yan, they, them, I didn't have to, like, we did a lot of preparatory work for the film, like lots of rehearsals, workshops, readings, and uh, wrap nine Concannon did exactly the same amount of work as the two other girls in the film were actually new actors. There was no difference. And, uh, and I think that is what makes, um, uh, artists great when they don't have a sense of arrogance about, you know, feeling like, oh, I already know it all. I don't need to put in the effort. I think it was very, very clear and everyone puts in a lot of effort and there was no sense of uh, um, you know, I'm already on national award winning actor. I don't need to do rehearsals for one month for like shooting for 20 days, but they all did it. So I feel like, uh, uh, I, I think there was that instinctive sort of, you know, bonding over that this is how we see the filament is how we're going to sort of, uh, sort of work. So I feel like for me in the good learning in that was that, um, I think for all of us, we should never become, uh, um, arrogant our craft

Speaker 2:          44:32          in terms of like nothing or whiskey booking do. How can I hone my craft more and how can I deepen my art more and how can I, um, yeah, become better and better at what I do. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          44:43          That's awesome. Thank you so much for your questions. So we have like one minute to go. I do want to ask a final closing question. What do you want your audience to take away from this movie?

Speaker 2:          44:55          Hmm. I think a month's, a little like what I said about what the goods like should feel. But yeah, I just feel like, um, I don't believe in this idea of messaging so much. So I feel it's a story about for ordinary women of different ages. So I actually want people to just experience their lives, um, for those two hours and laugh and cry and smile with them and feel with them and go back home thinking about them.

Speaker 1:          45:24          Let's think Alan creative for her time. This has been amazing. Thank you so much.
