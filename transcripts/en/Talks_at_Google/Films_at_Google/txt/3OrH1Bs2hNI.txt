Speaker 1:          00:05          Hi everyone. Welcome to talks at Google. Today is my pleasure to welcome director Danny Boyle.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Hello.

Speaker 1:          00:16          We're here for trainspotting t two trainspotting. Yes. Uh, and it's 21 years later. So you guys have a crack at writing SQL awhile back. And you know, you'd mentioned that it didn't quite work and so you guys came back and revisited what was it between the, that version and the one you've just written that really was like the difference between like, this is actually a movie we want to make. I think you was

Speaker 3:          00:37          that we were very, um, I'm sure that person was fine, but we, there was no reason to make it other than the fact that urban had published a novel and then it felt like a commercially, you know, a debt thing to do. And when you read it, you just feel, you just felt wretched. And I think, I think the reason for that was that you realize that, um, if you were going to approach it again because there was this affection for the original, the w did, it's sustained, that people would be incredibly disappointed if you just went back for it for that reason. So it was kind of risky. Commercially it's obvious to go back to it. Um, but actually in truth it was very, very, it's very risky unless you had something personal, some real powerful reason to make it like we had for the first time we were, we approached the book, which nobody wanted us to do because people couldn't see how it could be called Boma film and the kind of type of people it was about was where, where would, where would not be attractive on film, UN, UN, UN, UN, UN, uh, more than that, that would be unacceptable really.

Speaker 3:          01:43          But we had a passion for that and you have to find that passion in the new version. Otherwise you'll, you'll, you'll just end up disappointing people and, um, and then they will crucify you. And rightly so because you kind of gone back to something that has, has a value in their life that you're lucky to have that place, you know, so it was, it was age really. And um, for all of us involved, for me and the screenwriter initially John who, who had himself a bit of a medical emergency, I don't know if you've seen the film of any, have you seen it yet? No. Well, does it kind of like, you'll see it as a kind of like, so I know what to give away and not one, not to give away. Anyway, there was, he'd had a kind of medical emergency which gave him a bit of a crisis and that's the focus part of the film is what triggers the re-ignition of their time together and the, their friendship again.

Speaker 3:          02:33          Um, and then it was really, it was weird doing it because the film is really you really part of making the film was realizing what the first film was about, which we didn't really know cause everybody said it's a drug film. And we said, no, it's not. It's a film about friendship and things like that. But actually the first film is a study of energy and you thought, or you boyhood, if you like, is a better way of putting it. And this is actually about the transition and how badly man make it to manhood really is sort of what it's about really. And uh, and we learned while making it home much, although winning get terrible flack for age and time, actually women age much better than men way, but men are terrible at it. They just, we hang onto the past in a way that's actually eventually embarrassing and you don't realize it.

Speaker 3:          03:24          Um, and you'll see that in the film really. And it's one of the, and it's, it's one of the things that makes the film attracts it because they do try and we live in the past. That's not just a commercial reason to do it. They literally do try and the effort was Bravard or the past is kind of saw attractive to them. And there's a couple of seasons where they do that, but actually it's inappropriate. No, in a way. And, and anyway, on women age and much, much faster. And they're all women in the film who, um, they don't have a huge amount to do, but what they do, they do devastatingly well, really. I'm like, Oh God,

Speaker 1:          03:57          yeah. Women, women have always been sort of a catalyst for the characters in this for me at least as a viewer, I'm like, okay, well there, you know, part of yeah. Of what has driven them, these guys to do these things. And it was interesting because both Diane and Gail's characters are back in this, it's the whole cast is back. Yeah. Um, but was there ever a point where you guys were like, actually we might explore and we do see more of that with like big beast family, but were you ever considering putting more of the female perspective in or is it, I mean, obviously the first one is so much about like these, this guy dynamic. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          04:25          Yes. It is a, and it was um, it was, I mean we did, when we set up the film, the, the key questions that people asked is, would the four guys that come back again to be at the center of the film, would it be the same actors? And, but the second question, people always ask these would Kelly McDonald comeback to play Diane? And she does. And uh, and but we had another scene for her later. So she did have a bigger part to play and we caught it because it diminished her. And it's weird the way film works. It doesn't work. Like it is almost script at all and it's slightly, it was better that she just has this one central scene, which he does beautifully and UN and it's devastating nuclear war. How much more successfully she's dealt with time then the Renton has dealt with time. Um, and uh, so we actually, if anything in editing, we reduced it. Really, their agency is very important in the, in the film, but it is quiet. Yes.

Speaker 1:          05:24          And, and that's not to say there aren't strong female characters in it, but it was, it was interesting because they were returning, um, uh, you know, family and father son dynamics are also a big part of this. Again, as a viewer, at least I felt. And I'm curious like, you know, in the first one it is all about youth and questionable moral decisions, but adding a family layer definitely sort of changes that. Were you at all afraid that it would adjust like the tone or was it just like, no, this is actually the way, the best way to display some of these evolutions of these characters?

Speaker 3:          05:54          Yeah, there's a whole bunch of kids running around all the way through it. Some of them are, uh, kind of from, some of them are images of themselves as children. Some of them are, are, are there children who are very disappointed in their fathers and some of whom are imaginary children in one of the characters cases. Um, um, and I know obviously it's kind of from, from a commercial point of view that's very unattractive because everybody wants to believe still that there, like they were in the first film where they were running around in this completely care careless world. But it's, it's honest about really where they are and it, and it was quite interesting that the four actors all became fathers after that film. Um, the original film, they weren't fathers when we made that film and they've all become fathers. No. So it is very much a, uh, like you said, it's a look at fatherhood in, in different relationships with their own children and, and also with their own fathers in a way.

Speaker 3:          06:47          There's a couple of key scenes about their own fathers as well. So that dynamics very important to it as well, which doesn't make it sound very attractive. It makes it turn rather of, I can hear it as I'm saying it, you think, oh my God, what have they done to train spotting? But actually it's really, there's an honesty in it that's really essential to it really. And you and you have to find this balance. When you do a sequel like this, there's an extraordinary balance you have to find between, everybody wants it the same but different. And it's that kind of thing where it's got to be, it's got to have these trigger points, these kind of muscle memories of the first film. But also to have any honesty it's got to be different because they're 46, no, you know, not 25. Um, so it's the difference in that really.

Speaker 1:          07:30          Um, one, uh, one of the things with that is like there is a good deal of humor in this, right? It's not like a dark, like we're making it sound very dark and dramatic, but there were like there's a ton of humor, but how do you balance like those moments and how do you make sure that humor is something that's universal because there was also a lot of, you know, a lot of it does have to do the UK culture and the source material, but how do you manage that ship? Like

Speaker 3:          07:54          you can't really think like that really. Cause that's very much a studio perspective. How can we make sure this humor applies everywhere and it's deadly. I think, you know, I mean it's not in terms of Pixar and things like that, you know they do it brilliantly, but in terms of the stuff I do, it would be deadly if you started to worry about how's that going to play. Especially with characters like this because again, the first thing you do is start reducing their accents so they were more comprehensible, which would be incredibly on truthful to them as characters because they're there. Their accents is, it identifies them in a way. It's a kind of defiant pride in in how local their culture is, you know, verbally anyway, and the linguistics that's in urban while she's books. I like that the book is a challenge to you from the get goal as soon as you open it, it's like that's a challenge and can I do it?

Speaker 3:          08:43          And obviously as the way we know with accents it they unlock. If your patient, they unlock very quickly for you, but you can't compromise that upfront, which it would be the tendency to do to make it more palatable or to make sure that it traveled. Really, you just hope that it will do that. People will see things in it that they recognize across cultures, I guess. I guess aging is a universal thing across cultures, whether or not we want it to be. It is, it's in the post for all of us. So it's, it will be there even though you don't like acknowledging it sometimes. Um, but yeah, it's there for everyone. President, whether you're president or whether you're homeless, it's the same applies. If you could go back 21 years and tell yourself one thing about where either your journey or where this film's journey was going to take you, would you take the opportunity and if so, what would you tell yourself?

Speaker 3:          09:31          Oh my God, that's like those letters that people write to themselves as younger people. My God, I don't know what I'd say really. I've been very lucky really with the stuff I've done. I mean, I think I'd probably put more time in with my kids. Really. I haven't, because I've been out doing stuff like this and making films and stuff like that. So I suppose I'd say look out for that a bit more really. Cause the kind of, you can't repeat it back again, but us as terribly depressing thoughts really. Um, yeah. Enjoy culture, really. That, so that's, that's the, that's the most important thing. I think it's weird. We were just talking about this before about, um, someone said, um, what, so Renton in the film, I was a terrible crisis. His relationship in Amsterdam was broken down and that's what, and what's one of the things that drives him back and he has nothing.

Speaker 3:          10:19          The relationship has broken down. She's taken the hose that they were living in. He has these kind of, well I won't tell you, but uh, cause that will spoil it. But he's in crisis about, and this guy says to me, what would you say to a guy like that who's 46? He has a line in the film where he says, I'm 46 and I'm fucked. And what would you say to a guy like that? And I was trying to think, what would you say someone like that and I all you would say is reach for culture really. Cause it can save you in a way that I, I've learned over time. Um, and, and when, and the, and the future that we all face know with jobs becoming more Ramal or becoming, you know, um, not being there anymore because of Robert's ization or mechanization or you just reached for culture, you know, it'll save you in the end.

Speaker 3:          11:09          That's my own personal philosophy. You know, it's like, I think you know, you, why do you read, you read that. That's what they say, isn't that you, when you read a novel, you read to know you're not alone. That's why we read weirdly, it's a solitary occupation. But actually you read to know you're not alone because you recognize things and w and that written the reach of culture is, and I know it's a terrible time at the moment because, and it certainly is in Britain a way, culture is just sneer that and kind of disparaged and it's an end. It's not about politics, culture, it's actually about something much more important than everyday politics. It's actually about something deep that connects people across cultures, across their individual cultures and across time. I think it'd be fair to say that the world as a whole,

Speaker 1:          11:54          including like the UK and the US have changed dramatically. Like politically since you guys even film the film, right? Like forget since the first one. But since the production of this film, we've had a lot of changes but our horse Brexit, but is there any part of the film that took on sort of an additional context for you because of the time that it was getting released now?

Speaker 3:          12:14          Well, date, they come in and out of focus. Weirdly, I remember we, we, we, we, we shot the, we shot 28 days later. Um, w when we, this a horror movie that we made, we kind of butt and when we shot it, the idea of the film was that it was about social rage because there've been a number of instances, which you hear about it occasionally, but there'd been a particular number of instances in Britain of people literally having arguments in, in, in traffic jams and getting out and stabbing each other, you know, that kind of incredible intolerant rage of each other that was happening. So that was our philosophy for the film. That was like, wow, we'll make a film about social rage. And the thing that drives these zombies was actually a kind of thing tolerance of each other. And that was our philosophy and everything.

Speaker 3:          12:59          We set it to make the film. We shot the opening in London in the summer, you know what he's wondering, run London on his own and it's empty. And then we started shooting the main body of the film in nine 11 happened and the film came home and the film was not about social rage, it was a boat, the vulnerability of cities. It was weird about, and it was, and it was an a think in the film was a hit here. And I absolutely know that was the reason because it was, it was the first film out with a block that dad look up the terror of feeling incredibly vulnerable in these amazing cities. We build free for ourselves. And you can't predict that, you know, you just, there's no way you'll know that. So sometimes they swim in and out of focus really. And you can't say what there'll be, they take so long to make the bone not to be applicable to daily politics. I mean, otherwise you'd make documentaries and make them very, very quickly and get them out. Like John Lennon used to say, you read, sing the song in the morning and have it on the streets in the afternoon. But um, otherwise they're never going to be up to date. But you do read things into them for sure. And um, I don't know what you'd reading to this one about Brexit and about Trump or anything like that. I just don't know. Maybe people will see things in them that has some kind of resonance on that level,

Speaker 1:          14:13          spoil anything. I feel like just because there were a couple of months where I was like, oh okay that's, that's something that, I don't know if that was the filmmaker's intention, but it for me where I live and you know, the climate I live in that had a different meaning that I think it might have originally,

Speaker 3:          14:26          well we were shooting, we were shooting when the Brexit vote happened and there is a kind of, there's a plot elements in it to do with the European Union, but we kind of get, we couldn't get her hedge run them or ramifications of it. So we, we just shot it anyway. And it, and it's in the film as a as it is at the moment though, we still don't know what will actually happen with Britain and Europe fully. Although it looks like Brexit will happen. Yeah. And if it does happen, Scotland will almost certainly go. That seems very clear cause, well although we were shooting there at the time and it wasn't, it was an, it was a vote to leave the European Union. Uh, Scotland voted 62% to stay in. So Scotland will break away from the United Kingdom and stay in Europe. The Scots don't like the English anyway. They never have done, not since 17 or seven when they were bonded together. So the opportunity to finally get away from them, they, they'll, they'll palliate to the French. What's more than the English anyway, the Scots, they are always known for that. That's called the old alliance, the relationship of Scotland and France.

Speaker 1:          15:23          It is interesting how like the first film just took on this, like it became this purely Scott like a Scottish thing, right? It's, it's, is it interesting for you not being Scottish first of all to be at the helm of that and to see the second one given that timing come out, like reignite that sort of like, yeah. Scotland pry like and you're like, am I going to be responsible for this?

Speaker 3:          15:44          It is interesting working in Scotland. I, I did enjoy it. They are tough. They don't suffer fools gladly. There's no kind of Hollywood welcome of kind of light, you know, um, and you and you and you have to earn your right to be there really to work there. Especially in film terms. I felt that very strongly in making the first film. And I'm, I'm not, I'm not a nor what I claim to be an honorary Scott, I'm far to a county to ever say that. My background is, I actually Irish, I come from Manchester, return in the northwest or an industrial town in the northwest of England and uh, my heritage is all Irish really. So maybe that was why they accepted me, you know. Anyway, we did W it's Joanie that he deploys to more than anything. I say Johnny Lee Miller, who's one of the four guys, cause he's not Scottish.

Speaker 3:          16:29          And um, when we made the first film, he adapted, he did that method thing where he just adapted the Scottish accent in his daily life as well. And I remember Kelly MacDonald who with, she was really upset when we stop filming because he, he, they were, we were having a party afterwards and he was talking and he's natural accent. She was really upset that he'd lied to her all the way through, you know, and she was really genuinely very upset about it. She still talks about it. Didn't know cause she'd been completely taken in by him. Um, as a, as an, as a, as a a fake Scott really.

Speaker 1:          17:06          So that's like the highest compliment is an actor. I assume I was like got a doctor, but you still have to deal with her upset you and you and Johnny work together. It like super recently to write on Frankenstein Frankenstein. Yes, yes. Yeah. Is it, is it sort of interesting shifting mediums like that and like coming back to not only film with him but something that, you know, he and the rest of the cast had been with so long ago? Yes. Yes. It

Speaker 3:          17:33          was extraordinary. Like, what are the key jobs as a director of a large part of your job as a director with actors is that they're often very, eh, they're like on eggshells at the beginning. They bit careful, a bit wary of doing too, too soon until they find their feet and, and understand what the process is and how that, how close they are to the character and stuff like that. And part of your job as a director is to encourage them, um, over that chasm of confidence really to get them to step forward. Especially because I quite like big performances. I'm not a kind of mumble core kind of salt, social realist, kind of just do nothing with the lines, just let the camera do everything. I quite like performance. Um, but on this it was the opposite. They had that built in to them cause they, they'd obviously been in the first movie, it had done very well for everyone and they personally felt absolutely in charge of that character and they were very clear about what that character would and wouldn't do.

Speaker 3:          18:34          You know they had a, they knew him even though they hadn't done him for 20 years. So that was weird. They, they um, you had to step up as a crew and as a director you have to lift yourself straight away cause they were, they were at 100% straight away, which is unusual on a film. You know normally your pussyfooting around for the first few days really. And you can often see that in a film, which is obviously done out of order, but you can often see the films that aren't quite, and they're often the first days of filming where people are not sure of what, what they're doing. But there was none of that. No, they were fully ready to go. What was the first thing you guys feel forward? The foreseen we thought first thing. So when people watch it again, there's a scene under a pub with Begbie comes back and see sick boy for the first time. Is that, so that's the Robert Carlisle character and the Johnny Lee Miller character. And they got under the seller of the pub and, and the, where there is adult farm, cause he's doing a bit of cultivating on the quiet sick boy and they have this discussion about taking revenge or Renton together. And you'll see that's the first scene we shot. And the crew was shocked at how big the scene wall straight away like, um, and we all had to lift our game from there.

Speaker 1:          19:47          Know, speaking of drugs. Um, so again, the world has changed a great deal since and I don't know of heroin and heroin use, even drug use aside from maybe like the fight over here at least over like is should marijuana be legal? Like I feel like it has taken sort of a back seat. And you guys do address a little bit about like the other ways people distract ourselves if it's digital, if it's, you know, running. Um, but, but was there ever a temptation to sort of update more of the story to be involved more of these like other distractions that people are more engaged in?

Speaker 3:          20:21          No, the, I mean there is a big speech about it. Um, he, he does have a choose life speech, which is because of an update really have is what was quite a famous speech about, you know, the choices that society offers and eat. There is an update. I think you guys are mentioned in its one point. Yep. That's probably, again, it's one of those objective viewer things where you're like, um, all the different choices that are available, social media, no, et cetera along like that. But actually the speech is really about, it's, it's actually a confession in the end that um, he hasn't made good choices really it becomes a confession by the end of it. Um, no, I, and I think like the drug use thing there, there are some drugs in the film, but again, it's appropriate to 46 year old guys. So there's a lot more viagara in the film.

Speaker 3:          21:10          Then there is, um, some of the other drugs of choice in the, in, in the first film. So in fact, Begbie takes so much Viagra. At one point, he medically, his heart would explode, but it doesn't fortunately for the film. But um, you, you have to see that to see what happens. What does it explode? Yeah. Is that the type of thing you have to do research and before like, okay, he can take this many people. Well then you get an Edison cope together and taking lots of Viagra pills. So it's eight s fake. It's not fake by I grew, but it's um, Viagara from China rather than correct. [inaudible] street. [inaudible] street via ground. Um, so what do you, what do you think the role of

Speaker 1:          21:55          failure is? Because these are characters who failed time and time again and they keep going. And I don't know, like I, I'm sure we all are. We're humans. We experienced failure, right? And it's, it's either internalized and like, Hey, I think this is a failure when really it's people could be like, this is a smashing success. So what do you think like that role plays either in the characters, in film making in life?

Speaker 3:          22:19          The film is as characters, they are failures, absolute failures. I mean in the first film, the only success in the first film is that he steals the money off his friends, which is, can hardly be looked at as trial color. Um, so it's, it's saturated with failure really. But film is odd and especially film that has a sense of humor and a kind of independence of spirit. It doesn't come across like that does it? You don't think when you leave the other film, Wow. Their failures aren't they? If anything, you kind of like think they're cool, you're rooting for them. Yeah. But he's like morally reprehensible, but also they were attractive as well, even though they are morally reprehensible and it carries on into this film as well, I think is that, you know, they're not until spot or something right at the end of the film, which is truly transformational in a way that you'd never expected on thing.

Speaker 3:          23:10          What they amount to his failures, you know? Um, but again, film has that weird thing of elevating people and it's why we cut the duck. The scene we were talking about earlier about this Diane scene that we caught. We caught it because it made her ironically made her look like a failure. No matter how we played it or cut it, it made her look like a failure, which is completely wrong, you know? And yet that's because you're following Renton, you're emotionally empathizing with rents and really with presumably without fully understanding the crisis is in, you know, it is very film does mythologize people. And it was one of the interesting things about, about doing this film and explained it to the actors before we started that we were going to unlock that image people had of them in the first film because film is extraordinary.

Speaker 3:          23:57          It is. Film is time, isn't it? When you edit film, it's all you're doing is extending time or compressing it. That's what you do with editing. It's just that the whole time. And you have this additional power where you can freeze time. And I think we do that in movies. We have, uh, you know, especially our favorite movies. We have an image, you know, a mind of an actor in a path like boomer Thurman in pulp fiction, you just have an Emmy or John Travolta report, you just have an image of them when you just freeze it in time. And I said to the actors, that was one of the things we were going to try and do. It was on lock that, that, that, that frozen moment with them. Um, which would be very cruel on them and it is very cruel, you know, when you see them in the, in the way you remember them, the skinny, cool guy who smears everything and here's the update right next to each other like that, you know. Um, and it is extraordinary like that film that it can do that, um, as an, as an art form it. But I don't think there is another art form that gets at this anywhere close to having that connection with time like film does, you know,

Speaker 1:          25:03          how do you achieve something like that? Do you talking about that, like that particular scene where you're bringing back basically the ghosts of the versions of them passed. Like, do you have someone on set? Who's the standing? Do you show them that scene beforehand? Do you wait and not show them that scene until afterwards?

Speaker 3:          25:17          Some of it was still enough towards, I had warned them that we were going to do it, but it's done afterwards in a in effect. I mean you used tricks, you, you can have stunned ins too. We cast a lot of young guys who look like them in the first film, including one young guy who'd been tormented throughout his school life because he looked just like you and McGregor in trainspotting and he'd grown up with this. Everybody teased him about it and finally got his own bike. He got to be Ewan Mcgregor. And that was bizarre. You and seeing him, you know, for the first time we ever met him, cause he was dressed as you and walls in the first film and then you meet this kind of doppelganger like, um, what's the great kids? Lawsky Phil is a great kiss. Lawsky filled the boat. The double double life of Veranique is a wonderful film.

Speaker 3:          26:02          Um, you get to meet you. That's what they say, isn't there? There's a double of you somewhere in the world out there. There is an absolute double if you do. But statistically I think that's true, isn't it? Kind of the number of statistical chances of there being someone there is there will be somebody out there who you would, if you met them they would be, it would be like meeting a mirror anyway. That was weird for the axiom that you use. Sometimes you use a double, sometimes you use footage from the original film. Um, yeah, we, we didn't use it. They've changed so much. You can't use them as they're on the stand ins at all under any circumstances, you know, cause they really do look, it is very honest about the film, about what they look like. No. Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:40          Uh, did you experience it all like a sense of Deja Vu because you shot in some of the same places? Obviously you're dealing with the same characters and actors or was it like, nope, this is just a new experience?

Speaker 3:          26:50          The, the, the, the most acute moment was when we went to [inaudible], which was this countryside place in the first film as if a speech where he says it's shite being Scottish and they go out to the countryside for 10 minutes and they hate it, you know, and they decided to go back and take drugs instead. There is a new scene out there again and we went out there and it is obviously exactly the same until the moments in, of course these people passing in front of it or like a fly just moving across it later. But that's 20 years to the moment. And it's just like a movement like that that brings you down to earth. Yeah. Ce Mark. So that's a kind of put and it is a very, very important moment in the film where they, um, there was a reckoning moment there really where they, uh, some of Tommy who, who did, he went out to the countryside with who died of his, uh, his addiction.

Speaker 3:          27:37          Um, there's a reckoning about that in the film as well. Yeah. At that moment, I would like to know who inspires you as a director. As a director? Yeah. Where's the human? But mostly as a director it's like different. I like that young. I did you, did you see don't breathe horror movie. I thought it was so I remember watching that as it director. You watch some time, do you think arc? You know, he could really direct like I thought that was really good. Um, what's he called? Fetty? [inaudible]. Alvaraz is, I think he's called. I remember thinking that. So sorry. That's just jealousy. That's not inspiring. Um, no, I, I, I'm one of your low, I mean, coupler is one of my big, huge inspirations, you know, and not just as a, from everything I've read about it. I mean, I met him once actually, I was like, it's terrible.

Speaker 3:          28:30          Meeting your heroes. I was Jelly, absolute jelly. I mean, I'm a grown man and I was just shaking meeting Francis Ford Coppola, who's just like, who doesn't really care, but everybody's like that with him, I think. Um, so that was quite special. But everything I read about him, um, also confirms what special person is and I think he's work is certainly from one particular period is as good as it gets. Really. You know, that's a big thing for me and another British director who's also a very, very fine mum is very and very elderly. No Nicholas Roeg there they're big inspirations for me. But on a personal directing level, yeah.

Speaker 1:          29:06          Do you find it challenging watching other people's work? Um, like do you or do you find that you're able to disconnect or is it watching it and just being like, oh, I want to do that. And why did he get to do that first?

Speaker 3:          29:15          I'm very good and very good at shit unless it's terrible when you do start to take it apart and I don't take stuff apart at all. I kind of get lost in it and kind of cry and um, it molts and shouting dog breathe. I was shouting, there were like 20 of us in the audience in London watching it in this cinema in Stratford just, and we were shouting and screaming at the, you know, which you don't hear a lot in England. It's kind, you do get that a bit more here in cinemas here. I like that. When an audience is a molt like that start show 10 but you don't, everybody sits in a respectful silence in England. Um, but uh, yeah, no, I'm more like, I, so I don't take it apart. No, I didn't. I tend to get lost in it. Really. I was, I'm very grateful. I do really. And um, especially on planes, I was reading it, but someone saying why we cry on planes g I, I do cry at movies more on planes. The non earth.

Speaker 1:          30:09          I've heard, I'm not kidding. I've heard it's like the elevation. Something about that that makes the tear ducts Ron Moore, the pressure, the pressure to do with pressure. Keira Knightley movie and I'm crying. He's like, wait, they said no, but could be wanting to be a Rockstar, but I'm crying anyway. Um, so you've covered a lot of Sigmadek grounds since the first one. Uh, you've gotten to the slums of India, the canyons of Utah. You've got to silicon valley, a fracking site, lab space. Uh, what's something you've haven't done yet that you would like to

Speaker 3:          30:45          musical? Oh, really? Oh yeah, no, that is, I think for any director. Um, that's the one that's the grail, the holy grail that you'll, you'll, you'll probably never get to. And if you do get to, it probably won't work, but I'm a modern, um, original musical is virtually impossible to pull off. You know, obviously there's been more very recently that did work, but the [inaudible] to get your characters to sing, to actually just start moment of singing. That's the kind of terror moment. Can you do that? Um, so I, I still trying to do that in a way

Speaker 1:          31:24          it's going to say there's very good key musical moment in this film that was like fascinating to watch him, just to give them, they're like the stakes of the circumstances. They were in a good scene. Yeah. Um, so, so a little bit, you can do it a little bit of singing, a little bit of singing,

Speaker 3:          31:39          your move isn't a bit of dancing and all that kind of stuff. So, um, but it's the original concept. But we, we, we did a kids film called millions, which is a lovely little film about two boys. You find a sack of money and it changes their lives. And um, and that was originally meant to be a musical and we were, we had this idea that we get Noel Gallagher to write the songs for these kids because it was sat in Manchester where no comes from as well. And we kind of check into away from it. You need a lot of confidence to pull it off. And we were just seem to lack it in that moment and we made it as a straight film and it's a lovely film. I'm very proud of it. But um, yeah, it should have been a musical cause those kids could have saying then you'd have never questioned why they were singing or you'd have loved them singing, you know. Anyway,

Speaker 1:          32:24          I mean there is this sort of trend of like taking films, adapting them for the stage and then putting them back as a musical film, maybe millions musical. Oh, I said, okay, I'm going to take that as a no. Are there any genres that you like don't necessarily

Speaker 3:          32:40          have like an inherent interest in directing, like westerns or animated films or is it everything just like the world's your oyster? I tried to do an animated film, uh, an adaptation of a Terry Pratchett book called the Barometer Yard. There's your first problem, Terry Pratchett. It's so hard to, yes, very difficult, but God bless him. And um, and we would, we, me and the writer of the millions scripts actually frank cultural voice, we set it up at dreamworks and we were warned all the time about how long it was going to take. And uh, and we backed out of it in the end cause it really was you, it's all very well. Somebody saying seven more years, seven years like that to you and you just kind of go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then you got closer and you realize it is going to be seven years.

Speaker 3:          33:24          And so we backed off it as well. It's a lovely scratch. There's a little bit, I don't know whether it'll ever see the light of day. So, um, so I think my last question is, uh, what's just one thing you'd like people to take away from this stuff? You have to distill it down. I think it's the, it's what, so as we did the film does it kind of, one of the weird, one of the weird things about getting older, the one of the, the few compensations about getting older is the um, um, I said Kingsley Amos said that the only conversation we're getting older is that at least you know what's funny and what isn't. I don't know whether that's true or not, but one of the few conversations phoned about age is that you, you have this weird recognition that time is not a straight line, that there's a kind of loop in it somewhere.

Speaker 3:          34:14          And there is a section of the film and it's to do with spot at the end of the film. And he begins to recognize his voice, which in the original movie and an India original stories of what's in his whole plus character, utterly chaotic and hapless and nothing ever goes for him. He's the ultimate addicts in a way, on and off and on and off and on. It's somehow he's just to survive. But he finds his voice really. And I think that something that I believe in personally very deeply, and it's a new Irving's work, is that no matter how impossible it seems for that person to have an important voice, every voice is important. And that seems impossible thing to impossibly platitude in his thing to say in the modern world where life is so complicated. But if you lose sight of that, you're lost.

Speaker 3:          35:01          I think, you know, because you have to believe that all those [inaudible] and it's just how they'll find the value in their voice that's all in. And he finds the value in his voice and it leads to a loop where you, you start sort of experiencing the first film again, um, in, in the second film, and they loop back on each other. And, uh, I love that. I don't know whether people will get that from the movie, but they'll probably just have a good time watching you and Greg and make a fool of himself or, you know, stuff like that. But, um, that's very important to me in the film. Yeah. Cool. Well, thank you so much for joining us today. Cool. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          35:35          That's fine. It was a good, good time.
