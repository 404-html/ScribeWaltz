Speaker 1:          00:05          Hi everyone. Welcome to toxic Google today. It is my pleasure to welcome the lonely island for Popstar. Thank you guys for being here. Thank you for having us. Uh, could you tell us a little bit about the film?

Speaker 2:          00:19          Keith, why don't you just like tell them a little bit about the film? Yeah, you do it. Okay. It's a movie a, it's a musical movie. Yes. Say mockumentary. Yes. So far. Uh, yeah. All the pop you mentorees like, um, Katy Perry. Pardon me? Or Bieber? Never say never. Classics one direction. This is us going, uh, that's the John Written. Do you want to get deeper? It's up to you when you were looking for an idea for a movie that we could do our comedy songs inside of and make feel natural. So we were talking about maybe doing one of those poppy mentorees as the genre. Then a Kiva had a general meeting inside term with Judd Apatow and Judd was like, I think it'd be really funny if you guys did like one of those poppy mentorees and he was like, I had the same idea. We were just talking about that. And Judd said, if you guys write it, then I'll produce it. So we started writing it two and a half years later. The movie. Hey, here we are.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Yes. So

Speaker 2:          01:25          question real quick is every but does, does anyone here work at Google? Do you all work at this campus? Like this building? Not everybody does. Nope. Got It. So Mountain View,

Speaker 1:          01:38          Boston present Beantown right. Just kill. That's the thing we say we say kill. You guys can spread it around if you want. No means to distribute information. That's kind of a, it just means right on. Essentially. I have a followup question. Do you guys have any nicknames for Google? Like do you call it like big g or anything fun like that?

Speaker 2:          02:03          Papa goose. Goose eggs.

Speaker 1:          02:07          Papa gigs. All right, good to be here. Papa Roach. Yeah, it's very slept better. Alright. Things we aspire to to be like the approach. And so how do you guys feel about the Hooli thing? Like do you feel like fuck those guys or if you want to talk about like mockumentary versus the most accurate documentary there is. Okay, fair enough. So you think it's accurate? I think it's pretty accurate there through those guys at Pied Piper going to get it together is what I want to know. It's like they're right there on the brink of greatness and that just can't get out of their own way anyway. Pop Stars. Great. Yeah, that'll be on HBO eventually. Maybe I'm speaking of Pop star in terms of the process, so how did you guys sort of find a balance between writing the songs and the plot? Like

Speaker 3:          03:00          which was it a chicken and the egg scenario or,

Speaker 2:          03:03          I was a little bit of both. We, once we decided that this was the kind of movie we were going to make, we started writing songs and brainstorming the script at the same time pretty much. Um, so we had a lot of ideas for songs that were kind of free of the story that we just thought were dumb and funny and then we'd sort of shoe horn them into the plot. But then as we started writing and, and the story started taking shape, we would then pinpoint moments where we were like, oh, this should, there should be this kind of a song for this character. Or like we knew there was a montage sequence that was going to be about two characters getting to know each other and maybe if they made a song together it would make more sense there. Stuff like that. So kind of both.

Speaker 3:          03:40          Um, did you that's true. Yeah. Accurate. I'll just fact check. They say something. I'll fact check it. You could do, um, when you guys were writing, did you take a different approach to the writing the songs in this as opposed to when you're writing like as properly the lonely island? Like musical style wise? Uh,

Speaker 2:          03:57          little of both, but a lot. Yeah. Cause it was more specifically in character, but yeah, he could be ignorant in different ways then maybe we could as ourselves. But I mean, similar to say like the Dick in a box, dude's like there's an untrustworthy narrator thing happening where my character, especially in the movie is a bit of a dumb ass. Uh, so his perspective, like he was saying was able to be inappropriate because you, you don't forgive him it, but you're able to laugh at it because you're like, well, they don't think that the people writing it. Don't think some of both though. Like so like throw it on the ground. You're obviously a character in the past. And then I'm on a boat where ourselves but not for any real reason through it on the ground. I'm not a big fan. Thanks for fact checking and I was like fact checker. Just got fact check.

Speaker 3:          04:51          I keep a neuroma. How was it being both behind the camera and in front of the camera on this one? Uh, it's exhausting. Yeah, we wore so many hats. Uh, let's talk about it. Um, no, it was a, it was great. We, we uh, we've kind of developed all three of us, a real style over the many, many years of working together. So we kind of have a, our shorthand is very short. Um, and then we would just get to trade off who gets to say action, you know, like we'd be like, okay, your turn. And then he'd be like action and then I'd be like Roshambo for it. Yeah. We did a lot of really took a lot of hours out of the day. Yeah. And people will be like, you guys were, and we were like, we're concentrating on something shut up and then one to do and then action. Yeah. So it was a mess. It was a mess. It came out well. So they weren't, um, is is this going to be like a weird, healthy way for you guys to sort of live out a parallel universe where you get to get angry at each other and creatively?

Speaker 2:          05:48          Uh, yes. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Sure. Yes. Sure.

Speaker 3:          05:52          Seems like a healthy expensive form of therapy.

Speaker 2:          05:54          It's really, it's the most expensive therapy there, I guess. Making a big movie. Uh, yeah. [inaudible] has been describing it as the characters are us. If we were not self aware, so there's any, any roadblocks in their path that are challenging, they kind of make the wrong decision, whereas we make the right decision. All three of them. Always. Always. Yeah. You heard it here. Oh, always. Yeah. Always.

Speaker 1:          06:23          Yeah. Fact checked. Consensus. It's important or they're like guys on the roof that don't do anything here. Yeah. That there saying that's awesome. Sweet. You guys probably had your choice of guest actors and musicians for the film. Who were some of the people you were most excited to have and was there anyone who was unfortunately unavailable for it? I was, we were all pretty excited that Nas a nas the rapper, he used to be called not Nasty Nas. Now he's just not as uh, as your Jones. He only changed it like 18 years ago. So I know, you know, for the heads out there. Um, but uh, yeah, no, like we were, we grew up listening to him and so that was a really cool person to have on set talking about us and how he was a fan of us growing up. It was great. And then a Mariah Carey was another person that I was really excited to have in the movie. It wasn't us. You want to be was our characters. Hold on a second. You can see what were, we were acting in pretending, so he wasn't a fan of us. It was hard. No, I felt like he was deep down a fan of us as I'll go out and go in it anyway. Um, who are you guys excited to have on set?

Speaker 2:          07:41          Ringo. Ringo Starr was pretty crazy. That was, that was cool. He was in this group called the Beatles. Yeah, they had a couple hits. Yeah, they were pretty cool boy band back in the day. Uh, yeah. Lots of cool people asap. Rocky Dj call it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:59          I mean you guys are clearly ridiculously like media savvy or you're just going to say ridiculous. Why don't you go jump off the roof? I think you guys use like social media and the use of the Internet in the film really, really well. But was there ever a concern that like things would become passe by the time the film actually came out because of the editing process for this film? Like we were kind of adding to it while we were editing, so that kind of changed as we went. Honestly. Like a lot more snapchat stuff

Speaker 2:          08:33          added kind of as we went. What would have happened if like TMZ went down? Oh, it had to make some cuts. Um,

Speaker 1:          08:43          would, would it be fair to say that like a lot of your notoriety and success is because of the Internet and how are you,

Speaker 2:          08:47          you guys sort of were discovered that would be fair? Yeah, I think so. We always say we were incredibly fortunate that we got on SNL kind of right when streaming became actually possible for video. Like forever we had a website and it was a big deal that we had videos posted or you know, you'd have to submit your video to a site that would host it. Um, and even when we were first getting it going in La, we would tell like agencies and producers and stuff we were meeting with like, oh we have a website. And they were like, cool, send us a VHS tape because they just didn't exist yet. So like basically youtube became a thing right around the time that we got on SNL and did lazy Sunday. So it was very good timing for us

Speaker 3:          09:32          when, when lazy Sunday came out. Like what, at what point did you realize like it, it was something special and it sort of like, I feel like it changed the way that traditional TV produced for the Internet. Like suddenly it was cool to have web shorts and it was cool to have extra content that isn't like for broadcast necessarily.

Speaker 1:          09:48          Well, we sat down before we wrote it and we were like, let's change the way you were just that. We were like, people don't say the word viral enough. Yeah. That is one of the negative connotation for so many years. We'll meet with people and they're like, we want you guys to make us a viral video where blah, blah, blah. And we're like, you can't predict if it's going to, you can't just so extremely popular. We'll make a video and then maybe people will watch it and we'll follow up. Question, uh, to this. Um, do you guys still have the, it's, it's that are like organic, but then they made them for you like the vanilla, it's it ice cream. Oh yeah. But they're like the ones that they made for Google. There are some fancy, it's, it's like that for you guys, the ones that they made just for Google that they made for papa good anymore.

Speaker 1:          10:35          You know what I'm talking about. Some employees that were here so they don't do that anymore. Now it's no discontinued. You can get them through. Those are the Nasty Nas heads. They still exist, but not the ones that have the Google logo and are made with different organic ingredients and stuff. No, no. It was a big deal for us because we used to get, it's it at school, but they had them at our junior high. You could buy them in the cafeteria and we were like, whoa. Special edition. It's it. I know. I was excited to come here for that, but yeah, whatever. Now we're just excited to see you guys. But at first it was the insets thing.

Speaker 3:          11:12          Do you can't have, it's, it's, this is this acceptable second edit model as well. That's great to know. Um, it's, speaking of sort of, uh, earlier in your career, it's been almost 10 years since hot rod came up. Um, what were some of the lessons that you learned from that film that you applied going into this one?

Speaker 2:          11:33          Has it been 10? I'm just kidding.

Speaker 1:          11:34          No, it's not fine. It'll be next summer, next summer. What were some of the lessons? Uh, just believe in yourself. Yeah. It was a lot of that if that, if you find something funny that eventually a lot of people will tell you, they also find it funny. Yeah. We know there they are very different films obviously. Like there's a ton of music and this one there's less, you know, motorcycles crashing, uh, as well. Um, but it's, it's a totally different format. So, um, but I dunno, I guess you just learn, you learned something from everything that you make from even a small Internet video or whatever. So I wouldn't, I don't know. Each thing presents its own challenges. Even like a good snap, you know, we learned like I learned so much from a ground staff. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          12:22          no, no. Um, what, what were some of the, what were some of the perks of doing a longer form thing? Because you guys have done well, you've both done features before. You're on your stick, not take on but like television 30 minutes. I'm sure. Yeah. It's like a good Sitcom. It's a really good sick huh. Award winning maybe once. Um, uh, but yeah. So what were, what were some of the sort of the challenges of adapting and what were some of the perks? I assume like aside from maybe a good part is that you get to play in

Speaker 1:          12:56          like at SNL we were just throwing them together so much so quickly that, that we, we would never get to even like location scout or like plan ahead. We would kind of go, it needs to be at an office and then you would just show up with the camera crew and the actors and go, okay, I guess this is our office and we'll, and we would just kind of make it up on the fly. And on a movie it was, you know, you get to take things a lot slower, location scout, then you got to go back to location a few times before you actually shoot and build sets. And I dunno, by the time you're shooting it's actually very calm because you have planned it. Right? Yeah. One of the huge advantages is, is to have turnaround of just like that you can't, like you have to give the actors 12 hours and the crew 12 hours in bed so you can at least go home and sleep. Whereas that SNL, we would routinely make things and have an hour to sleep at before we started editing something cause it was going to be on there. So that, that was a big advantage. It's getting to sleep is a, is a huge difference. Not just in film. Just in life. Yeah. Yeah. It's really important you guys and drink water to talk about a life hack. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          13:59          They don't let you have water at SNL.

Speaker 3:          14:02          Yeah. To save a buck or two somehow. The rumors about Lorne Michaels or true that, no, he seems nice. Um, so these are, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Um, have, has there been anybody that you've sort of parodied or taking inspiration from that has turned around in revealed themselves to be a big fan?

Speaker 1:          14:21          Oh, what a nice version of that question. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought that was going to go. It's like, here we go. We got to talk about how much we love Bieber again, uh, which we do, uh, who so many, uh, will nick cage for me, it was a crazy one. I was doing him on SNL lot on weekend update and it basically came about that he was enjoying the impression and liked how like psychotic it was and got the joke that it wasn't literally of him was just, I found a weird

Speaker 2:          14:52          character and called it nic cage and he came on and did it with me at updates. So we did like twin nick Cage's, which is what SNL does. Um, and he was really, really nice. It was fun. And right after we did it, the crowd cheered really loud and we sort of walked off the update desk stage and he turned around and he was like, pleasure doing business with

Speaker 1:          15:13          and then just disappeared into the darkness. Didn't come to the party. I, no one saw him again after that moment. I was just like, what's he ever there? I like picturing that he like threw a smoke bomb down. Yeah it was awesome. I'm sure he's like hunting treasure or he's out there doing something good. Something compelling to watch. It's very important. Yes. So, okay. Well speaking of encounters like that, you guys have clearly proven yourselves capable of entertaining yourselves at press junkets. What's been aside from the Jimmy Fallon thing that's been some of your favorite sort of, um,

Speaker 2:          15:54          well we went to Miami and went to the Latin billboard awards this year, which was rad was a totally new, the whole show isn't Spanish and we speak Uhmm Poquito uh, made for some awkward interview APP, the whole red carpet. And I presented and it was a, it wasn't like us entertaining ourselves, but that was certainly the coolest and most different experience we had this time doing press. It was really fun.

Speaker 1:          16:20          What was it like sort of living out, cause you know, you shot these huge concerts, um, what was it like sort of getting to live out that pop star fantasy we got to is fun, right? Fun. It's really fun. Yeah, super drink preproduction. Maroon five was nice enough to let us go to one of their arena shows, like a sold out arena show in like two minutes before they would go on stage. Uh, let us run up on stage and it was like me and norm just with Mike's like, it's like hi guys. And we were like, Andy's about to come out dressed like this guy's name's Connor. Someone literally booed when they said that like already they wanted him to be called Andy. I was like so calm Conor. And he's like boom. But uh, and then, uh, we had cameras there and it was kind of just almost a camera test. But then a lot of the footage we actually put in, we just shot Andy and slow mo for like two minutes just running around acting like a superstar. And it kind of gave us also like a true image of what it should look like if it's a full arena because it is. And, and the footage is like at the trailers and stuff. And I don't know, was that neat for you Andy, to run out there and see what's super neat? It was two minutes of pure heaven.

Speaker 1:          17:28          But, uh, there, there are a lot of sort of absurd moments within the film during the concerts and like what, what was sort of the level of one upsmanship cause some things that happened to both your characters are, are, I don't, I don't even know how to describe comedically awful, comedically awful. That's the review the movie. I was going to say like outrageous, but I guess comedically awful. Um, yeah. Uh, I think that we were, we were pleasantly surprised when we were screening the movie that a lot of, some of the crazier jokes were getting the reaction that we had. Cause we obviously love sort of like more over the top kind of bits and uh, and so, uh, that was pleasantly surprising. And there are some things that, uh, one, one incident that you're referring to that you're kindly not blowing the joke for.

Speaker 1:          18:21          Um, but yeah, it quite outrageous and can't eat. And Andy had to shave everything. I shaved every inch of my body for this part and it's like a kind of de Niro Brando level of commitment, I would say. That's a fair comparison and if you want to spread that around, you can. Anybody could say that. It doesn't matter who said it first, whether it was like our camp or your camp internet. Nobody actually checks. Yeah, exactly. That's just words. Just words. Time to fact check for while. But yeah, I don't, don't highly recommend shaving every part of your body. It's your, your spouse doesn't like how it looks.

Speaker 1:          19:06          Where, were there ever any points where you guys were just like, this is too much? Or was it just sort of, did you keep plussing all of it? You just decided to editing? Yeah, but no, like, no, we didn't pull back at all really. We back on one joke that is, there's quite a few DVD extras in this movie. There's about an hour and a half of extras. It's maybe more than the actual movie, a full feature of worth. That's April, May, June. I'm going to ask this question just because it's been in the news a bunch, but, uh, there's, there's talk of the junk in one of the shots. I hope I'm not ruining this for everyone. Oh, that's what I thought you were talking about earlier. Yeah. That's why I brought up the shares, a wardrobe malfunction, seeing that she was referencing but then there's also a limo scene with some junk.

Speaker 1:          19:53          Yeah. Junk. Is that, well we are not going to say because people have claimed that it's their junk. Well we've heard that the got out that it was Judd Apatow's and we're not really like an [inaudible] should ask him and ask him if he wants to kill with that. It is a feeling he'll say yes. But to be fair though, we do want to, we should go on record saying that he didn't want it to be nepotism or just cause he's a producer. He had been sending us the uh, audition pictures or email for weeks even before we had written the scene. It was unclear. Yeah. Whether or not it was like, yeah, just be subject line would just be like better lighting might've just been a dick pics itch. Yeah. He just wanted us to see it in different lighting, different scenarios, um, where you at different shirts and then like what it would look like pressed on glass, all kinds of things.

Speaker 1:          20:53          And uh, so he would, he would just send us those and then he said, just throw this in the mix, put it, put it in, you know, take my name off it, put it in with all the other picks you guys are going to be looking through. I, and he wanted to win the role naturally based on talent and and you know, not based on just cause he's a producer and then he won the role he did. Yeah. I think that shows a lot of artistic integrity. Exactly what on all of the great produce. All of our parts on us especially. Yeah, definitely on our part too. Yeah. I'm glad it worked out. Um, we'll take audience questions in a minute if people want to line up. Um, all right, so you guys are from the bay, Hell's yells, correct? Yeah, Berkeley about them. Ooh. If you could go back in time and tell your Berkeley high sells when he's been advice, what would it be? Don't change a thing. Don't change anything. Your sense of humor at 12 we'll be your sense of humor at Hecka old or like that one time. Like you don't have to take quite that many shrooms.

Speaker 1:          21:58          You're not going to go with it. It'll still be fine without that extra few. They'll kick in eventually. Yeah. It just wait. Just wait. It's coming. Stay the course. Stay the course.

Speaker 4:          22:14          Hi, I'm Courtney. It's actually my 21st birthday and this is probably like the best present I could. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:18          Oh, happy birthday. Hey today. Oh right. You know you can drink now. Yes. That's so wild.

Speaker 4:          22:26          Yes, though I told my parents that I probably be more, uh, it'd be more likely that I pass out from meeting you guys then drinking today, but okay.

Speaker 1:          22:33          Do both a drink responsibly that can out for Courtney tonight. Who's designated driver. You what's driving cars or four? Come on. Oh yeah, you can just Uber it. Yeah, just do that. Google stuff. The Google cars I love. Those are safe. Right. Unless there's a red light that was ones do it. There are ones just drive all over the place, right? Yeah. Keith, well do you want to tell it? I they, I have the Tesla and it will just run a red light. It's only what's in front of it. So it's not like, yeah, check out the signage. No. And you're just texting and doing whatever you want. Cause it buries driving. That's what I call it. But to be fair, he's got a real lead foot. Very has a bit of a lead foot. Yeah. And he'll just go fuck. He'll float through that soccer. Anyway, sorry, what was your question?

Speaker 4:          23:33          No, I love you guys and I love Brooklyn. I nine Andy, I see one show that I always bug people to watch. Awesome. Thank you. So I was wondering when is the rest of the only on in going to be on Brooklyn? Nine nine. Ooh, hard question. There

Speaker 1:          23:46          was talk of your and being on last season, but he was so busy with this movie that it didn't work out. But I'm sure in the future he will and Kieve doesn't really ever want to act, so he could now that I'm in this movie Guy, yeah, I have caught the bug.

Speaker 5:          24:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          24:03          He's constantly doing like vocal exercises and like body movement stuff. Yeah. Very into movement. Very end of movement. But yeah. Hopefully.

Speaker 4:          24:12          And uh, uh, since you, uh, Jake was kind of based on you in the beginning, how do you think Jake is kind of different from you since he's kind of become his own person at this point?

Speaker 1:          24:22          Um, well he's, aside from that, he's a cop and you know, I ain't no pig.

Speaker 5:          24:30          MMM.

Speaker 1:          24:32          I Dunno. I mean he's got like dysfunctional family stuff that he's working through and he's much smarter than me as well. Um, he talks faster, he talks way faster. The main difference, he's kind of like the Cumberbatch of the comedy world, I guess. I mean, you have noticed that you guys usually have the same haircut. Yeah. Me and Jay actually when you guys are shooting. Yeah. Jake and I usually have the same haircut. What are you doing for your birthday tonight?

Speaker 4:          24:56          Um, I don't really know yet. I'm mostly working here.

Speaker 1:          25:00          Right. So you guys, let's get a towel every years for one second and some cake cover yours. Is there a secret cake? Is it made of? It's it.

Speaker 5:          25:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          25:15          Thank you so much for answering my question. Yeah, happy birthday. Happy Birthday. Um, first of all, thank you guys for lazy Sunday. I, this is my personal opinion, but I think youtube is what it is because of that video. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Not on behalf of a problem to root it out, but yeah. Um, I've read that you guys met in junior high or camp, I'm not sure which one it is or maybe both. Junior high for us. Can you tell us your meat? Cute. Like do you remember how you guys met? Tell us some stories about that. Well, yeah. Well, me and Andy were like chatting up some girls and then we saw your arm and he was being bullied

Speaker 5:          25:50          and

Speaker 1:          25:51          yeah, you guys don't laugh. And we were like a real thing. You're like, ladies, hold on. Put It on ice for a second. They were cool. They chilled. Yeah. Yeah. And, and the sunglasses down we went over. Yeah. We were like, we got a problem here fellas. Yeah. Yeah. Obviously they backed down and you'll be like obvious Phyllis. Thank you. Thanks guys. Where are you guys going to get a Gig? You eat lunch. Do you want to share a lunchables? Yeah. And then we all had, uh, it's, it's together. So you should probably mention we have been paid by its it to be all right. We'll go with that. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Hi Guys. Um, thank you for the digital shorts. They're brilliant. Thank you. You've been on the sets of, on the set of girls. Um, does Lena Dunham ever wearing your clothes? Not In one of the scenes that I like one of our longest scenes. Uh, no, she was wearing just a mesh top the whole time. Um, and I was maybe more impressive seeing her direct simultaneously and then act and readjust your lines. I like, so she's like rewriting, directing and also being nude at the same time. And you're just like this. She's incredible. She's really incredible. Thank you. Um, yeah, but she'd worked close the rest of the time though.

Speaker 3:          27:11          Hey guys. Thanks for being here. Um, I'm also a big fan of the digital shorts and I was hoping you could talk a little about your writing process. Like how do you go from, like, we should write a song about being in each other's moms to actually deciding which ones to carry through. Are there any you wish you'd done? How do you go from like idea to a full length video? Any you wish you hadn't done right? Right.

Speaker 2:          27:37          Yeah, most of them. Um, well that one specifically it was because it was mother's Day actually. It was the mother's Day episode. Trying to give a gift that kept on giving. Yeah. Uh, it, it happens all kinds of ways. I mean that was a rare case where it was actually motivated by something. Um, Dick in a box is the same. It was the Christmas episode and then

Speaker 1:          28:02          specifically at SNL for those ones. I mean we knew something had to be on TV that Saturday and it would be Tuesday and then a lot of times we'd stay and we'd stay up all night and if we were really lucky we would have come to it. But a lot of times we wouldn't really like and we'd stay up all night Wednesday and we would then stay up all night Thursday until basically challenging ourselves to think of something better. And sometimes like for instance with mother lover, the idea was cracked on Tuesday and we kept trying to make it better and oh no it gets on that what we do is settle down the gold settled on that on Tuesday. Yeah. The golden rule of that. And that's the third. The third one we had the idea Tuesday but didn't trust it and kept trying to top it until eventually. And like on Wednesday night and Timberland we gotta just kept saying like, cause like you guys are great at it. That's a great idea. Let's just do that. And we're like, no, no, we gotta be sure was like no too. It's funny.

Speaker 2:          28:52          Uh, yeah, but that's our basic product. And then once you say like, okay, that's the premise, then we put the beat that we're going to record on on a loop and we just sit there with pads or on our computers and write as many joke ideas as possible or like little pieces of versus and like read them to each other out loud and go like help me finish this line. I have the setup that I think is funny. What's the punchline? What rhymes with this? Um, and sort of cobble it all together together. Yeah. Then we kind of, yeah. Then we do put it all together. Like, Oh, who has the best first line? No, actually your line would be good first and then we should do this one of mine or, yeah. So we kind of group write it at that point and it would just light a bunch of candles and I just let the harmony. Hello. All right, well thank you. Thanks. Thank you, Margo.

Speaker 3:          29:36          Hi. Um, thanks again for being here. I Love Brooklyn nine nine. I also think,

Speaker 1:          29:42          yeah, also had, I think my dad might be a captain Holt, like long lost twin, but we can chat about that later I guess. Yeah. Um, I'm also wondering, um, really my brother is wondering, uh, when will there be a hot rod too? 1990 never when pigs fly. I mean, not like we'd be opposed to it, but it's not like that made a killing the box office. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Yeah, good answer. Thanks for coming guys. Could you tell us about how you were able to stick together through your whole career? Particularly like through auditioning for SNL now you got something to take all three. Just the money, right? Whoa.

Speaker 1:          30:40          No, we're, I mean, we got very lucky at that Bowman. That's probably the closest we've ever come to having it be that we would have really been on different paths. Was when we were getting considered by SNL and they had met all three of us. But then Andy auditioned and then there was a moment, basically it was about it like fog stories today was like, he was tired where we kind of knew he was hired and we weren't sure if they were going to say, hey, we have one writing position and it can be one of the two of you. There was no way for them to know we turn in a writing packet but all three, it was the three of us together had written it. They didn't know us well enough to be like, oh we want that one or that one. So it would have been kind of arbitrary.

Speaker 1:          31:19          So I think they knew they either had to hire both of us or none of us. Um, yeah, but that, I mean they didn't have to, and then we had a little pact that was if, if two guys got hired, the second guy who was as a writer would not take the job so that the two of us could continue to what's it's the worst would be for one guy to get left. Yeah. So we made that pack, but also we weren't going to like hold Andy back if he got hired from going on his own. And you never did.

Speaker 1:          31:49          Hey guys, I actually took the day off to be an extra in the movie. Oh No. Have you seen it? Did you make your cut? Was that the forum? That's what my question is. Did I make the cut? What was it at the forum stuff? So it was it the Inglewood Auditorium. So I was in the bin Ladin one. So it was like this up against the stage. Yeah. Oh yeah. I love kid contact. Oh yeah, no, that's not him. That was the second part to the question is I know that we filmed like a lot of songs. Did all of them make it into the movie or is there going to be just, yeah, your odds are better and you guys go the movie to support her. Really important. I'm expecting my check in the mail too. Yeah. Uh, no, not all. Not all this hot. All the songs are in the movie, but they are all on this soundtrack, which is like chock full of extras.

Speaker 1:          32:56          Uh, kind of circling back to the earlier question, we wrote many, many, many songs. Then we whittled them down. Yes. I think we wrote like 40 songs, let's say. Okay. Or maybe 50. Even then we widdled it down to like our favorite 25 and then we probably shot 15 of them. And then uh, those 15 well there's about 15 in the movie, probably in one way or another. There's been, the soundtrack has 25. There's a, there's a song with a con that we shot the whole thing and we loved and it just didn't work. Plot wise of that is not in the movie or songs that it would be the strongest songs that just couldn't fit storywise yeah. When it comes down to cutting songs like that. Do you guys tend to agree or is there ever sort of like discord amongst our, their tie breakers inside promotion though? Third strong discussions. Yeah, during discussions, but it generally it's to do with what serves the story best. Um, and there's something freeing about knowing that there would be a soundtrack where they would live so we wouldn't have spent time on something that we really liked and know that it would, it wouldn't just disappear. Usually if, if one of us has a problem with an idea, there is something slightly flawed about it and then like us all discussing together and fixing whatever that problem is, just makes it better at the end. So, oh,

Speaker 3:          34:14          thanks. Democracy rules you guys. We'll take our last few audience questions. Okay. Hi Guys. Hi. Great to meet you. And Goldie, uh, I've been a huge fan of yours since. Awesome town, which had the best song intro ever. Any plans for awesome town, the movie or the musical?

Speaker 1:          34:36          No, that's the other question again, which is very nice to people. Like, by the way, that song was completely ripped off from fraggle rock. You're just like, even though like clap, clap, kind of thing. Uh, but just changed enough so we wouldn't get sued. Uh, no, there's no immediate plans for rosin. Towe are kind of, banks are real lives are kind of awesome town. Like, oh. Uh Huh. Uh Huh. Fuck you keep, that's fair.

Speaker 3:          35:05          Thanks for coming in today. Aside from its, it's are you guys excited about anything else? Being back in the bay area

Speaker 1:          35:11          besides the warriors? I was very, I was at the big one. How was that game seven with my dad. It was fucking awesome. Uh, yeah, just coming home and seeing our families and smelling, smelling, smelling debt. Good air. We're, we're uh, Gordo, Tuckeria guys, uh, our nails in Berkeley. You're talking about food, right? Like other food that we like. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          35:36          Thanks. Um, so are you guys ever attempted to, uh, expand into other sort of mediums? Because if you did a a Broadway play, you could theoretically be the first people to Igor because of a song about a Dick in a box. That's true. Is there a temptation there?

Speaker 1:          35:54          Well, who should we get to do the Timberlake part on Broadway because he'll never do it. Stamos Stamos done great. We'll make the call. We look forward to it.

Speaker 3:          36:10          Um, I think my last question for you guys is if you had to each bring one album with you to a deserted lonely island, what would it be?

Speaker 6:          36:18          Mm hmm. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          36:21          It's so hard to say without sounding like a dick. Uh, for me, just like a sound effect CD, just like goofy sound effects just to make me giggle, laugh part sounds and stuff and like just city sounds or like, you know, it'll be like, oh, that sounded like a door slamming. That's actually kinda probably smart. You know what I mean? Cause he'll probably have missed the foundation. Yeah, there you go. That's what I was trying to say. Just maybe like blood on the tracks. I don't know. Something I probably Yoyo Ma, just best of outcomes. Just best of Yoyo Ma. I like what I liked the hits, you know, the one that he does, just the ones that get me hyped. So basically just the crouching tiger, Sandra. I mean, that'd be one of them. Which just the number ones.

Speaker 3:          37:10          Well, thank you guys so much for joining us today. Had started [inaudible] everyone to go. Thanks guys

Speaker 1:          37:15          for fun.
