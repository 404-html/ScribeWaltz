Speaker 1:          00:02          We are thrilled to have, uh, two folks really intimately involved obviously by his face on the screen. Um, with Richard Link ladders film boyhood. Uh, Matt Linkous is an accomplished photographer, local here to Austin and in 2002 he was asked to take annual photographs of the cast of boyhood to capture them throughout the film process and he just released his book boyhood 12 years of film featuring his right his photos and some writings from the cast and his time. And then joining Matt today is Ellar Coltrane, so also an Austinite and a star of the movie boyhood. We're so lucky to have them both as their crazy schedules on the award circuit have kept them pretty busy over the fast few weeks. So we're excited they could stop here with us today. They were nominated for six academy awards and they just won several Golden Globes. Something that I think all of us here in Austin are pretty, pretty proud of. So leading the conversation with Matt and Ellora today is Chilay Nafis who's director of programming at the Austin film society. Thanks so much for coming and without further delay. Here are the guys.

Speaker 2:          01:13          I'm curious how many of you have seen, boy, if you haven't lie please. Okay, no that's great. I think then you're going to really enjoy this and learn a lot. Um, all of us have seen probably countless films in which a main character grows up. Often that character is played by a person at six one at 12 one at 18 three different actors, but we're trying that particular character and we've gotten accustomed to that. What Richard Linklater has done is completely unique, taking Ellar Coltrane and filming him, others over a 12 year period, portions of each year. So we literally see her grow up on state, on screen. So when he came through the door, I didn't even recognize him today. He continues to evolve. So let's just start with a question you're always asked. How did you get involved with the project? Richard is actually said that he thought you had a very theorial mind and he was fascinated with how you thought as a young child. So tell us how that happened.

Speaker 3:          02:24          If I had to guess,

Speaker 4:          02:27          he saw a like mind that's a lot of, I mean Richard has a really hands on casting process and

Speaker 3:          02:36          no, um,

Speaker 4:          02:39          he's much more interested in kind of getting to know people than he is and like how well you can memorize a page and a half of dialogue. Um, and so that's kind of what, you know, I had been auditioning a lot. I did a lot of theater when I was really little and had gotten a with the talent agency in town. Um, I was like five, I guess I had one small part in a movie called Lone Star State of mind that was filmed here in when I was six. I got the audition with Richard in that end. It was very just, I mean I think they were probably six or seven callbacks, but he didn't have a script for me to read or anything. So it was just kind of a conversation. Um, you know, I think he had me bring in art that I had made and talked to my parents obviously, and we just kind of bonded for a couple of weeks and, and that's, you know, kind of everyone on the set is that's kind of his relationship, you know, it's very kind of about being friends and being able to collaborate together first before anything else.

Speaker 5:          03:50          Taking

Speaker 2:          03:51          courage you as soon cause they were going to be part of this for 12 years.

Speaker 4:          03:55          Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, you know, I think they, my parents have always kind of struck a good balance of supporting me but not being like the dreaded stage parents that are trying to live vicariously through their child. So they were definitely, I mean, they love Richard's work and so they were definitely excited. Um, but also, you know, I, it was definitely a long decision. Does it is a great commitment and they didn't want him. No one wanted to push me into it. So,

Speaker 5:          04:27          uh,

Speaker 2:          04:28          Matt came in at year two, photographing on the south, taking portraits and all that. Tell us how that came to be. Sister, Kathleen and Sutherland was the producer and actually production coordinator on the first year, second year. And then she hired me. I'll do stills. And early on I saw an opportunity to do portraits, which is one of my favorite things to do, portraits of people. Um, I do still once a year maybe on a film or commercial. So to have that opportunity present itself and know that I was going to, as long as Kathleen was on the movie, I would be on his nepotism is alive and well here. Um, so yeah, so when I took the opportunity to, to make these portraits, this is actually one of the first portraits I made, um, was actually a Eller and I'm just very simple, simplistic, um, black and white on black background. And um, I just wanted to continue that every year we're going to discuss the portraits in greater detail in a little while. Um, Eller, there's a tendency for a lot of viewers to almost think this is your life in one way or another. Uh, so just to, I have several questions. Tried to distinguish our, to show where there was some overlap between you and the character mason. It's a narrative film, not a documentary, but I think at times there must have been elements of you, um, the open, the film opens with you looking at

Speaker 4:          05:59          the sky daydreaming where you a daydreamer as a child. Absolutely. Good. That's why you got, there's this, there's this interview from late year one or two I think that we unearthed that is probably mine. Maybe it maybe is on the DVD, I don't know. But um, and it, when it opens there's a good like 30 seconds where I maybe I didn't know we were filming and I'm just kind of like muttering to myself and just like looking around and just kind of like, and then he's like Eller and I'm like, oh hey.

Speaker 2:          06:33          My niece stared out the window for 12 years of public school and she's an artist also. So, um, your character, mason is very interested in animals in nature. Is that true view? Yes. Absolutely. Okay, very good. We'll just go through these quickly. We'll get, have a check list. A, your older sister, Samantha is played by Richard Linklater, his daughter Laura lie. And for the most part, you all have standards, sibling animosity on screen in many ways until you're older. Do you have any siblings?

Speaker 4:          07:07          I mean, I have a nine year old sister, so it's a very different relationship but, but there'll be the Lorelei also has younger sisters, so uh, you know, anything that relationship formed pretty naturally that we both kind of wanted a sibling and we're able to sort of, you know, obviously we didn't live together, but we were able to sort of fill that role and you know, we're at each other's throats instantly. Okay. Uh, when she's saying, oops, I did it again, I wanted to throw all the pillows at her and make her stop, you know, in lower lights defense though. [inaudible] she wanted to stay and I think was gentlemen prefer blondes. She's, she's a little cooler than the list. Correct. Alright. Uh, Patricia Arquette, you're fell model where you, so Harry Potter to where you are Harry Potter founders or trial and you know, I actually wasn't, that was one thing that I like go in, go into the, I never went to any of the book opening, so it was right. I was worried about you in that scene and I thought there was no way that's Eller. That is amazing being able to do that. Okay.

Speaker 2:          08:19          Uh, Ethan Hawke is your dad tries to get you interested in sports, football, baseball, uh, bowling. Uh, did you have to do about a hundred shops to bowl so badly?

Speaker 4:          08:31          I don't think so. I think, I think I'm just pretty bad at bowling a, we did like a photo shoot recently where we kind of recreated that scene and I didn't do much better.

Speaker 2:          08:45          Um, finally on this part, um, in the film Mason goes to 12 years of public school and you were primarily homeschool. Uh, how did you feel? I think you

Speaker 4:          08:56          went to high school for a while. I was at school. Yeah, that's definitely the biggest kind of difference. Um, is that, cause I, you know, my, my social dynamic was very different growing up and, and see, I mean then I was really, I mean that was one also one of the most interesting parts of, you know, having this sort of parallel, you know, story tracing. My, my own life is getting to kind of go and like pretend to be in these schools situations, which was very foreign to me. So, but obviously something that all the most of my friends were in school, so it was always this, you know, I was very aware of this environment, but get him to go kind of pretend for a couple of days was pretty interesting.

Speaker 6:          09:42          So Matt, um, after you started with your two, did you go to the set every day of filming or how did you decide when to go? Yeah, I was the onset photographer, so I was shooting stills of the action of the film and then also behind the scenes shots, which are going up every now and again over there. So it was basically documenting the way the film was made. Richard Directing Eller, Richard Interacting with Patricia, Laura Lion. And, uh, and Ethan when Ethan was onset and um, what I would do is each year I would pick a day that I knew all the actors would be onset. Most of the time they were, but sometimes it would overlap by a day or two. And um, I would choose a location nearby set and make my portraits on the one day. And once I got everybody documented for that year, I wouldn't necessarily do the portraits on another day of shooting that particular year.

Speaker 6:          10:34          Does that make sense? Everything you're saying makes sense. Uh, how, how do you manage to be almost invisible as a still photographer on set? How do you manage to be almost invisible, not obtrusive and all? Well, you have to get a good relationship with the first lady who's leading all the action, which has vents and then also with the other cameraman and the acs that work on the camera assistant camera because you need to be right next to the camera getting similar shots. But sometimes I would float around and, and just Eller got comfortable with me real quick and that was great. If I was in Patricia's eyeline or Ethan's eyeline, that would kind of disrupt things. So you kind of have to do the exactly what you said. Try to be invisible as much as you can and be low key. And I'm kind of a low key person so it wasn't too hard to do.

Speaker 6:          11:23          Uh, Rick Linklater is very famous for the relaxed atmosphere on his saps. Um, did that help in some ways? Just the set atmosphere affect your Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I've worked on sets where the director is not very nice like that. Like Rick and Rick has, um, puts everybody at ease on the, on the set. I've never heard him raise his voice wants, um, literally. And um, Tyler might happen, you know, back when rehearsals or something, I don't know, but uh, no, Rick is very easy going and it makes else at ease and everybody just does their work and everybody's professional and everybody knows that they have all have a job to do and that's what makes it come together cohesively. And that's what makes, that's what the beauty of this picture is, is that we put all this effort into it and we have this beautiful body of work.

Speaker 2:          12:11          So, uh, the photo you took of Mason getting his buzz cut, he's actually smiling or laughing in the film. He's definitely not smiling at all. So that in a sense that it gave me a different reading of that scene. I mean, obviously that was Eller, whereas in the film it's Mason reacting that way. Uh, why'd you decide to print that one?

Speaker 6:          12:33          For that exact reason? I wanted to show that Eller was actually quite happy kid. It gets haircut during that scene, or at least I can't speak for him directly, but he seemed to be how we hot here. Yeah. So, um, yeah, Eller was very happy to have his hair cut and, but he had to play the scene. So I did a few takes where he was actually smiling and that's one of the ones that I wanted to put in the book and having the book for sure. And just a bit of technology. But describe your, your equipment, your cameras, lenses. Well. Um, I started out shooting digital for the production stills and behind the scenes, which I knew it was just going to change as far as pixels, but that would always be the same and what I wanted to do with, so I use a digital camera, a Nikon, Nikon, um, now for the film stuff.

Speaker 6:          13:21          I originally started shooting on film on a hostile blog, which is this image here. And then I had a Polaroid converted from a land camera that shot pack film Polaroid that had a positive and a negative. So I could look at the positive picture and know that I had the negative and then I put it in the water and wash it later and I have a negative. And then as time wore on, Polaroid went out of business by about year eight, so I didn't shoot Polaroid anymore and had to go back to film. Um, just straight four by five film. And the majority of the portraits are shot on a four by five camera. That's, um, a wooden field camera made in Japan called the Tacho Hora with a, just a basic normal lens. And really at the end of the day, it's extremely simple camera that gets the subject involved with the process. And Eller himself was great. He, he loves posing. I mean, I, I don't know if he loved it, but he was very amicable to me and to to do it all. And um, and then later on Ethan would, after a couple of years of coming back, you can go, oh, I love that camera. And then he'd be more inclined to spend a little more time with me posing. Not that I would take them, you know, for an hour at a time. Literally I do the shoot about three or four minutes. So it was a very quick process.

Speaker 2:          14:39          Okay. I'll go back to acting. Um, how did you and Rick actually work say in your childhood and later on as far as action line, delivery, body language, facial,

Speaker 4:          14:52          all of that? Um, I mean there's, there's kind of an amazing, and you know, a lot of what Richard does it, I mean, I assume for most of his movies, but definitely with this one is a lot, or for her soul, you know, the, the, the, the script is kind of constantly change. And you know what I mean? He would come,

Speaker 4:          15:14          he would come to two s, you know, maybe a week out before shooting and have, you know, a basic script, you know, scenes written for that year, but, and then we would spend the next two week rehearsing and rewriting bits of that and, you know, and taking things from our own lives. And, you know, like you were saying, there's a lot of, not just me, but all of us, you know, there's a lot of, all of, you know, Patricia and Ethan as well in the, in the characters and just in the, the world in general. Um, and that rehearsal process would, was on going, you know, into, into filming. So there was little, there was little difference in, in kind of the atmosphere between rehearsing and filming. You know, we kind of joke that it's like a lot of time you don't even know. It's like suddenly you're just rehearsing and then he's like, okay, we got it and you're done.

Speaker 4:          16:01          And, and that is kind of how it felt, you know? So, and that's an art, you know, that's something that has, when I was young I wasn't really aware of, but that's an amazing balance to be able to strike, to make it toward you. You know, there's no, there's no pressure of like, oh I'm on camera. And especially when I was young, you know, it changed as I got older and you know, kind of became more confident and aware of myself as an actor. But when, you know, when I was seven and then when Laurel, I was so young, it's, that's really valuable, you know, to just be able to not feel pressured and not feel on the spot, you know, cause they think all kids like to pretend, you know, when it comes really naturally, it's really easy to act when you're seven, eight, nine. But the problem is that a lot of kids are pressured, you know, you feel like you have to perform and be cute or you know, try to please the people around you. And, and Richard did a really good job of making it, you know, making me feel like an equal. Then also just making me feel comfortable so that I was able to, you know, do what I had been doing for years

Speaker 4:          17:08          and I don't, yeah, I mean as, I don't know, as far as like a direct direction, it,

Speaker 4:          17:16          it never felt like, I mean he would say little things, but a lot of it was just kind of born out of the rehearsal process, you know, so that when we were actually filming, he didn't, we'd already kind of knew what he wanted, you know. Great. Um, was the scene with your alcoholic Stepdad scary or fine cause that glass or whatever brakes right in front of you on your plate that was, um, both they think. Do you know what I mean? It was definitely a decider and there's not, there's not a lot of like real acting in the movie. And then, you know, something explosive like that is certainly your site. I know, but I think it, I mean I'm sure, I think it was scary too. You know, it's the kind of thing that you kind of, it's easy to ignore it when you're a kid, but looking back it's like, it definitely was an intense experience, but, but they also, you know, we like Patricia with, you know, they would all, everybody would start kind of joking in between tapes to sort of distract us I guess from the gravity of the content.

Speaker 2:          18:19          Um, since we would get together every year. How soon ahead of filming did you know what was going, what the basic actions are big for that year?

Speaker 4:          18:30          Um, I mean generally at the end of each year, Rick would give me some kind of idea of like, hey, you know, next year you're going to go on this camping trip or you're going to meet a girl or, you know, or whatever. And, and then throughout the year. And we would, you know, he would call me and take me to lunch two or three times and kind of just compare, you know, his whatever ideas he would have and kind of asked me about what had been going on in my life and, you know, see where the two might overlap. Um, so I generally had a pretty good idea, you know, I had a lot of time to kind of think about that. Exactly. You know, what, what Mason was doing and how I could use my own experiences to kind of inform that. Um, but then like I said, the, you know, the, a lot of times the final script, the final dialogue wasn't printed until the morning of the shoot,

Speaker 2:          19:23          which would be maddening for many actors. But,

Speaker 4:          19:26          but if you're not a part of writing it, I mean, it's, it, that's the thing that, that's why is because we had been rehashing it and rehearsing it for a week. So it's, it's not like we needed a memory. We already knew the lines because we were there and when he wrote them. So it was, you know, it was definitely constantly evolving but also very long. You know, law enforcement was a very longterm kind of process for each, you know, 15 minutes. We had a whole year to kind of rehash it and figure out exactly the right tone.

Speaker 2:          19:58          Matt, going to your portraits or four by five portraits, which are really stunningly beautiful. What was your method of, did you direct that? People are what?

Speaker 6:          20:11          Mostly I would just kind of have them in character in front of my background, just looking directly at the camera and if you've ever seen a four by five camera, it's a, it's a slow process to say the least. It's the old camera where you have to put a hood on and look underneath on the ground glass and focus. So I would have elder stand there or Patricia or whomever and I would say, okay, hold on, let me get focused. They would just kind of, you know, look at, you know, look at the camera. I'd say, okay, hold still, I'm going to drop the film. They're still looking still. W I think what's captivating a lot of these is that they really have an intense look right into the camera. As far as directing them. I didn't do much direction. Patricia's of wonderful professionals, she didn't need any direction. I, I would say maybe on after I did a couple of frames of just a straight expression, I would say let's do one a little friendlier. She might let us a little smile in there. Lro I would do the same. Eller would, you know, we would go through a range of emotions and expressions and mostly it was get the, the kind of the serious ones out of, out of the way first and then go into whatever,

Speaker 2:          21:20          you know, hanging out, whatever. Looking at camera. Pretty simple. I need to get through to teach me how to smile for the camera. It's, it's easy to do that in real life. Uh, so if you were doing a lot of these three or four minutes, what is your shooting ratio? It's not very high. I think you mean the number of shots that you're taking? The final choice. So the for the fall

Speaker 6:          21:45          by five film, so there's two sheets on a back, you turn it over and it's quite simple. But for Ela I would probably do, you know, for holders, eight sheets, eight shots and then I would do all the digital shots cause I'm also having to be wary of their time away from set. So, and placate when they want to actually do the pictures. Like, you know, some of them were a little more reluctant on having their pictures taken. Eller was never that way. Um, Patricia wouldn't want to spend more than five minutes just because she wants to do other things. Um, Ethan was okay. He, he'd loved doing them and Lorelei was fine as well. Um, and I'm not trying to say Patricia was doing anything unprofessional. She was, she just wanted to get it done and out of the way. She didn't want to linger. Like Ellery she Eller is interested in the photographic process. So that was, you know, that was nice to see and made my job easier.

Speaker 2:          22:36          So have you been tempted to do any time lapse photos? Showing them age very quickly?

Speaker 6:          22:42          Um, I did a very brief, I'm not very good at video editing, but I did a very brief little 32nd snip of all of these shots before we had the book before, right as the film was releasing. And I sent it to Rick and Kathleen and showed it to the, actually I sent it to other as well. And it's just like, uh, just that same thing that you've seen on some of the programs that they show before these guys go on and do their interviews. And I think it's fascinating to watch. The face has changed for sure. Um, I'm just, I don't, I'm not very good at it. So, interesting.

Speaker 2:          23:17          Um, discussing the improvisation in acting, at what point did you and Rick start feeling free enough for you to improvise in certain scenes and what words some of those scenes?

Speaker 6:          23:30          It was never really, I mean, there was definitely like, I mean there was definitely an element of improvisation to it because, because of the fact that the district was constantly changing and, and you know, a lot of times we would be improvising

Speaker 4:          23:47          up until, you know, the morning of the morning of the shoot. But when we went on camera, we definitely always had a script that we follow it with. The one exception of the star wars scene, when Ethan and I are sitting at the campfire deaking added deeding out about star wars, that there's about 45 minutes of that. I think today for day like 45. I mean there's a 45 seconds in the movie, but there's another half hour probably of just us talking about star wars. I don't know. But, um, but yeah, I mean that's a common misconception. I think we achieved a lot of realism, just threw a lot of improv improvisation just leading up to the, you know, leading up to the, um, to the shoots. So there's a lot of it is our own words, but you know, but it was always scripted.

Speaker 2:          24:41          Um, the transition to teenager, I love the scene in which you're asking your dad are there, there's no magic in the world, really, like elves and stuff. Had you already reached that point in your life or was that a terrible revelation?

Speaker 4:          24:57          I don't think my parents, but I think the way Santa Claus was presented to me was as a myth. So, yeah, I mean, I definitely believe in magic, but not, not that kind.

Speaker 2:          25:11          Great. Um, when you're at a party with a girl, you tell her how you're unhappy with people trying to control you, which are a teenager, nothing surprising about that. Uh, how does that marry you at that time?

Speaker 4:          25:24          Um, I mean, that was one of the first pieces of dialogue that I just wrote. So is they're just actively, I mean, Richard had come to me the previous year and said, you know, the next time you're alone with a girl for the first time to take notes and like, um, so that, it's definitely my own, uh, pseudo philosophy from 17. Okay. Great.

Speaker 2:          25:52          Good year for that to happen. That takes care of the next question about emotional trauma. Uh, let's see, uh, by the end, you break free, you go to, I can sit Saul, Ross state university and Alpine, and then you go to big band, uh, is a perfect place for your photography and love of nature and all. Um, how well do you relate to Mason's decision to do that?

Speaker 4:          26:16          Um, I mean, I,

Speaker 4:          26:19          I love that place. I love that desert. It definitely, I mean, I, I stayed, I've spent a lot of time out there, you know, it just in Big Ben, but I, after we shot everybody else went home and I stayed for another week or two. Um, it's really special out there and I mean, photography isn't as big a part of my life as it was. I mean, that's, you know, that's an why mason is a photographer's because I was really interested in it kind of as a result of, you know, following Matt around on the set and, you know, looking at all these cool toys. Um, but that's, you know, but I definitely, I definitely do. I relate with the need to get far away from home and the, you know, the desert, um, definitely calls to me. So that, that last scene is, you know, I've, you know, more often I'm alone, but I've definitely had that moment, you know, many times in my life of just being out there and how quiet it is and just kind of realizing how, you know, how for granted I take everything.

Speaker 2:          27:24          Um, Matt, this is a big question. How do you see the difference between the art of cinematography and the art of photography?

Speaker 5:          27:33          Okay.

Speaker 6:          27:34          That is a big question. I

Speaker 6:          27:38          find myself, that's hard one to answer. I'm moving pictures versus still pictures. It's, Eh, we remember things differently when we see the moving picture as opposed to one still frame from that picture or that movie. So I was lucky enough to have Eller and the whole cast to document during the 11 years that I was on the film. And um, I guess I think my documentation is impactful, but I think the film is way more impactful when you see the moving images. But I think that's the beauty of the book is that it pairs well with the film. And you can go back after seeing the movie and seeing everything and kind of land on a moment and land on a picture and remember that soft face boy and then see the chiseled man that he is now. You know, it's like, you know, I mean he's, he's a movie star and it's, it's incredible to watch the transformation and, and I've loved that I was able to do that photographically. And Richard was able to do that cinema cinema graphically. So

Speaker 2:          28:46          did you see a younger you and or when he was interested in photography?

Speaker 6:          28:51          Um, actually yes. There was one scene that we filmed, um, at Austin high in the dark room scene where the, he's getting the lecture from, um, Mr whatever his name is, Burlington, Burlington. And he has that great line, um, which is, you know, any dip shit can take photographs, you know, what are you going to bring to it? And it's, I love that scene. That scene was really wonderful and powerful to me because that dark room was the actual dark room where I first learned how to develop film and make prints. So I was at Austin high. I was trying to tell her that right before the scene and we were just having a little moment about it. But it was, it was fun to be there and, and that, that was a pretty powerful moment for me. That dark room

Speaker 2:          29:33          from the very beginning we see the true are interested in art. You have your graffiti symbol, which I still can't decide when were a child, but then you take on the name because Joe for your bedroom wall art in general, graffiti in particular, what are Your Art Tris?

Speaker 4:          29:54          I that was actually a replica of a thing I had on my wall and mine was maybe a little more, a little more decipherable but burned. Maybe not, I don't know. But yeah, I mean that know that that's spray paint art was definitely a big part of my life at that point in time. Um, and photography is something I, you know, I not as, I don't John, I don't shoot constantly the way I did when I was younger, but it's definitely still something I'm very interested in and you know, Pencil and paper drawing and painting and I don't, I don't really know how to play music, but I, there's definitely a lot of it inside of me. So I probably will someday. Great.

Speaker 2:          30:46          Beautiful Book that has come out. How did this come back about? I noticed you wrote after a few years I looked at the images collected so far and became excited by it all looking forward to the final volume of work. So when did the idea for book come out?

Speaker 6:          31:04          Well, I, the idea originally for me was the black and white portraits as a portfolio piece. It's not as a book. It was really, I was going to have this nice body of work. Selfishly, I was obviously going to give Richard and Kathleen access to it so that, you know, IFC can use, use this. But um, that was the original intention with the black and whites. However, year five, year six when I was counting up, I've got, you know, four thousand five thousand images. And then by the year, by year 12, I've got close to 18,000 images. It was a no brainer. Early on to say, we're going to do a book, we have to, we have too many images to the cheek going on. And, um, I think it was year nine, Ethan said, I want to write the intro to your book. And I was like, Oh, I have a book.

Speaker 6:          31:48          And I hadn't ever talked to Ethan about this. So, um, that was my first little light bulb moment that if Ethan's involved, and I knew Rick and Kathleen were kind of mulling the idea, but if Ethan were involved in it, would really have a lot more chance of playing out. So, uh, and that's what actually led into the essays that each of the actors did was Ethan talking about doing the intro. So Rick has the pseudo intro, but you know, Rick was talking about the passage of time and then everybody kind of touches on that. And, um, so the book actually officially became tangible, uh, as an idea of just this time last year. And really, and it was a very much a quick, I mean we had 12 years to make the film and we have like two months to make the book and was kind of a quick process. But Dj Stout at Pentagram and Stu Taylor did an incredible job, um, you know, designing it and then

Speaker 2:          32:40          ut press, I've done a remarkable job of marketing the book and distributing it. So, um, I hope that answers the question kind of long winded and I'm really happy it's ut press, so it's another product of Austin. That's great. What has been the reception to the book so far? As far as I can tell, I mean my 10 friends like it, so, you know, I don't know. I'm going to, I'm kidding it, it, I think it's doing very well and it's, it's hard. Books in general are a hard business as Brady will tell you. It's anyway, it's, it's, it's difficult, but I think it's doing well. I just saw that it's at Costco now. So I mean that might be a good thing or bad thing. I don't know, you know, but I think a Walmart, okay, sorry. No, draw the line. A friend of mine at Barnes and noble said it's selling very well too, and it will be available here today at a really nice discount. So we'll mention that again in a minute. So Eller of summing up, uh, many of Rick's films have to do with time and you of course get the last line of the film. It's always right now. Uh, is that you as well as Rick?

Speaker 4:          33:53          Yeah, I mean in hindsight, I think it was kind of a message from Richard to me because I definitely, I mean that definitely I had nothing to do with writing any of, I mean I, you know, in rehearsal we died, we know, helps to kind of tweak it and put it in them, you know, words that I had was comfortable saying, but, but that definitely, I mean, that was, he knew, he knew what he wanted to say and it definitely is, you know, I understand that. And feel it in a, in a big way. And like I said, you know, I mean, I think that Ma, that moment that Mason's having of kind of, you know, realizing the, the fleeting nature of reality and, you know, how kind of easy it is to, you know, forget the importance of family and connection and just, you know, how quickly everything's going by and how easy it is to miss it, you know, and then just kind of get wrapped up and bullshit.

Speaker 4:          34:50          Um, we were all kind of having that moment out there, you know, I think not just me, but everyone on the set, you know, we were all coming to the end of this thing that had become so much more meaningful to us then I think to anyone, never aside from maybe Richard had ever expected, you know, um, and realizing that it was over and the, and just kind of striving to appreciate the last few moments of, of the project and the last one, you know, the last day of being together. Um, so I got a little lost there. But, but yeah, I definitely, I definitely, that is, you know, that is me in a big way.

Speaker 2:          35:31          Can you even imagine your life without having this experience? So would you be

Speaker 4:          35:36          absolutely.

Speaker 5:          35:38          I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I, I've, you know, I've been, both of my parents are artists and I've been around, you know, projects, you know, in collaboration my whole life. So I would, you know, I would definitely be creating things, but I would be a very, in a very different way. Had I not met Richard.

Speaker 4:          36:00          Um, do you miss being mason? Are you ready to go on? What's your own life? I mean, both. It's something of a relief, but it's also incredibly bittersweet. I mean, I just, just miss being able to work on it, you know, but also, but I mean, the blessing of all of this is, you know, that how well the film has been received as just that we've gotten to spend the last year together. Um, which had, you know, no one cared about the movie, but it probably, you know, we wouldn't have a thing every weekend that we all get together for. Um, so, so that's been nice. But definitely, yeah, it's bittersweet, you know, hey, I hope we get to work together again.

Speaker 4:          36:39          Okay. I want to open it up to the audience for questions as or that it will lead you to this or you know, what's kind of your reaction. But you know, it started off with limited release and then, you know, it's obviously taken off. So, um, I, I mean, I didn't expect this a year ago. I mean, I think we were kind of bracing ourselves for no one to care. That sounds funny, but it's true. Entirely true. I mean, you know, for the last 12 years trying to explain this project to people, it's like, okay, you know, Richard Linklater, like, oh, I've heard of him. And then it's like, it's like 12 years and like, it's not really about anything. And so people didn't care, you know, it feels like, oh, that's cool. But it's not like, oh, I'm so excited to see that movie. It just like, okay, well, you know, good.

Speaker 4:          37:29          Tell me about it when it comes out. Um, so we really, we're kind of bracing ourselves for the, you know, for no one to really get it or to connect with it the way cause we needed, we know it's really important to us and that makes it, you know, all the, you know, Stereo to kind of release it to people who, you know, may or may not understand it. Um, but the way people have responded, I mean much more than, you know, I mean the awards and everything that's really awesome to be recognized. But what's more meaningful is just the way people have responded personally and individually, you know, and expressed such kind of vulnerable emotions, you know, about that, the, that this movie has inspired them to feel. And that, you know, I think we all feel pretty vulnerable, um, releasing, you know, putting this out there because it's so kind of personal to us. But a lot of people, a lot of audiences have really matched that vulnerability. So that's, you know, that's really inspiring.

Speaker 1:          38:30          I heard an interview with Laura Link Linklater on Texas Standard and her to the film and seeing it after the, the whole project was complete, was quite strong. She described crying, watching the movie, and I'm feeling some, I guess how strange it was to see different parts of herself, um, unscreened for the public in earlier parts of her life. I wondered what, what your reactions were to hers and if you relate it to it at all

Speaker 4:          39:01          before Sundance, Richard, Dave. But we had nothing, we hadn't seen any of the footage until, you know, until it was done. Um, and Richard, Dave, both of us DVDs and kind of very wisely advised that we watch it by ourselves. The first, you know, alone the first time. Um, and I mean, obviously I was, I, I don't think anybody heard from me for a few days. It was pretty intense. Definitely. Um, I don't know. I cried a lot. It's hard to really describe what it feels like. You know, I think you spend your whole life wondering how you're changing from day to day, much less over a decade. Um, and it's one thing to look at pictures, but to see it like that is, you know, mind blowing and tender. You know what I mean? To say painful but not really in a negative way. It's just a lot to take in all at once. You know, I've seen it like 10 or 11 times now and it is finally getting easier. Um, but it's very emotional. Definitely.

Speaker 2:          40:11          Please don't watch it alone when you're my age. My head might be the end of year then between now and then, fine. I, I'm very glad Laura light didn't succeed in convincing her dad to have her character dive swine flu. There was one year she just didn't want me to do it anymore.

Speaker 4:          40:30          I think she just didn't want to dress up for the Harry Potter thing. Right.

Speaker 1:          40:37          Oh, hey. I was just wondering, did you get in front of the camera at all over the 12 years and if not, do you regret not having that time lapse for yourself?

Speaker 6:          40:45          Uh, actually I was asked to be an extra in one of the scenes, couple of scenes, none of them made the cut. So thankfully I'm not in front of the camera. Um, in the book, however I did, my sister took a portrait of me, so I'm in the, if you happen to get the book, you'll see a portrait of me in there. But, um, as far as getting in front of the camera, I just did that. You're four. Um, I was a bartender or something and Rick gave me this great line of what's your motivation and all this stuff. I was just the complete extra background, fluff and clearly not important enough to make the cut score.

Speaker 1:          41:18          And how do you see this experience in this job affecting your work in the future?

Speaker 6:          41:23          It's funny. Um, I definitely take a look at the longevity of projects now. Like I've been shooting photographs of kids at a Montessori School for about eight years and watching that same kind of growth and watching them age and it's, it's, it's, it's interesting, it really plays on you when you have to have that. And, um, thankfully Ella has agreed to continue our project. We shot year 13 last year in May, so a sometime coming up, if he allows me, I will do year 14 with him. So.

Speaker 5:          41:55          Okay.

Speaker 6:          41:56          So the movie on the whole is kind of this like wonderful measurement of what it is to be human. That's that curious probably a lot of weight, right. For you and your professional life. Do you feel a lot of pressure now to keep moving forward to work on projects? Kind of UB substance?

Speaker 5:          42:14          MMM,

Speaker 4:          42:15          and I think I would feel that regardless. Sure. But not, I don't, I mean almost people kind of asked me that. It's like, oh, how are you going to like top this? And I don't think I need to. Um, so in a way the pressure is off. I guess. It's like the first movie I was in just won best picture. So it's like

Speaker 7:          42:36          not,

Speaker 4:          42:37          there's not much like more did I can strive to accomplish as far as recognition, you know, so I don't know. But absolutely. I mean, I, I feel a lot of responsibility and pressure to only be, be a part of things that have substance and, you know, communicate genuine emotion. Um, but I think I would feel that way, you know, even if I hadn't been a part of this. So look for you and like Morticai too, right? Yeah, exactly. So you promise not to do Texas chainsaw massacre 87. You know, I add though, I like before, like the year two or three of boyhood, I auditioned for that. The Texas chainsaw remained in, um, very wisely. I, uh, my parents talked me out of it. I tend to, I wanted to do it, but, um, I have since I've heard that that's, that was like one of the most hellish sets ever. Kind of glad I wasn't party.

Speaker 7:          43:37          Um, and it has to do with a scene or two scenes in the movie. There was, um, uh, your mother and the movie, um, she has an exchange with, uh, an immigrant who's working at our house, which tells me, you're smart, you should go to school. And then there's a scene later on where he's like, thank you for that. I went to school and I managed her all that. I'm just wondering why, why do you think, from your perspective, why was that included in the film and what was the meaning behind it? Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          44:05          I mean I think, I think because she, you know, it's kind of is underappreciated and mom's kind of our, you know, and she's sort of spends the whole movie trying to ease, you know, ease the suffering, I guess, of all of these men in her life. And, you know, it was sort of punished for it, the whole movie.

Speaker 5:          44:35          MMM.

Speaker 4:          44:38          And I just, that's a role that a lot of mothers fall into.

Speaker 5:          44:42          Oh.

Speaker 4:          44:45          And the, and, and to be, you know, have better appreciation from someone who's not trying to start a relationship with her is powerful I think. But I don't really know. Do you think there's a reason? I, um, they chose randomly to have at a Mexican immigrant and working on our house. So, I mean, I don't, we live in Texas, I guess that's, yeah. I don't know the cause a lot of Mexican immigrants do that kind of work and are, you know, put in a place, you know, by whatever pre, uh, preconceptions of society, you know, that they can't rise beyond, you know, this idea of what an immigrant is in this country. Um, and, but also a lot of, a lot of people do. A lot of people come here and start doing work like that and you know, make fairy, um, I dunno, uh, successful lives for themselves. So yeah. Thank you.

Speaker 8:          45:59          So a lot of times as you know, little kids weren't into one thing or another and we make decisions off those and change those really quickly. You know, was there ever any time, like you kind of were questioning your role in the movie and being a part of it and like, guess what kinds of sacrifices and things had you like or what happened you got to do that you kind of wanted to do when you were a kid? Or how did that kind of overlap with work balance for slight bounce some during the movie for so long? With so many years.

Speaker 4:          46:22          I mean, I don't, nothing, never. I, I never wanted, I never, I never questioned my decision. I mean, I, you know, I was, I was never terribly rebellious. I never had much of a reason to be, I wasn't in public school, so I didn't have that, like inherent need to rebel against all forms of authority. Um, they kind of, you know, it was kind of fun to have an obligation, you know, something I was committed to and, and it's in, you know, I think you here 12 years and it sounds like it's like taking up my whole life. But like I've said, it was like a week and a half each year, you know, so it wasn't, I don't think that ever kept me from doing anything else, you know? I mean, yeah, I stopped auditioning for other movies. That's the only thing. But auditioning just sucks. And that's why I did that. So Bette Davis had to audition for the movie in the fifties and she just took our two Oscars, put them on the table and said nothing else. So you're going to be able to take some awards along with you. It's the, it's different now they're sending is different. Auditioning

Speaker 6:          47:30          for commercials sucks.

Speaker 5:          47:32          Yes.

Speaker 9:          47:34          During that week and a half, what would a typical day of filming look like?

Speaker 4:          47:39          I mean, during the week and a half, there was it about three or four days of actual filming and you know, a lot of times in the morning we would still be, you know, working on tweaking bits of dialog and rehearsing and

Speaker 5:          47:55          yeah.

Speaker 4:          47:55          You know, but other than that, I don't just, I don't know, standard, I guess, you know. Um, I think Richard, you know, he, we did a lot of tapes when we first started and I think Richard maybe had, became more confident as we went along, so things became more kind of efficient, I guess as the years went on.

Speaker 5:          48:13          But, um,

Speaker 4:          48:15          I don't know. We would just shoot and, well, like I said, you know, it was very, like everyone has said it's very relaxed and you know, so it was like the rehearsal was constantly going and the difference between rehearsing and shooting, you know, wasn't that noticeable. It was just kind of something we were all working on together.

Speaker 9:          48:34          And Matt, what other projects do you have coming up apart from the aforementioned shooting of the children, if that sounds really bad? Photographing? Yeah,

Speaker 6:          48:43          children. Um, I, I have a lot of different projects besides shooting, shooting up children. Amid that comment please. Um, aside from my annual portrait with Eller, um, I do a lot of different things. I do a lot of head shots and, um, commercial work. I shoot food, I do interiors, I do a lot of different things. I'm working on movies is fun for me. If I did it all the time, I probably would have a little bit more of a different outlook about movies because it's a really long day on set. You shoot things from three different angles. You have moves. Like Eller was saying about the typical day of filming on set. It's actually quite grueling because it's just so boring to be perfectly honest. Like, I mean, it's exciting being on a movie set, don't get me wrong, but doing it day in, day out, day in, day out, it's, it's, it's tough work. It's really tough. Um, so that's why I don't do very many films. I just do it a few, you know, one or so a year maybe, but, and with red fun, you know, Ellen, I hope that answers your question about shooting.

Speaker 6:          49:53          So you mentioned right now, what is your reaction to like a huge, you know, spike in attention in your life and, uh, your projects moving forward?

Speaker 5:          50:01          Yeah,

Speaker 4:          50:02          figure out what my reaction is. I guess it's really excited. No, I mean, I like making art and you know, there are a lot of amazing filmmakers out there that I'd like to work with then, you know, I might have the opportunity to do that now. So that's definitely exciting.

Speaker 6:          50:21          Question for Eller. Um, are your memories of the film and he experiences going through it, it's still your memories or

Speaker 4:          50:28          do you feel that they have been impacted by the, by the positive reception of the world? Like we look at your work, I look at a picture and say, oh, they're making history. Do you look back like that now or is it still the memory? It's always been, yeah,

Speaker 4:          50:43          that's the strange thing is, you know, it's, it's being, it's become so kind of hyperbolized and you know, the hype, the hype is pretty over the top. Um, but it definitely still feels like, you know, something very personal and it always, it always has, you know, and it, people ask me to change, you can know you were a part of something so important and it's like, it's kind of absurd. I mean it's, I don't know, it's just a movie. It's just an art project. I think if, if you set out to make something important, you're kind of an asshole. So I certainly try not, I don't think I, you know, look back on it that way. I'm glad. I'm glad that it's means so much to so many people. I mean that's the kind of the greatest reaction you could possibly ask for. There is reward. You did ask for it with a piece of art is, you know, beyond people liking it, being moved by it emotionally. It's really, like I said, it's really inspiring to have people be so honest and open about their feelings. But, but no, it definitely still feels very small to me and it's hard to communicate that, you know, when people are

Speaker 4:          51:51          being so kind of hyperbolic about it. But,

Speaker 4:          51:55          but it is, it's very small and personal and you know, it feels strange to be in the middle of all this. You know, it'd be in the midst of all these awards and this is like ultra glamorous Hollywood stuff and it's like we don't really belong there and it, it feels, you know, kind of like crashing the party, but, but I think, you know, I think, I think that's straight. I think hopefully, you know, a movie like this that is small and is, you know, intimate and certainly, you know, was not made with any intention of like any of this to be, you know, to be so recognized and so kind of connected with and celebrated. I hope, you know, it gives people more courage and more opportunity to make smaller, more intimate movies and, you know, get them out there.

Speaker 5:          52:39          So,

Speaker 2:          52:41          okay, that'll close our Q and a, just a reminder that over in the corner, they will be selling the book boyhood. Uh, 40% off. You can't beat that at all. And I'm sure Matt will be signing them and I bet Eller would autograph some of the portraits and my committing. You aren't. Okay. All right. It's been a real pleasure visiting with you. Thank you. You didn't break out in a sweat. I did, but I enjoyed it. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          53:11          Thanks.
