Speaker 1:          00:05          So thanks for coming. I really appreciate you my first time at Google. It's kind of overwhelming. Really. Yeah, I had imagined, but you know, Pixar, you like a postage stamp. This is like a country. Uh, the city of mountain view was very generous to us. So most of the time. Um, yeah. So thanks to cliff for arranging this and, and the authors program and thanks to Disney for bringing you out and arranging the clips and stuff. Um, oh, that's, no, that's the guy who's the Mars rover guy. Really? Yeah. So you should tie that I've talked to you. Yeah. So, uh, John Carter, John Carter. So I actually would like to start in the will drive ab people nuts. I'd love to have the concept art from when you were, how old were you? Uh, it was a 11. You're 11 years old. Perishing draftsmen skill. So this is you.

Speaker 1:          00:49          This is you here or it's me. So you were 11. I was 11. And then I think if there's another one there that's a, that's Mark Andrews at age 10. Look how good he could draw. And he really kicked it. But I hate him. It's, um, and then I think also you have a Michael Shay bond froze nine. Yeah. Putting himself that's a little bit more accurate for nine years old. Yeah. I'm like his, his foot robot. The one thing come between all three of us besides that we all wrote on this picture was that we all were infected by the book that this movie came from, uh, called a princess of Mars. And we'd all read it similar ages and all couldn't sort of drop the images and um, and characters that stuck in our heads as we grow, grew older. I mean, we all have things that sticking our heads in the formative years, whether it's an album we've heard or movie we've seen or a book we've read. And this was one of them.

Speaker 2:          01:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:42          So we said we had to have a little club once we found this out. We didn't know this until we were all writing really. And we said we should, oh, now that we have to make it, like if any other writer comes on this at the right half to have a drawing improve that they like read this book when they were a kid. That's really, yeah. I didn't discover burrows until much later. Fortunately. No, I couldn't. Like I, I, I'm actually, I shouldn't even be on this day. Um, but it's, uh, it's interesting cause you know, 1917 and I just haven't seen was when it was published, compiled, but it was, we actually started 1912 was when he started in copyright. I might point you exactly. And so it, uh, it's, it's literally a hundred years to last month. Wow. That's pretty amazing. So, so this brings up the question of an anachronism, right? So, you know, people are like, well, he gleefully embracing anachronisms the book. So what did you think about this? Did you ever hit a point where you're like, well, it's just not Mars enough, it's just not real enough? You know, there's this weird assumption

Speaker 2:          02:38          that

Speaker 1:          02:40          you have to modernize, contemporize or bring, I mean, I made a movie about fish that talk underwater that was inaccurate. I find that if you have a problem with me taking license with Mars, then it's a sad world. You live in that you can't take license and have stories where you take a couple of things. You mean Grimms fairy tales have like, there was a sausage,

Speaker 3:          03:00          a burden of mouse and they lived in a house together and you're like, okay. You know what I mean? It's, it's, it's a, it's, that's just the fun of stories is taking a couple of things are one thing and just going, what if, and that's what Burroughs did. You know, that was the period of time when telescopes had just gotten slightly improved and they could see a little bit better on the surface of Mars. And they saw these lines and some people, you know, I think it was personal low that just thought that they were canals and it got everybody thinking about maybe people live there. And then you just see this plethora of, of, uh, just fantasizing. And imagination go on that didn't have a title to it yet, but it wasn't until the 30s or forties that they started calling it science fiction in a sort of, you know, common way that we do not denigrating way back then.

Speaker 3:          03:44          It was still horrible. Yeah. Pulp. But the interesting thing is that I, the thing that I loved about the book and what we felt was the DNA about it, the theme, the thumb print about it to capitalize on that hadn't been done by anybody. Even though it's inspired so many things. Yeah. Was that it felt like a romantic adventure. It felt like somebody that just wanted to explore and find one more last continent on our planet. It didn't read like somebody that wanted to travel in a spaceship and go to space. It was almost against his will. He's like, I have nowhere else I can uncover. The guy got to go off the planet. But it was like, it was sort of like a reluctant choice in it, but it was really this sense of desire to, to explore, find a new culture, find a new war, um, civilization that had been going on in parallel the whole time that we just didn't know about, which had been happening for a hundred, hundred 50 years.

Speaker 3:          04:37          Honored. And so that's what I loved about the book. And it reads like a tourist that's gone there and kept a journal on in some ways. I mean, you made it very clear in the movie, which you were Nice enough to show me when that you, um, you made it really clear that John Carter was looking to get the hell out of what we knew as being the world, you know, he needed to get away from it. I mean, that was, that was, that was something we added, um, again, because of the, one of the downsides of the, uh, antiquated nature of the book was that it, uh, it had very sort of simplistic character development and some of those things very quickly became tropes. They were cool for a while. When you're doing flash Gordon and uh, and even early superman and buck Rogers where you had just the, the hero that would fight anything and the Damsel's would go, oh, help me.

Speaker 3:          05:30          And uh, but that was not interesting to us at all and I wouldn't expect it to be interested in anybody else. We took that, we took sort of these core elements of them and kept them as starting points. But if they were any character that we had been developing in on anything original and anything else I've worked on, we would've said it's nowhere near enough. We need to, we need to, you know, add a lot more to them. So we, we said, what if it was more of an origin story of somebody that had that nature of fighting for justice no matter what did they compelled to,

Speaker 1:          05:59          to help others, but they had gotten bitten really hard for it and they were afraid to sort of venture out again to do it. And that made it interesting. Yeah. We're running out of power because the lights are going down. I think people are turning off their laptops and maybe it's surging. Yeah. Um, so, uh, I asked a friend of yours, well, a colleague of Yours, Rob Cook, so I don't have any friends. You don't have any friends? It's the cost of Hollywood and the Hollywood. I live up here. Well, I, you know, I live in mill valley. I work at Pixar, so that's nice. The cost of mill valley, the cost of living in the Alleles, it's a horrible place. Uh, no, I'm kidding. My, my wife's family's from there. Um, so, so rob cook, uh, who was who, who just retired after 30 years at Penn?

Speaker 1:          06:43          Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Um, so he just retired and he became the first like concerned Meritus or whatever. Yeah. That's going to go to his head. Yeah, it is a, and I said, is there anything I can ask him that he hasn't been asked before? He was like, I don't think so, man. And so I wanted to talk to you about feet, feet. So early. I used to work on games. And one of the problems of courses when you would, when you would, when you would have these artificial characters, you know, their feet never looked real. I see the way the feet and met the ground never really looked right. And it's like, and, and you guys picks her really mastered this. And then you're thrown into this world where you have human beings you have to deal with. So how did you deal with these?

Speaker 1:          07:19          And you mentioned earlier a little bit of the trouble of having to deal with live action and real things and sets that you'd never done at Pixar. And so, yeah, it's like, well, I'm going to try to make a connection between those two and feet. Um, well, I don't really like feed that. You know, the thing he's talking about his weight, right? And that's the thing that you see first time animators make the mistake of all the time. It's not giving things proper weight. Um, there's just the, there's a sense of weight to everything in the world and whether you're really conscious effort to not, and that's, that's what, uh, the, uh, Disney animators had really mastered and figured out and we, and we had sort of pulled from and John and added to Pixar and definitely, you know, made that a big deal when we were, uh, animating on, on this picture.

Speaker 1:          08:03          What a lot of people don't know is that this movie is got more in a character animation in it than any other movie I've ever worked on. Um, putting the fish movie, including that fish movie that we will not mention email. Um, and, uh, it's, um, it's, so it really was not. I did and I never swapped one form of making movies for another. I, I felt like, oh, I had to use everything I knew and then add on top of it a live action, uh, skills that I had to sort of learn on the go. Um, and the big myth, this even happened on the set I would get on set on the first couple of weeks ago. What's it like to work with people? Humans like I have never directed a computer or an inanimate object in my life. All I've ever done is to talk to a human being and I've talked to people that had to be good at their job, that had special talents and skills

Speaker 3:          08:56          specifically at whatever they did. They were great at modeling something, they were great at lighting something. They are great at camera. All of all of them having not only much more intelligence than me but mostly more talent in whatever the arena was. So I was used to debating all the time and you guys, I don't need to convert. You get that. Like if you and I were talking about where the camera's going to go or what the model is going to be on a computer, we can like debate for a couple of minutes, hours, days about it. Just the, you know, just, just creatively. And then you've got to ask the box to do it and then it becomes this unwieldy toddler that will not cooperate and not do what you want and you start banging on it, you're cursing. And that's where you run out of time and money.

Speaker 3:          09:35          That's where like everybody thinks I get it from, I mean I've been, I'm just coming off of a world tour where every person that asks from the press thinks, well, what's it like to come from a world where you can just do whatever you want? And I'm like, wow, wow. You have never worked with computers, have you? Because I felt like I could get whatever I wanted on the live action set. I've never told this story. This is a good one. Um, the, the way the way picks are set up is based, you know, we just made up how we made, how to make movies. We did it with our gut and with our instinct. And I think that helped us. We use logic, which turns out Hollywood doesn't. And, and we based it around how John lasted or work to. So John always knows what he wants.

Speaker 3:          10:19          I mean, or at least he's always good at facilitating how to know what to want and whether it's micro or macro. So we built a machine that works based on how well the director knows. There's stuff. If the director doesn't know what what's going on, the machine doesn't move forward at all. Um, and if they really know or they start to get an idea of the machine moves really well in live action, the machine moves whether the director comes out of his trailer or not. Which is a real sad that happened to statement. Well no but, but, but it, but it was really fascinating. There'd be days where like, they're called setups when you're gonna move the camera to another place and start a new shot, there'll be days where like, okay, we finished that shot and before I could tell anybody what we were going to do, they'd all start moving the camera and putting it somewhere else and I'd play this little, um, you know, just functional game of going there.

Speaker 3:          11:03          I'm going to wait and see if anyone's going to ask me what we're going to shoot next because they seem to not care. They seem to be putting it where they will. I haven't had to talk that much with Brad Bird, but we did compare that that was happening to both of us were like, is anybody going to ask me what they want the next shot to be? Wow. They seem to be fine. I'm just gonna let them set it up now and then they'll find out without, I don't want that camera there. And um, it didn't happen a lot, but you started to realize it was, it was based on just you have to get it done regardless of if you have an inept director or the best director in the world, they have to work with the lowest common denominator, which is really kind of sad.

Speaker 3:          11:38          And uh, but, but they're also bay. They're there live actions based on, nobody wants to look bad. Nobody wants to look like they weren't ready for any request. So they're all like on edge, like whatever he says, whatever. He says, you know what I do? And I finally figured that out about three months into the shoot and we were out of London in, in Utah and I'm in this western set that they've built out in the middle of Utah. It's fantastic. Is that where the arena was built? Is that what I was reading? It's where everything was built, whether you saw it side and um, and so I'm, I'm Taylor who is the lead is walking through a doorway. It's your classic cowboy coming into the saloon kind of shot. And I was feeling like it was a little too cliche and I had no clue that anybody had any of these or anything. I just went,

Speaker 1:          12:21          we need two chickens here and five minutes, here's chicken. There were two chickens and if you see the movie, you'll see there's two chickens. And I really didn't need to chickens. I just at that point wanted to see can they get three to chicken? And they did. It was amazing. So, um, I never wanted to do abuse that privilege, but it is kind of a, that's to go back to, I could get that faster than if I ever asked for two chickens at Pixar. Six months would go by and then we debated, do we really need to do it? You know, how should they be model what color feathers do? My Gosh. And so it's, that's a long answer from way back when that question, but two chickens, that's kind of cool. So we get back to the question of CGI actors now, right? CGI actors. So, so one of the things when rob gave his talk here, as he talked about how much work you put into matching was [inaudible] up with Billy Crystal's mannerisms and the way he moves his mouth, right? Grass. And then you have these things with mouse that are twice as wide. Yes. And forearms. So they don't really or not, you know, the torches are not gonna match up like that. Nope. They would. So how did you approach this? Well, every, to be honest, there's no science. I mean every, there's a philosophy, but every single character

Speaker 3:          13:37          do you model every single, uh, voice you add to it is a different, uh, problem to solve. And it's no different than an actor being given a new role in another movie. There's, there's hopefully something new and different about it with the same goal of making you believe that that character really exists. So that's part of the thrill. I mean, if you don't enjoy trying to figure that out, that you shouldn't be doing it. I mean, that's, that's part of the fun. Um, and, um, I, you know, all I ever wanted when I read that book was to believe it. I want it. I didn't see the world in animation. I didn't see the world in cartoons when I was a kid. I just, when I read something, I w I was transported, I was there and I always wanted to know what it would be like to be on the surface of Mars and meet one of these creatures and, and believe them as much as I believe anybody else that I'm talking to right now.

Speaker 3:          14:24          And, uh, when we did a test for this movie a year in advance, we made sure our test wasn't flashy, wasn't jumping around, it was just two guys talking. And would I take it as simply as a quiet moment between butch and Sundance in the, you know, like, and uh, and that was the goal because I said, if we can make that work, then, then we can, it's possible to do this film in the airspace. I want to, I feel a little frustrated sometimes because in the marketing, all they can do is show 15 seconds, 30 seconds, and it gives the impression that's this Whizzbang, you know, going to movie. And it's not, it's, it's, it's a very much about emotion and relationships and romance and adventure in quiet moments. And we're, and that's, to me what's so sexy about it in a weird way was the quiet stuff was just the like, wow, we're, I'm just really talking to these people.

Speaker 3:          15:08          And I knew to believe that, that you would fundamentally not only have to pull what I was used to at Pixar for the animated characters, but I'd have to believe the live action characters as much I can. I feel like I can tell when an actors acting against the tennis ball or a green wall. Um, and you can also tell when an actress does activity against another actor and they're not getting anything. Um, I wanted there to believe that there was just a real engagement, a real just in the moment. So I thought, well, I have to have great actors up against great actors, so I need, you know, somebody that like, uh, willing to foes stature and Samantha Morton's, uh, to be willing to play these ultimately CGI characters because I know what's going to remain at the end of the day is their voice, their eyes, and their movements.

Speaker 3:          15:56          And, but I also know that none of that comes for free. There's been a lot of misdirection about talking about Mo cap. Like it's going to actually do the job for anybody. It's just a pencil and it's only as magic fairy. It's only as good as the user that uses it. And again, I'm preaching to the choir here. You guys all know this. It's all about who you have, not what you have. And I knew that I needed a great actor on one side and at the back end, a great animator. And as long as I had those, we'd struggle through whatever tools we thought were the smartest way to work and what drove the tools we worked between it was what's going to give me the most believable presence on, on, in the actual shot, while I felt I don't want it to feel synthetic, I want to have as much screen real estate, be real and warm and, and, and, and, uh, uh, sort of, uh, uh, what am, what am I thinking of broken and imperfect and not be cold calculated in video gamey at the end of the day, no matter how good it looks, you can feel a little bit of a separation, a little bit of coldness when too much is CGI in a live action combo movies.

Speaker 3:          17:03          So I said, well, to guarantee that won't happen, let's actually go to the most cool desert location we can, let's actually put the actor in front of the camera and let's actually put the other actor that's going to be CGI in front of the camera. But because they're nine foot tall or 10 feet tall, I need to make sure that the eyes are going to be exactly what the other eyes are going to look. Or else again, it's going to look like they're not really looking at each other and they're not really reacting off of impulse. So I need these other actors to stand on stilts, wear gray pajamas with weird head gear and be like mountain goats and go up and down like you know these desert hills and, and that's how I actually sold it to people like Samantha and Willem. I said, how would you like to wear gray pajamas on stilts and with headgear and being 120 degree heat in the desert?

Speaker 3:          17:45          I figured, why hide it? And that was literally the first pitch line I would have to them. And it was like, it was, it kind of had this great reverse psychological effect. There was, it was like a dare. They were like, really, really? Nobody's ever dared me to do that before. I think I'll take it, you know, and, and, and it worked. And it was, and they loved it because these, they've made so many movies, they just wanted to be challenged again and um, it was difficult, but nothing effort, nothing that looks effortless in art, uh, is effortless. It typically is that if it looks effortless and it looks like it was always ordained to be that way, that means a tremendous amount of inverse effort went into it. Um, so it was a really difficult shoot along those lines. Actually, the relationship that was expressed in the film between Tar, starkist and Sola was probably in some ways the most poignant, right?

Speaker 3:          18:33          Yeah. Well, again, I had willing to phone Smith more than acting against each other. I just had to get out of the way. Did they have a lot of, uh, did they do a lot of work with your animators and your folks know it was very separated, but the people that were our head animators are supervising animators that basically it's trickled down. They basically are as the guide that keeps it on track because you always have multiple animators doing a single character. You know, there was 50 animators on Dora yet it had to come across like w only yelling, just dreamt, generous seem to be acting it right. As an example. So, uh, you have the people that were the supervising animators, they were on set, they were on set all the time so that they could just firsthand be aware of what was going on. Also be there when they heard, you know, what I liked versus what I didn't like. If we came up with ideas, we could discuss it and it wouldn't get lost in the ether. And a year later, you know, or actually for me it was like eight months later when we were suddenly in animation production, uh, we would have a shorthand and a then that's how it worked. That's really interesting. It's funny,

Speaker 1:          19:32          Dory. So we'll have questions, uh, in near the end of the, of the talk here. So, uh, you don't want to line up or anything now, but if you want to fill it out and moderator, or if you want to, uh, go to the, Mike just made me think of your questions cause I'm not gonna get all the good questions, I assure you. Um, so going from people, the crowds, I mean, you had some fairly amazing

Speaker 3:          19:52          collection. Yeah. You know, um, there was, uh, there were days when I had 500 people in front of the camera. It was wild. Um, it was thrilling. I mean, you can't help but, um, I would explain to people on days that I like when, when you had days like that, when the set was that big or you'd have an entire air ship that's like on a gimbal left and right, that took up a gym, you know, to, you know, a half a football field or, or you were out there on the city street with 500 extras. Sometimes if you thought too hard about it, you'd shut down. So I just go, just pretend it's digital. Just pretend it's digital. You've worked with worlds. They're 10 times bigger than this, you know, just pretend it's digital and then you kind of overcome it and you're fine. All right.

Speaker 1:          20:36          So, uh, Tar Sarkis it's all, they're all great, but in some ways I found the most fun of the movie was in the dog dog, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          20:48          He's got the easy job of just being entertainment. Well, he, he's that entertaining in the book if you want to talk about it, cause I don't want to ruin the role. I mean, you know, I don't want to give too much away about how you meet him, but um, he's uh, he's basically the equivalent of a dog or a small bear or something like that in, in, in a, in this world. Um, and we tried really hard because there's so much flora and fauna and so much a nature that is described in these books as again, it's, if you had gone there, right, that we wanted the stuff not to come across like fanboy. We didn't want to come across like this with somebody. That's been drawing this character on their, their, their notebook through school for their whole life and all they've ever want to do is just realize it on the screen since they were 11.

Speaker 3:          21:32          Exactly. No, and we wanted it to, we wanted it to feel like I'm, no, this is what nature intended and this is what nature required, uh, and evolve to for anything on this planet. Um, so we pulled from every kind of, uh, animal creatures, sea life, whatever it was that to, to find a, a sort of continuity and logistics behind all the physiology behind every creature here. Um, but you know what, let's just a fun, fun character. I don't know if you're going to show a clip because if know we're showing a clip of will. I don't want to, all right. I still don't want to ruin them. You'll enjoy Willa. Yeah, he's great. And it's funny and the reaction of the audience when it was shown was what it was just, you could hear the glee, you know, how they appreciate them. I want to believe that, you know, when Burroughs wrote the book, he had never written anything before.

Speaker 3:          22:18          He was very frustrated with what he was reading for adventure stories. And I, and I think he was trying to read stories to his son and he, and he just sort of winged it and fit. And I think you said I could basically write better than what I'm reading, you know. And um, and I, I know weird way I think for doing that, even though you can look at the book and find all these in a, this sort of naive writer and a lot of things that could be better, better character development, maybe some better plotting, it still holds up because it's made with such sincerity. I really feel like somehow he tapped closer to real myth for being innocent and unafraid to just jump into it. And I find a real kinship to that with what it felt like with being with the gang.

Speaker 3:          23:00          When we first started making toy story, we, we didn't know how it was done with collectively. We had sort of half the knowledge you needed. And, um, and, and that's what really drove us. Uh, and, and, and I, and I, I'm so glad we didn't know better or else we wouldn't have made some of the glorious mistakes we made that led us to some of the better answers. And, um, and so I think that that's why in a weird way, there's a lot of elements to his stuff that holds up today. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's funny, the Pixar nerd in me wants to ask you like how you would have done Wally different after doing this, but it seems like such a Weirdo Wally. No, nobody's ever asked this. I'm wildly, really was a great movie set up or prep. Yeah. For me to do this movie, because it was all about imperfection.

Speaker 3:          23:52          It was all about trying to figure out how to make them for Wally make it feel like you just discovered this guy and life with this life was going on, whether you documented it or not. And so it is a sad thing that when you do an all computer graphics movie, nothing comes for free. You have to plan everything. So we were, we had to plan for imperfection. We had to break down and deconstruct what tells you that you're using a camera because of the imperfection in the Lens. What tells you that a human being's holding the camera because of the inertia and the muscle fatigue. What tells you that you're working within an actual space that's really tiny and you have to change your, your, your choices of how your camera work is because you're stuck in the corner with the camera. Like all of that stuff was planned.

Speaker 3:          24:39          You don't get any of that for free. So anything that felt kind of gritty and imperfect, uh, in any of our movies, let alone that one was planned, which can drive you insane. Um, and but I knew that that was the thing to embrace and try to capitalize on and again own. But I get a lot more for free for shooting a in the conditions that we shot for Carter. So that again, it would feel like this is probably really happening somewhere. So like real so, so it's funny cause so thank God I made Wally before it or I wouldn't have had that instinct. Yeah. Now you can sort of in some ways, and I know that, uh, up was not so much yours, but you know, you can sort of trace this sort of like animals, that Pixar sorta thing really. And I sort of in some weird way, maybe it's me and that's okay.

Speaker 3:          25:31          Um, but you know, where you see, you know, animals like Doug, I look to Molly and all the rest of, you know, leading the things like, right. Yeah. So, so that you can see like there's a history there and you sorta want to, well, it's a natural instinct. It's a much more natural instinct for an animator to give life to something that isn't human, right. Because it's just, I, it's just how you're wired up. I mean, humans, do you have the exact example? Exact example. They're right. They're right. And when I was in, uh, you know, I grew up in this small town where there wasn't as many kids like me that liked all the exact same thing. We were all sort of, you know, smaller minority game on, you know, Andrew's. Yeah. And, um, so it wasn't until I went to college for animation that I met other kids of my tight and that I realized that I was a type like, oh, you also thought your bike was cold in the rain, that a fish was lonely in the fishbowl. That of leaf was afraid of heights when it fell. You know, I couldn't stop myself from looking at things like that. That was just the way I always looked at the world. And so imbuing animals and inanimate objects with things is, is sort of like a, I don't know, animation one-on-one. Yeah, I bet. I bet. Now it's funny because, so one of the questions that I mentioned, uh, like you should ask him about how he did if for

Speaker 1:          26:44          these guys and stuff. But I want that and I want you to tell us about that because that's always really interesting for, for me. Uh, and me again. Uh, but the thing that really struck me when I was watching the film is I was trying to find the things that were truly alien. Right? Yeah. Because whenever people do alien worlds, different worlds, unfortunately, sometimes they're awfully, you know, us Los Angeles looking thing. Oh really? But, um, but for me, the, the flying machines and the interfaces and the interface, the interface to use that word, I'm so sorry. Uh, so, but the interface for controlling that flying machine, you know, you have this fellow from, you know, you know, they're just coming out of the, the, the war, you know, and something he's presented with having to fly this thing. Yes. You have to figure it out. Yeah. I mean, how much did you work on making that? Oh, it was so fun.

Speaker 3:          27:35          I worked with basically two people, uh, on all the, all the props and the machines and stuff. It's, again, those are described in the books, not down to their detail, but to their major functions. And stuff. Um, it was with the, my production designer, Nathan Crowley, who works on all of Christopher Nolan's movies, most of them. And uh, and um, Brian Church who is an incredible concept artist and a who had ironically worked on other, uh, failed, uh, attempts to put a princess of Mars onto the screen. And, uh, we finally came around to it and I just kept saying without knowing what I was looking for in the very beginning, I just want it to be a period film of a period I didn't know about. I just want it to look like we researched our marsh and history and did really, really well. I want it to be in historical costume drama.

Speaker 3:          28:22          I want it to feel like the satisfaction you get when you go, oh, this is my, what be what it was like to be an ancient Egypt. This is might be what it was like to be in feudal Japan. And, and even though nobody knew that this existed before. So we did a lot of discussion that when Burroughs wrote this book and when he kind of places the time of things on earth, it was pre industrial revolution. And what does that really mean? Well, it means pre automization for a lot of things or even the stuff that was automated, it was so rudimentary, you could look at it and figure it out. You had the luxury of just seeing how everything was connected, how they're all the gears were attached and it usually still required a lot of manpower. And so that's very visual. That's very cinematically friendly.

Speaker 3:          29:06          So we said let's make it in depth preindustrial revolution on Mars. Um, I kept saying tall ships in the sky. Yeah. Um, when you look at tall ships, I don't know. I still, I mean my father's not a call. I've been out on boats most of my life and I still can't figure out half of what a tall ship does, but I can look at it and know that everything I'm looking at, you know, the rigging, the Wa, the ropes and all the gears and the wood. And I could tell that like they all have a function and, and that's very kind of, um, satisfying. I mean it's very cool. You, you feel a lot of history and depth and, and of, of, of, of, uh, learning that has happened to, to get to that, that vessel to that point. And that's what we decided to do with everything on Mars was, uh, make it feel that you could see the manual labor, see all the purpose and the function and culture behind everything.

Speaker 3:          30:01          And then one of the brain teasers was, if we want to make it feel that this has been concurrently going on, then how do we, how do we not let it accidentally look like earth had anything to do with it? Because in other words, if you suddenly saw a doorknob on a door, you'd be like, Earth, Earth lame. You know, and suddenly you're down to like, okay, I'll look at the Burbank. Yeah. Fundamentally. How to, how did they come up with windows? How did they come up with doors? And you know, it was hard, but it was so satisfying to come up with those answers because again, none of that stuff's ever pointed out. It's never, there's never a spotlight on it. But if you've done it right, you feel it. I learned a lot of that from just making worlds at Pixar. I'm like, there's, again, not in a single detail gets on the screen without planning it.

Speaker 3:          30:41          So I'm used to over planning and making sure that everything in the mid ground background had a reason and whether it ever gets addressed or not. And so that really paid off also for a film like this, sort of like Andy's room, but Mars, yeah. Auntie's room. But Mars, wow, here's the sales pitch. Here's the sales pitch. I'm not, but so the language, which sort of dominates his relationships with them, you know, sort of mid movie Red Way Ish, you know, earlier. Yeah. Yeah. But you obviously put an awful lot of work into it. I mean, well, break your heart to go all Babel juice on it. I mean, you know, Burroughs did a lot of that. I mean, he had written 11 books, uh, of this series by 1960. And so when I was a kid in 1976 and found this book at 11, it was already, it was already done.

Speaker 3:          31:25          It was my Harry Potter. I mean, I, there were so many adventures and you could just tell the desire to keep discovering places that hadn't been mapped on the, on the, on, on the, on the, uh, on the world, on the globe was really what drove each book. It was like, oh, we didn't know about this part of the world. We didn't know about this country, didn't know about these people. And you, and you travel with this little group that we all meet in the first one and over 11 books. That's a lot of Martian language that he had slowly compiled. And fortunately, I, it's called a guide to Barsoum. Somebody in late sixties early seventies took the pains and never left their basement and put it all together in an encyclopedia. This is before we keep him. So I think we bought every copy of it for off Ebay.

Speaker 3:          32:08          Everybody in the art department, Production Really? And a, yeah, and we were able, it was half my work done for me. I mean that's usually two years at Pixar working on something is coming up with that stuff and it still wasn't full languages. It was only like he wasn't, he never thought about it from like this wide about how it all connects, but it was enough information that we could give it to a linguist. We gave it to a guy named Paul from or who actually did all the languages for Avatar. And at first I was a little reluctant because I didn't want to look redundant, but then it turned out to be the smartest thing because he didn't want to be redundant. And so he wanted to go a whole nother direction. And also he had a book that already had a starting point.

Speaker 3:          32:45          He had to work in this pool that burrows had set. And so, um, and the whole movie, you know, it doesn't work in Martian language. It only works for maybe a quarter of a movie. So, uh, it really works out great. The, the, I, I don't know if this would thrill than anybody else, but one of the most thrilling moments for me, we had a week to a week and a half before we started shooting where we called it the dark camp, um, where we taught the actors that were going to play Sarcs, how to walk on stilts, how to work with Mocap, how we were going to shoot specific things and functions that they had to do with, uh, within certain scenes and how to learn the language. So they worked with a, a language coach and they had all their lines read to them on us on a CD so that they could play it back all the time, uh, from Paul Fromer for they get the pronunciation right.

Speaker 3:          33:31          And so they sat in a circle once, a twice a day, and they would talk back and forth to each other with their lines, uh, even though they didn't actually functionally have a column response. And then what the meanings behind the lines where they were just to be able to look each other in the eye and talk and get more used to hearing how each other talk and they start adopting the same accent. And it was the cool, it was the animator and me. It was the coolest thing is the first time I heard Polly Walker, Thomas Haden Church, uh, Willem Defoe and Samantha Morton all talk to each other. And I didn't look and I could tell exactly who was who and I, that's when I knew we were in good hands that we'd have no problem being able to follow who was who in the movies. So, so, so as I'm watching this and I kept on saying, well, with the exception of a Darryl's Hybris character, right?

Speaker 3:          34:14          It seems like it would sort of break your heart as you're going through it, as you're building this over what, four years you worked on this by five years you keep on leaving behind things like you leave behind the language, you'll leave behind Bryan Cranston and now it's like you leave behind all these people and you really, you have these core people of course, who you carry through the whole movie, but it doesn't it kill you to say, oh, we're not going to visit that language again until the next move. A real nice problem to have. I mean, it must be, yeah, that's what the books were. Yeah. We tried to, again, I don't want to be called hidebound. I approached all of this. I don't think I made a single career choice on this thing. It was all about wanting to finally see after 36 years as a fan, this thing up on the screen.

Speaker 3:          34:56          Right. And hoping that it would start a snowball that would start a series that would go as many movies, if not more as the books, which would weigh outlive me. I mean, I can't, I have, there's no way anybody can promise that'll happen, but that's your hope. So you have to plan for that. So I plan, we got the rights to the first three books and we mapped it out, Michael Mark and I like a good TV season so that everything has a Meta underlying goal with it. And also not being able to be afraid to like hold something back. That might've been great in the first book, but we couldn't find a narrative excuse for right. And use it in the second or it'll come up in the third with a much grander purpose. And the same thing about pulling somebody or something from one of the later books and put it in earlier and

Speaker 1:          35:38          have the competence and comfort of knowing there's a grand design that this will all satisfy, uh, if we, if we can keep going. But I also hate cliffhangers. I hate being left in the dust right before. I hate the Hubris of like, oh, we'll definitely be back. You know, I just, I just, I just find that cocky, but Groupons and I'm still frustrated from buckaroo. Banzai well, thank you. And, and I mean, I want, I'm still waiting. Yeah. You know, playing a 10. So it was a little of what it was. How do you, how do you let it so that it can continue on if you want, but you've been emotionally satisfied and come to a conclusion at the end of each of these stories. For us, it's a trilogy and each of these have a very wrapped up, complete narrative emotional statement that we're doing, but there are greater things that will go on if we're allowed to.

Speaker 1:          36:29          So, so if you want to start lining up to ask questions, now's a great time to do that. Um, uh, because I really only have one question that I, I'm just dying to ask. So consequence. So you said, you mentioned that at your Ted talk in a way that basically without consequence there is no drama, right? Yep. And unfortunately as I've gotten older, uh, you come to say, well, it's extremely unlike the John Carter is going to die in this movie, right? It's extremely unlikely the data tourist is going to die this movie. So is there really a consequence? How do you, how do you sort of try to pull out that drama? I don't want to give away anything, but you know, the whole time you're watching it, he goes back to Earth. Yeah, that's true. That was part of the narrative structure. Yeah. So, uh, please ask, you're making decisions as a director, how do you conceptualize the audience of your mind?

Speaker 1:          37:15          Is it, is it yourself? Is it your 11 year old? Exactly. No, that's it. I mean, I've been asked this question for 25 years now, 22 years, and I got mad at the press recently. I just said, my Gosh, you know, I'm going to answer this the same way in five years, in 10 years and 15 years of the same way I've been answering for the last 20. Uh, I don't think about who the audience is. I think about the audience. If I'm ever thinking of the audience, it's the audience member and myself, like I can't, I disassociate myself and go, okay, I'm going to the theater and I'm going to go see this, would I like this? But that's the most I would ever ask from anybody that I love. That's an artist that I follow. I'm not sitting there hoping that Scorsese's tried to second guess my demographic or tried to test anything or the Picasso ever did though the Beatles or the stones.

Speaker 1:          38:02          I follow them because I find them to be the tastemakers. I find them to be the people that they can see farther past the horizon than I can. And I want to know what they're getting into that I'm, I'm not clear on yet. And, and that's, that's always been obvious to me that that's what I, I somehow, because movies are these big things with armies behind them and lots of money and a lot of anxiety from a studio, uh, it starts involving the audience and I just feel it. That's the kiss of death. Um, and we've never followed

Speaker 3:          38:36          it at Pixar. And Steve got that from the beginning. So he, he really is credit. I always got to get more credit than I ever do about how much he just firewall does from everything and just let us do, make all the mistakes, all the gut instincts that we would have done had we never left home and just we're making this thing for ourselves. Anything we've made, I've made so far. Knock on wood, I could care less. I've ever get to show it to anybody else. I've satisfied me and maybe the people that I care about peer wise artistically and that has stood us in such good stead were superstitious now of ever doing anything more than that. So, and I would never want anybody else to do differently. I just find it's a little disrespectful of the audience. It's like Steve had a great saying, which is it's our job to know what people want before they do and I think that's incredibly ballsy and incredibly insightful. Is that really hard to instill in the people you work with? Some those coming from the rest? Not at all, no. The Hollywood, I find that really artistic people get it. People that don't, I don't really care. Okay. I'm glad to hear

Speaker 4:          39:40          you mentioned, you know, you as an artist, you have to kind of go about your vision and then kind of see, uh, you know, once it's out in the world, what people think of it. Do you ever get into, you mentioned that the previous or John Carter, you may not accurately reflect kind of what your concept is for the movie. Do you ever have a, you know,

Speaker 3:          39:57          Journal dialogues with marketing folks or how did you go about, how do you get to crying like a, it's not, I've never worked on a movie that was easy to sell unless it had a two behind it. And so it's, it's, I've, I've had, I've, I've said to mark and I said, just get used to, it's never going to be easy. You're going to get, you know, silent robots, rats that cook, you know, Octogenarians with a Korean boy scouts, romantic adventures that are from 1912. I mean it's, it's not going to be easy for you get used to it because people always say to the marketers and to the studios what they want. They want the door knob. But the truth is, is that they don't know what they want. They're, all they are capable of doing is describing what they liked last because they're searching.

Speaker 3:          40:51          But what they really want is a new color that won't be as cool as the last color they had saw and they don't know how to describe that new color. That's our job. And the marketer said job is to say it looks exactly like orange, but it won't look like orange. It's a tough job for them. I'm not trying to get, you know, get them off, you know, off the hook. But I get it. It's, I mean, I've had nothing but full cooperation. I just get the W it's tough. I mean, I know that once they're in the theater, they'll go, oh, I always wanted this. I just didn't know it. You know? And that's the, that's the feeling I want when I see or hear something, it's, it's just you're in this weird betwixt and between prior to to release of anything. Cool. Thanks. Cool.

Speaker 5:          41:34          Hi. So first of all, I'm a big fan of the fish movie, so thank you for that. I don't say it, I don't know. Why can't we say that it finding Mimo, right? It's, it's like the movie that must not be exactly what we call this, the finding Voldemort, the Mars movie. I, you know, anyway, so speaking of marketing, um, so the book is a princess of Mars. And when I first started hearing about the movie, it was John Carter of Mars and now it's John Carter. And I know there's obviously a lot of people in a lot of factors that go into the title of the movie. And I was wondering if you could talk about how that evolved in this case.

Speaker 3:          42:07          I'm at a place now where I'll ruin the movie if I tell you exactly what I, why I finally came up with the decision that I did, but there was a real sort of testing that went on with groups and stuff that I couldn't ignore that, uh, about the title that happened last year where they found that a large portion of people, and this is again the wrong place to say it's too, don't like sigh. I think they don't like Scifi or think they know what Scifi means when they hear that word. And the Mars thing was just boom. It was like saying, um, will you watch a movie with subtitles? I don't like to read. I won't see it. And you just know the, how many movies you've done, been denied of what you might enjoy. You know, had you just got over that Hump and then she didn't showed subtitles from the Mars.

Speaker 3:          42:50          Shaun's um, I can't, I couldn't ignore that fact. And so, but then nobody was making me change it. It was more like, well, how do we want to deal with this? So I slept on it for, I dunno, a week and I started to realize, you know what, just from a narrative storytelling standpoint, it's about John Carter and I, and then I had this idea that I pitched to Disney. I said, if you'll let me have it the way I'd like when they leave the theater and then I'll be willing to go the way that everybody would feel more comfortable going into the theater because of Mars is not going away and it's going to be an every other title if it ever comes back. So that was really, it

Speaker 6:          43:32          came down to it. So we'll see. Thank you. Thanks.

Speaker 5:          43:37          Um, hi there. So I'm a huge fan of Pixar and one thing I really love about the movies I've seen is it's more than just a fun story, but there's always a bigger meaning behind them. Like, for example, maybe it was just me that saw this or it's all in my head. But um, like cars for example, I saw like I saw situations there that reflected the economy or about how up has some concepts of like materialism in that. Yes. Is that something that you purposely think of early on when you're coming up with these stories?

Speaker 3:          44:09          I think I can pretty much say of though, I can't speak for every filmmaker that at Pixar that no, because we're so emotionally driven, but we love that anything that starts to create parallels or feel like it does naturally link up to truths that are out there, whether they're economic, political or emotional. Great.

Speaker 1:          44:32          Let's use them because you just want it to feel that much more grounded. The last thing any of us want to do or like having done to us as being preached when we watch a movie, um, I think you want to feel something and if that turns out to be connected to a deep truth that you are inspired by, again, politically or environmentally were great. But what matters to us is that you're touched here, not here more than anything else. Um, it's also just the curse of I'm the guy that likes the music and then I don't even know what the lyrics were for years, you know. Oh, you know, that's about incest. What? I had no idea coming in that tomb for years, you know. Um, somebody just showed me the lyrics come my Sharona and they're awful. They're horrible. I had no idea.

Speaker 1:          45:18          So, but, uh, anyway, I know my little pretty thank you. Sure. Please play full rounded off. I'm sorry. Got It. Oh, sorry. Yeah, thanks for coming. I think, I think Wally's actually one of my favorite Pixar movie. You think you're gonna hear that a lot and I just had a question. I hope it doesn't offend anyone at Pixar or you, but, uh, it just seems like since Disney is like petting, like, no, he has acquired eight. It's, it seems like Pixar is now be trying to book some being other, more commercial, like for example, Bait. They suspended production on newt to focus on cars too. And No, it's just, you worry that there's a tension there. The sts, cause like, you know, that's, you guys perceiving it. Uh, it's, it's, it's, it's more scrutinized now. Okay. There's, we had other projects that we've killed that we spent years on. We just weren't so publicly. The world is so exposed and transparent now and everybody cares and everybody's watching. We could've, we could've announced to the high heavens all the things we killed in the first 10 years and nobody would have listened. Um, so

Speaker 2:          46:14          yeah,

Speaker 1:          46:15          also again, if I've learned one thing about human beings for having to study them, so specifically for writing is that we're born to be conspiracy theorists and we hate that we can't make patterns out of things. And we hate that we can't connect the dots. And, uh, we do it without even trying. And I can promise you that there is

Speaker 2:          46:41          okay.

Speaker 1:          46:42          Maybe this is too much to say, but some of my favorite things of Pixar are yet to come. So great. Thanks for reassuring this. Sure. I don't think that's too much to say. I mean it's pretty, I don't want to be cocky. Alright.

Speaker 7:          46:54          So one final question. We got it from the, the livestream actually. Um, it references your, your Ted talk that you did just a few days ago. Oh, okay. They're, they're asking you to explain the difference between making the audience to work for their meal and making them feel what you want them to feel and perhaps tie that into the work you did for John Carter.

Speaker 1:          47:12          Well, it's just story. It's the basics of storytelling it, which is, um, you know, I, I had this, this, this, this theory for a while from toy story on once we, you know, toy story sort of left us with this like, wow, did we do that? And there was a lot of time spent sort of looking back and, and analyzing and

Speaker 3:          47:30          Rican and deconstructing what, what the hell did we do? And uh, and we used to curse that movie all the time. We're like, Damn, we made that movie too good because it made us have to, we had to, you know, still would buzz light year. We had to keep the bar up to that every, and you know, it's actually a blessing, not a curse, but man, does it make your life hard? Yeah. One of the things I remember starting to get a discovery of a four now seeing the behind the scenes of making a movie is I could go back and look at all my favorite movies and with a different eye, a little bit better understanding of why did I like all these other movies so much? And um, and I realized that, um, that you're always problem solving, that you're always in a, in, in good hands being asked to sort of, uh, hold this thought, put that together, wait and see where that's going to go. And it's all very orchestrated and, and um, you were actually working for your meal, but it's done in such an entertaining and engaging way. You don't know it. And that was what I finally concluded was that audiences want to work for the meal. I just don't want to know that they're doing.

Speaker 1:          48:33          Yeah. So along those lines as we're wrapping up, um, but yes, I, I apply that Don Carter apply that on everything that I do. Sorry. That's fine. Uh, so help us cheat on this work, right. Not by giving us a spoiler or anything, but like the chickens, everyone who goes to see John Carter who's seen this now it's gonna look for the chickens. Right, right. And, and I'm, I'm thinking about too, when I saw it, cause I didn't have the pre knowledge of the chickens. I'm like, why? Because it didn't seem different than the standards for guy walks into a bar and gets punched out. Kind of. Yeah. Right. I'm not, that's what happened. But anyway. Um, is there, is there a direction you want them to, to have in mind? Is there something you want them to think about when they're watching the movie? No. My hope is mommy to go hope is seriously because we tried so hard to capture
