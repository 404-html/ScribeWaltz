00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,260
Hello everyone.
Welcome to toxic Google on Kevin Belk.

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,480
And today we welcome Harrison
Ford for blade runner 2049.

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,430
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,330
Can we Google? Thank you very much.
Yeah. Well excited to have you here.

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,520
I'm excited to be here.
Yeah. So, uh, yeah,

6
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:34,280
so you're returning a role a that
you create over 35 years ago. Um,

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,600
it's the world and the characters
obviously changed a bit since 2019. Uh,

8
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,700
but when you were first
called to return to the role,

9
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:43,870
I have to mention me and
you. Yeah. Not Too much.

10
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,660
Plenty. No, no, no, no, no.
But, uh, no, no, no. But it, it,

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,060
so did you work with a,
the director and the writers?

12
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,330
A Hampton Fancher and Michael
Green on developing the character

13
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,670
drove where a decker does now?
Um,

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,300
you know, I worked more with
the Dinny, the director, uh,

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,870
the, um, and, and on the script, but, but,

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,190
but mostly I,

17
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,190
I filtered my input and,

18
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,350
um, concerns through Denny. Um,

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,790
I read the, uh, I read
the novella that, uh,

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,820
Ridley and Hampton French or one of the
original writers developed as a kind of

21
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,650
a exercise prior to the
script writing the script.

22
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,390
And I said, that's a, that would be good.

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,440
That would be good. And then, uh, then
when the script came, then I began to,

24
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,280
uh, work with, uh, with Tony.

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,230
I really wanted to establish my
connection to him. And was that, when,

26
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:59,270
did you have any concerns about
coming back to the character at all?

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,480
Not about coming back to the
character, just about, you know,

28
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:04,480
taking advantage of the opportunity to,

29
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,293
uh,

30
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,320
to get the most out of the potential that
there was in revisiting the character

31
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,580
after so many, so many years.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,820
Yeah. It's, and it's incredibly difficult
to talk about the film, by the way.

33
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:25,610
So you'll see this with the questions
and because there's the plots,

34
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:27,300
basically a spoiler.
So it's,

35
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,340
is that difficult as you go through some
of this talking about the film and in

36
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:35,660
terms of not spoiling stuff?
No, no, you just keep it,

37
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,490
keep it simple.

38
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,850
I, yeah, I don't enjoy talking about

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,300
Marsha.
This should go great then for free.

40
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,000
How much it cost? Just going, oh, no,
no, no. I'm happy to talk, but you know,

41
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,620
I want to save it for the audience.
I want to serve for you guys.

42
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,040
I don't want to tell you what happens.
Why would you, why would you want

43
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,640
to it to read in today's newspaper?
What's going to happen tomorrow?

44
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,710
I mean, why would you go into a movie
if you knew how it was going to end?

45
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,030
Right.

46
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,360
Well, it's, and it's unbelievable. We
were talking off stage, you would call it,

47
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,770
I'd call it fucking epic.
I said,

48
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,800
can you say fuck here? And he said, yes.

49
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,980
I gave Harrison Ford permission to swear
yes, in that, that you need. If not,

50
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,430
then I do. You don't need
it. But there's a great cast,

51
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,640
Jared Leto and Robin Wright and, uh,
Ryan Gosling. So when Ryan Gosling, uh,

52
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:40,220
you know, him becoming a,
stepping into a blade runner role,

53
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:44,030
did you give him any advice on
what should be doing? I can know

54
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,000
and can seek the answer.
Man can play the piano.

55
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,670
He doesn't need any advice from me.
It's been a,

56
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,280
he was a mouseketeer.

57
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,150
Uh, no, I'm serious. He was,

58
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:59,520
he's been in the business as long as I am.

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,513
Uh,

60
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,610
and he's only half my age or less,

61
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,080
I think. Anyway, he's a, he's a
great guy to work with her. I had

62
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,910
the best time working
with them and I'm really

63
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,550
not that it matters,
but I like him.

64
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,020
No. Um, and you know, he, he's
phenomenal. And just the, the use of what,

65
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:31,150
what I found out about the film was the
use of practical effects and building

66
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,870
real sets and that we're laying a lot,
we're like allowing too much on CG,

67
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:36,580
but you've been in both
worlds in terms of,

68
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:39,160
you've worked a lot with
practical effects, but you've
also worked a lot with CG.

69
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,970
Do you like one over the other or do
you see any positives or negatives?

70
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,830
I think there's huge positive in
working in a physical space. Um,

71
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,960
uh, I mean, just sitting
here, I, I, I can,

72
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,890
I'm relating to the, this, you know,

73
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:59,200
the sound of my voice in this space.

74
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,320
I'm relating to the closeness of
the people in the front row. Uh, um,

75
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,940
I can smell something.
Don't,

76
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,113
was that you?

77
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,820
But

78
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,800
it's, it's, it's, it gives me
a sense of reality, uh, that I,

79
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:24,390
that I don't even think about
because it's there. And,

80
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:27,930
uh, so we, you combine
that with, with what the,

81
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,670
the visual information. When
you walk onto a set, you know,

82
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:38,550
it, for instance, there's
a set a scene in, uh,

83
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,350
in the office of the character
played by Jared Leto.

84
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,120
And I think it's no secret
that he's, it's a, it's a,

85
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,260
it's a, uh, a visual
environment that, that, um,

86
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,540
telegraphs power and, and, uh,

87
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,080
great on natural power and,
uh,

88
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,020
so that, that, that's communicated. Uh,

89
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:13,340
and a picture is worth a thousand words.
And so you,

90
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,690
you pick up from that point, you
know, it's not like, but you, you,

91
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,460
you can be a pre armed
with a, you know, a visual,

92
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,990
a CG storyboard that's going
to be supplied later, but

93
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,540
it's not exactly the same. You can't
bounce the sound off, uh, off, uh,

94
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,780
you know, a storyboard. Yeah.
And, uh, it's, no, it's a
great point. And you know,

95
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:41,810
you, you revisited this character of
Deca. And what's actually interesting was,

96
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,640
you know,
watching the original film,

97
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,820
which was super interesting to see how
head of its time it was as well with its

98
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,790
facts and its use of models.

99
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,260
And so I bought its predictions of a
scientific developments and that's why I

100
00:06:57,561 --> 00:07:00,380
was feeling that that's the
part that blows me away.

101
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,160
The capacity that we have now to

102
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,490
create what we call
replicants medically possible,

103
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,590
uh, has, uh,

104
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,850
advanced far beyond
anybody's actual expectation.

105
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:25,880
Yeah. And, and, and you know,

106
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,940
today in this particular
environment where we are facing,

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,600
uh, people that, uh,

108
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,550
suddenly for the sake of
their own convenience,

109
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,680
I've chosen not to believe
in science anymore. Uh,

110
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,930
it's, it's pretty, it's pretty
important that we understand that,

111
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,980
uh, you know, what kind of logic,

112
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,570
reality science is
responsible for and that,

113
00:07:56,571 --> 00:08:01,280
and the sort of moral story of the,

114
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,220
of the, that's that's
part of the, the film

115
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,420
is that it's only, uh, that our capacity,

116
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,920
uh,
to build a human being and then own it.

117
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,880
Because it's your intellectual
property. You know, not, it doesn't,

118
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,510
there's no free will, no free choice, no,

119
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,690
no human opportunity,
uh, no human potential.

120
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:34,280
But, but to have a program,
biological, uh, Lee,

121
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,720
I identical creature,
uh,

122
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,940
to a human being and to own it,

123
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,310
well that's what we used to
call it slavery. Uh, but, uh,

124
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,150
the,

125
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:52,150
it's only the moral constraint of
science that keeps it from happening.

126
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:57,610
I mean, we can, can create life
in a, in a Patriot journey.

127
00:08:57,611 --> 00:09:02,580
We've agreed or petri dish and we
decided not to go much further than that.

128
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,483
Yeah,

129
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:05,700
yeah.
No,

130
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,460
and this actually goes to one of the
questions we took questions from social

131
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:09,510
media and from Googlers.

132
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:13,350
And one of the questions was the original
1918 film predicted a lot technology

133
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,900
that we would have now and 20,

134
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:19,170
49 does some of the same where you
start seeing where technology could be.

135
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:22,650
And we're actually pretty close.
Um, so as life as imitating art,

136
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,220
artificial intelligence, toxic smog,
video calls, what lessons do you think

137
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,090
yeah,

138
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,030
of that world will be informed?

139
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,430
Like inform us on how to not
repeat mistakes or, well,

140
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,960
I mean, we know what not to do. And
so the message is don't do that.

141
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:42,970
Okay.

142
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,520
Can we turn the world into
a shit hole? And, uh, and,

143
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,220
and so don't do that

144
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,770
individually or as a
culture, as a, as, you know,

145
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,920
impose the positive nature of humanity on,

146
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,900
on the world instead of the
negative nature. Protect nature.

147
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,070
Nature doesn't need people.

148
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,060
People need nature to survive.

149
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,643
It's true.

150
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,450
I don't have a segue,
but, um, it was dark.

151
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,560
I'm sorry, but, uh, I know. Um,

152
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,640
but you revisited Deckerd and,
and now,

153
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:29,310
and then I'll Han Solo in Indiana Jones
and I'm sure a lot of people ask you

154
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:31,140
about which carrier you
want to revisit again,

155
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,750
but is there a character that you really
do love that you feel like their story

156
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:34,340
is closed?

157
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,980
You've moved on? Oh, there's
a lot of characters. I mean,

158
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,770
I don't have favorites.
Um,

159
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,400
I'd love the opportunity to,
um,

160
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,630
uh, to tell stories that, uh,

161
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,510
okay

162
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,980
with the audience wants to hear.

163
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,630
I would think it's a public service
occupation to be a storyteller.

164
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,970
We need that. We need those stories
to be told in a variety of different,

165
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,520
uh, styles, you know, uh,

166
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,460
movies,
music,

167
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,990
whatever you just, we, we need,

168
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:22,020
we need stories about ourselves to
inform us and remind us of our common

169
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:26,800
humanity.
Are there any films or,

170
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,410
or stories that you've read or seen
that I've done that for you? Well,

171
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,650
there are films that I've been in
have, well, we do it for me. Yeah.

172
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,680
I just got out of the car listening to
Albert King a song and I spent three

173
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:42,070
minutes.

174
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:46,960
They're making you lose weight because
nobody walks out an Albert King.

175
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,210
Uh, so yeah, but I get it
every day. I get it out of a,

176
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,510
I get out of a nod on the
street. I get it out of, uh,

177
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,930
out of Albert King I, you know. Yeah,

178
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,490
yeah. Was there a role
now? Thank you very much.

179
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,000
What was hope you're getting it back.

180
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,863
It's only fair.

181
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,560
Was there a roller character that you
felt once you found that character that it

182
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,080
can agree you as an actor or even as a
person there would like just Rumi as a

183
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:22,260
carry? Every one, every one
of us, every one of them.

184
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:27,020
Because you don't, well, for first
of all, you explore the life, right?

185
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,760
And the quality of mind of a character.

186
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,830
But you're also working with a
group of people, a new tribe,

187
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,240
every, you know, every movie is a
new bunch of people with new heads,

188
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,530
new, um, um,

189
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,410
it's a, it's just this,
uh, this process is, uh,

190
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,810
is really sustaining and engaging
and challenging and demanding and,

191
00:12:57,201 --> 00:13:02,120
uh, it's, that's the part I really love.
What was there, is there anyone in,

192
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:02,931
this is probably hard for you,

193
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:05,630
but like is there anyone who you haven't
worked with before that you still want

194
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:09,920
to work with in terms of director or
actor or writers? Yeah. Yeah, sure.

195
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,043
Oh,

196
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,770
there was one oh one 10.

197
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,610
Oh Man, I don't know. No, I
just can't go there. I don't,

198
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't know how to go there,
honestly.

199
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,880
Fair.
Albert King,

200
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,070
um, you know, you've
been in this film, it's,

201
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:39,860
it's very physically demanding
and there's a lot of, um,

202
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,760
stunts and physical work that you do
with Ryan and, and water and everything.

203
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,540
Um,
how did you approach again in,

204
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,160
in water is not quite
physically demanding. I had
a shower this morning. Yeah.

205
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,370
And that's what I'm talking, I'm talking
about the shower scene with me. Uh,

206
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:04,030
it was, you know, it's a, yeah,
there's some physical, I like physical

207
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,800
go acting. That's fun. That's
great. I love that kind of stuff,

208
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:13,600
but I, I did, this is not, there's
a, there's a bit, there's enough.

209
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,250
Yeah. But that's not the kind
of movie this is for me. Yeah.

210
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,610
I mean there's, uh,
yeah, there's good stuff.

211
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,000
Good action in it.
Yeah.

212
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,120
Is there, so we talked about kind
of the negatives with blade runner,

213
00:14:27,121 --> 00:14:31,190
but is there any thing with a
technology or a piece of technology, um,

214
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,000
from the original blade runner or this one

215
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,970
like to see, become a reality? Uh,

216
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,160
I, Ryan keeps saying that
he wants a flying car. Um,

217
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,160
uh, but I fly or playing, so I know. Okay.

218
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:49,820
Okay.
You

219
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,000
don't need the flank. No, no.

220
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,413
You know,

221
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,730
I want us,

222
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,490
I want to see that technology
which will help the natural world.

223
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,270
Um,
and I,

224
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I want to see our devoted as devote
our energy to making lives better and,

225
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:15,394
um,

226
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,610
promoting some kind of,

227
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,153
even

228
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,700
opportunity for people that
haven't had their shot yet.

229
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,350
Anything across all fields

230
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,710
against in terms of people have had
their shot, like, and Oh, I just mean,

231
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,150
I mean cultures, uh, that you know,

232
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:47,760
that maybe are going to get gobbled up,
uh,

233
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,040
to be somebody else's
breadbasket or, uh, um,

234
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,240
I'm concerned about, you know, what,

235
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,610
what we have done as,
as,

236
00:15:59,611 --> 00:16:04,420
as one of the highest consuming nations
in the world and what we're asking the

237
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:08,080
rest of the world, uh, to
do, to now to save our asses.

238
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:13,150
Um, and, um, and I, and
I want to, you know,

239
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,260
I want to see the forces
at hand that keep us,

240
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,890
uh, um, from,

241
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,640
from really fully exploiting the
potential of alternative force, uh,

242
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,760
forms of energy,
uh,

243
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,760
because they've got such
a stake in fossil fuels

244
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,850
and that technology,

245
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,340
we better get on with it,
or a word or word

246
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,960
gone
skydiving.

247
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,150
Well, it's scary, but it's
also exciting. I mean,

248
00:16:46,151 --> 00:16:48,760
I'm sitting down here and
I'm looking at all this, uh,

249
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:50,890
okay.

250
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,000
Suppose it brainpower and

251
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,920
an opportunity

252
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,630
and I can see who around here that
it, it's fun to go to work. Uh,

253
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:06,010
and so let's get other
people to get to work and,

254
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:07,244
uh,

255
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,720
yeah, get it done. Um, so a
few questions from a social,

256
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:19,510
um, so social media, which you love
right now, and a Google employees. Um,

257
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,850
but was there a, what was, do you have,
without going too much in the parlors,

258
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,640
was there a, the, what was the
most difficult scene for you?

259
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:28,010
The film we're challenging scene.
Nothing.

260
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,710
I love going to work on it and
I don't have anything difficult.

261
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,330
What was it as enjoyable seeing them?

262
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,980
Um,
oh wow.

263
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,250
It's next question with
the front of it is no,

264
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,520
the front of it is that it's

265
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,210
that in a certain sense you go uh,

266
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,010
armed with what you think is necessary.
Uh,

267
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,150
you identify the bit of story that
you want to create behavior around.

268
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:01,560
Cause every, every scene should
ever have a reason to be there.

269
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,920
You want to make sure you're not doing
the same thing over and over again,

270
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:09,180
sort of that kind of thing. You want to
be available there, but you also, uh,

271
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,740
for me,
I loved the problem solving aspects of it.

272
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,090
All of a sudden the director
wants a shot, you know, for,

273
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:24,270
to motivate the camera and the actor has
the camera's got to follow the actor.

274
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:27,840
What, why would I go out to
the other side of the room?

275
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,360
Little little stuff like
that or the dialogue isn't
really feeling authentic and

276
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:40,640
then w you know, what, what do you
do in, in collaboration with who,

277
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,720
with all of the other people
involved to just solve that problem.

278
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,140
Is there any, did you have any advice? I
guess that's the real fun of it. That's,

279
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,520
that's what, that's what makes
you feel good about the day. Yeah.

280
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,280
And it would,

281
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,940
do you have like a particular director
or someone you worked with were like,

282
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,010
you've got that from them
and you just remember it was,

283
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,810
this is a piece of advice that I will
carry through with all my other fellows.

284
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,790
Um, well I had, I, there was a,

285
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:16,140
there was a guy named Mike
Nichols who a great film director.

286
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,610
He was a half of nickels in May,
great stage director,

287
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,550
one of the smartest guys
I ever met. Um, and funny,

288
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,123
uh,

289
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:35,380
hugely funny guy,
but the occasion of one of my,

290
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,490
some early success,
uh,

291
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,130
or attachment to somebody else's success,
which is really what it's about,

292
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,120
a common success. He said, uh, to me, um,

293
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,810
don't let them turn you into a thing.

294
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,660
No, I don't still don't know
exactly what that means. No, do I,

295
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,990
but, uh, it'll come to you, uh, uh,

296
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,720
after all these years.
Well, I mean, you know,

297
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:14,721
somebody will approach you with something
that is not who you are or what you

298
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:20,050
want to be, uh, but has a utility, uh,

299
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:25,550
to them or a perceived utility to
them and that I'll call that a thing.

300
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,830
Great answer. Um, uh, another
question from social was,

301
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,270
so you were talking a little bit
about scenes and stuff like that. Um,

302
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,780
do you have an array or do you have a
preference between the original cut of

303
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:45,280
blade runner or of the original or
the final cut or the director's cut?

304
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,610
Any of the cuts that you like?
Did you read watch one,

305
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:52,590
I guess going into this dude,
I rewatch one of those. Yeah,

306
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:56,390
I rewatched, um, uh,

307
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
what Ridley called his director's cut or
was his final director's cut or is last

308
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,950
cut or the one after that? I don't, yeah,

309
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:15,310
we have no more money out of money,
which had happened, but it, yeah,

310
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,830
that, uh, I like it.

311
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:21,890
The a or the one without the voiceover
narration and the drive into the sunset.

312
00:21:21,891 --> 00:21:25,430
I liked the one that ends with me picking
up the Unicorn and stepping into the

313
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:29,450
elevator and the doors closing now.
I don't know if that was still out there.

314
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,460
Yeah, no. Yeah, that
was all, I just want to,

315
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:35,600
I'd like to see that one and the new
imax format, but I haven't seen that.

316
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,760
Uh,
that would be,

317
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,390
that would be interesting to see
that what the visual changes.

318
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,090
Yeah. Um, so a few more from social. Um,

319
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,470
what should we expect of Deckerd and
his evolution with the blade runner

320
00:21:51,471 --> 00:21:56,420
universe from the first film
to now 2049 expect nothing.

321
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,670
Spoilers. Spoilers. No. Um, oh,

322
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:05,150
I thought you were talking about does
it? Yeah. I believe you. This character,

323
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,920
let me leave it at that.

324
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,880
Expect nothing but just going go in cold.

325
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,750
Okay.
Um,

326
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,380
what was the first thing that you
thought when you found out what their was

327
00:22:18,381 --> 00:22:21,530
going to be? A blade runner sequel. Well,

328
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,840
Ridley called me and um, so, uh,

329
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,110
would you in theory,

330
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:30,560
would you be interested in
revisiting the character?

331
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,010
And he's quoted as
saying that. I said, hmm.

332
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:37,780
Yeah,

333
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,740
which is bullshit. I said, I
said, yes, yes, I would, uh,

334
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:46,820
if, if, you know, if there's, if
I can figure out how to do it,

335
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,700
if I show me a script,

336
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,930
and that's when I got this a
novella that I talked about earlier.

337
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,070
Um, and how did, uh,

338
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,010
reprising the role of Dechert compared
to a returning as Han Solo or Indiana

339
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:04,840
Jones? It's just two different
things, but that's how they compare.

340
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,780
There we go. Two completely
different things. Okay. That's a,

341
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:12,810
that's an employee a question.
So that's all right. Not Mine.

342
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,590
Do not credit me with that.
Nothing wrong with the question.

343
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,540
Uh, that is the answer. Yeah.

344
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,600
They don't compare. Um, and
I'll, I'll leave it with,

345
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:27,090
if you had to describe
yourself with three words.

346
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,373
Okay.

347
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,880
Almost done.

348
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,503
Okay.

349
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:46,440
There is no fourth way more now. You
weren't forward. No, it's all right. Um,

350
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,620
so thank you so much for
being here. Uh, blade runner,

351
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:53,000
2049 is a out next week on October six.
It is

352
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,353
awesome.

353
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,710
[inaudible].
