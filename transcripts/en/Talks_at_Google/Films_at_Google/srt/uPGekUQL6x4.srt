1
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,630
Thanks for having us say no problem. I'll
do it. Well, I'm going to be doing good.

2
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,550
Doing good.
Good.

3
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:20,440
So you both are twin
brothers from Australia. Yup.

4
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,220
Curious to know how you both that
started in the film making industry. Uh,

5
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,020
we say

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,600
jump the back fence into
the film industry. Uh,

7
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:33,240
we were in design for for quite a while.
We were in motion graphics artists, uh,

8
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,320
dealt with a lot of post production,
visual effects,

9
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:39,910
that kind of thing in the early two
thousands and around the same time as each

10
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:41,980
other around maybe six
months from each other.

11
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:45,520
We both jumped into directing live
action at production companies for

12
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:47,620
advertising commercials,
that kind of thing.

13
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,380
Started to do commercials, music videos,
you know, a lot of live action stuff.

14
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,960
And in about 2007,
uh,

15
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,070
we moved to the states together to New
York knowing that La might end up being

16
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,550
further down the line. And so did a decade
in New York doing mainly advertising,

17
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,800
good spots for Google, but
you know, a bunch of things.

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,280
And it wasn't until about 2014 that we
just felt a little restricted with the

19
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:19,600
shorter form a narrative stuff. 30
seconds, 60 seconds, sometimes 15 seconds.

20
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,470
Yeah. And felt like we wanted to
stretch our legs a little bit.

21
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:28,470
And that's where bag man, this short film
that Ken is based on inspired by, uh,

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,290
came about.

23
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,350
Great. And what kind of work did you
guys do for Google now that you're here?

24
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,693
A number

25
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,441
different things.

26
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:39,340
There was some stuff for the phone
originally and then that got canceled.

27
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:39,690
There's like,

28
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,210
there was a bunch of different
things with a few different agencies.

29
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:44,330
You guys got money so yeah.
You guys

30
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,150
stop and scrap stuff. I'm sure you
were aware of that a little bit.

31
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:50,983
Um,

32
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,930
and as brothers who created number of
short films and just like your first spots

33
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:59,140
together, um, how do you guys merge
your ideas and influences together?

34
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:02,990
I feel like brothers get on
each others tails your look.

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,610
Yeah,
it does for us as well.

36
00:02:04,611 --> 00:02:08,390
I mean a lot of people say I could
never direct with my brother or sister.

37
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,171
And Yeah,

38
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,950
some people like that where the type of
twins that have grown up liking the same

39
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:16,460
stuff, having the same taste.
Yeah. Uh, generally we've,

40
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,190
you were in high school together,
college together.

41
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:21,440
We're in a brief stint in
the army reserves together.

42
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,000
We've done a whole range of stuff. So it
just makes sense that we have the same

43
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,510
taste. Yeah, no, it works. It works well.

44
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,740
I think going into high
stress environments, uh,

45
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,070
this isn't necessarily one of them,
it's a bit casual. Uh, but you know,

46
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:39,640
you're in a board room
with studio executives or
whatever and you're pitching a

47
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:39,971
movie,

48
00:02:39,971 --> 00:02:43,990
you want your bro there to kind of
backyard and it's nice to have someone to

49
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,070
take over and you have a second to
think for a minute. And yeah, no,

50
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:48,904
it works really well.

51
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,130
It's great. And when you guys were
looking at two potential careers,

52
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,010
how did you guys come up with filmmaking?

53
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,620
Did you guys have a moment in your earlier
years that you thought filmmaking is

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,040
the career

55
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,120
for me? Yeah. We've always been
obsessed with movies. I'm sure you know,

56
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,020
millions of people are.
But I guess back in the 90s,

57
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,530
whenever we could get our hands on
a camera, uh, we would, you know,

58
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:14,800
from high school, all that type of stuff.
And we started making our own thing.

59
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,620
You usually we were emulating stuff,

60
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,370
so it was like watching trailers and
they're making our own backyard version of

61
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:25,000
trailers and all that kind of
junk. Uh, early on as well.

62
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,040
We had a fascination with putting visuals
to music and that led quite easily

63
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:32,600
into the music videos.
Totally.

64
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,350
And just like creating emotions
with very simple stories. Um,

65
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,960
a lot of the time with no dialogue,

66
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,380
which bag man became the
lead character in the short,

67
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:46,760
which you can check out online. Um, it
doesn't say a word in the entire film.

68
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,450
Right.

69
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:52,450
And so carrying over that very simple
aesthetic of minimalism and quietness into

70
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,070
a studio feature film was
interesting because you know,

71
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,660
your lead character needs to say to him

72
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,590
and stuff at times. Great.
And speaking of which,

73
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:09,480
tell us a little more about kin, uh, the
trailer we just saw. Yeah. Well look,

74
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:11,430
it's a,
it's the last movie of the summer.

75
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,560
So we're transitioning into movies that
are maybe a little, hopefully smarter,

76
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,300
uh, awards fair, things like that. Um,
I think this movie has a taste of both.

77
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,120
It's,
it's got some big Saifai concepts,

78
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:27,480
stuff in it as you can
see from the trailer. Uh,

79
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,660
but it's not your traditional Scifi.

80
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,690
It's also got a much more of an influence
with character and a story about

81
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:35,670
brothers.

82
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,670
We figured out pretty quickly when we
wanted to turn bag man into a longer form

83
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:44,550
project that, uh, we really
needed to dive deeper.

84
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,570
And so we didn't want to be handcuffed
by the things that were in the short

85
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,810
necessarily.
So we were,

86
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,530
we felt like we were free to change
certain things and adapt and things.

87
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,090
And so we figured out it's about family
and then specifically about a very

88
00:04:57,091 --> 00:05:00,500
unconventional brother unit.
And what does that look like?

89
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:03,580
Like are you only brothers
if, if, if it's blood, uh,

90
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,270
is it circumstance and the things
that you go through trauma,

91
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,300
like what brings brothers together? So
that's really what the movie's about. Um,

92
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,530
essentially this kid finds a giant crazy
alien space rifle and that does not

93
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,310
belong in this movie.

94
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:20,910
But that's the challenge to try to make
it all feel as grounded and realistic as

95
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:21,730
possible.

96
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,730
The other half of that sort of genre tone
with the Scifi is a much more sort of

97
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:31,040
indie spirited, you know,
character drama. Uh,

98
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,060
there is elements of crime stuff in there.

99
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:37,780
There's a coming of age road trip.
It's really multiple things.

100
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:41,860
And what turned us on is just things
that are harder to define. You know,

101
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,920
coming from advertising is very easy to
get put in a box and we early on became

102
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:49,810
the visual effects guys and you've got,
you know,

103
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:54,460
transforming cars and houses and rooms
and in their fun stuff and they generally

104
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,140
have big budgets.
Um,

105
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,710
but at the of the day we have
influences from, you know,

106
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:02,240
more modern,

107
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,810
gritty crime dramas like out
of out of the furnace or,

108
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:09,900
or place beyond the pines or mud or
you know, these more sort of quiet,

109
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:11,840
a sophisticated sort of filmmaking.

110
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,940
And it's the partnership of those two
with Scifi that makes this really unique.

111
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,433
That's great.

112
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,760
I know we saw James Franco in that film
talk a sub and more about the actor and

113
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:24,610
actress selection. How you guys
decided who goes in this film.

114
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Well you basically do a top five list
for every role and there was months of

115
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:34,600
discussion from outside of just who's
right for one thing you definitely don't

116
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:36,970
want to do is write the
screenplay thinking of an actor,

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,640
horrible idea because you'll
always disappoint yourself.

118
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,110
But with this top five lists you
go through and you're like, okay,

119
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:45,160
who are we going to go out to?

120
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,970
And the casting process can be really
frustrating because you've got to go one

121
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:49,421
at a time.

122
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:52,630
We're not auditioning when I bring it
all these giant act as like Dennis Quaid

123
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:55,720
into a room and getting him to do
his lines. It's not the way it works.

124
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,070
So you go out one by one to these people
and you wait for them to say they're

125
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:02,350
available or they're interested
or whatever it may be.

126
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,840
And we were really lucky
to team up with 21 laps.

127
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,470
The guys who made stranger things,
uh,

128
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,870
which wasn't made when
we joined up with them.

129
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:13,270
We just knew of this Netflix
show though doing on the side.

130
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,130
And I said they do really good stuff and
they can easily get on a phone and say,

131
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,280
James, uh, these, these
are really good guys.

132
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:24,640
They've got a great script and now that
they haven't done a movie before, try it.

133
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,600
Trust me, watch this short film
and get back to us. So, uh,

134
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,770
we were really lucky. Zooey was out
number one and we actually got it,

135
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,650
which is kind of incredible.
Uh,

136
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,760
she has this sense of cool that
you can't fake a, and she, yeah,

137
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,020
she's Kinda perfect for the role.

138
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,760
And then James came up, uh, through
Shawn Levy, one of the producers,

139
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,290
and we'd always liked the more sort of
spring breakers side of, of his career.

140
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:54,291
And He loves playing with
darker characters that
have a very sort of in your

141
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:56,940
face.
Charisma makes you uncomfortable.

142
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,420
It makes you not know whether you would
need to laugh or sort of pull back in

143
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:02,830
your seat.
And he plays a character.

144
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:07,831
I A mallet wearing a Cosby sweater wearing
a gun runner in this and he's one of

145
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:12,210
those characters that kind of is pretty
terrifying but also has some very

146
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,760
comedic moments. It's, yeah. Yeah.

147
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,490
Uh, the other, the two brothers,
I mean it's about them. Uh,

148
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,910
the older guys, Jack
Reynor, he's an Irish actor,

149
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,690
has actually quite a dense
Irish accent in, in real life.

150
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,940
He was in a bunch of indie our cinema
movies like, um, glass land with, uh,

151
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,720
Toni Collette,
what Richard did by Lenny Abramson.

152
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,770
He was even in a giant
transformers movie, which, um,

153
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,420
I'm pretty sure he doesn't
want to be in again. Uh,

154
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,080
and so maybe for his house
though. Yeah, probably.

155
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,670
We wanted someone that you might have
seen before and he was in Sing Street,

156
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,080
one of our favorite, he's
a great character in sing
street. Um, thanks Rick Fan.

157
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,010
Yup. Right here in the red. Uh, so we,

158
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,790
we put someone in that lead role that
you might know, but you're not like,

159
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,661
you really know.

160
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:04,380
I think Jake Gyllenhaal and that role
might what might've worked as well because

161
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:07,380
you want to learn who these two brothers
are without kind of being clouded by

162
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,060
something.
And then the lead kid,

163
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,090
we auditioned heavily for this and it
was a very difficult role to find someone

164
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:19,911
who was NCLR and emotionally mature and
someone who could stand up in a room

165
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:24,930
full of adults and feel like they belong
and isn't trying to like sing and dance

166
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:25,800
for you the entire time.

167
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,250
And this is his first
movie. Like we, yeah,

168
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,460
we had nothing to go off
other than an audition tape,

169
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:35,350
a self tape from home on a phone.
And uh,

170
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,060
we just really were impressed with the
fact that he didn't come out trying to

171
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:39,631
impress us.

172
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:43,080
He had the confidence to kind of pull
back and be very subtle with it all.

173
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,340
And yeah, he, he's, he's brilliant.
It's his movie. That's awesome.

174
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,900
And as you guys are working
with these actors and actresses,

175
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,950
how are you guys working
with each other on set?

176
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,750
Well, I think rule number one is we want
to try to not contradict each other.

177
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,850
That's, that's, that's
not rule number one. Yeah.

178
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,730
I mean the last thing you want is to be
sitting at the monitor and you have an

179
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,140
idea and you run up and you tell them
something and then Josh has an idea and

180
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:13,950
run up and says the exact
opposite nightmare material. Um,

181
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,210
but yeah, we, we 50, 50 everything, we
have the same tastes like Josh said.

182
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:23,180
So we trust each other. There's mutual
respect there and, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

183
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,043
That's awesome.

184
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,780
And as we're coming up
kind of on time here, um,

185
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,410
what's next for you guys? What are you
guys thinking about with your next move?

186
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,920
We have a really killer science-based
TV show that we're looking at right now.

187
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:41,250
We're developing with the writer of
arrival. Um, and it's going to be killer.

188
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:43,440
You guys are actually
gonna really like it. Uh,

189
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,770
hopefully that's something that comes
out and a premium channel at some point.

190
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,940
We're pitching it out
at the end of the year,

191
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,490
but then just a couple of
movies and different things. We,

192
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,600
we certainly don't want to, like I said
before, get put, sort of put in a box.

193
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:59,530
We like telling interesting stories
and unique stories. Uh, this,

194
00:10:59,531 --> 00:11:03,190
we're just lucky that this first one
is very personal to us and came from

195
00:11:03,191 --> 00:11:06,690
something that we did as a short
film. So yeah, we're really,

196
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,810
I'm interested just as much to
find out what's next. Um, you,

197
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,830
the movie hasn't come out yet,
so hopefully it changes things up.

198
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,510
It's hard to know.
That's great.

199
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,510
And we want to open it up to
Q and a from the audience.

200
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,120
So if anyone has a question, feel
free to walk up to the mic. Yeah,

201
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,110
we'll tell you what's up, man. What's
your name? Nelson. What's up Nelson? Um,

202
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,850
first of all, I'm really excited
because I love Carrie coon. She's,

203
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,480
she's great man.
I'm also more gray,

204
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:35,970
so I think they did a great question.
Yeah,

205
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,430
I know they've done a soundtrack for
this French show that I really love.

206
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,920
Was it working in sort of the,

207
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,400
the process of working with a band
like Mogwai to sort of say, look,

208
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:47,370
we got Mogwai stories for days
there. They're really, really cool.

209
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:49,080
It's one of our favorite bands.
Um,

210
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,560
we knew at the very beginning that we
wanted to go with a band on this and not a

211
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:57,010
traditional composer just to have a
different life for the music so that it

212
00:11:57,011 --> 00:12:00,640
could come out in an album and have
its own fan base. Let's be honest.

213
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:03,730
It was a selfish endeavor.
Yeah. Hell yeah. You want to
hold a vinyl in your hand?

214
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,390
Definitely. And so we did a playlist
that went for about 13 hours.

215
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:11,140
That was from bag men and
then we transferred over to
the movie and we just kept

216
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:13,360
adding to it and we gave it
to the rider to listen to.

217
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:15,680
So it was just kind of set the tone.
Yup.

218
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,730
And there was a lot of Mogwai
in it and we realized one day,

219
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:21,910
why don't we just ask Mogwai.
So we did.

220
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,420
And they get offered really big
stuff all the time. He said,

221
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,320
and they turn it down like big Hollywood
movies and they'd never done a movie

222
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:30,101
before.
Like you said,

223
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:33,940
they only done a French TV show and a
bunch of docs and where they are on the

224
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:37,150
phone and they say, yeah,
we really emotionally,

225
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,180
emotionally connected to you as screenplay
and we'd love to do your first movie.

226
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:43,630
And we were just like, oh. And we
went on mute and then it was like,

227
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,230
they're cool guys and we've
got to go to Glasgow and,

228
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,700
and sit in with this in
the studio with them.

229
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,680
And in a sense like help produce
one of our favorite McGuire.

230
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:58,330
I'm going to switch like when
does that ever happen? Yeah.

231
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:02,350
Now their locker leasing not only the
soundtrack that the score soundtrack,

232
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:04,510
but they're going to, well they have, uh,

233
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:08,470
taken cues and stretch them out into
full length studio song. So it's,

234
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:11,350
it's a Mogwai I'll cold call again.
It's ridiculous.

235
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,480
And you should pick it up cause
it's a really solid album.

236
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,380
Comes out of the day a, the movie drop.
So August 31st I'm excited to hear that.

237
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:22,270
Um, and then one last question is, uh, so
you were mentioning how this has a more,

238
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:22,601
you know,

239
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:26,890
family centric and I really love that
about these newer Scifi movies like

240
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:29,590
arrivals or midnight special if
you've seen it. Yeah, absolutely.

241
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:34,540
I can loop or even any thoughts of great
references continuing like exploring

242
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,870
that SciFinder you have this TV show
that's hopefully going to come out or are

243
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:41,740
you into other genres that you have?
It definitely man.

244
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:45,160
Like John was saying before,
we don't like being boxed as directors.

245
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:47,200
It's kind of really limiting.
So yeah,

246
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,740
we like all kinds of film and that there's
so many different references in this

247
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:55,741
from like 80 to mud to all the way
upstream district nine to like,

248
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,020
it's moonlight meets
district nine in a weird way.

249
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,320
There's so many different things going
on and that's just purely because we like

250
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:06,680
a lot of different movies and, and,
and why can't they all be in white?

251
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:10,270
Why can't they all sit in the one film
where you telling me you go and see it?

252
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:13,060
And maybe they don't,
but we think they do. Uh,

253
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,770
so when it comes to the stuff that we want
to do in the future, yeah, I think so.

254
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:20,050
[inaudible] is a part of it,
but we're also interested
in, in other things. I mean,

255
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,570
the movie that Damien Chazelle is looking
at right now about, um, the mood killer,

256
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,110
man, we'd love to do something
like that. So who knows? 6,000. No,

257
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,003
appreciate it.

258
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,530
Hi. Hey, how are you? Hi. Origin
Harris. Found Australian Australia.

259
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,260
Okay. Maybe a little bit more.
Maybe more than us. He goes,

260
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:43,530
I've lived here 17 years. So
who knows? Try Sound. Um, no.

261
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,630
First I just want to ask you
and nothing super technical,

262
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:49,610
but I'm really very proud to see
Australians on stage ever. Thank you.

263
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:53,270
They kick ass work. I it, that's the first
thing. And Americans, everybody else.

264
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,580
But we're not talking about them right
now. Between you and I. Well, no,

265
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:00,450
but I'm just very curious about,
you know,

266
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,370
the life that you had in Australia and
obviously you were involved in this kind

267
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:08,320
of stuff or at least burgeoning into
this stuff when you're in Australia. Um,

268
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,270
what kind of different perspective do
you think it does give you coming from

269
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:14,300
Australia and you know,
there's a lot of Australians in la and

270
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,000
sure there is. It was part of the reason
we moved to New York to be honest. Um,

271
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,091
look,

272
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:25,040
we have always felt like we are a little
bit of an outsider coming into the

273
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:29,480
industry and coming through
advertising as well.

274
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,600
We have a different perspective
on certain things, um,

275
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,540
certainly aspects of the film
quite timely as well. Um,

276
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,530
and so yeah, we have it. We have a
unique perspective. I think that's

277
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,140
always helped. What do you think? Um,

278
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,610
in Australia we worked mostly
music, video and advertising. Um,

279
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,290
so we didn't really have a chance to dive
into the Australian film industry per

280
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:58,390
se. I think they're doing some
super respectful staff. Um,

281
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,110
I think it's small and I think it's, um,
there's a ceiling on it in Hawaii. So,

282
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,240
so if you want to tell a really big story,

283
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,080
you've kind of got to bring everything
else down to make it work for the money.

284
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:13,070
And that's disappointing or
limiting. It's limiting. Um, so I,

285
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:17,690
I do think a lot of people get up and
move and obviously London and La are two

286
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:18,680
massive options.

287
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,330
I think there's a shit ton of
talent coming out of Australia and,

288
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,920
and that's why we have a lot of actors
and maybe Americans don't even know half

289
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:31,010
of them are Australian. But like
there's a lot that are doing really,

290
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:33,320
really good stuff. Yeah, I dunno.

291
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:35,270
I don't think we could have
made this movie in Australia,

292
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,370
which is disappointing in some ways.

293
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:41,990
But then the way we've approached it
by putting the two tones together,

294
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:44,800
I think is very Australian.
So I dunno,

295
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,360
I'm actually really interested in how
it goes down there and what the response

296
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:48,380
would be because we're,

297
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,980
we're trying to do some promotion with
over there and hopefully people see it.

298
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,280
Oh Man.
Do it pimp away.

299
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,460
Good luck. Thank you. Appreciate
that. Paris. Thank you. Paris.

300
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,300
Okay.

301
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,100
Hello. Hey, how are good? How
are you? Where's your name?
Susan. Hey, nice to meet you.

302
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,900
Um, from this far away, um,

303
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,250
my question is about the diversity of
the cast and how intentional that may or

304
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:16,550
may not have been and if we can expect
to see more of that in your work.

305
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,470
For sure. I mean, again,

306
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:23,430
sort of stepping into America and
seeing a lot of the conversation that's

307
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:25,120
happening,
uh,

308
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,040
in one way is super encouraging because
things are changing in another way.

309
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,700
It's kind of disappointing that
we're even talking about this.

310
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,910
And so this is just us playing our part.
I mean,

311
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:41,040
it's more interesting to us to have a
story about a young African American lead

312
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,950
that is finding a MacGuffin
from a Scifi movie.

313
00:17:46,951 --> 00:17:50,670
And we just don't see that.
I mean, said that awhile ago,

314
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,420
white kids had been fine in alien
spice space rifles for far too long.

315
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,150
Let's mix it up a little bit. So, yeah,

316
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,550
so,
so it's two things.

317
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,300
The first is it's just more interesting
as a filmmaker because you want to dive

318
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:07,040
into something that feels different and
unique. Uh, and on the other side, um,

319
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,720
you know, we made a short, we lived in
New York and we said it in Harlem and,

320
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:16,250
and we will definitely going to keep
that vibe when we moved over to make the

321
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:19,900
movie. Uh, it's really,
really refreshing and

322
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,470
okay,

323
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:26,210
really delightful to see the reactions
from young black teens when they see this

324
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:28,940
movie to be honest and
representation is super important.

325
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:33,630
And seeing themselves up on the screen
and seeing how this character's arc, uh,

326
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,740
evolves is awesome and we've
had some great responses.

327
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,610
Thank you Beth. Appreciate it.
One more question here. Awesome.

328
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:46,170
Last one. I guess I'm Chris,
what's up Chris? I'm curious about,

329
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:50,150
so I spent a couple of years
of my twenties in attempting
to be a screenwriter.

330
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,330
Uh, and I'm curious that when you guys
were trying to make the leap into first

331
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:58,920
feature film and one of the struggles
that I had as a Scifi writer was how do

332
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:01,650
you, how do you determine like, you
know, the story you want to, right?

333
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,290
How big do you make it based on,
you know,

334
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,300
that budget's going to be hard to come by.

335
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:08,580
Like you want to tell you the right way,

336
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,440
but then the more cool scenes you pack in,
the more dollars start to grow.

337
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,940
He's a really cool question.
Um,

338
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,590
I feel like coming from visual
effects really helped us with that.

339
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,620
We know what things cost and
so we've restrained ourselves.

340
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,070
That's probably the right word,

341
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:31,071
restricted ourselves when we have told
stories for the last 15 years because we

342
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:35,760
know where it gets a little dodgy
because you're like, I don't,

343
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:39,720
I can't afford this and we don't want to
be doing the scene that we can't afford

344
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,100
in a really bad way.

345
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,270
So this movie is a really good example
of that where we do some big things in

346
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,770
this and,
but

347
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,340
all right,

348
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,360
nothing is ridiculous. Nothing gets to
the point where you're like, well, wow,

349
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:55,730
they spent billions of dollars and an

350
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,610
[inaudible] is not one green screen in
this movie. It's all very practical.

351
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,930
Props were made, environments
we created, sets were built.

352
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,880
We're dealing with a young 14 year old
actor that's never been in a movie.

353
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:12,420
We had to make it as realistic as we
could for him. So that was one reason,

354
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,920
but another is just, we've always been
very responsible directors in a weird way.

355
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,140
I don't know if that's
a thing to brag about.

356
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:21,780
It could be a batch coming
from advertising you, you know,

357
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:24,720
like what the budget is and you
know what you can afford, you know,

358
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:26,820
what things cost. So, you know,

359
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:28,710
we just started putting
ourselves out there to fail.

360
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:28,910
Well,

361
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,290
we had a lot of conversations specifically
on this movie about how far do we go?

362
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,213
And,

363
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,520
and I think this is the anti giant movie
in a way because you're getting all of

364
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:44,390
that stuff still, but we're
making you care about it. Um,

365
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,400
we're starting slow and we're,
and we're,

366
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:49,810
and we're introducing to
these characters and the,

367
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:52,810
and it takes a little bit before
the gun comes out and gets fired.

368
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,620
And we're like,

369
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,950
obviously that's part of tightening
the noose intention and all that stuff.

370
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:59,080
Expectation.
But then we're also,

371
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,560
we're never going to that place where
you'll start rolling your eyes and you're

372
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,000
like, all right, that
just got really silly.

373
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,300
And I think that's just done on purpose.
We want it to feel real world.

374
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,810
And the Buzzword is grounded Psi Phi man.
So like keep that shit grounded.

375
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,790
Thanks guys.
Yeah.

376
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,020
Well thank you guys for
coming by our office.

Can't believe we've got an imax release.

381
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,060
Yeah. Just, just lastly though,

382

the Imax and D Tsx One of the best
surround sound audio in the world.

383
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,160
It's crazy that you put out a trailer
and people like the trailer and then

384
00:21:46,161 --> 00:21:49,790
suddenly we've got Imac saying,
we'd love to put you guys on for a week.

385
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,900
And so now we have imax and in dts
x knocked on the door and said,

386
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,610
this looks really cool.
We'd love to give you a full surround,

387
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,860
like the best sound in the world.

388
00:21:57,861 --> 00:22:01,010
So it's one of those amazing things and
you'd make something cool and people

389
00:22:01,011 --> 00:22:02,130
come knocking.
So

390
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,300
