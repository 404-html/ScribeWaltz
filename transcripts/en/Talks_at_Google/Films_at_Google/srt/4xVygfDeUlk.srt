00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,360
Hello everyone. Welcome to toxic Google.
I'm Kevin Valve with the Google team.

2
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:15,510
And here we are in sunny
la at youtube space.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,160
So how awesome is this space going guys?

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,550
So this full productions facility,
we're really,

5
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:24,190
really excited here because we're doing
something brand new that we haven't done

6
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:28,900
them toxic Google before. We're
doing a youtube three 60 degree live.

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,330
So we're live right now across the world.

8
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:34,360
And these two cameras that
you see here are 360 degrees.

9
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:35,800
So for you guys watching online,

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,750
you probably have a great
shot in my pelvic area.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,070
And so what we're going to be doing
here today is interviewing the cast to

12
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:44,080
finding dory. So we're gonna bring
him up here in just a second.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,930
So if you guys watching online,
if you're watching on your mobile device,

14
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:51,220
just take your phone,
just look around and complete 360 degrees.

15
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,780
Then we got some fun
stuff here in the back.

16
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:55,420
You can look around the production
facility, um, and then four,

17
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:59,890
if you're on desktop, just take your
mouse, click the video, move it around,

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,100
and that's it. So. All right,
we're going to meet the cast.

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,310
It's bring him out,
ladies and gentlemen,

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,560
the cast, the voice cast and creative
team behind Disney. Pixar is finding dory.

21
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,190
Ready? Welcome guys. Thanks
so much for coming here.

22
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,150
Um, so, uh, finding dory out June 17.

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,980
Thank you guys all for being
here. Uh, Ellen, welcome. Uh, so,

24
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,311
uh,

25
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:58,311
this is a movie completely about your
character Dory and you've been characters,

26
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,570
right? Uh, thank you. Uh, and uh,

27
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,040
but so York, yeah, go ahead. Out.

28
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,743
I'm dory.

29
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,140
Okay.

30
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,670
And so, but you were huge cheerleader
for this film for years on your,

31
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,743
uh,
on your show.

32
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,310
Thank God I had a show. We would not be
sitting here had I not had a talk show. So

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,350
talk about

34
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,710
to intimidation. Yeah. He finally called
and said, uncle, he's like a, all right,

35
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:33,730
we'll do it. Let's do it. It was this, you
said, I was just kidding. I was like, no,

36
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:38,240
I'm not interested. No, it
was a, it was started. Is,

37
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,820
is I seriously wanted a sequel.
I was like,

38
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,190
they make SQLs for every
other successful film.

39
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:47,000
We won an academy award for crying
out loud. So where's the SQL?

40
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,780
And then it just got to be a joke and
then I just gave up and I was just, well,

41
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:54,110
I'm just going to keep going because it's
funny. But uh, and then it worked out

42
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,400
and then 13 years later, so Andrea,
you brought this back 13 years later.

43
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:58,960
So when did that idea,

44
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,220
I want to push it again when you make
these movies that you see them so many

45
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:07,300
times. So I'd seen finding Nemo about a
hundred times before 2003 even finished.

46
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,080
So he just stop watching.
And about eight years later,

47
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:14,800
it was 2011 they wanted to put it out in
three d they put me in a theater and I

48
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,560
watched it like an audience member
for the first time in a long time.

49
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,340
And I walked out so worried about dory.
I was just like,

50
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,900
she's going to forget Marla Nimo.

51
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,990
She won't know how to get back
and I don't know where she's from.

52
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:29,290
And I think that yes, she's
got abandonment issues that
I know about as a writer.

53
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,980
So it like suddenly it was just all, it
just all started to bubble up after that.

54
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,650
It's, it's unbelievable. And it's, it's
wonderful thing. I've seen it. It's, it's

55
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,160
otherwise, as long as you're here,
you make the third one before we die.

56
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,160
Oh, okay. Oh well I want,

57
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,410
I want to get to you actually about your
character to Marlin Marlin's back. Um,

58
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:53,500
and we have the new voice of Nimmo
birthday up there. Hayden. Hey,

59
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,373
say hello to everyone.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,770
Hayden Hayden's

61
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,420
actually 30
plays a really good nine year old,

62
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,670
like you guys didn't know yet.
And so l a Alberta,

63
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:10,470
your character Marlin is back obviously.

64
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,870
And it's interesting cause it was really,

65
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:16,260
really great to see you now have a
completely different dynamic with your son

66
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:17,040
Nemo.

67
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,360
And now Marlon is much more particular
dory who wants to go find your family.

68
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,360
So can you talk a little bit about
where Merryn is at the stage and,

69
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,640
well,
I know he doesn't agree,

70
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,190
but I thought that Marlin
was in love with Dory. Okay.

71
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,250
I mean it, I just figured that, you know,
whatever makes the seats were heard.

72
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,850
Marlin's lonely and, and, uh,

73
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,800
you hadn't found anyone else and
she's lovely and you know, why not?

74
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,030
But, uh, I think we have the next
seat and say there's your third.

75
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,250
Um, but you know, it was
great. I Hayden's terrific.

76
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,130
Alexandra Gould who played the first one,
he's 42.

77
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,930
I actually was in weeds
with him after he was Nima.

78
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:10,320
Roy played his grandfather in weeds,
so that was sort of interesting.

79
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,950
Talking about pot with Nemo,

80
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,863
you know,

81
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,930
but a Hayden's wonderful and you
know, like a modern, divorced family.

82
00:05:18,931 --> 00:05:19,764
Here's the new kid.

83
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,070
There we go. It's gone.
Great. Uh, so ty and Katelyn,

84
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:29,400
you guys play new characters in
the film. So we have, uh, Bailey,

85
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:32,120
which is your character
tigh and then designate.

86
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:33,510
So tell us about your characters.

87
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,510
Um, we're buddies. Yeah. Uh,

88
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,490
basically, uh, Bailey and destiny are, uh,

89
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,780
two people that Dorian lists
to help her find her folks.

90
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,423
People.

91
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,740
There are two people dressed in
whale and whale shark costumes.

92
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,130
It's like an abstract kind of a thing

93
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,280
we were doing. Did you dress in wheel
costumes when you recorded this?

94
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,560
Didn't need to do for the only
line moving. It was exhausting.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,360
It has been so hot. It's really hot. Yeah.

96
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,750
You're Bailey's a big Beluga whale and
a destiny is a giant whale shark and

97
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,080
they're kind of a brother,

98
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:20,060
sister relationship and they
get on each other's nerves,

99
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:24,350
but they're very sweet and they ended
up, uh, trying to help dory out.

100
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,651
Great.

101
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,410
And we have an exclusive clip we're going
to play here in just a few minutes, uh,

102
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,590
with your two characters. So what,
bring that up here in a little bit. Um,

103
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,280
but Ellen, so you know, you're returning
to the character of Dory. It's a really,

104
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:38,860
really emotional story about her trying
to find her parents. So, um, you know,

105
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,960
when you first read the script,

106
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:43,020
was there anything that you were able
to bring to the scripts or tell Andrew,

107
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:45,450
I'm looking for this and the character,
I want to go this direction?

108
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,890
Um, no, I, I mean, this
guy is a genius. This, I,

109
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:53,690
I'm not going to tell him how
to write a script. Um, I mean,

110
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:56,210
when I was in the room I
changed a lot. But I, yeah,

111
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,800
no,

112
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,410
but you know, that's what's great
about it. The script is fantastic.

113
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:05,090
The script is what it is, but it's,
it's open and free enough that you do,

114
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,040
you know,
50 takes and,

115
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,700
and you can then he did you just do
whatever you want to do and he chooses,

116
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:14,390
they choose whatever it
turns out to be the best one.

117
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,920
So it's always the first.

118
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,920
But you know, it's four years writing
this thing. I mean, so we're doing,

119
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,250
but there was over 10 drafts of
this story done over that time.

120
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:27,400
And they know that what we're working
with them and you also adapt to the actors

121
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:29,620
once their cast. So
you're, you're, you know,

122
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:33,010
I'm learning just as much from them
and we're rewriting to play to their

123
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:37,060
strengths so that it's like hopefully
comfortable shoes almost. And they, and,

124
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:41,230
and you just, it becomes a little
symbiotic at a point. And Eugene,

125
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:45,850
you play Charlie. Yes, that's
correct. Other of Dory. Yeah.

126
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,150
So what can you tell us
about Charlie and oh,

127
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,070
well it was a,
it was exciting to play a,

128
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,780
a dad who has a child not
doing strange things with pies.

129
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,013
Uh,

130
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,970
that was a big plus.

131
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:05,380
Okay.

132
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,840
That was me.
That was like your first question in the

133
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,640
yeah,
write that out.

134
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,590
Does dory eat baked goods?
No.

135
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,710
Uh,

136
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,490
no. It was kind of a, it was a
very charming, well, I was just,

137
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:23,820
I was honored to be included in this
thing and no question about that.

138
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,830
And playing a dad, uh, you know,
uh, have a child who is, you know,

139
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:33,800
kind of memory impaired so to speak.
So there, you know, there it's a,

140
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:38,280
it's kind of a very funny,
very amusing and,

141
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,480
and there's something very heartfelt
about playing, um, you know, a dad,

142
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,400
um, where, whose child is off somewhere.

143
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,610
You don't know what happened and you know,

144
00:08:50,611 --> 00:08:53,340
will they ever be able to,
you know,

145
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,610
how will they function
because she has no memory,

146
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,890
a short term memory.
So, you know, um, it's,

147
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:05,700
uh, it was interesting and
complicated and fun and exciting.

148
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,190
I mean,
that's a real powerful part.

149
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:10,650
Two and hit it and I'll get right
back to you. But Andrew and Lindsey,

150
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,070
when you're creating this story about you,
you,

151
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,410
it's very much of a comedic effect in,
um,

152
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,230
in finding nemo where you have Doris
character with short term memory loss,

153
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,070
but it's a real disability in,
in life and you really,

154
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:25,650
really hit it home in this
film. So was that, I mean,

155
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,210
cause she's really struggling with it.

156
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:29,040
You see in the beginning of
the film you see it throughout.

157
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,740
So was that a point that you really
wanted to drive home and yeah.

158
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,520
Well she's the main character.
Once you have a main character,

159
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,550
it has to be more depth to them and they,

160
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:38,940
and you sadly are sort of forced into a
bit of a straight man role when you were

161
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:42,320
in the main character will the thing
that it was always great about Doerries

162
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:45,360
that I always knew that tragic
side of her, that was always, uh,

163
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,950
I always knew her optimism
and her caregiving and her
candy spirit with somewhat

164
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:54,240
her armor to protect herself
from the sense of loss she had.

165
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,400
So it was just sort of
flipping that on this film.

166
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,730
It was, it was great too, because
I remember the day that you, uh,

167
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:04,450
there was this the scene where I had to
explain what short term memory loss was

168
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,650
and how to explain it.

169
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:10,120
And that was one of the Times that
I could just go and talk about what,

170
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:12,960
what to,
how to explain it to someone was hurt.

171
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,140
I mean, it was funny and
heartbreaking at the same time.

172
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:19,410
And I think that's kind of what the
movie really leans into on this one that

173
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:23,250
it's like it's charming and, and that
is dory and we kind of, you know,

174
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:27,540
we were always trying to walk that line
between the charm that was dory and that

175
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,760
is Ellen. And then also the, you know,

176
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:34,230
the kind of tragedy really of it and,
and making sure that we never lean too,

177
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,790
too far one way or the other,

178
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,280
so that we felt like it was being
really true to this character.

179
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,000
No, it was a delicate balance. I mean,
that's what it was like in the beginning.

180
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,770
The movie, you first, your
initial reaction is to laugh.
It's like, oh, that story.

181
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,800
And then it starts getting deeper and
you're like, Oh God, I don't like, it's,

182
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,540
it's really, really intense. So, uh,
Hayden, the new voice and Nimo, um,

183
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,200
pretty exciting from my
hometown of Chicago. So
welcome here to California. Um,

184
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,900
so what's it like to be an email?

185
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,400
Um, uh, it's very fun being
able to pretend that I'm
just a cute little fishing.

186
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:07,480
I'm not, yes. And I'm not just me.

187
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:12,481
I actually get to pretend that I'm
something that's a very good idea and very

188
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:13,804
fun to do.

189
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,530
Yeah, no, it's your were wonderful
in it. It's crazy. Cause I was,

190
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,840
when I was watching it and I actually
didn't realize the first one,

191
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:21,190
the trailers that they got a new voice,
I was like,

192
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,040
well of course it is
13 years later and you,

193
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,930
you pull your sounded exactly like
them. It's it, it's great. Yeah.

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,130
He's like the Darren of bewitched,
you know,

195
00:11:28,131 --> 00:11:32,990
like he had to show your folks watch
original Darren and it's really tough.

196
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,290
And so a lot of this takes place in,

197
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,460
which is a great thing because
you can finding an email,

198
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,680
you'll see the characters going through
open water and oceans and everything,

199
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:43,431
and you have different apartments.

200
00:11:43,431 --> 00:11:48,200
But now you're in a marine institute and
it's so for you, you, Lindsey and Andrew,

201
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:49,040
when you guys were there,

202
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,160
there's a lot of creative ways of how
the characters get around the park.

203
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,480
But what one of the most complicated
scenes as a producer, Lindsay,

204
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,270
you're just like,
really?

205
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,010
Honestly that was the,
it was when Andrew came and was like,

206
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:06,690
so we've come up with this new
character and he's an octopus.

207
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,630
And I said, I'm sorry, what? And he said,
he's an octopus boy. He's a step to posts.

208
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:14,670
So you get one less technical.
He is a Hank the octopus,

209
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,220
no doubt is the hardest character.

210
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:21,570
I think anybody at Pixar has ever
done and took two years. I mean,

211
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:24,330
normally our characters take kind
of nine months start to finish.

212
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,300
And this took two and a, he took two and
a half years just to build and rig. Um,

213
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,900
and so that was one where I was like,
really? Does it have to be an octopus?

214
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:37,090
Could you maybe not? Maybe turtle? No,

215
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,650
already have that now the front plastic,

216
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,720
the first shot took six
months to anime and we're,

217
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,390
we're never going to get
finished at this rate.

218
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,640
But fortunately ready got
smarter and faster. Gotcha.

219
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,750
And what environments where some the most
complicated ones cause you see them in

220
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:51,440
pipes and

221
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,860
it's, it's actually, if
you watch finding Nemo,

222
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,410
you'll notice that there was
like only three shots I think,

223
00:12:57,411 --> 00:13:01,760
where we allowed Andrew to put the
camera in the corner of the tank of the

224
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:02,421
dentist office.

225
00:13:02,421 --> 00:13:06,170
And it's because of the reflection
refraction talking to people at Google and

226
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:10,210
youtube. So I feel like I'm in a
people, you understand me? Um, so it's,

227
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,820
and it's really hard. I mean, we,

228
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,290
we intentionally didn't do that because
the computer couldn't do it and we had

229
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,360
to direct it and fake it,
all the lighting.

230
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:21,380
And so the new renderer are actually
allowed us to do much, much more.

231
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,290
And we took do it everywhere.
We basically, he did it
everywhere. I'm like blue.

232
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,720
Yeah, every possible container has
glass and reflection in itself.

233
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,570
Gotcha. Um, and so, you
know, are there any,

234
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:37,950
you know what Andrew I loved was,
you know, I remember watching,

235
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:42,150
I'm a huge Pixar fan animation fan and
I love watching in the first one some of

236
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:45,470
the making of it and you
kind of tacked onto this, um,

237
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,960
flashback thing and the first finding
email where you want to do flashbacks and

238
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,310
kind of tell the story through that.

239
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,100
And it's a great plot device that you
used here throughout the movie as well to

240
00:13:53,101 --> 00:13:54,790
kind of tell Doris story.
Um,

241
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,990
was that something you immediately
knew that you wanted to do?

242
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,570
That is an 11th hour idea that
saved our butts on this movie.

243
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:02,310
We came up with it last fall,

244
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,550
but a lot of people don't know Nima
didn't come together until the last six or

245
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:08,190
eight months. Um, like all the pieces
where there we just didn't happen.

246
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,300
It didn't have them lined.
Right.

247
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,960
And so I feel like this movie is in good
hands in a weird way because it did the

248
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:16,140
same pattern. Um, but
yeah, the first movie,

249
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,860
all that tragedy you see at
the beginning of finding Nemo,

250
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:21,990
all that loss was actually
flashbacks that were doled out.

251
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:23,970
And it just didn't work.
You didn't sympathize with Marlin.

252
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:25,710
But once we saw his tragedy at the front,

253
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:27,360
we moved it all the friends and something,

254
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:31,350
all the lines we'd always had played fine.
Everybody empathized with them.

255
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,490
Um, and then this was the reverse. We
have too much information at the front.

256
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,420
And then when we doled it out and made
it memories that Dory or she has and is

257
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,810
triggered, she goes, it became like
the inverse of the first movie in it.

258
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,850
And it just felt right.
And it was Jason Bourne.

259
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,550
You can take that into your own life.

260
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,790
Start every conversation
with your saddest.

261
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:52,963
It works.

262
00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:00,020
And so now we're going to Q, a, uh,
exclusive clip here from finding dory.

263
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:00,920
So let's clear it up.

264
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,810
Can you please keep it down over there?

265
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,520
My head hurts that my neighbor,
he was brought in with a head injury.

266
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,413
I know you're talking about me.

267
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:16,550
Destinee uses echolocation but I've
overheard the doctor's time writing every

268
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:19,610
word you're saying about me.
What's echolocation? Well,

269
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:23,540
Bailey's head is supposed to put out a
call and the echo helps him find objects

270
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,070
far away.
I'll put,

271
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:29,780
apparently he's still healing now.
I know you're talking about me.

272
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,930
I really can't echo like I
have this conversation again.

273
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,220
I get my head very hard out there and
see how it's falling in his head is

274
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:39,590
supposed to be big. You're a Beluga. Yeah.

275
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,123
Yeah.

276
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,330
So ty and Katelyn, those are your guys'
characters. Uh, Bailey and destiny.

277
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,770
Did you guys record it altogether to get
some of the dynamic and Improv and we

278
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,700
did.
That was,

279
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,240
that was fun. We got to do two
or three together is, you know,

280
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:04,600
mostly you just in there by yourself
with these guys. Right. Again,

281
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,920
um,

282
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,030
but we got to do a couple together and
it was really fun because we're actors.

283
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:11,010
We're used to working with
these spies by the way,

284
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,940
are amazing and they're too
smart for us though. It's much.

285
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,410
I'm always looked on people. Yeah.
Yeah. She was looking for an idiot.

286
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,630
That's your phone one. That's
right. It makes me more comfortable.

287
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:23,900
It makes me feel smarter.
Um, yeah, that was actually,

288
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,930
that was new for me. I, I, I
haven't done a ton of animation,

289
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:32,070
but the chances to go in and
be in the room with, well,

290
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,430
Katelyn in particular who was so funny,
um,

291
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,700
it's all, you know, the whole
process is so collaborative.

292
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,680
Um, obviously we're not really
tinkering with any of the major writing,

293
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:46,670
but these guys were just so smart and
so much changes as you're doing it.

294
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,280
Um, the, when we were
able to do it together

295
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:54,150
really felt the freedom to play
around a little bit and see what else.

296
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,563
Yeah,

297
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,980
that's great. So we're
going to bring up our, uh,

298
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:02,000
one of our youtube top creators smoothing
to ask him questions that he got from

299
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:05,060
our social media, a social media
handles. So let's bring him up.

300
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,570
Hi, check, check. How's
it going guys? All right.

301
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,580
So we asked a lot of our
youtube subscribers and the
youtube people's out there

302
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:20,000
some questions and a lot of
them were coming toward you,

303
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,073
Andrew.

304
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,230
They want to know how
you go about selecting

305
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,370
voices for your movies.
Oh, well, you know,

306
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:31,820
everybody knows the term that the camera
loves them. They're very photogenic.

307
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,940
But I like to say there's a term
with a microphone. Loves them.

308
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:39,410
There are people that just have voices
that you can just hang a character on and

309
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,590
sitting in front of you. Or five
amazing example. Six, I'm sorry,

310
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,250
I can't count today. Six examples
was either the one you weren't yeah,

311
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,770
yeah, I wasn't thinking year. My
girlfriend is not loving. Sorry.

312
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,380
There's five people in front of, you
know, four, no, wait a minute. Say

313
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,300
One guy who just tries super hard,

314
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,120
a hard working guy, but it's true.
Like when you want it. Like I,

315
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,300
I was started out as an animator,

316
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:09,470
so I really recognize like when
you hear a voice that you just,

317
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,050
you can't help a project, a
character on, you can't help it.

318
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:15,860
Like want to see a acting
from out of, out of, out of,

319
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,000
out of a different
character. It, it's a it.

320
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:23,210
And so you end up with these
lists sometimes. Um, uh,

321
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:27,530
Ellen herself as somebody
I wasn't thinking of at the
time when I was really an

322
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:30,410
early days of riding on finding Nemo and
then I heard her off of the television

323
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:34,790
set and boom, you know, it, it's suddenly
matched. I'd been a fan of Albert's,

324
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,180
you know,

325
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,020
ever since I can remember watching going
to all of his movies and listening to

326
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:42,500
his comedy albums and sorry, just waiting
for the right role to fall for that.

327
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,270
And then Katelyn,
same thing.

328
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:48,410
I'd sort of been a fan of her voice
and tie and a hate and I discovered,

329
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:51,830
and Eugene of all these are people that
I've just been fans of hearing and I

330
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,110
just go, they would be perfect, but
you're just waiting for the right.

331
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,320
Okay.

332
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,440
Character that you're coming up with and
hope that somebody else hasn't grabbed

333
00:18:58,441 --> 00:18:59,274
them before you do.

334
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,060
Okay.

335
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,560
What's the other thing too,
on Youtube?

336
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,690
A lot of us are one man production
teams and a lot of us do animations.

337
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:07,950
So there's a lot of people are
wondering how do we start off?

338
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:12,030
Anybody that wants to be involved with
animation, the process, just out the gate.

339
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:15,030
What would you recommend as far as
programs for anybody starting out? God,

340
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:17,850
I don't know. I mean I'm too
old now. I don't, I don't know.

341
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:20,700
I started out with Pencil and paper.
I still use pencil and paper.

342
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,930
I don't know if anybody
knows what that is.

343
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:24,980
But all of the school like
stone age stuff. Yeah.

344
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,770
All I can say is it's so easy. I mean,
now you can make a movie in your house.

345
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:32,100
Like, like I get to steal stuff
like when I did it, you know,

346
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:34,950
to like get them to get movies
made and my backyard stuff.

347
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,580
But so I'd just say like do it.
Do you grab whatever you can and do it.

348
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:42,240
Like there's nothing stopping
you. So just do it. Oh,

349
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:46,620
this is for the cast of all the new
characters. Excluding yourselves.

350
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,480
Who's your favorite
character in finding dory?

351
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,140
I'm a Hank fan is rude
and you can't choose.

352
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:04,440
You can't choose yourself to that
question. Can we move on to Shrek?

353
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,500
Yeah, that'd be good. I'm studio. Uh, I
mean this one was popping up a lot. Uh,

354
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,980
we can go on to, all right. What
about other animated Disney films,

355
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:15,210
if you could be,

356
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,330
and any of those other
animated Disney films,

357
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:18,600
or what movie would you want to be in?

358
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,150
I,

359
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,950
I'm a huge fan of all the Pixar movies
and particularly all of Andrew's movies.

360
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,240
I was a huge fan of Wally and all
the toys, stories, those are just,

361
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:32,080
I watched those before I had kids and
then I, my little boys love those movies.

362
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:35,790
So those are the ones that are always on.
And so when I got the call about this,

363
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,670
I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I
don't care what I'm playing, but yes,

364
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,600
whenever I'd like to get the candles
sticker go and beauty and the beast.

365
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,603
Nice.

366
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,230
Broadway Virgin. No, not matinees. What,

367
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,320
what about you hate in any
other movie, Aladdin, Lion King,

368
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:55,380
any of those that you'd want to be in?

369
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,520
Um, I don't really know if I'd want to
be in any other movie besides this one.

370
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,640
Yeah,
you're checking

371
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,080
Buenas Ellen,
what about you?

372
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,990
Uh, same answer. I would never,

373
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,700
this is the one I thought dory
was great in finding email.

374
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,650
I'm
joy

375
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,110
site out would have been
fun. I like joy that, uh,

376
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,120
I mean I'm very happy being dory.

377
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:28,620
Eugene. Anybody? No, I, I,

378
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,630
you know,
the thing of it is really these pictures,

379
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:37,370
all the pictures are animations
are so incredibly great that,

380
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,810
and the process is so much fun to do.
I mean,

381
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:45,590
I don't know if anybody really understands
exactly what you do when you're in a

382
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:50,090
studio, but it's really quite amazing.
And when you get to work with,

383
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,670
you know,
incredible,

384
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,280
incredibly talented
like genius people here,

385
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,940
uh, where are you kind of
just give a line and they,

386
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:05,900
as you're giving the line and
the in the, in the, in the scene,

387
00:22:05,901 --> 00:22:09,200
they kind of know they're making changes
as they're going, try it this way,

388
00:22:09,201 --> 00:22:12,620
try it this way. And it's all happening
in milliseconds and it's just like,

389
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:17,540
it's an incredibly exciting way to work
because I got to act with Diane Keaton.

390
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:22,490
So that's probably why he's on a high.
I know my wife isn't here today.

391
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,090
Um, yeah, so that was a, that was good.
That was kind of a fun too. But yeah,

392
00:22:29,091 --> 00:22:30,770
I I, you know, I would say it's just,

393
00:22:30,771 --> 00:22:35,210
it's a really fun way to
work doing animated films
and when the scripts and the

394
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:40,010
stories or as as exciting
as a finding dory,

395
00:22:40,011 --> 00:22:44,150
then you know, you're, you consider
yourself very lucky. Okay, awesome.

396
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:47,690
That's all the time I have for you guys.
Uh, we have some crowd questions later,

397
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,860
but I'm going to toss it back here. Thanks
so much for your time guys. Thank you.

398
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,740
Nice teachers.

399
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,380
Thank you Suzy. So we're going
to take some audience questions.

400
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:04,120
I think they're going to start
lining up here. Um, here we go.

401
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,843
Yeah.

402
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,640
Hey, you hear me? Yeah, I kind of
want to ask a question of everyone,

403
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,350
but I'm going to focus on dory, so
don't be offended. It's all good.

404
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:16,600
You're all cool.
So my question to you is in finding dory,

405
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,630
when are the mantras for me was just
keep swimming, which is, I'm a plus size,

406
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:22,800
health and fitness motivators.

407
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,950
I help women like me starting
to engage with fitness.

408
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,750
So to me it's about the journey,
bracing the journey.

409
00:23:27,751 --> 00:23:30,480
Just keep moving no matter what happens.
Just keep going.

410
00:23:30,481 --> 00:23:32,700
Well loving who you are
in the body you're in.

411
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,010
So what I'd be curious to know is what
is your life lesson coming out of finding

412
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:38,371
dory?

413
00:23:38,371 --> 00:23:42,690
Did you have that moment that just keeps
swimming moments that really stood out

414
00:23:42,691 --> 00:23:47,690
to you? Um, well, my life is, that's my
motto as well. That's my motto, I think.

415
00:23:47,691 --> 00:23:51,350
Okay. It's yours and I'm now
we'll share. So sorry to know,

416
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,240
steal it from you second law
suit. Oh, I'm aggressive.

417
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,000
Um, well it was, it was kind of like

418
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,810
my motto.
It wasn't completely my motto.

419
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,350
Okay.
Um,

420
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,470
because I think if anyone knows my story,
it is, I had to just keep swimming. I,

421
00:24:11,471 --> 00:24:12,070
you know,

422
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,780
my life has been a lot of challenges and
a lot of the different curves and uh,

423
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,920
and uh, roadblocks. And so I
think that's a great, you know,

424
00:24:20,921 --> 00:24:22,900
I didn't come up with
Jessica keep swimming,

425
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:27,930
but it has turned out to be something
that a lot of people can hold onto and use

426
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:32,320
in their life. And so I would say
that just everything I think is, I'm,

427
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:37,180
I am so blessed and lucky that that's
part of my character that I get to say

428
00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:40,660
just keeps, keeps swimming for whoever
you are and whatever you're going through.

429
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,910
Well, thank you for that cause it's a big
life changer. So thank you. Thank you.

430
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,163
Thank you.

431
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,880
Ready next.
Awesome.

432
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,113
Hello.

433
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,590
I just wanted to know what your favorite
aspect of working on this film has been,

434
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:04,730
whether it's recording, fleshing out
the story, promoting it, et Cetera,

435
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,820
of anyone you've had the big you've
had probably the most to from. Yeah.

436
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,910
Uh,
it's honestly,

437
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:17,840
working with the actors is probably my
favorite simply because they're sitting

438
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:20,600
in front of me. Um, no, it's,

439
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:24,760
it's actually because it's the one part
of this process over four years that's

440
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:28,550
spontaneous where you're actually doing
a lot of give and take in the moment and

441
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:33,290
you're kind of, you're in the now
and you're just reacting. And, uh,

442
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,150
I find that so exciting. I get very little
of it waking in an animated pictures,

443
00:25:37,151 --> 00:25:40,250
so I'm pretty hungry for it when we do
these sessions. I know they're grueling,

444
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:40,641
they're long,

445
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:44,150
these guys stand around for four hours
and they're just on the whole time.

446
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:46,160
So they're basically
doing a one person show.

447
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,750
And a lot of them I know I've said
that it's the most tiring thing they do

448
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,850
simply because there's no breaks
built into it. And, um, but um,

449
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,920
it's, it's pretty invigorating.
It's pretty exciting

450
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,803
to me.

451
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,950
Hello, I'm Christina cal from
the channel back girls ball. Um,

452
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,180
this question is for everyone. A lot of
people in the audience, including myself,

453
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:15,160
are content creators here at Youtube.

454
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:19,540
And I just would like to ask you all
what advice you'd like to give us with

455
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:21,040
building our careers.

456
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,760
Get Super Lucky.

457
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,250
Okay.

458
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,590
It's weirdly lucky.
Oh,

459
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,170
that's a horrible advice.
Horrible advice.

460
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,620
Well,

461
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:39,620
someone asked a question earlier about
to Andrew about how do you animate

462
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:44,030
something and you know,
I would say the answer

463
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,920
is the same and match a story.

464
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,930
You start with that, you start,
you're a content creator,

465
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,550
so you don't start with the actors.
You don't start with the [inaudible],

466
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,630
you start with a story,
you start with the content.

467
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,540
And if you have a great story,

468
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:08,790
it can fit a hundred different
ways to tell it animation,

469
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,800
it can fit live action. So you
know, think of great stories,

470
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,950
just stories that you haven't heard.

471
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,920
I would say that's a basis to start with.

472
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,600
I would say authenticity.
I think whatever.

473
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,340
I think when you,

474
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,830
if something's happened to you in
the same thing that Albert's saying,

475
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:32,850
if you have a story, you're probably
not the only person with that story.

476
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:33,631
Whatever it is.

477
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:37,920
And sometimes the best stuff comes out
of the hardest stuff and the worst stuff

478
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:41,220
that you've gone through. So if
you've actually experienced something,

479
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,090
I don't think anybody should
hide any kind of truth.

480
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,950
So whatever you have witnessed
or experienced or gone through,

481
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,580
find a way to express that
and find a way to stay.

482
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:57,660
And I think people read truth and
authenticity and I think that's the most

483
00:27:57,661 --> 00:27:59,940
important thing for establishing anything.

484
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,970
And even if you don't have something,
you must have a horrible uncle.

485
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,960
Thank you very much.

486
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,363
Okay.

487
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,380
Hello.
Um,

488
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:20,670
so I know a lot of you have experienced
with Improv and just being quick on your

489
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:25,720
feet and I was wondering how much
room there was for improvisation.

490
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:30,450
It seems like a lot from what you've
been saying, but how that improvisation,

491
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:35,050
uh, affects the process and the final
product and how it might be different from

492
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:38,890
other animated films as
it was with finding dory.

493
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,070
Well, I don't Dunno, compared to other
animated films are, are different.

494
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,440
Some are the Simpsons that I've done.
The whole thing was Improv'd.

495
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,440
There's always a solid script here.

496
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,040
And the thing about Andrew is
that once she gets those words,

497
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,410
if you're willing to keep going,

498
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:06,540
he'll take every word in the English
language out of you. So you know,

499
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:11,541
by the end of the day you've
given a lot of choices.

500
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,940
Hopefully there's some choices he
didn't think of and then they have to,

501
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,260
the thing I'm most grateful for is
I don't have to listen back to these

502
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:26,850
recording sessions
cause after 9,000 takes,

503
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:28,170
I just took you chew

504
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,290
every, every person here. There's at
least one or two lines if not more,

505
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:35,890
that are in the finished movie of things
that they came up with on the set that

506
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,330
I would have never written.
So,

507
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,141
but you know,

508
00:29:38,141 --> 00:29:43,141
it's generally an animated films I think
generally welcome because it's at the

509
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:45,820
stage where it's still,

510
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,100
you're not coming into a finished movie
where you have to fit the exact words in

511
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:55,270
a mouth. So they generally, if
you can do it, they welcome it.

512
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,920
All right.
Thank you so much.

513
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,480
This is a question for Ellen and Dory.
How did you learn to speak?

514
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,160
Well, that's very good. First of all, um,

515
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,490
I was in Hawaii and there was a woman
who was staying in the house next to the

516
00:30:23,301 --> 00:30:28,301
House that I was renting and she was
doing yoga and like crazy yoga on rocks

517
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:36,200
and, um, and listening
to whale sounds like,

518
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,000
I didn't know you could buy that record,

519
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:42,470
but there's a record that
just is whale sounds. And uh,

520
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,890
and I was listening to it and I just,
it just was like the most,

521
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,950
it was the weirdest thing
I'd ever seen in my life.

522
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,560
And I just thought a wave is
going to take her out any minute.

523
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,700
And it didn't kind of wanted it to
happen because it was just so weird that

524
00:30:55,701 --> 00:30:58,760
she's on her head on a
rock. And, um, so anyway,

525
00:30:58,761 --> 00:31:01,940
I just knew what a whale's
sounded like. And so, uh,

526
00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:04,550
I didn't think I'd ever need
to use it in life, but I did.

527
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,910
I was so scared to ask her this.
I thought this is going to be the thing.

528
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,430
This is going to be the sub Nima. This
isn't gonna be the thing that makes me go,

529
00:31:10,431 --> 00:31:13,610
okay, I'm done. I'm not in this
movie anymore. I'm out. And I'm like,

530
00:31:13,611 --> 00:31:15,590
would you be willing to speak well?

531
00:31:15,591 --> 00:31:18,320
And she told me this whole story right
away and then just went right into it.

532
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:23,770
Oh, I can speak whale. All right.
I've been waiting. Yeah. So that's it.

533
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:27,070
And it's a, it's not easy. I
mean, you did it very well,

534
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:30,850
but if you have to do it a lot, it's very,
uh, it's, it's tough on your vocal cords.

535
00:31:30,851 --> 00:31:31,740
You have to kind of warm up.

536
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,260
Caitlin had to do it a lot
because her care characters,

537
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:36,240
the reason dory knows how to speak well.
So

538
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,860
yeah, it did it a lot. They'd look
at me and go, um, one last thing.

539
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,700
Okay, let's just do it. Give me some tea.

540
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,610
Thank you.
Thanks.

541
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,380
Hello.
My question is for Ellen.

542
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:02,150
What was the craziest moment that have
been onset when recording the movie,

543
00:32:02,151 --> 00:32:02,984
Finding Dory?

544
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:08,120
Uh, the craziest moment. I don't know
if there was a crazy moment, but uh,

545
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,670
yeah, when your back went out you
couldn't even stay at your back.

546
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,690
Well, I don't even remember that
we didn't give it to the senior.

547
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,760
So what happened like this stand
up right before you came in,

548
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,700
do like a four hour session with us
and we were like, we're really sorry.

549
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:22,534
Could you do one more?

550
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,450
That's right. That's, well it's, I don't
know. It was crazy. It was sad. Sad, sad.

551
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:31,250
One of the saddest. Do you want a
sad moment are crazy. Yeah. I forgot.

552
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,200
And then I literally, I had to still do
it time. I got in that horrible accident.

553
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,680
Yeah, I remember that time
when I was so crazy. Crazy.

554
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,420
Crazy. Ellen. Yeah. Um,
I was going to say a,

555
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:48,320
this is just an excuse to
complain about it, um, that they,

556
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,770
because dory is always either left
behind or catching up to people.

557
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:55,430
So there's a lot of hyperventilating
like breathing really just,

558
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,430
you know, it's that or it's
like scream like a lot of those.

559
00:33:01,431 --> 00:33:03,080
And you'd think that once,
I just did that,

560
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,850
you could use that throughout
the whole film. Right.

561
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,500
But I had to do it all the time. I
had to like in a just like, do you,

562
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,580
don't you really have the already,
so there was a lot of that.

563
00:33:13,581 --> 00:33:17,150
And when you see this film and
you should see it many times, um,

564
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,860
you, you will see that I don't do it that
often in the film. And I don't know why

565
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,210
that was like your first comment that
was like, that was like Ellen was like,

566
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:29,560
I really loved it. Where was all
the gasping and paper ventilating?

567
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,280
Like literally that was
her first question. Yeah.

568
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,780
Like where is it? So it's in
the toys. Yeah. Yeah. I see.

569
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,040
That's how they get ya.
Thank you. Thanks. Okay.

570
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,660
Hello. Hi. Oh, who came up with the
idea for Sia to cover unforgettable.

571
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,280
And how did that all come about?

572
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,450
Oh Gosh,
we know who exactly what we,

573
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:59,110
you always wanted the song.
I just, that was always

574
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,510
said. They gotta have one syllable.
That's the only thing I care about.

575
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:05,630
Just one. And we don't want to know what
she looks like. Yeah, no, but it was,

576
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:07,220
the song was always there.

577
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,760
Like you always wanted that song at
the end of the movie and you were new.

578
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,870
We knew it was going to be covered.

579
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,760
Originally we wanted it Robbie Robertson
and Robert said, Robert, it'd be amazing.

580
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:20,680
Robbie Williams, the head
actually covered, um, beyond
the sea on the first movie.

581
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:24,250
And so I wanted it to feel like that
same sort of complimentary modern day

582
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:26,680
singer plus an old classic and see you

583
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,720
pretty much at the top of the list.
We were talking to you

584
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:34,900
in a session and they said, we need this,
the song is going to be unforgettable.

585
00:34:34,901 --> 00:34:39,480
And um, they said, we're thinking of Sia.
And I got my phone out. She was like,

586
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,120
let's see how fast we can make
this. I said, I'm right now.

587
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,480
And so I texted her and she's like,
are you kidding me?

588
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:48,790
Of course I would love to do that.
So it was like that quick.

589
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:50,490
She just was so excited.
So

590
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,940
turns out when you know
islands and generous, you
have to be a friend of Ellen.

591
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:56,000
And it happened pretty quickly.
I was texting the CEO too.

592
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:01,100
That's a thing is she was texting with
me when she got that text and I was like,

593
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:02,550
all right, go. Ellen needs you.

594
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,980
Thank you.
Thank you guys.

595
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,673
Yeah.

596
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,490
So a couple of things with the
audience too. So what we, uh, uh,

597
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,540
Google also partnered with Pixar and
Disney to basically give you guys a lot of

598
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,730
really cool content, uh,
on the knowledge panel.

599
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:24,870
If you type in finding
dory on Google search, uh,

600
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,200
you'll see over on the right hand side
in the knowledge panel as a whole bunch

601
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:28,460
of stuff that Disney has been doing,

602
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,520
trailers and gifts and a whole bunch of
stuff. So it's been really cool stuff.

603
00:35:31,521 --> 00:35:34,040
So thank you guys so much for providing
that. You guys probably didn't know,

604
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,740
but it's there. And so now you
guys know, so check that out.

605
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:41,460

today being a world oceans day. Um,

606
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:45,520

in, you know, just to, uh,

607
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,150

So there's a donate button in the,

608
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:52,330

there. Um, and after this as well, uh,

609
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,230

Oh,

610
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:59,870

friends at sea. I was friends.

611
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:03,480
Yeah. Um, uh, to help save rays,

612
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:07,470

places across the globe. So, uh, yeah,

613
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,030
