Awesome guys.
Thank you for coming to Google.

9
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:52,690
I think this is your first time here
for trade. It is. Yes. Yes. First Time,

10
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,510
I know you've done a
Google plus hangout if,

11
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,310
I don't know if you've actually
done it on our campus. So welcome.

12
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,810
I have not and I'm very excited to be
here and uh, we're excited to have you.

13
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:06,520
And for those Googlers who didn't
know right before we came in,

14
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,910
Tyler Teraji and lyric actually popped
into a coding class that was happening

15
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:15,130
right over here with young
women's leadership academy.

16
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,180
So we had about a dozen young
ladies from Queens who, uh,

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,980
I think they were doing some,
uh,

18
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,920
VR coding and they just popped
in. So all that screaming, yes,

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,260
I heard it wasn't me. It was,
no, it was where you William?

20
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,850
Yes. I wish. Anyway, thank
you guys. So I'm sorry. I,

21
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:45,530
let me just give me right now guys.
I'm tired and I'm stupid when I'm tired.

22
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:49,520
So this and this may go straight silly.
Just, just no, I'm just be prepared.

23
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,470
I read the disclaimer, the disclaimer.
Okay. All right. All right. I'm ready.

24
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:59,280
And this is not being filmed at all,
so, okay, good. Good, good. All right.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,310
You won't take those off now.

26
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,990
So acrimony,
uh,

27
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,950
the name kind of says it all if
you know what the definition is.

28
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,540
And I was about to say,
so, uh, bitterness, ranker,

29
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,700
anger, anger, rage, Alice. I didn't
know what the definition was. Oh,

30
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,770
I'd literally,
I'd written this script and I was like,

31
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:26,540
I got to find a title for it.
And I was watching,

32
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,990
he was watching CNN and somebody
was describing our president

33
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,850
and you were like, and they
said, it's acrimonious. I said,

34
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:38,080
what is that word into this angle?
That's the title of the movie

35
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,570
theaters March 30. Well, you
answered my first question.

36
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,910
How did you edited you come up with the,
I already knew you were going there.

37
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,243
There you go.
Okay.

38
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,990
Um,
but this movie is,

39
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,240
is a little bit of a departure
from what you're known for your,

40
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,070
you're a worldwide brand
known for making movies, um,

41
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,580
that are humorous

42
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,020
and dramatic and watch
it be careful. Yeah. But,

43
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,800
but this is a thriller. Yeah, no,
it's, it's a big departure for me.

44
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:12,640
After doing gone girl and working with
David Fincher and seeing his brilliance

45
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:12,831
and,

46
00:03:12,831 --> 00:03:17,080
and he would watch he and Ben Affleck
and on the brakes talk about cameras and

47
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:20,710
lighting and shots and this Hitchcock
kind of filled that they wanted and they

48
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:23,200
want to make sure that the, the
way the light falls, I'm like,

49
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:27,190
what the hell are they talking about? So
I really started paying attention to it.

50
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:29,170
And then when I saw gone
girl come together, I said,

51
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:32,860
I want to do something like
this. So I started, I had
this idea for a while and I,

52
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,150
and I started riding again.

53
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:36,790
And of course there was only one
person who could play Melinda.

54
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,020
And that's to Razi p.

55
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,770
So did you, did you write the role of
Belinda with Taraji and mine? Merlin,

56
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,220
Linda, Linda, sorry. Yeah,

57
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,180
that Belinda's for someone
else that's called by. Oh

58
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,653
my God,

59
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,990
yes. But no, totally wrote it
with her in mind because you know,

60
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,930
when I start writing a few of the scenes,
what happens is the characters start,

61
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,170
they speak to me that I could, I
could hear them as I'm, as I'm typing.

62
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:10,900
And then pretty soon I
started to see a face and I,

63
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:12,290
the first face I saw was hers.

64
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,850
And then he calls me and I'm like in
the middle of filming and by, Yep.

65
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,350
I'm not done until months later.
So I'm like, sure, I'll do it.

66
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:24,020
My high eight it says, he said, no, no.

67
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,760
Yeah cause nobody,
let me tell you something.

68
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:29,420
Nobody does a film while they're shooting
their television shows because you

69
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:34,010
don't have the time. It's, it's 1618 hours
a day, six, seven days a week sometimes.

70
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:37,250
So He'd some crazy schedule. But
uh, for some reason she said yes.

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,540
Well cause you wouldn't go away.

72
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,330
You wouldn't take no for
an answer because I was,

73
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,800
I tried to give him every excuse.
I was like, Tyler, I am cookie.

74
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,861
I was like,

75
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:54,861
how do I di program my
instrument being cookie?

76
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,300
He was like, he let me
finish. He was like, okay,

77
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,580
you've been living with cookie for
three years now and you got that.

78
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,430
You can come and do this,
and I was like, okay.

79
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:09,360
I was so nervous and scared and that's
why I did it because if it doesn't scare

80
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:12,210
me then I'm not going to change.
I'm not going to transform it anyway,

81
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,930
so I don't do roles that don't really
scare me. Not unless the check is good.

82
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,280
First scene that we shot, it
was cookie, the first thing,

83
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,130
the very first and I pulled you
aside and said, nope, that's cocky.

84
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,470
What was the first scene?
It didn't make it in the movie.

85
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:34,850
It's the trashcan where you come out
and you went to the trashcan and the and

86
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:39,110
the his, his, his, his ideas
in the trashcan. He dropped
a cigarette ash on it.

87
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:41,580
He's like, thank you lord that she
is open. Then you get in the car here

88
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,400
dry. Oh, how you cut that? Cause
that was because that was cooking.

89
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,650
Well you call me in the middle
of the vehicle, you said
no, no, no, but no, no, no.

90
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:54,230
I say that to say that. So I
say that to say this. She's

91
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:58,130
like, you know what, you right.
You right now watch this. She comes

92
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,570
back and she's this, she's Melinda.
Everything, the boys, the boys,

93
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,010
the eyes that this the, the way this
woman looks up at, at it, at him,

94
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,890
it's chilling. Man. It was crazy though.
It's true. And I was looking at that,

95
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,970
that character, while I have
been broken bleeding and I was,

96
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,720
I was kind of shocked. I, I mean you,

97
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:22,610
you played strong characters,
tough characters. Um,

98
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,050
I have get to see you play a character
like this and it seemed like it was,

99
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,890
it was kind of scary.
I mean it was definitely scary.

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,020
I've been waiting for this APP
ever since I seen fatal attraction.

101
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,730
I been gunning for a character like
this and it was great because I'm always

102
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:44,260
playing the righteous female, you know,
she's really always the moral compass,

103
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,040
you know, to stand up kind
of woman's strong and pow,

104
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,720
I wanted to do this because she's
that. But in another light, right?

105
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,150
He's made up this story and um, I
mean, we've all been there. You know,

106
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:58,750
you man get a tax. It's a simple tax.
It could be from a cousin, you know,

107
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,970
maybe he didn't see the cousin
and 10 years, I don't know.

108
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,900
But we will take that and
run with a child. It says
his woman, he's been dating,

109
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:08,480
but he has a whole nother family out.
I don't know about,

110
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,450
every woman in here is
not agreeing with you

111
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,633
talked about,

112
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,380
I will take something and we're all
capable of it, but then there's that one.

113
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,820
We're capable because then there's that
one part of you that's the rational

114
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,600
where you got to go, okay, this is
stupid. Like I can't, this didn't,

115
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,180
this is not happening. Well, Melinda
didn't listen to that voice. Right.

116
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,690
She just took her story and ran with it.

117
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,620
Well. Right. I mean, she, she's pure rage.

118
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:42,020
And as I remember,
if I remember correctly,

119
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,820
very early on in the movie as Melinda's
talking about herself, she says,

120
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:49,490
my rage is like this discreet thing.

121
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,530
It's like something that's
separate and apart from, yeah. Um,

122
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,810
which is kind of amazing and I want to
come to come back to that because you

123
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,600
touch upon mental health just
a little bit in the movie.

124
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:02,210
And I wanted to explore
that more, but, uh,

125
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,160
I wanted to get more into the character
of Melinda and then go to go to lyric

126
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:10,620
because, um, the, the,

127
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,640
the character seems to be off to save,

128
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,610
to save the, to say the least. Did you,

129
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,680
and you talked about your, you know,
what you did to build out that character,

130
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,420
basically. Fan, you're off.

131
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,210
It was Tyler.
That's what you think about it.

132
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:38,250
But she's also, she, she's broke and
she's, and she's hurting. So his,

133
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,640
through his lyrics are, so
there's, there's a lot there,

134
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:44,040
but I wanted to know how you,
how you gotten into that camera.

135
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,180
Well, I mean, we've all had a broken
heart. If you haven't, you haven't loved.

136
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,380
But you know,

137
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:53,820
I've had those moments where I had to
talk myself out of scratching up a car or

138
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:57,240
throwing a brick through. Come on.
You know when your heart is hurting,

139
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:01,560
you want that person hurt.
People hurt people. Right?

140
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,330
So if you hurt me,
my natural reaction is to get you back.

141
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,530
Right?
So,

142
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:12,180
but then you have to grow up and you
have to realize that jail is not for me.

143
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,080
So I'm gonna keep driving and pretend like
I don't see the car. You know, I'm not.

144
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,830
So this was a role for me to act out
all of those things I thought about and

145
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:27,010
wanted to do
and not go to jail,

146
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,470
including show up with an ax. But yeah.
Good. Yeah. Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah,

147
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,060
exactly. So, so

148
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,860
I had, this hair is driving
me crazy. I'm so sorry. Okay.

149
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,780
This is what I did with on set. We'll
be in a serious thing. She'll be like,

150
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,470
and if you do that again,
what the hell is going on with his hair?

151
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,800
Right here is what we dealt
with all the time. All the time.

152
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,410
Be looking at me like sweet.
Why? Because the people,

153
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,310
I have a weird way of
operating like working,

154
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,770
you know you have act is
where you have to be quiet.

155
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,090
You can't move you right
there. Sorry. She on her phone.

156
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:09,870
I don't really like that and I could
add in the middle of a damn circus.

157
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,500
I mean literally and I'll do
these scenes where I'm just like,

158
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,920
and everybody's like tip toeing
around me and then they'll,

159
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:18,240
they'll cut and I'm like, yeah.
So anyway, tower last night,

160
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,580
various stuff.
Was that off putting lyric,

161
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,210
we're working working that way or
you do you work a different way?

162
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:31,290
It's very calm. Just no,

163
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,080
this is all going to be proud to change.
It's about to get real calm.

164
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,810
Real leading man. Real sexy. Right.

165
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,130
Where the peanut gallery also
asking me a question. Go ahead.

166
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,733
I forgot the question.

167
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,760
Was this your first time acting
with Teraji? It was. And then

168
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,343
how was that?

169
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,790
It was a great experience.
Um,

170
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,390
I never thought that this moment and
this opportunity would be in my career.

171
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:11,290
So it was something that was a surreal,

172
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,390
still beside myself a year later.
So I'm working with,

173
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:19,190
with Toronto was great because I know
from seeing her own empire I've seen on

174
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:23,140
our work before. Yeah.
I was just like, okay,

175
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,040
I got to come prepared. I gotta
make sure that, um, didn't,

176
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,400
I didn't know she was that intense.
I had no idea. She was intense. I,

177
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:33,880
I like to believe that her characters
are different than the person,

178
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:37,060
so I didn't think of
her as cookie. But, um,

179
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,520
the professionalism that, uh, that she
brought to the set was second to none.

180
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,450
And um, I came prepared. I'm always
prepared. I like to believe that.

181
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:51,451
But then when I saw the level of
professionalism after one could think,

182
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,370
you know,
you could just relax

183
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,490
because I've made it, you
know, got a big show, you know,

184
00:11:57,491 --> 00:12:01,150
you could come on and just like stop a
set because you know that one hair is out

185
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,360
of place, not the thing, but
it was never that. It was like,

186
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,600
like what you see is what it
is. Yeah. I was very thankful,

187
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,460
but I know really I your check?

188
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,663
No,
no,

189
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,060
we didn't really get a lot of time
together because it was so fast.

190
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,560
She didn't want to spend time.
She um,

191
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,140
there was a disclaimer to
not spend any time. Well no,

192
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,540
that's kind of remarkable
though because while the, the,

193
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,260
the movie sidle characters you really,

194
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:31,020
that's about the relationship
between your character. Robert,

195
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,620
fix this cause this is called Virgo
for you. I also know you're a,

196
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,230
you're a stickler for details.
Yeah.

197
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,820
Yeah. He, I'm going to say this. I don't
know where you were in the question,

198
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:46,080
but I just have to begin my presentation.
I never, I had never met lyric before.

199
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:50,340
I didn't know. And I trust Tyler.
So he says this guy's great.

200
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:54,690
So of course I Google and I can
call my guy from finance them. Okay.

201
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,800
But they know, you know, cause
it's all about a chemistry.

202
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,770
You know the great thing
about this is that you know,

203
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:03,180
whether the chemistry was there or not,

204
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:08,160
it was okay because we really didn't
like each other for the part of the film

205
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:09,540
that we started.
You know,

206
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,750
cause they start with the kids
first plank us and then we grow up.

207
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,030
So by the time we're,

208
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,380
we come in as ourselves and the character
in a movie, we don't like each other.

209
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:23,340
Like the, the relationship has fallen
apart. So I wasn't like, I, you know,

210
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:26,700
the chemistry didn't really have to
be there as if we were madly in love,

211
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,630
but it still helps to show
a pass that there was,

212
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,140
you can see the chemistry used
to be there something. Right.

213
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,220
And so when I met him,

214
00:13:35,221 --> 00:13:40,221
I remember the first thing we did for me
is the eyes and his eyes are so like he

215
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:44,910
was so vulnerable. Yeah.
Something in his eyes so strong,

216
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:48,720
but yet he could break in any moment
and that's where that character was.

217
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:53,190
And not just as like Tyler where to
find him a year later I look up and he

218
00:13:53,191 --> 00:13:54,024
everywhere.
Yeah.

219
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,743
Yeah.

220
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,700
Fortunate to lay eyes on some amazing
talent before they, before they hit.

221
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,280
And he's definitely one of those things.

222
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,220
And I think that its features
going to be so amazing because,

223
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,560
because he is an incredible actor.
He is.

224
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,610
Just what he brings in the vulnerability
and I mean he's leading man material.

225
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,750
Yeah, absolutely. And unfortunately
I don't see a lot of bad anymore,

226
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,980
especially in men of color, so,
but he is definitely that. And if,

227
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,240
and I can tell you when you're,
when we're going down casting,

228
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,870
trying to cast a movie and you start
looking for the leading man that lit up,

229
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,020
I lead a man of color. That list
is really short, really short.

230
00:14:34,021 --> 00:14:35,460
So he definitely should be on that list.

231
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,870
My checks don't have them

232
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,190
while I can I,
can I tell you my favorite part?

233
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,040
Sure. [inaudible] is the, for the,

234
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:52,220
the second I think is a second scene or
something when she's in with a therapist,

235
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,840
there's a camera move that I did that,
that it's just nothing special.

236
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:59,210
It's just on low on a track
and it just pushes in on her.

237
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,550
And it's about a four minute
scene that I didn't want to cut.

238
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,140
I didn't want to edit it at all.

239
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,800
I want it to be raw so people can see
the brilliance in this woman. I mean, I,

240
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:09,110
so that scene is uncut.
She's sitting,

241
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,120
she's sitting there on the sofa doing
this long monologue and she sets up the

242
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:17,560
whole movie. But it shows you
how brilliant, what, what,

243
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,510
how broken she has is as an actor.
It's incredible. It's incredible.

244
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:23,630
And I love it that way on purpose.
So be nerve wracking, hopefully that,

245
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,970
that scene,
it's so sad.

246
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,830
Why you scared the hell out of nights.

247
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,180
It scared me when she saw it back to
your site because it's like, who is that?

248
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,103
I'm like,
well,

249
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,190
I'm gonna tell you why as an actress
doing television is scared me because we

250
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:38,550
didn't cut. Right. He was like,
no, I need this all in one take.

251
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,450
And we only had for three days to do it.

252
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,140
It doesn't hold my whole part of the film.
We shot in four days.

253
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,880
The whole movie was done in eight days.
We have to protect this man because no,

254
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:54,210
seriously, because he can, he
can read a lot of jobs. Yes.

255
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,990
He's a lot of people don't, well,
you know, let's just set up,

256
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,760
we don't want miss the ferry to come.
I'm missing,

257
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,940
but I do do.
I'll go out

258
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,620
there. There will be a lot of haters.
No, I won't because he's getting, I mean,

259
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:14,550
you know, so many people think their
jobs are important, but you know,

260
00:16:14,551 --> 00:16:17,970
we won't go there. Let's keep
talking about the movie. But um,

261
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:23,150
so I was so nervous because I had so much
dialogue to say and I didn't have the

262
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:27,330
luxury of cut. Oh, can I do, can
we just pick it up from here?

263
00:16:27,331 --> 00:16:30,990
And it was like he needed all
of that dialogue in one take,

264
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,950
but that's when that theater
training came in. Yeah.

265
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,980
Because I wanted the
audience to see when you

266
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,140
throw an accurate or
role and you don't cut,

267
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,970
you don't cut like work for
those of you on our cutters,

268
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,140
you jump to a close up or you jumped to
a side shot. He jumped into the chat.

269
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,430
It's one shot pushing in on her as
she delivers. Like it's chilling.

270
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,100
And if you don't know who Melinda is
in that moment at the beginning of the

271
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:55,350
movie, you won't. Yeah. The,

272
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,620
the other character though,
Robert,

273
00:16:57,621 --> 00:17:00,290
I said to till lyric as we
were coming in and I said,

274
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:05,350
I actually thought that character that
you wrote was the most complicated one

275
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,790
because it's, it's through his
character that you shift perspective.

276
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,440
And that's the really,

277
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:15,980
one of the great things about the movie
is because you think it's this movie

278
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:19,880
about, you know, trust and betrayal
and you know, there's this, you know,

279
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:23,900
steadfast woman who is yet this
unfaithful man and this is revenge.

280
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,270
And actually it's a different story.
It's a different,

281
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,880
because if you notice in the
beginning of the movie, it's told,

282
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,680
we can't tell them the room has this
room scene. I don't think that they have.

283
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:35,310
So you're trying not to no, no, no.

284
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:37,820
I just started to set it up though
in the beginning of the movie, she,

285
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,520
she is telling the story from
our point of view, right?

286
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,120
So you're in it from her point of view
and then there's a shift where you go,

287
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:47,960
wait a minute, wait, there's
this. Right? What is she saying?

288
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,890
Did that really happen?
And was that true?

289
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,110
And you realize that as
you're watching the film,

290
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:55,680
that there are two perspectives to this
is like in every relationship that goes

291
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:58,770
bad, there's her side and there's his side
or there's his side, his side, her side,

292
00:17:58,771 --> 00:17:59,604
her side.
Yeah.

293
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,330
And then the, and then there's the truth.
And I, and this was born out of it,

294
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,260
out of me counseling a lot of friends
who have gone through things and I would

295
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:09,230
sit down with them and that I would be
friends with him or friends with her.

296
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:11,810
And then we'd sit down and have
a conversation, uh, separately.

297
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:16,730
And they saw two different moments that
both the tore them apart. And I was like,

298
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:18,580
how could this be that?
And I would drive,

299
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:21,350
I remember really trying to get this
one person to see this other side of it.

300
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,221
And she couldn't,

301
00:18:22,221 --> 00:18:26,120
she would not allow it because what it
would mean is that she would have to take

302
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:30,920
responsibility in her own and what
she did wrong. So yeah. Yeah. Right.

303
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,450
That was my,

304
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,010
there were a few Aha moments
and that was definitely an Aha,

305
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,200
Aha moment when it switched perspectives.

306
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,000
And it's so easy how we're so quick to
jump on the girl's side because y'all do

307
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:48,150
that though. Do that. You'll get all
your girlfriends and you get your,

308
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,030
you get your girl nation
to come up against.

309
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:55,450
He did it because he
wrote a movie like that.

310
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,160
There's always another
side. Just just I, I,

311
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,630
I'm pretty good about taking a moment and
stepping back and like even when I can

312
00:19:07,631 --> 00:19:09,610
remove the emotion within
myself, I'm be like, okay,

313
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,210
let me just look at this from both sides
because a lot of times people run out

314
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:15,910
on relationships that could have,
could have been really, really good,

315
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,720
but they couldn't remove themselves
from the middle of the emotion.

316
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,110
If you can take yourself out of it and
step back for a minute and go, okay,

317
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,330
maybe I could have handled this
better or maybe I could have did this,

318
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,700
but first thing you ask yourself is,
what did I do wrong?

319
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:32,420
Own your own stuff first and
then you can work on fixing it.

320
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

321
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,290
hey, hey, come, come back.

322
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,170
I have never heard anybody say they were

323
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:01,330
going along to best. Fascinating goal.
That's the new movement. Be a synagogue,

324
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,203
Girls Bill Gurley.

325
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,400
Agrimonia
know how to spell that.

326
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,470
You don't understand lyric
lyric looking just like

327
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,160
I said. Okay. Cause I moved really fast
but he came here but the camera Andy does.

328
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,820
Okay. And everybody get ob. It makes
her gut is right brain Raylynn's okay,

329
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,663
let's go

330
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,030
lyrical code when you go.
I'm sorry.

331
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,060
Maybe I'm sorry,
I need to explain cause I'm the director.

332
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:55,760
Let me explain to you what, I'm sorry. I
just thought you got it. But yeah, yeah,

333
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,500
I you do them out of sequence also. Right?
So yeah, this was, this was the, I'm sorry

334
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,720
I have to say this,
we have totally taken over your,

335
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,633
I know

336
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,840
I did my homework. I was watching like
youtube clips in like all sorts of things.

337
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:18,000
Anyway. It's all right. Wait,

338
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:23,740
Fillmore is, despite saying he
shows up and all hell breaks loose.

339
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,570
Me and my sisters jump is a yes.

340
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,180
But it was

341
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,630
crazy because he had Tyler again,
his brilliance,

342
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,310
he had all of these cameras set up to get
all of the angles. So this cut out six,

343
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:38,300
six cameras.

344
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,740
So we had the crane shoddy out of
somebody with a steady cam on the track.

345
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:46,010
There were cameras everywhere.
This is unheard of and a feature.

346
00:21:46,011 --> 00:21:50,900
You do it for five, 10 times to get all of
those angles. We did it. What two, three,

347
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:55,250
two takes at the most. Um, and what
he would do, we would start the fight.

348
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,970
So if I got body hair

349
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,100
wasn't, it wasn't supposed to be
a fight. Yeah, it wasn't enough.

350
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,860
It ended up [inaudible] high was because
he never read that in the script.

351
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:07,630
I don't know.

352
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:12,170
It wasn't, it wasn't a fight.
It was, it was a disagreement.

353
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,703
And then

354
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,190
after,
after I tell her what's happening,

355
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:23,670
I leave to go about my business and she
decided that it's not going to go like

356
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:28,360
that. It's going to be a fight. And it
ended up on the front lawn of the house.

357
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,830
The scene is supposed to be in the house.

358
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:35,530
Well, that scene and I thought like,
I'm like, wow, that's real. That's,

359
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,880
but this is no, this,

360
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:44,750
this is one of those moments where I
didn't fill him in. It was not filled in.

361
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,450
We talked about it, but that's what,
I'm sorry. We were all in the same way.

362
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,360
That's one of my questions
was how much did you improv?

363
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,990
And that wasn't clear.

364
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,781
It was good though.
It was.

365
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:06,220
So that's what I enjoyed about his dad
to beat his ass on the first day and all

366
00:23:06,221 --> 00:23:09,640
that. And I would say, I would say hold
and they will stop right where they are.

367
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,940
Why does paypal and we would have to
freeze like that and he was like answering

368
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:17,890
or you have to set the cameras up,
but it,

369
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,070
it works well and it keeps, it keeps
the actors in the moment. Yeah.

370
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:23,850
And me being an actor, I want to be in
the moment. I want to, I didn't want,

371
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:28,720
I don't want to sit and do 5,000 takes
of something and I don't want to go and

372
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:29,740
get it in.
It can be two,

373
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:34,060
three created a models I'd
be on a Pallette is terrible.

374
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:35,170
You have created it.
Is

375
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,110
that it?
That is a bit of sweet of it.

376
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:41,970
After you do something like that and you
show up on set, yeah. You're like, right.

377
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,010
You know it's go. Yeah. Cause
we were sitting, we were doing

378
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,150
15 pages a day on the,
on the actual recording,

379
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,210
15 pages a day or you don't
understand what that means.

380
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,320
You have to understand what they shoot on
rate on a regular, a Hollywood picture.

381
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:59,840
They've shoot two pages that they
at the most, sometimes three.

382
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:02,280
If they get to three or four,
they think they're going really fast.

383
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:06,680
And we were at 1516 pages a day. So yeah.
Yeah. But that's how you normally work,

384
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,010
the efficiency of your production. Yeah.
It's kind of astounding. Couldn't do.

385
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:16,970
You could do a television series and a
day. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can do a movie.

386
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:19,190
This one was done in
eight days. Yeah. Yeah.

387
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,040
We shoot the haves and have nots
in a day. And if, let me use wrong,

388
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,820
we shoot in a day, but, but a
lot of that is, it was about

389
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,560
a lot of that and we've
never done television.

390
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,770
That's how you get a job.
But you're on the,

391
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:41,390
you're on the biggest show on
television right now. Let's,

392
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,650
that's coming to an end at some point.

393
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,420
Just enjoy the ride. It's just
going to be around for a long time.

394
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,440
We'd know we shoot, we shoot him
date, what? But what happens in that,

395
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:55,600
cause I have a studio in Atlanta and part
of me building this studio was so that

396
00:24:55,601 --> 00:25:00,190
I can do that. I can, I can go from
sing to sing set to set all on the base.

397
00:25:00,191 --> 00:25:03,580
I don't have to travel across the city.
I don't have to go from stage to stage.

398
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:06,040
I built this world for me
to be able to do that. And,

399
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,910
and now it's become a world where other
films are coming to be filmed there.

400
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,640
Let's say a black panther
and universal shooting

401
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,103
condo forever

402
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,240
versus shooting their HBO know,
walking dead is shot.

403
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:20,390
There was a lot of things that are shot.
They're now so,

404
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,610
so it's a world that I created
that allows me to move that fast.

405
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,630
And I have a good team.

406
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:29,870
I bought a bunch of green folks that have
never done anything that wanted to be

407
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:34,050
in the business and taught them so well
that now they're breaking off and going

408
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:35,550
onto other films.
But,

409
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,380
but having all these young kids and a lot
of them people talking about inclusion

410
00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:42,000
rider, I need a non inclusion
writer cause I got everything

411
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,510
body they already, that's
amazing. He actually goes to,

412
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:46,710
when he told me on Saturday,

413
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,550
he said I go to colleges and I hire these
kids that the industry is not going to

414
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:55,320
hire. That's why he's so blessed because
he just, he gave me my quote amount.

415
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,450
I don't know how many
people read my book but

416
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,250
they don't understand what quality is.

417
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,530
I never had a quote to be paid.
Like when I did all those movies,

418
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:12,150
y'all saw men up until I did the first
movie, I can do bad all by myself.

419
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,520
I was working with adequate,

420
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,490
which means they were paying
me chicken feed basically.

421
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,590
Where'd your quote this Sally,

422
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,850
you and moves used to but this has changed
but whatever your quote is this like

423
00:26:23,851 --> 00:26:24,684
what did,
what did you,

424
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,240
what's the highest amount of money
you've ever gotten paid and whatever that

425
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:30,420
number is, that's what they based you
on. Well this is what we'll offer you.

426
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,190
And a lot of those
numbers were a lot lower.

427
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:36,180
So we set it then as at a higher
numbers higher than you ever had.

428
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:38,850
And even with this one I than
you've ever had. So it, it,

429
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,890
it changes the financial picture
for the actor and actresses. So,

430
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,770
and being able to do that
for her and a lot of others.

431
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,450
[inaudible]

432
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,490
no, no, no, no, no. He was
there. He was very generous with,

433
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:02,180
he's so cool. So cool. I just
want to hang out in his pocket.

434
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:06,060
Just go wherever he's going. Let
me go on now. And Larry Quick.

435
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,350
No real tall,
no real talky.

436
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,510
You were very generous and it's, uh, it's,

437
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:16,440
it's refreshing to be in
this crazy business and to
work with people who you're

438
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:19,230
not second guessing their,
their, you know, their,

439
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:22,180
their purpose and their reasons
for what they're doing. I was just,

440
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,000
just a good feeling to
be in that environment.

441
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,300
Yes.
I will always work with Mr. Tyler bear.

442
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,060
Well, it sounds like once you
go, Tyler, you'd never go back.

443
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,660
Well, what should they do? Really just,

444
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,360
Oh, so it was, it might have
just remained, just it just,

445
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,360
it goes when you win because
for me being a person that,

446
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,490
especially being a black
man in this business,

447
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,930
and this is not about racism at all,
this is just about race,

448
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:52,710
understanding that the value of
our own people and letting us know,

449
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:55,800
treating us all well, letting us
all, oh no, I mean if you walk,

450
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:57,720
if you came to the studio right now
and you walked through the campus,

451
00:27:57,721 --> 00:28:02,721
cause it's a 330 acre campus and 12th
sound stages there and in the city of

452
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:06,150
Atlanta and you walk through the campus
and you see these kids in their faces

453
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,230
and,
and I,

454
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,830
I know every one of them meant to shake
their hands and the two to empower them,

455
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:13,050
make them feel,
I feel you,

456
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,270
you have to just drive through
the gates to really get it.

457
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,590
But that the energy and the
spirit of what is happening there,

458
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,860
I just wanted to, to permeate all over
the world. And I look at, you know,

459
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:26,330
for 10 years I was the only one out there.
The person of color doing,

460
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:29,100
making film and doing
television for a long time now.

461
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,480
And I took a lot of attacks because
people would come to my shows looking

462
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:37,410
forward themselves in my basket.
They're like, yeah, this shit ain't day.

463
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:39,570
Hey that ain't me.
They didn't represent black people.

464
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:42,320
That ain't so I took a lot of
hits for that. Right. But the,

465
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,440
but the issue with it is this,
the fighting the fights that I was having,

466
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,870
like paying people equally
and behind closed doors,

467
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,340
telling people that there are,

468
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:53,220
there are many of us who have
stories that need to be told.

469
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:58,430
So to sit here in this seat and see a
Esra on her show and to see empire and to

470
00:28:58,951 --> 00:29:03,690
see Donald Glover on Atlanta to see
a Black Panther and Ryan Coogler,

471
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,800
I am celebrating man. I'm so happy that
this moment has arrived for so many,

472
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,110
but I caution but I caution them.
Yeah.

473
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,100
Cause I called a lot of people in
success. I said come, let's sit down.

474
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:17,590
Come to Atlanta, come, let's
sit down and let me talk to you.

475
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:21,880
Let me explain to you about ownership
because that is the way you really changed

476
00:29:21,881 --> 00:29:24,130
things. We, this'll be a great
wave and then it'll go away.

477
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:26,940
Because if you look back at history,
we've seen this before, right?

478
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,480
This wave of this African American call,
everybody loves everybody

479
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,120
for seven years. Then it call the seven
years. That's what I'm is his birthday.

480
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:39,080
It's a cycle of seven years, seven
years, seven years. We get all my money.

481
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:43,180
I can't walk in and it's seven years on.
Yeah. And then, and then it goes away.

482
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,180
It's like I said,
but we hope that it's massive.

483
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,240
Does this owners,

484
00:29:47,241 --> 00:29:50,460
this is what I'm trying to give everybody
that I meet with or talk to about

485
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:54,690
ownership, may owning all of my
copyrights. Me Owning all of my shows,

486
00:29:54,691 --> 00:29:55,830
me owning every movie,

487
00:29:55,831 --> 00:30:00,831
me owning everything has put me in a
position where where not only can I have a

488
00:30:01,141 --> 00:30:04,530
studio where 9,000 people
that went through the gates
to come to work last year.

489
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,880
Wow.
But also to,

490
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,970
to have generational wealth for
my son and and his children.

491
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,490
And if they're, if they manage
it right after I'm dead and gone,

492
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,540
what that means is it's passed on to so
many people. So if you want real change,

493
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,130
real change comes with ownership.

494
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:23,430
As long as you're renting the house
and somebody else owns, owns it,

495
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,700
they have the power.
So that's what I'm trying to get a lot of,

496
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,580
a lot of us to come together
to understand and I'm, listen,

497
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:30,860
I'm an open door's open.
Come on

498
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,790
Laura. I want to own some stuff. When you

499
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:40,460
got all your own, that's fine. Don't yell.

500
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,710
Stop. I want to own my own
your stuff. You already own it.

501
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:47,220
You just said that I will come
some stuff together. Oh yeah.

502
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:50,700
That's not what I mean. Okay. You
know what I meant? Let's collaborate.

503
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,280
You can help me o Lord,
how much longer I got the VOP

504
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:03,040
you guys are at, you guys are pressed
for time. If you, if you're game,

505
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:06,970
we'd love to take a couple of questions
from the audience before we leave.

506
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:11,560
And while Googlers are lining up
either at that Mike or is that mine?

507
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:12,643
The hand.
I was like,

508
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:16,883
um,

509
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:22,020
I wanted to ask one last question.

510
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,950
Going back to the themes of the movie,

511
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,320
it seemed like you were,
you were,

512
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:32,850
you were not just writing a movie about
trust and betrayal and relationships,

513
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:37,851
but you were actually talking about and
poking at some big myths and stereotypes

514
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:43,320
about the strong black woman
or the angry black woman. Um,

515
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,270
could you talk a little bit about that?
Was that the,

516
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,350
was that the intent or was you just,
were you just like thrown in there though?

517
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:50,110
The

518
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,930
people, when people say things like, this
is always fascinates me, because when,

519
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:56,640
when I'm writing, I'm literally listening
to what the characters want to say. Hmm.

520
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,320
I'm not trying to make a statement.
I'm not trying to, to, to,

521
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:03,610
to make a point as much as it is,
let's, let's hear what she has to say.

522
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:06,880
And the more I wrote, the more
she showed up, the more she said.

523
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:10,960
What I realized this moment is about is
for all of those people who can't let go

524
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,880
for all of those people who can't forgive,

525
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:16,270
for all of those people who spend their
entire lives looking at what happened

526
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:19,630
with the one that got away rather than
going forward to see what else is out

527
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:22,300
there for them. Because what happens
a lot of times, especially with women,

528
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:25,210
is this is they,
after a bad divorce,

529
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,720
they feel like they have wasted the
best years of their life with someone.

530
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,090
And that promise was
supposed to be forever.

531
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,300
And the anger and the rage of that kid
can become bitterness and fester and

532
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:40,520
destroyed the person. So for
me, my hope and when people,

533
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,270
the takeaway is don't be her,
don't be harsh,

534
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,190
don't be her life goes on and whatever,

535
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:48,750
it didn't happen with you
and this person there,

536
00:32:48,751 --> 00:32:53,570
there's somebody wonderful is you're
missing them because you are so stuck on

537
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:56,150
this and you've got all these people
passing you by. You can't even get to it.

538
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:00,140
And the happiest people I know are the
ones who came out of a divorce no matter

539
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:03,740
how ugly it was. And then ended up
finding the person of their dreams like,

540
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:06,800
oh my God, I'm so glad I went through
that because now I know how to treat you.

541
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,600
I know how to be there.
I knew and I know how to,

542
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:13,550
how this is how to make
this work. So yeah. Great.

543
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,660
First question. All right, thanks for
coming everybody. My question for you,

544
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:21,380
I think you hit on an interesting
subject in that the two sides of the

545
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:24,860
relationship is a common theme in your
movies. Kind of like the counseling.

546
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,860
Is that something that's really present
in your personal life or is there

547
00:33:27,861 --> 00:33:31,310
another reason why you think
that's a common theme in your work?

548
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,230
You know what happened for me, I, I will.

549
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,830
I only wrote about experiences
that I knew or had some,

550
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,890
some something similar in my own life.

551
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,800
But what I found when I looked
back at some of the work now,

552
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,340
the ones that I can look at, cause I
can't look at all of them, a deal moves.

553
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:47,700
I said to going, I can't watch it.
But, but what I've found is when I'm,

554
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:48,960
when I'm writing about,

555
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,690
when I'm riding a black woman
and when I'm riding her struggle,

556
00:33:51,691 --> 00:33:55,410
when I'm writing or paint or anyone for
that matter in any of the pain and what

557
00:33:55,411 --> 00:33:55,891
she's going through,

558
00:33:55,891 --> 00:33:59,910
I realized I was talking to my mother
because there's a little boy watching the

559
00:33:59,911 --> 00:34:02,550
things that she went through.
I was hoping one day she would get it.

560
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:06,150
So if somebody sees something
that I've written and,

561
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,840
and it changes their life,
which has happened where people,

562
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,150
there have been women who have sent
me emails, they've been in terrible,

563
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:15,010
horrible relationships.
But after seeing, uh, uh,

564
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,450
I got this letter from a family that said,
you did attend and an hour and a half,

565
00:34:18,451 --> 00:34:19,860
what we've been trying to do for 12 years,

566
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:24,950
my sister's leaving an
abusive relationship. So that
kind of, that's what, what,

567
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,010
what it's about for me.

568
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:30,120
So I realized early on that I was speaking
to her from the little boy that I was.

569
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:34,390
So I don't know who I was talking to
do for this one, but there we are.

570
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,590
Thank you.
Thank you.

571
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,630
Great. Hi. Thanks for coming. I saw
proud Mary by the way. I thought it was.

572
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:52,330
Yeah. So, um, you also, I saw also,

573
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:54,340
so one of your interviews where you were
talking about how they don't want to

574
00:34:54,341 --> 00:34:58,580
bring black actors abroad and they
think, oh, you don't sell abroad. Um,

575
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:01,720
get with Tyler with you like your studio
and you're like basically owning the

576
00:35:01,721 --> 00:35:03,910
whole vertical.
I think it's really powerful.

577
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:06,100
And including like what you
said about generational wealth.

578
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,500
I'm doing something
similar in real estate.

579
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,290
So I wanted to ask two questions.
One Tower,

580
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,780
do you see yourself expanding more into
the movie industry and like been doing

581
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,470
television, basically taking over some
more and to Rashia we're going to see you.

582
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,220
Um,
I'm pretty much in every area.

583
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:31,500
I am moving towards my own streaming
service though. I am moving towards. Yeah.

584
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,700
So that's what I, that's what
I'm working towards. But,

585
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,520
but when you talk about movies
not traveling internationally,

586
00:35:37,521 --> 00:35:38,070
this is something that

587
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,660
we've been battling for many,
many years.

588
00:35:39,661 --> 00:35:44,310
That's why the success of the success of
Black Panther spoke to so many levels.

589
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:48,720
Having international success because we
have been told for years that bed people

590
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:52,890
stories with people of color don't, don't
translate. They don't travel overseas.

591
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,810
And we've been trying to debunk that myth

592
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,480
for awhile because it's totally a myth.
I mean,

593
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,530
I was in China filming for
three months. China. Yeah.

594
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,220
And you know,
China is a very controlled,

595
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,180
a country is communist
still. Um, and you know,

596
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:10,770
you can't really watch movies there.

597
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:14,760
So they have these stores where you can
go get all of the DVDs from everything

598
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,490
and it's black market, you know, you
don't really go to jail for it. And Kevin,

599
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,690
unless they decide to stay. Yeah.
You don't get no money from it.

600
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,550
I saw every last one of my movies
there. Yeah. All of them I saw,

601
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,850
not easily broken there.
Right. Okay. That movie,

602
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:34,750
I don't even think did 700 theaters
here, but it was in China. Yeah.

603
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,030
So, you know, I don't understand
that. True. It's not true.

604
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,600
It's just that you have to spend
money to make money. You know, if you,

605
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,830
I have a personality,

606
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:48,240
I know I sell over there because empire
took me over there and I was in a room,

607
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,560
1500 standing room only.
They didn't call me cookie.

608
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:56,490
They call me Taraji Henson is,
was in Paris.

609
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,110
And I,

610
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,950
they didn't know I was in the audience
and lead Angela sitting on this on the

611
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:04,510
stage. And they, um, they
said they, they asked,

612
00:37:04,511 --> 00:37:07,170
started asking a lot of cookie
question and he's, and he said, well,

613
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:08,820
why don't you ask her?
She's here.

614
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,810
When I stood up the entire room
stood up and started applauding.

615
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,770
I cry because I cry
because they lied to me.

616
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,520
I haven't been new China. Tell me,
these people just met me during empire.

617
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,040
So then we finish the Q and a.
I go outside,

618
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:26,610
they are coming up to me with every jacket
of all the movies that I had done it

619
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,450
right.
I was so in my feelings that entire trip,

620
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,220
that's our next battle.
That's our next time to prove that,

621
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:38,170
that we do so in international
markets that that is the
next battle. And, and, and,

622
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,530
and you know the thing about it,
of what you have to understand about this,

623
00:37:41,531 --> 00:37:44,320
this is, I really do not
believe that this is the racism.

624
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,200
I really do not believe that. What
I believe is, as you just said,

625
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,210
you spend money to make money and,

626
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,020
and somebody has to make the initial
investment in going over there.

627
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,260
Will Smith was brilliant when he took me
over a, he was doing seven pounds. He,

628
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:00,190
I was like, I want to break it and
break in over there. Said, come, come,

629
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:02,410
let me explain something to you.
So we went to [inaudible],

630
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:06,010
I went to seven territories with him
and watched how he worked at and he had,

631
00:38:06,011 --> 00:38:08,740
but he had a a way in from, from, uh,

632
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,730
wrap and fresh prince so long
before. So, so it's, it's,

633
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,200
it's just we're getting there. It's a slow
thing. It's a fight. But we've got to,

634
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,210
we've got to convince more
people to spend the money. Yeah.

635
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,710
Just what if it fails,
I'll lose my job.

636
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,640
But somebody has to have the balls to
take a chance to take a leap of faith

637
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:31,430
because it's going to blow. Like it'll
happen if you just take a chance. Right.

638
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,720
If somebody just takes a chance on me

639
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:42,490
next week,

640
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:51,890
Rajiv, thank you so much for
coming. And um, your role in empire.

641
00:38:51,891 --> 00:38:54,590
Like I mean I've started watching the
beginning of me of my husband love,

642
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:55,820
we have to be a part of this week.

643
00:38:55,821 --> 00:39:00,470
This is just so powerful to see just all
these different emotions in this depth,

644
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,150
in this character that,
you know,

645
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:05,360
growing up like there was a few
examples but now it's just overwhelming.

646
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:07,380
It's so amazing. What the choice. Um,

647
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:11,210
but you guys mentioned something like
this lie of like not being able to sell.

648
00:39:11,211 --> 00:39:14,420
And I think back to the point
you made about payment, right?

649
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:18,620
Like how you know the statistics black
women and like it next women are making

650
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:23,300
so much less. And what are your thoughts
on the transparency around that?

651
00:39:23,301 --> 00:39:25,640
Cause you just mentioned that you
got a quote in the beginning and the

652
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:29,450
transparency on being able to say there
are people who are willing to pay me for

653
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:32,360
what I'm worth, so I don't need
to accept that from someone else.

654
00:39:32,361 --> 00:39:33,440
How do we change that?

655
00:39:33,441 --> 00:39:36,990
Like with more transparency around
people who are doing it. Right. Okay.

656
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,450
Well I tell you what's changing in
the industry right now. You can't big,

657
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,980
they don't go off quotes anymore, which
is great. So at whatever, whatever,

658
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:46,540
whatever, a movie or are you off like
before you can call it a page and a goal.

659
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:50,030
Okay. What's a quote? Oh she
made this amount of money
on the last movie, So, okay,

660
00:39:50,031 --> 00:39:53,480
so, so you, I'm going
to offer that now with,

661
00:39:53,481 --> 00:39:58,481
with everything that's happening with
equality and inclusion and diversity,

662
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:02,900
the, the industry standard is you
cannot ask what someone's quote is,

663
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,820
which is,
which is a good thing.

664
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:07,730
And a lot of ways it's slowing down a
lot of the negotiations because people

665
00:40:07,731 --> 00:40:11,330
don't know what to ask. So what did what
to offer. So they're starting really,

666
00:40:11,331 --> 00:40:14,150
really low now. But, but it also sets,

667
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,020
it erases that moment of I'm going to
pay you based on what your lasting was as

668
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:20,420
opposed to I'm going to pay
you off on where you are now.

669
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,800
What's your worth is
and what you're doing.

670
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,300
Okay. So the here's where all my
hard work for 20 years come in.

671
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,590
We got,
cause I know one thing I can do,

672
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:35,980
I can open the film, I can get you
what you paid on your film back.

673
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:39,370
I know that much now with the help of
the studio, I can get you even more.

674
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,410
So you gotta pay me now.

675
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,500
That's right. Thank you.
Cause I'm a Black Cup.

676
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,650
Hey, we thought that you guys
are here. Thank you so much.

677
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:58,690
Um, so my question is about your past
history together, working on other films.

678
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:01,210
Um, so which one was your
favorite that you guys did?

679
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:02,710
My favorite is the family that prays.

680
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:05,560
So I just wanted to know what your
favorite is and then also what is the

681
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:10,120
difference or your preference between
working together as actors and just acting

682
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:13,930
versus directing. Cause I know you do
both Tyler. So what's your preference?

683
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:14,800
What are the differences?

684
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:17,160
My favorite is this one.
We've done it here and once you see it,

685
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,400
I think you know why?
It's just the level of growth from,

686
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,350
from a family that prays to this.

687
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,890
I'm proud of the level of growth
that I've experienced, but also just,

688
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,620
I love being an eye.
I love acting with her,

689
00:41:28,621 --> 00:41:30,520
but I much rather director because I'm,
I'm,

690
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:35,180
I want to be behind the camera and I'm
leaning toward more and more that way.

691
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,000
Oh, I as time goes on, but,

692
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,600
but working with her on this
with was just, yeah. Yeah.

693
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,090
It's actors enjoy working with them.
It doesn't matter.

694
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,130
Cause if he's been in front of the camera,
not that I'm saying,

695
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,000
he's also directing himself too.
So,

696
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,970
and I, and I can't, when
I'm directing myself,

697
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:56,630
I can't have as much fun as if
I'm just directing the film. So

698
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,000
yeah. Thank you so much. Yeah. Yeah.

699
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,220
I do enjoy you better when
you're just directing.

700
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:07,170
Oh, they just so much for
coming in. This is so fun.

701
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:11,490
So you're talking about I'm all your long
days on set and being really efficient

702
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:12,091
in that time.

703
00:42:12,091 --> 00:42:16,020
So it was just kind of curious like what
are your non negotiables when you first

704
00:42:16,021 --> 00:42:17,340
show up on set first day,

705
00:42:17,341 --> 00:42:21,810
like what do you need there and what kind
of do to rejuvenate yourself and like

706
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,693
reenergize

707
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,340
you want me to go get you a ride
or do you want no kidding. She had,

708
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:33,210
she had a requirement of crab legs.
No, talking down to you, don't you?

709
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,630
I don't require much.
I don't,

710
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,450
I don't mean just crab legs and one
eye rolls or Matt check and see rose.

711
00:42:41,451 --> 00:42:44,280
All your techs, they're all
day long as you get that right.

712
00:42:44,281 --> 00:42:48,310
I don't care what's in the trail, I get
it myself. I know. Right, right. I don't,

713
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,820
I don't have any crazy requirements.
What I asked

714
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,660
just cause, cause I just, I just did
a film recently where, where, um,

715
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:59,800
I ended up paying for a lot of
stuff myself because, because

716
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,660
they didn't want to basically, so, so
eh. And I'm okay with that because I'm,

717
00:43:06,661 --> 00:43:09,520
I'm okay to go and improve myself and
show you what I can bring to the table.

718
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,850
So I don't have all the, I cut a bunch of
crazy requirements. I don't need a lot.

719
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,390
Just I have a bag with my own
stuff in and then we go from there.

720
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:20,060
And then what do you kind of do at the
end of the day to like rejuvenate and

721
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:22,030
like get ready for the next day?
The smoke weed.

722
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:26,430
Oh No, no, no, no. Really, no,

723
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:32,640
no, no. I thought it was a shock for me.

724
00:43:32,641 --> 00:43:36,680
For me. I know you don't want
those elite shot, is that
right? No, no, no. I've never,

725
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:39,620
I've never done, I've never done
drugs, but I do have trouble.

726
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,330
I do have trouble sleeping.

727
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,940
So, um, so what I, what I,

728
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,600
what I started doing was
having some buckets and then
I realized this could be a

729
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:51,020
problem if you keep doing this. So right
now what I'm trying to train myself,

730
00:43:51,021 --> 00:43:54,860
he has to let them calm my mind
down enough to go to sleep without,

731
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:58,460
without anything. But I did try. We drink
once this a friend of mine, she said,

732
00:43:58,461 --> 00:44:00,860
you've got to take, try this to help
you sleep. Because she had stayed.

733
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,040
She had tried ambien and that she would,
and this was working, this was perfect.

734
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,370
This will help you sleep. So I'm like,
okay. I tried it, took a shot of it,

735
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,110
didn't nothing happened.
Next night. She said,

736
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:10,460
well take two and nothing happened next.

737
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:12,200
I just didn't take three
because you're a big guy.

738
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:15,350
Maybe say start took three shots at
that. We'd drink. It was a pink lemonade.

739
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:16,873
Do my legs,

740
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,790
my leg started growing. I
couldn't open. I couldn't,

741
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:24,890
I was trying to pull my mouth open.
It wouldn't open.

742
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:28,370
Then she facetimed me and I was
hiding behind the camera for that.

743
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,260
God,

744
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,980
if you get me out of this,
I will never

745
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,720
ever touch this weed stuff again
in my life. So what owl? I relaxed.

746
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:41,580
I just lay there until I fall asleep.
Let last question.

747
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,790
We've got to go. Sorry. Nope, we're, we've
talked to about it was the last question.

748
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:49,410
Sorry. We have, we can't, we
can't let it go real quick.

749
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:50,723
Okay.

750
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,150
Questioning Kinda changed,
right?

751
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,070
You have, what can I can, I can, okay.

752
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,890
All right. So first off, thank you all
for coming. Uh, that ain't no question.

753
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,900
No, I am really quick. I
just want you to be thankful,

754
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:12,620
be thankful. So a two part
question, really fast one. Uh,

755
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,730
like although I know I look like Ryan
Coogler I am not as talented as he.

756
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,140
So are you going to have any or do you
plan to open up and actually start having

757
00:45:21,141 --> 00:45:25,070
some screenwriting classes or things of
that nature that we can maybe attend if

758
00:45:25,071 --> 00:45:27,620
we want to start getting
into your industry.

759
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:31,700
And then the second thing is I do you
have any plans to come to Broadway so that

760
00:45:31,701 --> 00:45:35,640
we can increase the amount of black
faces that we see there as well?

761
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:37,820
I think,
yeah,

762
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:42,020
I'm definitely going to a
startup incubators where we
have system where we have

763
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,590
talent once the studio is completely
finished being built where we bring talent

764
00:45:45,591 --> 00:45:48,980
in from all over the places,
writers, directors, producers.
Cause cause you know,

765
00:45:48,981 --> 00:45:53,240
I'm 48 and, and I'm going to start slowing
down. So I'm looking for the next wave.

766
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,690
So definitely, definitely going to
do that. And as far as Broadway goes,

767
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,390
I'm thinking about working on
a one man show and finally,

768
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:02,250
finally taken on Broadway. So I'm,
I'm, I'm thinking about doing that.

769
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,560
Why would first, so come see my
one woman show first and then,

770
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:11,970
okay, great. Great. All right, cut.

771
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:12,950
Um,

772
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:17,950
well my question originally changed
cause you went to your extracurricular

773
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,450
activities. No, I'm just
putting it, what's it called?

774
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,190
I was going to say like, do you,
what's your favorite, but anyways,

775
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,460
oh that's a good question.
Is for lyric, right?

776
00:46:28,461 --> 00:46:32,690
I kind of wanted it to bring the attention
onto you, so I liked what you did,

777
00:46:32,691 --> 00:46:36,980
what she's got to have it. I was hoping
that a little Nola was going to pick you,

778
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,000
but uh, it happens. How do you,

779
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,480
how do you like playing
the love triangle role?

780
00:46:44,481 --> 00:46:48,550
Like I feel like you're always
involved with like multiple people.

781
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,980
Let me ask you,
what's your personal life

782
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:01,000
and your
answer?

783
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:02,483
That's it.

784
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,910
I did not mean to put you on blast.

785
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,160
I don't mind playing those characters
because they're real characters, right?

786
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:18,960
People could relate to them. Um, I
like, I like real, I like raw, like,

787
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,800
you know,
moments where is it?

788
00:47:21,801 --> 00:47:25,430
It takes over and it's not you
being cerebral about it. So, uh,

789
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,100
like to you said earlier, if I'm not,
if I'm not scared or nervous about,

790
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:33,640
then something's wrong.
So I like when I'm nervous and scared and,

791
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:37,000
and I'm entering a new
territory I know nothing about,

792
00:47:37,001 --> 00:47:40,310
which is why I had a lot of fun
working in this environment. Um,

793
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,740
cause it was really scary. And um, it
is because as an actor you want to,

794
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:47,890
you want it, you want to be
professionally. You want to
know that your abilities,

795
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:52,210
Eh, you know, you, you have the ability to
get the job done. And when you're there,

796
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,890
each night you talk about winding down. I
couldn't because I'm thinking, God, what,

797
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:02,350
what, what happened today?
You know, there's a lot of
this movie, I don't remember.

798
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:06,160
No, no, no, no, that's
real. Because like he said,

799
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:09,970
we were filming 15 pages a day
and I've not done that before.

800
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,810
I've not done that before. So a,
you know, a lot of these interviews,

801
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:19,250
it's not because I'm super quiet,
it's, I just don't remember stuff. So,

802
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:24,340
um, so when I hear them talk, I then I
wrote, I'm like, Oh yeah, I remember that.

803
00:48:24,341 --> 00:48:28,180
It's like, it's jogging my memory
and I it, but it felt right.

804
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:33,400
It felt right and there was never a time
when I was really questioning, you know,

805
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:37,450
if we're getting it because the child
was saying, you know, Todd was saying,

806
00:48:37,451 --> 00:48:40,180
we got it. We got it. And, um,
they're saying that I'm not answering.

807
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:41,063
No,
but

808
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:50,040
he's happily, happily married. We got to
wrap up. Yeah, exactly. The last question.

809
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:55,330
He's happily married. He's
happily married UCI, he ran off.

810
00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:00,420
Thanks so much for coming. Um, Tyler,
love you forever. So many great movies.

811
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,780
Teraji 11th grade. I love
you Jody. That was, it.

812
00:49:03,781 --> 00:49:08,250
Took me home love lyric in
Jamaica, Kingston. Born and bred.

813
00:49:08,251 --> 00:49:11,310
Respect. Um, really quick question.

814
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,670
I just wanted to know what were you
guys next big project that you'd like to

815
00:49:14,671 --> 00:49:15,900
work on?
Are you already working on now?

816
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:22,040
Well, I'm working on, um,
uh, uh, what men want.

817
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,400
What does a remake of what women want
that Mel Gibson did with Helen Hunt?

818
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,403
Yeah.

819
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,080
Good ladies we get to hit with mainly.
Okay.

820
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,060
But that's coming out after mine comes

821
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,370

822
00:49:40,371 --> 00:49:43,470
And because you were promoted

823
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,230
and won't be Goldberg is doing the castle.
Oh, she might be joining my movie too.

824
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,660
Okay.
And layer it up.

825

coming out called Natalie ever after.

826
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,233
Oh.

827
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:04,440
Uh, again, um, you know, it's full
of women. I like when women. Okay.

828
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:09,360
Yes. Represent, represent females. What
are you doing? He didn't say courts.

829
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,880
I was going to say, it says, it
says wrap it up him around. Okay.
