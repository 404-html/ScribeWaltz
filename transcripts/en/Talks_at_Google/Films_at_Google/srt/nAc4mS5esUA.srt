1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,360
Hi, I'm [inaudible] from Texas. I Google,

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,490
I'm very happy to welcome Kate Mckinnon
and Mila Kunis for the spy who dumped me?

3
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,050
No.

4
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,320
Oh,
welcome to Google.

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,520
Thank you. Oh, how are you
reaching the floor? If I sit back,

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,620
are we all going to sit like
that? Okay. There we go. Wow.

7
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,480
Yeah.

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,640
Wow. You all left your desk. I'm
sorry. You're right. You're right. Oh,

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,723
you're a lady.

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,560
Okay. Okay. Oh, okay.

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,290
Oh Wow. My voice travels. It's fine.

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,130
Thank you. Okay, so thanks for
being here. I can't see Kate.

13
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:09,850
Mila. Well, other ways I look like this
cause I'm sure I know it. It's okay.

14
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,910
Okay,
so we got to see the trailer,

15
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:18,580
but can you tell us a little
bit about the movie just so they

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,880
okay. I can. Okay. Um,
it's two regular gal,

17
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:27,810
best friends who become embroiled in an
international espionage adventure for

18
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,480
which they're not prepared.
It's a good one liner.

19
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,233
Great.

20
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,243
Yeah, that's it. Yeah,

21
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,443
that's it.

22
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,980
Chaos ensues. High. Jinks
ensues. Hilarity and shoes. Um,

23
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,800
shoes and shoes issues.
Yeah,

24
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,960
that's true. I did. I saw it
yesterday. They're not lying. Um, okay.

25
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:50,961
So the movie does a pretty good job of
showcasing female characters that are

26
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:55,350
allowed to be human, which is awesome
because you don't want, right.

27
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:58,350
Isn't that great? Because he don't
get to see that a lot in comedy.

28
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:03,270
So it's really nice. Yes. Yes,

29
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:07,260
you're correct. Yes. Yes.
Thank you. Um, so, uh,

30
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:11,130
this is especially nice to see in comedy.
Is that what drew you guys to the part?

31
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,880
Um, is that kind of what you were thinking
about throughout the filming of this

32
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:15,714
movie?

33
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,130
Yes. I mean, I, yeah, no
it did. I um, I wasn't,

34
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,820
I do one film a year cause I have kids
and family and so it limits the amount of

35
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:28,690
work that I can do out of town.
I was working on a different film.

36
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,730
This project came along.
I was like,

37
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:33,490
I can't do it cause it would take me
out for six months and would uproot my

38
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:36,010
whole family. They're like,
yes, but Kate Mckinnon's in it.

39
00:02:36,011 --> 00:02:39,370
And I was like l so I,

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,820
I read the script and then, um, yeah.

41
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:45,903
Uh,

42
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,830
and what honestly drew me to it was the
relationship between two best friends

43
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,160
being incredibly grounded, incredibly
genuine. Kate talks about this a lot,

44
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:59,080
but in so many spy movies,
the two characters have a fight.

45
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,540
And that's a catalyst for like,
they have a fight and you're like,

46
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:05,100
but will they ever get back together
and solve the world's problems? Right?

47
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,180
So we don't have that. Like women or
people in real life don't always fight.

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,630
And so, you know, having that resolved
doesn't always resolve other issues.

49
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:17,350
So I really was drawn to the fact that
our characters were simply friends on a

50
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:19,630
crazy journey together.
Yeah.

51
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:24,160
So I uprooted the whole family for six
months for that. So clearly, I too,

52
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,770
I'm kind, I am so flattered
that you did sweetie pie,

53
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:30,610
because that's time with you.
Thank you.

54
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,170
No, no, no. You guys. No. Like, you know,

55
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,490
in a romantic comedy, in
the best ones, right? You,

56
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,030
you love to watch their
sparkling banter and rapport.

57
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:51,500
It's fun to watch two people on screen
who liked to talk to each other,

58
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:55,610
who get each other,
whoever rhythm what we have out of rhythm.

59
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,620
Yes. And so to watch a
friendship that has that,

60
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,700
and it's genuine and I
daresay in real life as well.

61
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:07,800
Okay.

62
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,670
It's just a joy to watch people
who take delight in each other.

63
00:04:11,671 --> 00:04:13,410
And that's what really drew me to this.

64
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,300
And it felt so real and like my
relationship with my best friend.

65
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:23,310
And what would happen if we really got
sucked into an international espionage

66
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:28,050
adventure for which we were not
prepared. Yes, correct. Yeah,

67
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,450
but so that's what I loved about the movie
the most, is seeing a real friendship,

68
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,200
especially between two women where they
raise each other up and they're not,

69
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,501
you know,

70
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:40,760
the stereotypical like bad eighties
movie where they're like being mean.

71
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:43,220
Girls like that was really great to see.

72
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:46,490
So you guys actually didn't know
each other before the film, right?

73
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,990
But became friends during it.

74
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,460
So can you describe each
other in three words?

75
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,900
SMART,
funny,

76
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,050
inspirational it up.
Be Nice.

77
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,120
Can I use the same ones? I'm sorry.
Those are the ones I would use for you.

78
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,730
And May I add

79
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,770
sparkling five basis
entrepreneurial spirit.

80
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,300
Yes. Nice. Okay.

81
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:28,130
Honestly, your entrepreneurial spirit in
addition to your creative genius is very

82
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:29,830
inspiring.
Wow.

83
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,130
Lots of love going on here. That's
great. Okay, so in the movie,

84
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,180
the characters try to pick out
the worst song out of a Jukebox,

85
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:42,750
which I loved as a music fan.
So what would you pick?

86
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,290
I know so many.
Yeah,

87
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,250
I like Pat's songs and I saw
that pop music. I don't know.

88
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,590
I do. I guys, I'm not that hip.

89
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:59,750
Like it's like I go see indie
bands and silver like and know,

90
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,870
but there's a bad song.
There's a bad song that you like though.

91
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,710
Like I like it's all there.
All the bad songs, no bad,

92
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,930
but none of them stand the test of time.

93
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:12,830
It's not like you go first and I'll
think of a bad song. I don't know,

94
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,740
like Chumba Walmart or something
who let the dogs out. What

95
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,340
is it?
Timeless.

96
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,050
But it is not a good sign and
prescriptive for, for living.

97
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,770
You get knocked down and you have to
get up again. You have to, what is,

98
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:34,520
what other choice do you have?
He drinks a whiskey drink.

99
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:38,060
He drinks of vodka training.
That's Trumbo amber, right? Yes,

100
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,100
you're right. It's very philosophical.
Thank you for bringing that.

101
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:48,101
Now he sings the songs that remind
them of the good times and the songs.

102
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:52,430
There might've been the bad times. I
know of the best. Oh, the lyric. See,

103
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,650
it's about positivity.
Okay.

104
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,960
Can you think of a bathroom?
I know one.

105
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,730
I know one song that I think
is a bad sign. I don't know
the name of it. How's it?

106
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:07,240
Yeah. I don't want to knock the
yard right here. Oh, that's not the,

107
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:08,960
are they usually don't write it anyway,
so you're fine.

108
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,310
Okay. No, no, no.

109
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,730
Okay. But I've only ever heard one song
that I was like, Oh wow, this is a bad,

110
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,090
I like to Shizam that on the radio.
In your car. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, so

111
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,620
the Great Jillian Anderson is in this
movie and it appears that Kate and I have

112
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:39,120
a mutual crush on her because
she's awesome. So a Kate,

113
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:42,210
at one point you dressed up a
scholar from the x files, which is,

114
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,430
yeah. Awesome. And

115
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,230
you also made a video asking
Jillian to call you. Um, it's,

116
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,550
it's, it's viral. I'm
not making this up. Um,

117
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,260
yes I did. Thanks to the magic
of the Internet. Never disappear.

118
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,370
Maybe we can get Google
to erase it. Uh, so

119
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,200
anybody, anyone, anyone raise
their man help me out. No.

120
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,320
Okay. So what's the weirdest
thing a fan has done for you guys?

121
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,950
There's lots of worst stuff.
Have Kate on the Internet than that guys.

122
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:23,090
You can just,
you know,

123
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,720
there's some good performances that you
wouldn't let me see that are online.

124
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,230
Right, right. You know, again,

125
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,810
anyone in this room who would
like to choose to just, you know,

126
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,210
hack the code or whatever, I
can do a little cleanup. Um,

127
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,630
you know, talk to me. I'm
sure I'll be forever grateful.

128
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,693
What was the question?

129
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,990
What's the apparently are here to
delete stuff from the Internet?

130
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,740
I have somebody leading something
for Kate. Listen, I'm on train.

131
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,250
I have lots of requests. What a weird
things we've done for what it was. No,

132
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:01,084
it wasn't.

133
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,620
That was kind of a cool,
I think it was cool,

134
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,910
weird thing you did as a
fan of Jelly. Sure, sure.

135
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,930
So what has been a weird thing
a fan has done for you guys?

136
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,540
Lived in my house. I'm pretty
weird. No Way. Yeah. For Real.

137
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,240
That's it. Pretty good. What do you
mean? Can't just give us a little blurb.

138
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,230
Well,

139
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,210
I going to come to tell the story then
when came in uninvited while I was out of

140
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:26,060
town.
Wow.

141
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,300
And decided to reside well in May used
to be home because this person was a fan

142
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:36,580
of yours. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
It's, I'd say it's pretty weird.

143
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,330
Wasn't just a random squatters, not
like my cousin. No, it wasn't. No. Okay.

144
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,600
Okay. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

145
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,190
Yeah. It's really good. It's
dark and you go, okay. Okay.

146
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,280
Okay, good. That's fine.

147
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,660
Um, for me, you know, Gosh,
no people just do nice things.

148
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:02,600
I got a lot of,
um,

149
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,820
self generated art about my cat,

150
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,030
Nino because people seem to,

151
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,520
maybe they've heard somewhere
that I have a close,

152
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,200
I'm very close relationship with
my cat and I know your cat. Well,

153
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:19,860
you call it unhealthy. I call it
a marriage. I don't know what.

154
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,160
Anyway, I've gotten a lot of
art about Nino and that. I
appreciate it. I love you.

155
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:31,260
They paint, they paint, they
knit, they make tee shirts.

156
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,860
Do they know what your cat looks
like? Oh yeah. Oh really? Google it.

157
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,410
Thank you. I believe we're like in the
headquarters. We're not, you're not,

158
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,590
that's in San Francisco.
But this is close to your clubs.

159
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,340
Like an outpost for that

160
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,260
next question.

161
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,920
Oh, you guys are killing me
already. Okay. And a good way.

162
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,660
So both your characters have
hidden skills in the movie, a,

163
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:11,620
everything from trapeze to video
games, shooting. Are you these things?

164
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:15,130
Do you do it all and you're in your lives?
And more importantly,

165
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:16,600
do you have any hidden skills?

166
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,960
Um, I, I have no hidden skills.

167
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,470
I have.
Okay.

168
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,280
I can make fettuccine.
Is that a hidden skill?

169
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,980
I roll my own pasta. Okay. When I
have time. Yeah. Yeah, that works.

170
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,260
What else?
I played the cello.

171
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,300
Oh, me too. Yeah. Rotting in jail.

172
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,930
Can your cat cow?

173
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,260
Sure. Oh no, he hates
stringed instruments. Oh Gosh.

174
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:56,530
When I pick up that chiller that he runs
to the other room that's not play the

175
00:11:56,921 --> 00:12:00,190
guitar I do. I still, you
musically inclined would be a good,

176
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,360
what's not very hidden.

177
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,750
I feel like people kind of know
you're musically inclined. Yeah.

178
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,640
Can you do like a back who,
yeah, that's a good hidden,

179
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,780
I'm not going to do right now, but no, I
can't do, I can't do a backbend. Can you

180
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,070
make very vulnerable position?
Yeah, I'm going to say no,

181
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:25,970
just some APP, but on the spot. I'm
doing it back then. Great. Okay.

182
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:30,200
So I got a couple more questions for you
guys then. What's happening? Nothing.

183
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,570
I'm just, I'm ready. I'm ready. I see
you're ready. Yes, I see. Yeah. Okay.

184
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,830
So if you weren't acting, what
would you be doing? Carpentry.

185
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,090
10000% carpentry.
Okay.

186
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:50,160
Specifically perhaps cabinet making,
but maybe just um,

187
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,040
general carpentry or
refinishing furniture.

188
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,260
Also quite interested in
plumbing and electric.

189
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,213
Cool.

190
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,600
She's on Hgtv all day.
I love,

191
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,500
I mean to see the fruits,
the physical fruits,

192
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:09,530
the wooden fruits of one's labor after
the day I feel would be very satisfying.

193
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,260
And having refinished a
few pieces of furniture.

194
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,863
Okay.

195
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,220
Feel like I,
um,

196
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,200
I got the ball rolling so that's my
alternate life that I may turn to at some

197
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:27,160
point. We'll see. What have you
made? I just refinished, you know,

198
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:28,480
some cedar chests

199
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,473
and you

200
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,750
okay. You speak as though I have
not, I have no idea. I was like this,

201
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,420
I am aware of this. What, what, what would
I be doing if not this? Yes. Cooking.

202
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,090
Oh, so you're a good cook. Yeah. Nice.
Yeah. What do you like to make everything.

203
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,040
I'm a pretty good cook. Bake everything.
No. Horrible Baker. Oh No, no,

204
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,950
no, no. Like I burned
toast. I don't bake, Cook.

205
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,310
Like I cook really well all
the time. I mean, I can bake,

206
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:04,550
but just not desserts I guess I
should say. Not like a cookie Baker.

207
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,570
I have to say I'm the same. Yeah. You
and I love to cook a lot. I love to cook.

208
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,160
I can't bake a cookie.

209
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:12,300
Like I literally didn't know that
you could buy those premiums. Look,

210
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,980
he's in there like this is, I can't do
it either. I will burn it. Same. Yeah,

211
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,310
I know why Mila. It's because you
don't play by the rules. I don't,

212
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,480
I also don't like recipes.
Maybe neither follow direction.

213
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,050
Who does that make it up?
Feel it? It's like ideas.

214
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,990
It's like recommendations. Yeah. Eh?
Yeah. No. Yeah. No, I'm with it. Okay,

215
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,710
so if you were stuck on a desert island.
Yup. It's one of those questions,

216
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:46,290
but somehow could access only one
John of movies. What would you pick?

217
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,850
Romantic comedies.
Horror.

218
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,320
I hate her. I hate it. You don't watch
any movies? Scary movies. I'm no,

219
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:01,010
like I genuinely get scared and then I
can't sleep. And then my husband's like,

220
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:03,230
this is the biggest mistake ever.
Why did I let you watch it?

221
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:08,030
I'm like a 12 year old. Like I was
the last one you watched. I haven't.

222
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,530
It's the shining. I don't know. I
don't like, I really do get scared.

223
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:16,820
Like I get very emotional and then I
worry if there's a child in it. I'm like,

224
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:21,230
well, where's its mother? Like I get very
uncomfortable very quickly. I like, well,

225
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:24,380
the child usually eats its mother,
so if there's a child in the preview,

226
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,660
I promise you I'm not seeing that movie.
Like I am not kidding you.

227
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:29,450
If they have like a child and the door
opens and it's like, Huh? I'm like, nope,

228
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,080
not happening. You love that.
I find it very relaxing.

229
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,940
What's your favorite scary movie?

230
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,260
Horror movie?
Yeah,

231
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:46,140
the one that really laid me out on my
parent's floor for a week and a half was

232
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:49,650
the original omen with
Gregory Peck. Ooh, very good.

233
00:15:49,651 --> 00:15:53,580
When he goes into that grave,
spoiler alert and finds the dead Jackal.

234
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,120
Ooh,

235
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,670
wow. That's what you want is watch
by yourself on a desert island.

236
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,330
Well,
you and I should not be deserted together,

237
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,410
but did you hear her original answer
was water and that's because she has an

238
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:08,400
entrepreneurial spirit.

239
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,590
She knows what she needs to survive and
she also knows that she can sell it to

240
00:16:13,591 --> 00:16:14,424
the other people.

241
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,560
Right?
Yeah.

242
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,880
For better movies. Yeah. All right, so,

243
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,400
so who or what inspired you
to get into acting and comedy?

244
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,380
Oh, I don't know. I was nine. Kate,
you're, I don't know. Maybe Lucille Ball.

245
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:40,510
Actually I think you, you
know what, maybe Lucille Ball,

246
00:16:40,511 --> 00:16:43,630
cause the first thing I saw when
I came to the states was, um,

247
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,960
was nick at night and I said watching
a lot of that. So it was a lot of,

248
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:50,110
I love Lucy Three's company.
I'm talking about like Mary Tyler Moore,

249
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:55,030
like a lot of old, like 60, 70 shows.
Right. And predating that. And so I think,

250
00:16:55,031 --> 00:17:00,030
um, I would definitely say, uh, probably
inspired by Lucille Ball. Well, cool.

251
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,300
Yeah. Um, uh, for, for me it
was just Saturday night live.

252
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,450
Really just that and Mel Brooks movies,

253
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,890
my house, it was all Melbourne cause
all the time he had no choice. Yeah.

254
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,810
Favorite Mel Brooks movies for both of you
producers,

255
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:24,060
young Frankenstein, young Frankenstein.
Good choice. It's their choice.

256
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,660
Yeah. Yeah. Which one?

257
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

258
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,250
Okay. So, um, last question.
I think we have time from, uh,

259
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:39,390
one question and then we'll open
up the floor to audience questions.

260
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,750
And I'll throw this and be super
awkward about this. What's that?

261
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,830
It's our a microphone that we
throw to the audience to ask.

262
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,590
Neat. Yeah. Yeah.

263
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,150
They come up with a throw a
ball microphones. So cool.

264
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,050
So, um, so what is,

265
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,510
what would be your dream
role as an actress?

266
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,433
Yeah,

267
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,510
surely there are so many,
there are so many

268
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,300
badass women of history
that I would love to inhabit

269
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,860
persona wise and also wig wise.
Um,

270
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,720
I will say that my dream role in musical
theater is Miss Hannigan for a new view

271
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,310
who pries musical theater.
But yeah,

272
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:46,330
I know.
I don't know.

273
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:51,180
I have nothing. Okay. I can make something
up, but I don't, you know, I don't know.

274
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,310
I was the first thing that pops into your
head like a rock star or someone? No,

275
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,940
no.
A vox style.

276
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:02,950
You wouldn't want to play a rockstar like
who anyone like wants to fit everyone.

277
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,960
I mean like [inaudible] anyone,

278
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,980
anyone from Janis Joplin to,

279
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,790
no, I should do,

280
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,050
if you're portraying a rock star,
you should have like at least rhythm.

281
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,290
Can you not sing at all? Well,
I mean, I like to think I can.

282
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,850
Okay. Don't answer that
one. I'll answer for us. No,

283
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,880
I know you love me.
And they know

284
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,590
you're a very supportive friend.
You're very nice.

285
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,240
Why don't you sing no,
and let us [inaudible] guys,

286
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,430
here's the thing.
Don't worry guys.

287
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,440
I do a cartoon called family
guy and for I have Google,

288
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:03,310
wrong audience, wrong audience there
too nerdy. There's, they're like, well,

289
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,110
we don't solve algorithms.
It's like that widow. But um,

290
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,650
for 15 years I've been like,
I'm not seeing it on your show.

291
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,960
Mcfarlane made me sing 15 years ago,

292
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,040
three lines and it took three hours
and I was like, I'm not doing this for

293
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,010
three months ago.

294
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,130
They put me in a recording booth and I
had to sing a whole thing of Oklahoma.

295
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,780
So in a year you will hear meg and this
is by the way, when, if ever you see this,

296
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,630
should you ever want to remember?
That's me trying.

297
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,250
That's me trying to be good.
That's all you need to know.

298
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,970
I don't need to showcase it. Everybody
will see it. It's a family guy.

299
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,930
It's coming soon. Let me singing
Oklahoma the best I can. Keep in mind.

300
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:47,650
Well, I look out for that guy. I
mean guys, it's brilliant. Yeah.

301
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,820
Okay, so who wants to ask
the first question? Nobody.

302
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,750
I'm going to, I'm going to throw this at
you, so I don't hate anyone in the head.

303
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,810
Can you hear me okay? Yes, I
have the question. Familiar.

304
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,070
I've heard tofor and Ashton,

305
00:21:05,071 --> 00:21:07,850
a few people talk about how great
the 70 show it was making that,

306
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:12,710
would you make a movie followup to
that or get back into it in any way?

307
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,330
Yeah, I mean, yeah, it was great. Um,

308
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,880
I feel like I'm too old to
reprise a 16, but, um, would we,

309
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,510
I, yeah, of course. I think
we love it. Plus I met my
husband on the show, so yeah,

310
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,890
I think the show's great.

311
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,063
Yeah.

312
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,640
Another question from me. Do you still
play games to find time for kids?

313
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,040
Sorry, I know I spent, what is it feed?

314
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,540
So it's a 20 to 24,
25.

315
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:48,000
It took up a lot of my life and
I would shoot movies and um,

316
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,040
and you go on break, so you get, it's like
a five minute break in between scenes.

317
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:54,400
And I was like, I gotta go. And it'd
be like on some rate and they're like,

318
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:58,390
well you need to go back to set. And I
was like shy, like I think it literally,

319
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,350
it was just too much. It was unhealthy.
It was just not healthy for me.

320
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,110
Have a question.
Raid

321
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,380
What game weights? You know
what I'm talking about Ray Ray?

322
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,100
Um, like if you do first person
shooter games or any like,

323
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:19,060
like any of those games you
can kind of pop in and out.

324
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:20,950
But if you're doing a
group game where it's,

325
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:23,830
if you're not going through the
story mode, you see what you started,

326
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,760
then you are,
then you are responsible for your group.

327
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,780
And I lot of times it was either
like a healer or whatever.

328
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,720
Long story short that. Okay.
What's the next question?

329
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,590
You do have secret skills.
Wow.

330
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,570
So I have a question about your hidden
talents that you were talking about.

331
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,350
You were saying that you
might take up woodworking.

332
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:51,160
Have you ever happened
to talk to Ron Swanson?

333
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,210
I did an episode of something and
Nick Offerman was there and yeah,

334
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:03,080
we talked about furniture making the
whole time. Wouldn't incredible life.

335
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:08,081
He has married to the eminent
Megan Mullally sitcoms,

336
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:14,560
star Comedians Xtrordinair and it
makes gorgeous pieces with live.

337
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:19,130
Would edges come on?
He does like he does like big tape.

338
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:23,470
Huge beautiful pieces. Yes.

339
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,100
Yeah.

340
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,570
He knows what's good.
What's up?

341
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,370
Oh, I have two questions.
Simple and difficult. One,

342
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:36,190
the difficult one.
Do you use any Google products?

343
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,110
Yeah.

344
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:42,640
The simple one is, since you mentioned
you have some entrepreneurial spirit,

345
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,380
can you suggest any Google products

346
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,020
you brought up that Google should
develop or something like that? Yes. Um,

347
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,290
but he didn't answer. I can answer
this. I do have, um, some, uh,

348
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,010
friends working on,
um,

349
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,980
Kitty Hawk and so the
flying car from Google,

350
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,040
so I can recommend that if you'd like
to buy it, you can contact Dave Clark.

351
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,510
He's selling them. I'm Sebastian is
the one who's working on the product.

352
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:18,630
It's a fantastic product. I Have Nikki
has held on to Vegas to, uh, fly it.

353
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,100
But uh, yeah, I a Hla answer,

354
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,160
I just thought of Shuba yeah,
their stuff.

355
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,540
Okay.
Okay.

356
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,920
She speaks Russian. I, um,

357
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,080
I have an idea. I was just looking
at these plants and I was like,

358
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:39,480
what about Google irrigation?

359
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,850
If one of your plans for you,

360
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,420
it's a self watering,
um, self timing water.

361
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,670
I'll take 10% thanks.

362
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,380
Any others? Oh, here, I'll
go in the middle here. Versus

363
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,090
similar to the question about
what would be your dream role.

364
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,320
Do you have a dream actor that you want
to work with that you haven't worked

365
00:25:16,321 --> 00:25:17,580
with yet?
And this is for both of you.

366
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,750
Okay.

367
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,950
I Love Matt Damon. So, yeah.

368
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,290
Okay.
My husband knows.

369
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:27,800
Okay.

370
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,270
I Love Matt Damon guys. I do, you know,

371
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:33,110
one of my,

372
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,200
one of my comedy heroes of all time is
Catherine O'hara and I've never met her.

373
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:42,350
So with, yes. So next to her was shot.

374
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,960
What did she say?
Nothing,

375
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,190
but I got really excited and it was
on Melrose? In Las? Yeah. Annika.

376
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:52,370
And I was making a left hand
turn and she was in an SUV.

377
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:57,430
I'm next to me and I literally,
I think I went like this. Okay.

378
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,930
I think I just didn't do anything other
than looking at her. I love her. I,

379
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:05,880
that's my story. That's all I
got. That's a minute of your life.

380
00:26:05,881 --> 00:26:08,040
You'll never get back. What?
You guys were in the same car?

381
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,410
No.
No.

382
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,300
I saw her at a yogurt land and I freaked
out the one on Sawtelle and Olympic.

383
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,170
So maybe she hangs out there.

384
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,910
What flavor would be
having a toppings of joy?

385
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:32,010
I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. Okay.

386
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,530
Hello. Okay. So, um, during filming,

387
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,660
did you have any funny moments
that you had between each other?

388
00:26:39,661 --> 00:26:44,640
You spend a lot of time on set, any pranks
or anything fun thing all day? Pranks?

389
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,470
No,
cause we're adults

390
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,150
cause I'm in between
takes that was nursing.

391
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,560
So I would honestly to answer
seriously, it was with my baby. But um,

392
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,880
Paul book the genome

393
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:04,861
and then Kate,

394
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:07,830
we just Chitchat with me and then I would
go into my little hole and pump in her,

395
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:09,980
feed the baby.
Like it was so not that exciting.

396
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,190
I saw lots of bathrooms in,
Oh,

397
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:18,600
everywhere we were everywhere I pumped it
was a bathroom and like a little sheet,

398
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,550
you know. What'd you do? Banana
peels all day. Every day.

399
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:29,790
Yeah. I killed a few people. No,
I'm kidding. No, I don't like,

400
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,040
I don't like practical jokes. I don't
either. That's not true. If, oh,

401
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:38,910
you like pranks I not done to me.
Right,

402
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:42,840
right. No, I liked, I like done
to other people. I'm a hub,

403
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,150
a hub on the whole country,

404
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,130
so I don't feel that I would ever do a
prank just in case something horrible

405
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:53,100
went wrong. Like if you drop a
bucket of water on someone's head,

406
00:27:53,101 --> 00:27:56,430
what's to say that they're not
looking up and they drown in the water

407
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,610
then he got a lawsuit now Paul Book.
Gl.

408
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,120
Sorry. Oh, sorry.

409
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,490
So we got one more question.
Make it a good one.

410
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,690
Shoot. Too much pressure. Oh my goodness.

411
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,240
Okay. Scenes on social media, it's
like going on like super fast.

412
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:30,660
Like nowadays, like in
everything, it's there. Um,

413
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,110
since you're a celebrity and you
said like somebody was in your house,

414
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:38,400
how do you manage that? Like in
your personal life? Like, I dunno,

415
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:39,690
like we shared everything like,
oh,

416
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,210
right here with Mila and
we're having a great time.

417
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,990
And then like a lot of people can't. I
don't know like how to manage though. No,

418
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,650
probably both. I don't
have social media. Oh cool.

419
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,570
Neither does Kate.

420
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:56,620
So that is how we manage social media.
Yeah.

421
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,150
By not having a Google.

422
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,280
So that's that. But to your point, um,

423
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,910
the biggest problem that I have with
people, um, that's a horrible statement.

424
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:10,080
That's not what I meant to say.
Like in,

425
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,620
in like as far as people taking photos
and posting them is when I'm with my kids,

426
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:17,190
I do ask them to post it after I
leave only for security reasons.

427
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:20,160
Why am I just don't post that you're here
with me if my child in the background,

428
00:29:20,161 --> 00:29:24,090
I just don't want that posted like an hour
later to your point. But I don't have,

429
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:25,020
we don't have social media,

430
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,520
but we've heard of this Google when
we hear it's great and you guys have a

431
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:34,080
Google phone, we hear that's
lovely. And uh, you know,

432
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:38,820
other great Google things.
Yay. Eric Schmidt, right
Larry Page. Guys I know words.

433
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,720
I thank you.

434
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,070
I use the search engine
surrogates all the time.

435
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:51,400
Google things. It's like a
verb. We Google then all day.

436
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,260
Um, this nice little girl.
The girl. Describe the,

437
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,030
that the woman standing back there.
I had a question.

438
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,000
Favorite musical guests who spit on
SNL since you've been on the cast?

439
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,710
Good question. My goodness. You know what?

440
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,120
You know what there was this week when,
I don't know if you've heard of Adele.

441
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,630
She came and she was that
week that she also did,

442
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:18,631
she filmed her live concert at Radio
City Music Hall and we all got to go.

443
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:21,850
And that was um,

444
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:27,430
it's the biggest venue in the world.
Maybe that's not correct,

445
00:30:27,431 --> 00:30:31,690
but it sure looks like the base, you know
that I performed a radio city musical.

446
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,090
What did you do?
Finish your story and then I'll tell you

447
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,640
anyway, she did, she
sang her glorious voice,

448
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:44,470
filled the valid hallowed
halls and it was transcendent.

449
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:46,360
What was your story?
Well,

450
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:49,810
cause you were talking about Radio City
Music Hall and at one point Fema Guy,

451
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:53,530
we did live readings all around.
That's why, why parts and yet,

452
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,253
and um,

453
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,900
and so we performed all at different
theaters and we sold out radio city music

454
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:00,580
hall a couple of nights and I was like,
you know what,

455
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,100
if I'm going to stand on
the stage and perform,

456
00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:06,100
I want to put on some tap shoes and then
say I can perform at radio city music

457
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:09,490
hall. So I put it on tap shoes and tap my
way down the stage once. And when look,

458
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,790
I performed at Radio City Music Hall and
that was like my big story that I can

459
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:16,070
tell people now.
Do you?

460
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,900
I want it to say,
but I performed at Radio City Music Hall,

461
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,390
so you can tell him I'm a rock
star in a real spirit, but not,

462
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:29,470
well a failed rockstar
who can't sing or town,

463
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,530
but performing radio city music hall.
That's all the time we have you guys.

464
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:37,120
Thank you so much for joining us.

465
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:43,170
[inaudible] on August
3rd it's really funny.

466
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,800
Thank you everyone for being here.
