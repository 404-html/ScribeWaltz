1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,840
[inaudible]

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,290
I want to welcome all of you all to
Google and to the youtube space. Um,

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,140
I can't imagine that anybody
doesn't know who these people are.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,280
We got Chris Webber, Lisa,
Leslie, Nate Robinson,

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,460
[inaudible]

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,110
4 times Olympian, five times, all
star, three times, slam dunk champion.

7
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:37,830
The list of accomplishments
goes on and on. Next. Nate,

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,450
the only one's ever actually done that.

9
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,910
[inaudible] [inaudible]

10
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,080
um, but we're not talking about a number
of things today. I'm excited to be here.

11
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,280
I'm Nelson voice by the way.

12
00:00:57,281 --> 00:01:01,030
I work at here at Google and I'm thrilled
to have the best seat in the House

13
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:05,500
with these lovely folks up here today.
Um, so everybody knows, I think that, uh,

14
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,100
uncle drew in theaters
nationwide on Friday,

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,760
of which all of these folks are
stars. Uh, it's going to be exciting.

16
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:16,570
I saw the movie last night. It
was incredible, um, in very,

17
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:20,440
very funny and all of your digit thing.
I will tell you that for sure. Um,

18
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,040
just to give you all a little bit of
the premise of the movie. Um, there's a,

19
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:29,890
a gentleman who under
unfortunate circumstances is
unable to feel his team at

20
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:32,230
the Rucker. So for those of
you who don't know Rutgers,

21
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:35,500
a playground tournament up in Harlem,
happens every year. It's incredible.

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,170
A number of historic players
have come out of that. Uh,

23
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,210
but there's one player in particular
played by Kyrie Irving who has the

24
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:47,590
opportunity to go ahead and field a team,
uh,

25
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,330
from the past,
if you will,

26
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,920
to come back and play the
Rucker once again in hopes
of winning the championship.

27
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,380
And that's when all these
folks come into play. Um,

28
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,360
it's based on the character of Uncle Joe.
You all,

29
00:01:58,361 --> 00:02:01,470
some of you may know based on a Pepsi,
uh,

30
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,660
created digital episodic,
uh,

31
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:09,370
that was very popular and ultimately
became a movie, uh, with lion's gate,

32
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:12,190
our friends at lion's gate.
So to that end, uh, you know,

33
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,010
this question is for everyone.
How did this come together? Right?

34
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:17,380
How did it go from kind
of an episodic to a movie?

35
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,820
And did your agents reach out to you
or did you guys actually audition? Uh,

36
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,090
how did it work? Well,
Lisa definitely audition.

37
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,070
I'm gonna let her tell y'all stories.
It's awesome.

38
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,540
Her story is pretty cool tomorrow, but,
uh, I just booked hiree until you told me.

39
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:35,430
Yes. So every, every game that
we had, I played against them.

40
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:38,150
We, you know, he's at the Fredo
mine and I'm like, [inaudible],

41
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,480
so can I be down bugging them every
time you check it in the game, Bro,

42
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:47,460
I'm serious. We're up. So, uh, you know,
then he hit me on Twitter. It was like,

43
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:50,280
were you serious about, you know, being
in a commercial? And I was like, yeah,

44
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:54,270
of course. Of course. And, uh, and
that's, that's how, that's how I'm here.

45
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,690
The origins for next. Okay.
Lisa, what about you? I got it.

46
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,250
My agent called and that they are

47
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,083
doing,

48
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,380
they were shooting for uncle drew and
there was a part for Betty Lou who's

49
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:09,190
played the wife, a preacher and
Chris Webber place preacher.

50
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,460
And he hadn't had the part
that time at that time,

51
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:13,660
but I was going to be the wife.

52
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,250
And Betty Lou obviously has to get
buckets at some point. So, you know,

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,340
I wasn't concerned about
that, but I'm like, okay, so
tell me more about Betty Lou.

54
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:25,420
Betty Lou has to be in her seventies
and I'm like, okay, got it.

55
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,010
So I get off the phone with my agent and
I go out of my closet and I go shopping

56
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,550
a little bit and I came up and I was like,
Babe,

57
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,930
I was telling my husband who
I called Babe. I said, Dave,

58
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:36,220
been harder for me to get this part.

59
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:38,620
I'm going to have to go
in dressed as Betty Lou.

60
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:43,130
Like they have to believe I can
do this. So I went in full, full.

61
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,300
I was Betty Lou when I walked into,
when I got off the elevator,

62
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:48,820
I was bent over hunched.
Hey Baby. Hey y'all don't,

63
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,420
I came in and talking to everybody.
Oh yeah, Betty Lewis here.

64
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,760
And can you just get the producer?

65
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,450
No one showed up because they said
they needed me to come full, please.

66
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,293
You better move.

67
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,030
So I just walked in being Betty Lou.

68
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,450
Oh,
everything with my bible and a Joe.

69
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,260
My agent called and said, I got the
park fiery character in the movie.

70
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,120
And what about to print? And she didn't
tell you about her thought how stock is

71
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,400
going to stop short.

72
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,410
Exactly.
Uh,

73
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:30,820
I got a call and I think that the part
was already cast it and I knew that they

74
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:32,980
were part of it.
And of course I'm big fan of native,

75
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:37,690
don't know Nate and Lisa is probably the
out of all the athletes private acting

76
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:41,550
along this and modeling all
this stuff she did. And so, uh,

77
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,750
I've been in the church my whole life.

78
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,150
He's just going to ask
you about that because

79
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,040
my father is like a deacon in the church.
My mom was a choir director,

80
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,220
someone who kids would get whooped,

81
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:55,360
visiting the church to come back and
have to sit up there and all that stuff.

82
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,150
And so it was, uh, you know,

83
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,040
it wasn't a better role for me than to
be a basketball player, which, you know,

84
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,490
I played basketball and then to emulate
some of the passages I knew growing up.

85
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:06,930
So I tried to take them along
with some great movies. You know,

86
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,390
you know all the other guys that have
done it and hopefully, uh, it's, it's,

87
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,630
you know, when you say it a
good movie, I'm thinking of
the audience. They're like,

88
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:14,680
yeah, right. Because that's,

89
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,480
I think we all knew it had the
potential to be Super Corny, super bad,

90
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,920
terrible.
And uh,

91
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,280
know the answer to that get,

92
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,790
what did I get to keep my brand reel?

93
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,910
The script was funny
when I read the script,

94
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:40,930
I was laughing out loud and I was like,
you know what, this is going to be funny.

95
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:44,140
So in the movie or at night, it was good
that it came up like that. Now, I mean,

96
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,950
I had the benefit of being
at the premiere and you,

97
00:05:45,951 --> 00:05:48,090
you brought a little extra something
to it. I will tell you that, oh,

98
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,970
I'm not going to give it away,

99
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:51,580
but there's a scene in the church
that you all will remember free.

100
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,663
Amen.

101
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,980
So a little bit more about the movie,
right? I mean, I think the kind of

102
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,010
underlying foundation about what's
there is the pure love for basketball.

103
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,770
Um, can you share with the, with the
audience and the folks here today,

104
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,560
the moment that you fell
in love with the game?

105
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,280
Well, you know, I didn't fall
in love with the game initially.

106
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:18,200
I was not as sporty girl.

107
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,130
I was really more into like I
don't want to get hurt. My cousins,

108
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,580
I had two amazing, I have amazing
girl cousins who were like tough.

109
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,781
I mean they're running,

110
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:29,300
they're kicking butt and they're playing
football with the boys and I was on the

111
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:33,190
side like, do you guys need water?
Like how is this not really,

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,080
really know this is true story.
I mean I was the cry baby of the family.

113
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:43,060
Like I'm not, I wasn't really tough.
But basketball for me really found me.

114
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:46,390
I think it was more my destiny because
I started playing in the seventh grade

115
00:06:46,391 --> 00:06:49,150
and I only played basketball because there
was a girl who was in the ninth grade

116
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:51,910
who was so popular. I'm like,
why does everybody know her?

117
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,270
And her name was Shay and she was on the
basketball team and at that I want to

118
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:58,720
be popular. Hmm. So I'm
going to play basketball,

119
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:01,630
but I had one rule. If
I fall down, I'm done.

120
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,850
Thank God I did not fall down. Our team
went seven and Oh, I won my first trophy.

121
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:10,600
Smaller than this cup. No lie. And that
show you have a say you get a trophy.

122
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,180
I fell in love with, I got the
trophy, the trophy to gold medal.

123
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,280
I mean the fact that you,
that was it.

124
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,750
And I really fell in love it and I put
in so much work and I realized that it

125
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:27,180
would open up doors.
I could get scholarship to college.

126
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:32,070
My mom was not going to be able to
afford a division one school. Um,

127
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,970
and so then it started to make sense
having good grades and playing basketball.

128
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:40,660
I was really in education. Very nerdy. I
know. Then look like it. No, just good.

129
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,230
I was really into school.
I really loved school,

130
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,480
but basketball just opened so many doors
that I had to stick with it. Beautiful.

131
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,780
Beautiful. And that is your
championship writing, is it not?

132
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,830
What's this one is not.
Okay.

133
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,970
This one is my top 20 w NBA players.
Of all time.

134
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,340
[inaudible]

135
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,960
on top of all that to the
other ones are too healthy.

136
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,580
Nate, what about you? When did you
fall in love with the money from me?

137
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:15,310
I was brainwashed at a young
age man watching Michael Jordan.

138
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,260
I mean that's as a kid, you know, that's
all you saw on TV for the most part.

139
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,590
Uh, you know, it was watching guys
like that that helped me, you know,

140
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,110
believe that, you know, there is a way
for me, a little guy from Seattle to,

141
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,740
you know, make it to the league and I was
just, I'm, I'm, I'm a different animal.

142
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:36,670
I would just hungry as a young
kid, 10 years old. I just,

143
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,360
I just knew what I wanted to do.
Yeah.

144
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,830
Since that day and after that
I just never looked back. Yeah.

145
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:45,400
You were still hungry, man. Yes. As
you want a mix. I'm a diehard fans.

146
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,540
We can use it. And what about you, Chris?

147
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,980
And he was killing when he was
on the Knicks to, first of all,

148
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:54,430
it made be a real humble too, because
he could gone to a pro in football.

149
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,070
That's why I want to stand up.
Cause

150
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,360
I think basketball shows you,
it's not about your size,
but it's about your heart.

151
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,370
You look at AI as small athlete.

152
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,120
One of the nicest killers I've ever
known in the game. And these guys,

153
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:08,190
one of the best athletes
the League has ever seen.

154
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:11,690
I mean he's won three
dunk contest or great, uh,

155
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,070
DB and could have gone to the league.
So he,

156
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:17,850
he definitely was a different animal
for me. I wanted to play football,

157
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,340
I wanted to, that's what I want
it to be a football player.

158
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:23,460
And I fell in love playing
sports in the street. You know,

159
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:28,050
like we had a neighborhood that had
a bunch of kids. So, uh, you know,

160
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:32,100
in the summertime it was on two square
running basis, like playing games.

161
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:33,840
And so I just fell in love with sports.

162
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:37,230
I just fell in love with friends
and competition, that camaraderie.

163
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:42,070
And I've been this height since ninth
grade. So yeah, my body told me like,

164
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,520
you do this, don't go over
there and football, are they
going to break away? So,

165
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,360
you know, it came natural, but I
always want it to be an athlete.

166
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,990
That's awesome. I didn't,
didn't seem try out for Seattle.

167
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,330
I tried out for to see how yeah,
they gave me a little,

168
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,250
I wouldn't call it a semi semi.
Yeah, it was pretty cool. You know,

169
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:00,840
I got to work out in
front of Pete Carroll,

170
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,380
the owners and a Russell Wilson was there.
That was pretty cool.

171
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:08,610
He gave me a football, signed the football
for me. So yeah, I'm more of a, um,

172
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,900
I'm more of a fan a lot of the time. Like
I get, I get geeked out scene, you know,

173
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:17,700
different athletes. Pretty cool. Good
stuff. Speaking of players, right,

174
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,310
as you guys were,
as the movie came together,

175
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,410
were there any other NBA
or w NBA players that, uh,

176
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,130
you know,

177
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,210
tried to maybe join the cast that didn't
work out or what would you have liked

178
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:32,720
to have seen in the movie?
Uh,

179
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,250
you mean as in take our spots?

180
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,790
No, not in taking your spots. No, there,

181
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,930
there weren't any other players.
We played against other players,

182
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:44,910
but there weren't a,
other than,

183
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,960
I think Gordon was the only other NBA
player. Right? Yeah, yeah. That was it.

184
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,930
So assuming there's a sequel
and I hope there would be one,

185
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,720
who would you want to see join
you all in the movie? Well,

186
00:10:56,721 --> 00:11:00,330
Kevin Duran was at the premier.
Yeah.

187
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,340
And I told them after the move,
because before I was like,

188
00:11:03,341 --> 00:11:06,490
I know what you're thinking. I was like,
it's not going to be corn. He trusts me.

189
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:09,820
He was like, all right. And then after
he was like, Oh man, I love it. I'm in,

190
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,960
I'm in part two. I was like, I don't tell
me bye. I'll be your agent. I want to go.

191
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,340
Who are you? But, uh, you know, it would
be fun to have Kevin Duran. I mean,

192
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,410
to dress up, you know, we're all 70 years
old plus in this movie. So, you know,

193
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:25,980
to dress up and have some older guys,
it, it, it'll be fun. Definitely.

194
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:30,240
But I think our crew, the fact
that we were all athletes,
the fact that, you know,

195
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:33,960
we're used to being vulnerable,
we used to working hard.

196
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:38,130
We used to ask him for help,
um, that, that really made
it a collaborative effort.

197
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,780
The fact we didn't want
to let each other down.

198
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:43,230
I didn't want to let Betty Lou down
and boots didn't want to let us down.

199
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,480
And so it was uh,
it was really unique.

200
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:48,600
They say when you retired you missed
the locker room and not the games.

201
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:49,500
And I think that's true.

202
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:54,040
And I got the locker room with these guys
and know it was, I feel sorry for our

203
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,220
director Charles Stone, cause I'm sure
it was like a professor teaching a

204
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,360
uh,
uh,

205
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,300
a kindergarten class cause we were
having fun every second, every second.

206
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:04,901
All right,
let's hurry up.

207
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:08,590
Take the take an after that he would pull
out a backpack with music and all the

208
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:12,250
extras, it'd be dancing. He's like, oh
no. Slow down. It's not. But we have fun.

209
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:14,230
Definitely set the whole,
the time.

210
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,880
So you mentioned two things. I want
to talk about a little bit more. Uh,

211
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,090
so the makeup, oh man. Talk a
little bit about that. Cause I mean,

212
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:26,620
it was full on transformation
for all of them. I kind of, uh,

213
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,930
for the first time I called
my mom, I'm like, mom,

214
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:32,740
I'm sorry for mega funny you for
Phnom Maaco for hours. It sucked.

215
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,480
Like literally is sitting there hours
doing the makeup. I'm like, man,

216
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:42,160
so this is what takes women's soul.
Tell my girl like I feel you.

217
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:46,120
So, uh, it was, it was tough. A little
difficult for hours for my makeup,

218
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,270
cause he know he had to cover all the
tattoos and stuff for me. But it was,

219
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,380
it was,
it was still fun.

220
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:54,010
Once I got the four hours out of the way
and [inaudible] care of there, I'm like,

221
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:58,930
yeah, when, when do we start?
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, it was
long for me. Same experience.

222
00:12:59,460 --> 00:12:59,791
Yeah.

223
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:04,620
And women were a little bit
more accustomed to being
in a chair and not quite

224
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:06,390
two and a half to three hours.

225
00:13:06,391 --> 00:13:09,990
So to get ready to be Betty Lou
and have the prosthetics put on.

226
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,400
I tried to think of it as
being in the spa, you know,

227
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,470
Tom down
Sunday.

228
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,060
And I would put my headsets on the
wireless ones and take it behind my neck.

229
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,870
And then I watched insecure and game
of Thrones. So this was last August.

230
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,490
So you know, I have to
finish up the season. Right.

231
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,530
So I just watch that every day until
I had to have my eyes shut. And then,

232
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,540
you know, I was good. The heart,

233
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,600
I think the hardest part is probably
taken it off cause I'm like yeah cause we

234
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:43,860
had to wear wigs. Well yeah we all have
wigs also. You know, I'm like listen,

235
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:47,160
edges are really important. I mean
I'm like listen, cause they, you know,

236
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:49,680
they want to put blue.
I'm like, okay listen,

237
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,400
this is a movie but I need you to just
pin this down and pin this down and Betty

238
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,200
Lou will be fine. Uh, so,

239
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:59,040
but the takeoff is a little strenuous
because they have to basically exfoliate

240
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,610
your face. Oh Wow. Yeah. And that's
scrubbing it. And I'm like, listen,

241
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,510
we need to look good.
Chris had some little bit of rehash.

242
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,500
Actually I think you had
the biggest struggle.

243
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,590
I felt like I was getting burned with
acid base is like I'm trying to me like

244
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:17,040
I'm burning and it really hurts
and my neck is coming off.

245
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,750
But it was three hours and uh,

246
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,510
weren't used to the makeup chair and
still that switch him to my face cream

247
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:27,160
actually. And this was an every day.
Some beauty lessons every day. Yeah.

248
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,370
Like you guys have to moisturize boys,
you need to moisturize.

249
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,450
I didn't even know what does that mean?

250
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:36,980
Where like when you leave here you
need to the cream on and I come back,

251
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:40,700
you know, fresh face because
I've got a book and they're like,

252
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:44,010
you don't have any irritation. I'm like,
no guys, you'd have to moisturize it.

253
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,330
So important for your life.
Rhodan and fields guys look me up.

254
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,970
Green juice, word makeups
coaches right now. Healthy

255
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,590
makeup coats.
We had a green juice every morning.

256
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,470
We do manage Kale, blueberry,
Lisa Cobb was, you know,

257
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:01,580
and thanks for keeping.
I'm the mom.

258
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,030
And you also mentioned the fund that
you all had on set and the dancing, um,

259
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,710
I'm not going to give
the whole thing away,

260
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:13,540
but there is a dance battle in this movie
and I just wanted to kind of get the

261
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:17,110
real, get the real school. So,
so who's got the most skills?

262
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,880
Nae [inaudible] me,

263
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,170
I just couldn't wait to
start the deadline. May,

264
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,260
can we hurry this up like this is, this
is my thing right here. Like the music,

265
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,960
the fun it was,
it was for,

266
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,540
who surprised me most was Reggie Miller
because he couldn't dance a lick and he

267
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:36,250
would, he got out, he got out there,
really show what he can do it. Reggie,

268
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,450
we were currently practicing
at our lunchtime there.

269
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,690
But the funny thing here,

270
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,080
the funny thing is during lunch
we are literally in our makeup,

271
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,080
but we can't take our,
our makeup off.

272
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:51,430
So we're literally having conversations
like this. But it was like funny. I was,

273
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,860
I was telling us, he was like, Bro, this
is funny. You got to tell an MBA story.

274
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:55,251
I mean,

275
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:58,460
I remember when I used to dunk on shack
and I'm looking at him when you look

276
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,600
like a real pretty sure Chris around
you're looking at, you know, it was,

277
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,620
it was pretty cool. Just the whole
dancing and getting Reggie, you know,

278
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,430
ready to dance with zero money. He was
nervous the whole time. My gorgeous.

279
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:13,750
Just enjoy yourself. I said just
you're in a mess. You're good.

280
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,640
Nobody even knows to do your days.
But he did a great job.

281
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:18,340
So you put them through a clinic?
Yeah.

282
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,840
How do you get them right ready
to go to weddings and stuff.

283
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,360
He was socially awkward. Like you
don't want it here. If I hit you with a

284
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,360
back strain.
Has Anybody at a party,

285
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,960
what have you,

286
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,920
Nate dance class 101 too funny.
Um,

287
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,700
in terms of anxiety and all of you
have done some level of acting, right?

288
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,110
First pro game or first day on the set.

289
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,230
Which one was more nerve wracking
first program? Yeah, for sure. For me.

290
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,100
Yeah.
First pro game for sure.

291
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,120
At least you get a second take and you
can mess up your check in the Cayman

292
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,470
Lodge and why your first game you, you're
done, you're gonna get embarrassed,

293
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,760
period. That's what is
going to be. So yeah,

294
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,730
I'd much rather do that
then in the first game.

295
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,070
I hear that, I hear that. So we'll,

296
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:14,870
we'll pivot away from the movie for a
second and talk a little bit more about

297
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:19,100
kind of a career and
life stuff, right. Um,

298
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,480
what was the most challenging time in
your career and how did you overcome it?

299
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,150
Oh Wow.
And use this

300
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,470
dag deep. Huh? Most challenging
time? Probably I would, my

301
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,940
career was when I was at USC,
um, as a college student.

302
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,570
And I would say it was challenging because
I went to USC and it's a school that

303
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:48,130
is a private school that students are
known to be a little bit wealthier than

304
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:48,964
the average.

305
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,040
And so I remember there being times where
I didn't have like a lot of money as a

306
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:56,640
student athlete and you know, like you'll
have five bucks and you're like, okay,

307
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:00,450
I'm an order a Burrito, cut it in half.
And he this half at this point and he,

308
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,020
this happened the other time.
There were times where I remember that,

309
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:08,220
but I also remember thinking like, this
is not the way it's always going to be.

310
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,640
Right. But I really, I wouldn't
say I enjoy my struggle,

311
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:15,160
but I understood when I was in moments
when I didn't have that, you know,

312
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:18,750
it was up to me to figure out
ways and to find a way to make it,

313
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,250
and it wasn't my mom's job. You
know, once you get to college,

314
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:24,570
it's like you gotta you
gotta figure it out.

315
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,740
You've got to figure out
how you're going to make it,

316
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:26,730
how you going to be successful.

317
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:30,750
And that's why lean so much
on my education and getting
my master's in business

318
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:33,120
and just really wanting to make sure that,
you know,

319
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:37,960
I would never be in that situation
again financially. Oh Wow.

320
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,580
I'm so blessed and
thankful. I, I love the,

321
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,060
I just feel like we have so
many opportunities and you
have to keep taking them

322
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:49,380
in now with social media and just so
much information at our fingertips is

323
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:53,490
there's no reason why people should not
be doing what they love to do their job.

324
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,970
They lift. I just haven't had five
jobs. I overdo it because of what,

325
00:18:56,971 --> 00:19:01,140
probably my struggle. But, um, you know,
that's the compensation I think I make

326
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:06,280
sure Nate, Chris, anything to
contribute to that challenging time?

327
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,470
I would say mine, it didn't come until
I got to the league, to the NBA really.

328
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:14,430
Cause you know, everything's been hard
for me. So being a little guy, sure.

329
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,700
You know, so, but the hardest one
thing when I got to the NBA was like,

330
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,530
they wanted me to be
somebody that I wasn't.

331
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,920
And now for me that was the hardest
thing because I was just like, Yo,

332
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:28,140
I just thought as a kid I just want to
play basketball, you know? So, you know,

333
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,680
they were big on, you know, attitude
and the way you add behavior.

334
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:35,290
And it was just hard for me. I'm like,
Bro, I just want to hope. I just,

335
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,190
I'm happy to be here.
You know, every game.

336
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:40,130
It was like different superstar
Vince Carter today. All words, right?

337
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:44,530
Like this is crazy. So I was just enjoying
the moment. I was enjoying the moment.

338
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:47,620
So my biggest struggle was like
every, every day. It was like,

339
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:49,780
all right and you got to chill,
like blah, blah, blah. I'm like,

340
00:19:49,781 --> 00:19:53,680
you guys are so worried about
everything other than basketball.

341
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,830
And I didn't understand
that. So that was, for me,

342
00:19:56,831 --> 00:19:59,740
that was the hardest thing
dealing with, you know, being a,

343
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,550
a starter and a player that you play
all the time your whole life and come to

344
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:06,550
the league and you're just coming off
the bench. Some games you don't play.

345
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,290
That was hard. That was really hard
for me. But I enjoyed the ride.

346
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,840
I enjoyed the ups and downs
and roller coaster was fun.

347
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,640
It was challenging and I had the
best seat in the house every night.

348
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:22,600
That's all I had to switch. How I thought
the process of not playing. I'm like,

349
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:26,590
you know what? I'm going to just embrace
this. You know? I'm going to just embrace,

350
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:29,620
you know, me not playing and then I'm
gonna just get on everybody's nerves,

351
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:31,930
ass jerseys. I need
shack, I need your jersey.

352
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,490
I was going to ask every different person
for their stuff to keep me, to keep me,

353
00:20:36,491 --> 00:20:40,420
you know, where I needed
to be. So absolutely right.
Chris, what about you man?

354
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,651
Like you just said,

355
00:20:41,651 --> 00:20:46,270
it's been a little coasters and I
think that for me it was my rookie year

356
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,980
because I was having

357
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,590
success,
but at home,

358
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:56,310
people in my neighborhood was going
through things that I couldn't help them

359
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:57,970
with back in the truck.

360
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,540
So it was a little bit of like
survivor's remorse and you know,

361
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:05,380
you have to take responsibility
for the choices that you make.

362
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,910
But some of my friends, uh, at that
time, they choices that, you know,

363
00:21:09,911 --> 00:21:12,590
I'll never see them again
when they were killed or,

364
00:21:12,591 --> 00:21:16,600
or whether they're in jail for the rest
of their life. And so, yeah, here it is.

365
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:19,150
You know, you're reaching the dream and
you're making it and you're loving it.

366
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,490
And, uh, you know, when
you're younger, sensitive,

367
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:22,690
you should be sensitive all the time,

368
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:26,260
but you're young and you're wondering
why you and why not them, you know?

369
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:27,910
And I just remember the whole season.

370
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,980
I don't think I enjoyed it as much
because I was living at home and my mind

371
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,120
wanting to bring them with me and will,

372
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:37,870
and then to see all of this
stuff and things I've never seen.

373
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,220
It's the most exciting time in the world.

374
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:43,700
And you have people you can't see it and
don't realize, listen, you, you know, you,

375
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,360
you can do whatever you
want. You know, it's,

376
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,560
I just met somebody out
here and it's doing great.

377
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:50,710
And they didn't even finish second grade.
They just had a hard work at the look.

378
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:52,450
You can do it, you know,
more stories and inspiration.

379
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:54,790
I wanted to take that to
them and let them see it.

380
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,550
But it was really hard at that time to,
to find that balance.

381
00:21:57,551 --> 00:22:01,600
You want to save the world and all your
friends at one time and it takes a while

382
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:03,250
to sell. For me, that was tough.

383
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:08,200
Having success reaching a dream and
in the kids that I dreamed with. Hmm.

384
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,170
You know we veered off at a point
of a dream and it was like, Dang,

385
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,490
I wish you could bring me with, so
that was tough. There was talking.

386
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,680
I hate it and I can relate
to that area very well.

387
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,480
Um Oh we'll say

388
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,390
man, I've got like four or five
questions. I wish I could ask you,

389
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:30,630
but we're gonna make sure that we spend
enough time letting some of the folks in

390
00:22:30,631 --> 00:22:33,150
the audience asks you some questions.
But before we go there,

391
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,590
we're going to do a little speed round.
Oh it's, you guys want to play games?

392
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,660
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I told him

393
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,010
cause all of you went in this one.
So this is, this is going to be a,

394
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,950
it's not fair cause she
always wins the games we play

395
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,370
seriously. But this is a, this or that.

396
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,700
Throw out two things and you just go,
don't think about it too much.

397
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:02,490
Just choose one or the other.
What is our answer?

398
00:23:02,491 --> 00:23:04,770
The answer is one or one or the other.
You'll see.

399
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:10,770
[inaudible]

400
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,090
we're going to start with Nate and we're
going to go to Chris and we don't keep

401
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:23,530
going back around. All
right. Dog or cat? Dog. Oh,

00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:40,150

405
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,320
live or on demand. Oh Man. Uh,

406
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:54,410
I'm gonna say live. Alright. Go to
the store or order online. Got It.

407
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,700
Okay.

408
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,840
Online. Okay. Online for sure.

410
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:10,110
butter dunk or three pointer up.
Duh.

411
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,600
Question player or coach

412
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,240
player.
Hot to cold.

413

Hot vacation or staycation?

00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:26,020
I'm a home body. Staycation.
Lebron or harden?

415
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,530
Uh, Brian. Beyonce or Rihanna?

00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,560
Beyonce.

417
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,740
Oh No, I'm sorry. I'll wait both too.

418
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,520
Oh, awake or asleep? No,

422
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:09,390
Chris. And on Solo or two week. Oh yeah.

423
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,530
So it got frozen empire strikes back
back in the day. I got to go higher.

424
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,230
So that is a lot of Solo Godfather.
Scarface.

425
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,840
Ooh. Uh, I'm gonna say
Scarface for me. Uh,

426
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,370
I grew up on that. Pac
man or miss man, Ms. Peck,

427
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,390
she was a sneakers.
Sneakers all day long.

428
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,210
Sneakers in this for all three
of y'all from Google or bing

429
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,360
[inaudible]

430
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,300
let's open it up to the audience.
We've got a microphone over here.

431
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,933
Hair.

432
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,080
Oh, y'all can't be shy. Thank
you. Come on now we up here.

433
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,360
I've got more questions I can ask.
I don't want to call it. Yeah,

434
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,430
that. Thanks so much for coming. This
is pretty much like a dream come true.

435
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,280
The question for all of you, who was
your favorite person to play again?

436
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,060
It's been why play against?
Yeah.

437
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,830
Oh, to play with. I mean either way

438
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,970
to play a gifts for me,
our have to shea,

439
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,430
it was Michael Jordan one time we
would play him in the playoffs.

440
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,720
You have 54 points, maybe something
like that. And I looked at Jawan,

441
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:17,210
my teammates and in front of Jordan
and we will work out when I was like,

442
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,630
oh, he sold his soul to the devil. He's
not supposed to be making these shots.

443
00:26:21,631 --> 00:26:21,890
I know.

444
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,800
Trying to get them off and
I really thought like he
sold like he may stuff, man,

445
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,470
they do not.
It's not humid

446
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,140
possibly.

447
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,140
So it was great trying to take him down
knowing that it probably wasn't a chance

448
00:26:33,221 --> 00:26:35,420
that you were going to do it.
So I stayed a great Mike Resort.

449
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,980
Yeah.
I think that would say Lauren Jackson.

450
00:26:37,981 --> 00:26:39,930
I enjoy playing against her cause she was,

451
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:45,530
she was really a tough player to guard
and stop and we had so many battles and

452
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,620
yeah, she was, she, she
was, she's the real deal.

453
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,580
I mean from between her three point shot
and her ability to score inside was the

454
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:57,180
most challenging to stop their
pick and roll and shopper inside.

455
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,530
And she could block my shot only on one
side. I had finally figured that out.

456
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:05,560
I'm like, Gosh, she getting my
shot. So I had to go left. But um,

457
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,830
she was the most challenging player.
I think I play it again,

458
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,310
uh,
from,

459
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:14,310
you probably are person cause I was a
little guy growing up watching another

460
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:17,430
little guy like change the whole league.

461
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:22,380
I don't understand like what he brought
to the game. Uh, he was okay for,

462
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:26,130
he made it okay for people to be
themselves, you know? And then for me,

463
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:28,530
I hit a game winning shot over him,
changed my life forever.

464
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,663
Thank you

465
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,350
sir. Thank you all for coming. Um,

466
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,560
I can think of highlights of, of many of
you, the things that you all have done,

467
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,890
but I'm just interested in what's
your best highlight or yourself.

468
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,820
Oh Wow.
I could help.

469
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,990
[inaudible]

470
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,690
I would say for me my best highlight
both say mom, my children, uh,

471
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,210
that maybe more so than basketball. They,
they're a part of me there, you know,

472
00:28:04,211 --> 00:28:06,760
I'm trying to shape them to be the best,
you know,

473
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,760
people they can be growing up,
you know,

474
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:14,740
sports education wise and just living
life for the full list and what it is.

475
00:28:14,741 --> 00:28:16,500
So for me it would be
my children for sure.

476
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,520
That was such a great answer.
I was,

477
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:24,760
I thought basketball initially
when you asked. So basketball,

478
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,690
just in terms of highlights, I mean
it's one thing to represent, you know,

479
00:28:28,691 --> 00:28:32,470
my city and state to have played in Los
Angeles for the Los Angeles sparks my

480
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:33,041
whole career,

481
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:37,000
but to have represented our country is
definitely the highlight for me to put on

482
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:40,090
the red, white and blue. And I know
we weren't like in the service,

483
00:28:40,091 --> 00:28:42,910
but it feels like you go into a war
when you play against other countries.

484
00:28:42,911 --> 00:28:46,630
And to come out on top,
just a little backstory,

485
00:28:46,631 --> 00:28:48,690
our USA team actually lost to,

486
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:54,080
we lost in a world championship
to Brazil and as you know Brazil,

487
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:57,160
like even in soccer, they're
very animated. They cheer.

488
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,190
So there was so animated
and this is the problem.

489
00:29:00,191 --> 00:29:04,890
They put us on the same bus
to the game and back. Right.

490
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,830
So on the way

491
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,750
that home team USA, and it was one of the
first times I got to the national team.

492
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:16,640
So I was one of the younger
players at that time.

493
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,930
They had made a bet with their
coach that if they beat team USA,

494
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:24,920
which is a really big deal, that
they could shave his head. Yeah.

495
00:29:24,921 --> 00:29:28,730
So they shaved his head on the
bus while we rode back with him.

496
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,450
So that level of disrespect I've out,

497
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,230
we will never lose, not always to
Brazil, but we had never, you know,

498
00:29:36,231 --> 00:29:39,380
cause we ended up with a bronze metal for
the world championship, which is like,

499
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,830
I don't even know where that metal,
if I accepted

500
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:42,683
does that or not

501
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:47,210
bratty. But the highlight then is
to go on and win four gold medals.

502
00:29:47,211 --> 00:29:50,150
I have also have to world to gold
world championship medals in,

503
00:29:50,151 --> 00:29:52,340
nobody ever talks about
but to go on and win,

504
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:56,600
go for the rest of my career wearing
red white blue is a highlight for me

505
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,230
though USA.

506
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,470
Oh it was awful. The clippers
out his hand, thrown it off.

507
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,960
Um, wow. Uh,

508
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,530
I'd have to start with baby playing in
college and playing with the group of

509
00:30:21,531 --> 00:30:24,080
guys in the Fab five or that time.
And um,

510
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:28,430
the reason why you don't need talks about
his mentality and if you get to know

511
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:30,190
Nate, you know, he's still
that 10 year old man.

512
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:34,100
He's still a beast when it comes
to sports in this mentality.

513
00:30:34,101 --> 00:30:37,430
But to be at that age,
I think all you guys understand,

514
00:30:37,431 --> 00:30:40,130
or maybe you're in that space now,
to be free mentally,

515
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:44,900
to know that the world's against you and
Tim embrace it and to take it on and,

516
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,790
but not be bitter enough
where you've experienced thing
and it, and it turns sad.

517
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:54,200
It's more so like an embracing of taking
on the world and playing with those

518
00:30:54,201 --> 00:30:58,850
guys was just so much fun because we
were on the same page. We all were dumb,

519
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:01,100
young and naive and
believe we could do it all.

520
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,210
And that's a great place to be when
you work hard, you know? And so, uh,

521
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:07,730
I would just say being
with those guys every day,

522
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,260
having them affect my life and who I was
and doing those true friendships and uh,

523
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,320
and then the highlights,
dunking on people too with those guys.

524
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:20,080
And I know it's a lot
of fun. Thank you, Lisa.

525
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,650
I'm surprised you didn't say that.
Dunk.

526
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,770
Yeah,
that's other people's highlights.

527
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,050
Yeah, that's true. Right?

528
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,600
Hey, thank you guys for coming and
stopping by here. Um, so fast forward,

529
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:38,110
you know, 50 years from now,
a hundred years from now, uh,

530
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,840
if you could have one
game that your great,

531
00:31:40,841 --> 00:31:45,550
great grandchildren could
watch of yourself, which
game would you pick and why?

532
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,160
Oh Wow.
Wow.

533
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,560
Yeah.

534
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,280
Say I'm the,

535
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:58,200
I have not a lot of games in my whole
career where I have triple double,

536
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,520
but I do have one in particular
where I had 10 blocks and I,

537
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:06,930
I won defensive player year. I loved
playing, I loved playing defense. It was,

538
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:09,090
you know,
playing both ends of the court of course.

539
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:12,360
And people know about the scoring,
but I really loved defenses.

540
00:32:12,361 --> 00:32:17,361
So I have one game where I
had 10 blocks and I would,

541
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,060
if for my son and daughter who
plays sports and plays basketball,

542
00:32:21,061 --> 00:32:25,020
I would like for them to see that game
because I think that game was just so

543
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:28,650
complete, whether it was scoring
or rebounding and blocking shots,

544
00:32:28,651 --> 00:32:33,270
but the defensive effort and
it was a championship. So
that was really important.

545
00:32:33,271 --> 00:32:36,840
But yeah, 10 blocks,
that's pretty good. Right?

546
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:41,660
[inaudible] get that out of here.
Yeah,

547
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,370
that game was pretty cool.

548
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,500
Uh, 50 a hundred years from now when our
kids to see you said, or great grandkids,

549
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:54,330
great grandkids. I always
say, uh, I would say,

550
00:32:54,331 --> 00:32:58,320
I think I had 28 points, 13
rebounds, but it was in a game.

551
00:32:58,321 --> 00:33:02,010
I call a time out at the end of the game.
And I will have,

552
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,310
I was showing him that because I would
want them to know you're going to go

553
00:33:05,311 --> 00:33:10,030
through things in your life,
even when you did your best and uh,

554
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,740
you won't win. Maybe you'll make
a mistake, maybe you'll lose.

555
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,650
But look how good of a game it was.
Look how it turned out at the end.

556
00:33:16,651 --> 00:33:20,290
And hopefully they will see, wow,
that was the most dark moment.

557
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,500
And hopefully it would have asked the
question, what did he do after that?

558
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,970
You know, me. So hopefully that would
teach them to have a great game.

559
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:30,540
Do your thing, kill it. Do yourself
when, if you run into a, you know,

560
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:35,070
a big speed bump, go ahead and
cry. Get Out of your system,

561
00:33:35,071 --> 00:33:38,400
get around some people that love and
support you. Forget it and keep moving.

562
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,520
You know, even the best guy, he's
like, Lisa talked about our 10 blocks.

563
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,370
I bet it's fun for her to think about
it now because when she was a player,

564
00:33:44,371 --> 00:33:45,240
she's so competitive.

565
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:47,880
She didn't think about a best games then
cause she could always know I can get

566
00:33:47,881 --> 00:33:49,200
11 blocks of 12 blocks.

567
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,350
And so hopefully through that they were
seeing our dad was a bad man. He made a,

568
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,850
a mistake and look at that and
then wonder how you get through it.

569
00:33:56,851 --> 00:34:00,190
And hopefully that would inspire them
to never worry about the, you know,

570
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,520
worst moments,
even in the best times of their lives.

571
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,390
Yeah. I'm gonna say for me, uh,
when I played with the Knicks coach,

572
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,970
I had a coach named Mike
Tony who sat me down.

573
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:14,360
He didn't play me for a whole
month. I never forget this. Uh,

574
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:18,710
he sat me down for a whole month
then give me a reason or nothing.

575
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,330
And I'm the one new years I will,
I called my mom, I'm like, mom,

576
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:27,440
I need you to come. You know, I need
somebody there with me just to, you know,

577
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,790
see if real familiar face somebody that
I love and my mom's like my best friend.

578
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:35,090
So I, Florida, Atlanta, and
uh, I took her to dinner,

579
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,060
we went eight and I ran into the coach.
Uh,

580
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,780
I ran into Atlanta hawks coach and he
was like, you playing on what tomorrow?

581
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:45,050
I was like nine and been playing for like
a whole month. So it was like 14 games.

582
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:46,880
He sat me and uh,

583
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:52,910
he ended up putting me in a game the
next day and I ended up having like 41

584
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:57,230
points. We won the game, went to over
time and the whole time I kept my mom,

585
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:57,870
Sharon,

586
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:01,600
so loud. They're like over
everybody gas, right? Nate Daddy. Oh

587
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,890
yeah, like the whole, I'm like, yeah.
I was like, that's mom dukes. You know,

588
00:35:07,891 --> 00:35:10,150
as a kid I always, you
know, you hear that,

589
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,970
that reassurance that mom
is there, you know what I'm
saying? For me. So, you know,

590
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:17,480
I would just,
I just played that game for her and it,

591
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,440
it changed my life because, you know, it
was a big story. Sports Center, you know,

592
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:25,400
a coach send you down for a month, you
know, I worked out hard before the game,

593
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:27,650
ran bleachers still did my workout.

594
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,410
So that would be something I would
love for my grandchildren know,

595
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:32,310
like even through, you know,
you go through adversity,

596
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,810
you just stay ready no matter what because
when your number's called, you know,

597
00:35:35,811 --> 00:35:39,420
I could easily just not been ready and
just say whatever or even told him, no,

598
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:41,090
I don't want to go in.
I just say, you know,

599
00:35:41,091 --> 00:35:44,400
I'm going to take full advantage of this.
I'm gonna see where it gives me. I said,

600
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,670
God, just don't let me make the
first shot because it's a wrap.

601
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,140
I make this first one at the, you know,
sitting down a month. So that was for me,

602
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:55,050
that'd be probably the game coming in
and helping my team and we want to,

603
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:57,600
that was a big, that was a big deal.
And all my teammates supporting me,

604
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,600
they showed me a lot of love. It
was pretty awesome. Thank you guys.

605
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,750
We're going to take one last question.

606
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,310
Hey, awesome. This is awesome.

607
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:10,150
So it looks like uncle drew is a movie
about old school guys teaching the young

608
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:12,940
ins. What's up, right?
So when you were young,

609
00:36:12,941 --> 00:36:15,460
what's a bit of advice that you
received from somebody older,

610
00:36:15,461 --> 00:36:17,470
wiser that helped you
in your success in life

611
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,490
with me? The first day of practice, uh,

612
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,600
I was drafted by golden state and
I was so excited to me Chris money.

613
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:29,300
So he's like one of the best shooters I
was seeing on New Yorker. Talk like this,

614
00:36:29,301 --> 00:36:31,230
you know, I'll tell you where
I've come over here. He cannot,

615
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,280
cannot understand him. I'm excited
and I wanted to just be around them.

616
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:39,680
I bought a place where he lived.
I just wanted the card and he had,

617
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:40,610
I wanted to be around.

618
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:44,660
And then the craziest thing is the more
than shooting more than anything else

619
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:48,020
after practice, he brought me into
the training room and he said,

620
00:36:48,021 --> 00:36:52,340
this is what I want you to do every day.
It was a hot tub and the Koto you said,

621
00:36:52,341 --> 00:36:54,350
I want you to go two minutes
in the hot tub, two minutes.

622
00:36:54,351 --> 00:36:56,890
Nicole took two minutes from
the hotel. I'm like, come on,

623
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,120
you don't need to stretch when
you're young, you can do everything.

624
00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:02,600
And then I found myself doing that
every game it through all the injuries.

625
00:37:02,601 --> 00:37:06,290
I found myself 15 years later doing that,
what he told me.

626
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:08,810
So he really taught me how to take
care of my body with nutrition.

627
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:12,110
He was at the end of his
career and telling me all
that in the beginning really

628
00:37:12,111 --> 00:37:16,880
helped me kind of at least focus my mind
and be ready to listen to my body and

629
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,620
stay prepared the whole time.

630
00:37:18,621 --> 00:37:22,430
And I think he had a big influence on how
I take care of my body hot prepared in

631
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:24,780
the summer because he was
relentless in his training.

632
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:27,960
And I think that was the
basis for, you know, having a,

633
00:37:27,961 --> 00:37:29,060
a pretty good career for me,

634
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,020
for me. Um, as a kid, I think, um,

635
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,960
my mom was my biggest inspiration and she
shared a lot of things with me being a

636
00:37:37,961 --> 00:37:42,430
single parent, raising
three girls. She would,

637
00:37:42,431 --> 00:37:46,060
and then just being so tall, like I
was, I've been taught all my life.

638
00:37:46,061 --> 00:37:47,960
My second grade teacher called
home, it was like, they,

639
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:51,370
you realize they says taller than
me and the rest of the chosen.

640
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,400
And my mom's like, yeah, well what's
the problem? You know, so, you know,

641
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,410
my mom was like, I'm six to her dad's
six, four. And she said, oh, okay,

642
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:03,940
we'll excuse the call. So being
this tall all my life, um,

643
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,480
having my mom be so positive about,
you know,

644
00:38:07,481 --> 00:38:10,780
my posture and sitting up
straight and that, you know,

645
00:38:10,781 --> 00:38:13,840
some people grow on the inside and
some people grow on the outside and our

646
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:15,640
family's been blessed enough to do both.

647
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,500
So don't be ashamed of being tall and
you have to stand up tall. And you know,

648
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:24,880
there was a lot of that when you're tall
and people ask you every single day,

649
00:38:24,881 --> 00:38:27,400
do you play basketball? And
you're like, no. Like, why do you,

650
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,940
I don't understand the association
with my height and, and basketball.

651
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,700
So for me through just
through grade school,

652
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,410
it was always this barrage of questions
and people talking about my height and

653
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,880
it was really annoying.

654
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:43,240
When you're a kid you don't really
get the whole comments and stuff.

655
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:47,800
So my mom was always constantly dropping
in these seats of building me up and

656
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,040
making me feel confident and
comfortable in my own skin.

657
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:56,041
And I think that the biggest takeaways
that she would tell us was small things.

658
00:38:56,741 --> 00:38:59,080
Like you can't receive
anything with a closed fist.

659
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:02,080
So always have an open hand and
helping other people, you know,

660
00:39:02,081 --> 00:39:04,970
we're all God's children.
Just, just really a,

661
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:09,980
a voice of love and positive positivity
that eventually my sister and I were

662
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:14,440
always like, we're our mother's daughter.
Because all we do is if somebody says,

663
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,330
oh my God, this headache
is killing me. No,

664
00:39:16,331 --> 00:39:18,070
don't say that because
it's not killing you.

665
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,830
You just have a headache this moment,
but you're going to be better. And then,

666
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:25,480
you know, everything is like
this whole positive affirmation,

667
00:39:25,481 --> 00:39:29,530
but I love it. And the other thing
she would tell us was the seven P's.

668
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:34,390
The seven p's are proper prior preparation
prevents Piss, poor performance.

669
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,990
So the seven p's with simply
whatever you want to do,

670
00:39:37,991 --> 00:39:41,320
whatever you want to get out of life,
you got to do it. You got to work hard,

671
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:43,900
but you're going to get out of it.
Whatever effort you put into it.

672
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:46,600
So if you're going to do it or did
your mom say, do it right there.

673
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:49,690
Don't do it at all because you're going
to go back and do it anyway in our house.

674
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:54,040
So it was all of these positive
affirmations that my mom kept getting,

675
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:58,990
my sisters and I that I felt helped mold
me into being able to accept. I didn't,

676
00:39:58,991 --> 00:40:01,160
God knows, I didn't know I was
going to get to six five mm.

677
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,670
Like this is ridiculous.
I'm like, you know, stop.

678
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,100
What are we doing here?
You know, cause six

679
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,290
like six foot in the sixth
grade. I know, I know, right?

680
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,190
Sixth Grade I was six foot,
they got,

681
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:19,750
my teacher was six two and there's other
ones are boys, Samuel, he was six foot.

682
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,630
So I'm like perfect. And the tallest
people got to be the line leaders.

683
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,550
I was so excited cause it's
usually the tallest or in the back.

684
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,180
You guys don't feel me, but listen,
this is like a struggle here,

685
00:40:30,181 --> 00:40:30,810
right?

686
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:35,340
His people [inaudible] exactly.

687
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:39,810
You're always the line leader.
Right. Who made up that rule.

688
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,570
So anyways,
so all of that was just,

689
00:40:42,571 --> 00:40:47,070
I feel like my mom being so positive
and knowing ahead having to fruition

690
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:50,460
because her growing up in the
60s being tall, it was just like,

691
00:40:50,461 --> 00:40:52,560
what are you doing?
Like who told you you could grow?

692
00:40:52,561 --> 00:40:55,230
We're going to have to get shoot shoe
boxes for you. She goes, you know,

693
00:40:55,231 --> 00:41:00,231
it was a negative thing and parents and
people made negative comments about tall

694
00:41:00,511 --> 00:41:01,344
women.

695
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:05,870
So I'm thankful that my mom gave me all
of that positive affirmations and for

696
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,780
all the tall women in the room feel good,
represent,

697
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:15,060
keep your head up high.
We are just queens amongst the people.

698
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,620
All got tall people problems

699
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,310
was the other one will
come from my mother's.

700
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,310
Well she really, uh, she
really wasn't the vocal.

701
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,790
She led by just showing
a three jobs to care.

702
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:34,160
Three kids are all on her own,
and I just, her just hustle

703
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,250
and grind every day. And she just, and
she smiled doing it, you know? So, uh,

704
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,230
my mother had been working for Boeing
for like 30 years, and you know, she's,

705
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:46,910
she been a janitor for 30 years and
she's never complained a day in her life.

706
00:41:46,911 --> 00:41:48,410
And she just goes.
So I just,

707
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,830
I think that's where I get my hunger and
drive from miss from higher for sure.

708
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,960
Thank you.
Thank you.
