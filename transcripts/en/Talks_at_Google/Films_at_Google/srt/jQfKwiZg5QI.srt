If you could please help me welcome up.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,220
Bill Skarsgard and Nadia Hilker
of their divergence. Here he is.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,480
Hi everybody.

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,680
Hi. Hi. How are you? Good.

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,940
I'm nervous.
I'm really nervous.

6
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:32,200
You guys are so smart and awesome and

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,250
with, with that, welcome to Google. Thank
you. Thank you for Lucy. Are you good?

8
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,450
Thank you. [inaudible] and welcome to
Chicago. Uh, allegiant is, is that in,

9
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:44,600
in Chicago? I think the whole
divergence here. He says,

10
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:48,770
is this your first time here? I
was here as a baby. Oh, great time.

11
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,480
I know you're just in town for a
short time, but how are you liking it?

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,770
It's great. It's, the
food has been amazing.

13
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:06,150
The bed at the hotel is
mindblowing. Um, no, it's,

14
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,570
it's beautiful. Whatever. I could
see, you know, out of the car.

15
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,790
I definitely want to give back.

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,230
It's very strange because we were
in Philly, uh, yesterday, uh,

17
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,680
and we flew from a word,

18
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:22,630
both flow flew from La to Philly and you
land and then you do like you go to bed

19
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:25,450
and then you wake up in a different place
and you do all this press junket and

20
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:26,440
we'll do the same thing today.

21
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,220
And I was like sitting like last night
at the hotel. I'm like, where am I?

22
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,540
Like what time? What time was it? Where
am I? Like, who am I? So it's been,

23
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:35,740
it's been emotional,
huh?

24
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,170
Yeah, very emotional. He's
been crying all day. Oh, okay.

25
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,140
Hopefully you're feeling better now.
We're here for you.

26
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,220
Thank you. Thank you. That
makes a lot Google. Thank you.

27
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,180
But it is, it is great to have
you guys here were, were, um,

28
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,200
very proud of,

29
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:54,730
of being in Chicago and it's great to
see you guys representing the city on,

30
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:55,690
on the big screen.

31
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,780
That's like half my lines. It's
just Chicago. Protect Chicago.

32
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,890
Going back to Chicago.

33
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,220
There you go. There you go.
You're sending up for us by a,

34
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,530
are the characters that you play in the
series a bill, you'll play Matthew and,

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,360
uh, you play Nida and the,
they're new to the series.

36
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,750
What drew you guys to
want to play those actors?

37
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:21,760
Do you want to be in the divergent series?

38
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,910
Um, we got the job. Yeah. That's how
it works. You got the job and you go,

39
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:31,500
Yay. So much of a
choice. Um, no, but yeah,

40
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,334
you can go ahead.

41
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,960
Um, so, oh my God, there's
a lot to say about that.

42
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,850
Um,
first of all,

43
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,470
getting a part like that is so big,

44
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:48,450
especially being from Germany and, you
know, yeah. Don't get me started on that.

45
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,670
Then second, Nida is a beautiful
young, strong, powerful,

46
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:55,830
confident,
bad ass woman.

47
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:02,140
Didn't like take too much of,
you know, convincing me that. Um,

48
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,750
and then third, um, I really like
the, the, the, the, you know,

49
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,690
diversion in surgeon and I really
liked the message of those movies.

50
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,820
Um, so yeah, and then getting

51
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,490
the was just crazy.

52
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,560
Yeah, no, it's, it's, it's same for
me. Like, I'm from Stockholm, Sweden

53
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,970
and um, and um, yeah, you know,
it's, it's, it's just great.
You know, this is I guess,

54
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,150
but by far the biggest movie that either
one of us have been in. So just in,

55
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:37,200
just in terms of like the size and, and
you know, it's huge fan base and uh,

56
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,330
there's a lot of expectation
on it and like you,

57
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:44,040
you play characters that they're also
in the books and what not. So it's like,

58
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,700
it's very overwhelming. Um, and then
it was just like a great experience.

59
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,650
I'm just filming it,

60
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:52,910
shooting it and like meeting the cast
and it was a weird thing. Like we've,

61
00:03:52,911 --> 00:03:55,800
we've been doing interviews so I can
just feel like I'm repeating myself over

62
00:03:55,801 --> 00:04:00,210
and over again. But like we, um, we went
to, um, like it feels like you're going,

63
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,940
like, you're going like, you're
going to school for the first time,

64
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:03,721
but like a new school,

65
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:07,080
like you changed schools or whatever cause
like they get these guys on the posts

66
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,410
are like, they all knew
each other. They work for,

67
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:10,140
to like two done two movies together.

68
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:14,800
They have all these inside jokes and like
the first scene that I shot was, um, um,

69
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,860
um,
my character has his monologue.

70
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:20,700
He's walking down and he's
like introducing these guys
to the, the new, you know,

71
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,070
world outside of shoot Chicago.
Um,

72
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,160
and it's just me talking and it's like
500 extras staring at me while I'm doing

73
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:32,160
it because it's like, ah, it was this
whole ordeal and it was kind of nervous,

74
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,650
like nerve wracking and like they know
each other and they're like making all

75
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:37,650
these jokes and they're like friends
and you're like, hi, I'm bill.

76
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,510
All right. I mean, they're like, we
had each other. We were like, yeah,

77
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:45,070
we had each other. Yeah. But it's
helped so much. I was so happy then.

78
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,370
So you were the new kid is
you're the new guy. Yeah,

79
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,120
me too. Me Too. You want to be my
friend? Not, I don't have any choice.

80
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,820
I don't have any other day.

81
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,290
I love it. It's great. You know,

82
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:01,050
you guys are going all over the country
promoting the movie. Yeah. Yeah.

83
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,290
Making,

84
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:08,290
making that jump from European movies
and just other other movies to a big

85
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:11,090
Hollywood movie and a multipart series.

86
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,990
What was the most surprising
to you about the process?

87
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,870
The thing is I never made the jump,
not even at my tree.

88
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,490
It's like a whole

89
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,790
new experience to me.
I mean Billy's been successful in Sweden.

90
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,980
I haven't been in Germany. Um, Jeremy
you've things, I think I'm a bit weird.

91
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:33,981
They're like her hair and she's
done a weird mix and okay.

92
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:38,040
I did. Okay. That sounds bad. I don't want
to mix German. So it was like, you know,

93
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,190
they're not ready for
mixes. They are. Okay.

94
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,880
You're digging yourself. Oh
yeah, totally. Um, no. So this is

95
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,440
I think what, what we're not just
trying to say as well. It's like,

96
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:57,770
I mean do they like, they like I
think over here they, there is this,

97
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:02,000
I like the same thing in Sweden.
Like I think in America at least people,

98
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,700
you guys are really supportive.
Like you,

99
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,540
you see qualities in people
like strengths, like hurt,
like being very exotic.

100
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,500
First special is something that maybe
she had a hard time struggling with in

101
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:14,930
Germany, whereas here it's like
something that you go like, wow,

102
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:18,510
look at your stunning, you're
amazing. You're incredible.
So, so, so the, the you,

103
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,710
it's just different mentalities
from where you're from. But um,

104
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,100
at the end of the day, it's just the
same thing. I mean, we're actors and we,

105
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,810
you know, whether it's a small independent
movie from you in Sweden or, or it's,

106
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:32,810
you know, the, you know, this
monster of a, of a production.

107
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:36,020
It's like you just go there and you learn
your lines and you're like, all right,

108
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,230
try to make a good job.

109
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,510
And it's also like,
I mean,

110
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:45,090
how many of you ever dreamed about
winning the lottery? Like, right.

111
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,140
So you find people more than that.
So,

112
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:53,760
and then imagine one day
you really actually win the
lottery and then it's just,

113
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:56,070
you've been dreaming about it your
whole life and then you're like,

114
00:06:56,071 --> 00:07:00,030
wait a minute now. It's, so, it's, it's,
it's, it really took a while. But like,

115
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,190
even today, like, like
still now I'm, it's,

116
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:06,270
it's been six months or we ever since
we stopped shooting the movie and like

117
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:11,271
seeing myself on a poster or like talking
to you guys and Google and in Chicago,

118
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,050
it's like, I'm still not, and I really
hope I'm never going to lose that.

119
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:19,380
I hope that hopefully even in
20 years I'll be, you know,

120
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:24,270
really thrilled about everything
I'm doing. And, um, so it's,

121
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,280
you don't get it and,
but it's just an amazing,

122
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:30,450
it's been such an amazing trip.

123
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,230
Yeah. No. Can you, congratulations. And
good. And speaking of that passion, not,

124
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,920
you talked a little bit about this on
why you were passionate into play, Anita,

125
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,610
but did either of you,
uh,

126
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,670
feel a deep connection with
your character? Did it,

127
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:47,740
did you feel like it was interesting to
play someone like you different from you?

128
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:49,820
How did you relate to those
characters you were playing with?

129
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,420
Oh yeah. You know, he's, he's, he's
very different. For me, I think Matthew,

130
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:56,850
but it's like anything,
I just,

131
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,500
for me it was like important to do
something just like, it's not a huge part,

132
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:04,800
but it's like, you know, I was just
want to do something that like might be,

133
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,610
you know,

134
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,930
a little new take on it for myself and
like creating something that's like

135
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,370
different from other things
I've done before and, and, and,

136
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,860
and make him feel like a real person
and, and, and come to life. Um,

137
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,040
and you only have yourself as tools,

138
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,520
like your own experiences and you know,
your face and you're at whatever,

139
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:26,520
like these are your tools that
you're given and then like,

140
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:31,500
what can you create from, from,
you know, with that. Um, um,
so yeah, you do find like,

141
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:34,320
okay, you know, you with anything
when you work, it's like,

142
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,810
how can I relate to this
scene? Like Blah, blah, blah.

143
00:08:36,811 --> 00:08:39,480
And like how would I have done
it? And you know, then again,

144
00:08:39,481 --> 00:08:41,610
like how would my character do it?
And then so forth.

145
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,160
I mean, I just described Nita
and if I be like, Oh, I'm Nita,

146
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,660
that would be kind of arrogant.
And Weird. Um, but it's definitely,

147
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,680
I mean, she suffered and I suffered
in terms of getting, I mean,

148
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,660
not suffering like tragedies,

149
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:02,590
but I got bullied in school a lot when I
was younger, um, because of the hair. Um,

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,200
so and I, and that made me stronger.
So I think that's, you know,

151
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,480
it just depends on when,
you know,

152
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:12,690
when you have a hard time life
either you're just, you know,

153
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,170
like hiding in the corner where you
just get up and become stronger.

154
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,720
And that's pretty much,
you know,

155
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:21,920
who Nina is and what
happened to her and Yup.

156
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,690
Thanks. That's very inspirational.
Thanks for sharing that. Um,

157
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,010
with that, um, you guys are welcome to
come up to the mics and ask questions.

158
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:34,430
We have one here on the right and one
on the left. So if you could please, uh,

159
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,150
start lining up. I'm sure these guys
would love to hear your questions.

160
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,880
It kind of would like to switch and
ask you guys questions sitting in an

161
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:43,714
audience.

162
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,710
Maybe we can take care of that afterwards.
I think that would be,

163
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,710
I'm sure these guys would love to hang
out and answer some questions about

164
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:55,150
Google. Um, so I want to make sure
we don't touch on any spoilers.

165
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,970
A allegiant comes out next Friday,
March 18th.

166
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,530
So now I touch you on spoilers about
this movie or even the next movie,

167
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:04,540
but you guys are here for the
rest of the series, right?

168
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:09,520
You're here for the third and
fourth movies. Yeah. Uh, what,

169
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:13,300
what are you excited about to see your
character's doing or growing as the story

170
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:16,450
progresses from allegiant
onwards in the series?

171
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,540
Well, I think that this
movie is, uh, you know,

172
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,360
part of it is like just
introducing this new element to it,

173
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:27,750
the new world that's outside of it and
where our two characters are part of it

174
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,100
and that, um, and you don't know,
like we haven't done the last one,

175
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:36,900
so we're sharing that in the
summer. So hopefully, um, you know,

176
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,590
but I'm looking forward to is like, you
know, exploring more cause I think I did,

177
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,280
you know, in terms of this movie being
like introduce like an introduction to my

178
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:49,170
character. Like, I would like hopefully to
have some things that play off and, and,

179
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:51,570
and the in the, in the last
installment of the franchise for sure.

180
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,960
Yeah. Well, yeah, we got introduced and
I would love to be able to show Anita is,

181
00:10:55,961 --> 00:10:56,794
and the next one.

182
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,190
That's great. We're, we're
going to be looking forward
to that and waiting for it.

183
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,990
Yeah. Thank you. Thank
you for that over here.

184
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,950
Hi. Hi. Can you hear me okay?
I have two questions. One,

185
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,970
did he meet the author of the books
and then to have miles teller,

186
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,450
Theo James and Shailene Woodley.

187
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,520
Who was your favorite cast member
to work with and Theo James?

188
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,050
Like the most beautiful
man in the world. Yes, yes.

189
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,180
So,
um,

190
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,730
Shaline is one of the most beautiful
young woman that's ever met in my life.

191
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,040
She's just

192
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,960
very grounded and cares
about the world and you know,

193
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:44,070
things they're really matters. He
doesn't care about fame or money or any,

194
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,060
any like,
she's just like us.

195
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,850
We talk about toilet paper
and making soups and you know,

196
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,360
grocery shopping and um,
she's very inspiring to me.

197
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,430
And I'm Veronica Roth. I said that
before too, like when you hear the name,

198
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,260
you think of this, I thought of this like
60 year old, beautiful, you know, woman,

199
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:08,230
older woman would like red
hair and like big jewelry.

200
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,400
And then I met her on set and
she was this beautiful 26,

201
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:16,650
seven year old woman.
And um,

202
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,030
yeah, she's, she's great. And
Yeah, if you as a very handsome man

203
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,680
for sure.

204
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,820
Oh Great. Come on guys. Yeah. Yeah.

205
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,723
Hi,

206
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,690
I'm Joe from the tour.

207
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,740
At what moment did you realize that
you want to do, become an actor

208
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,950
for both of you? Um, um,

209
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,353
when I,

210
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,280
I never thought about acting because
no one in my family or no one in my,

211
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:57,830
you know, friends circle
I ever did it. So, um,

212
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,340
but this agent one day saw me
and she's like, you're an actor.

213
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,560
And I'm like, you're weird. You
haven't, you haven't even talked.

214
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:10,550
Like you tell me I'm an actor and she
would call me like every month at least

215
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:11,420
once and you know,

216
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:16,421
try to convince me and then I quit school
and then I called her and you can't.

217
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,893
Yeah.

218
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,880
Yeah. I mean, I come from an acting family
of access. So I got introduced to it, um,

219
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,240
very early on. And, um,
for me it was like, um,

220
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,430
I'm getting annoyed by myself cause
I repeat myself so much. But, um, uh,

221
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,090
like acting is for me as a kid was like,

222
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,020
I couldn't really believe that
you got paid for it. Like that.

223
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:48,790
I was an actual job, like, cause
kids, um, I mean we, we're,

224
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:53,630
we're all actors as kids, we play and we
perform and you know, like I am, you know,

225
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:55,610
the bad guy and you were
this guy on the cop.

226
00:13:55,611 --> 00:14:00,020
I'm the superhero and you play with kids
and it's just as world of imagination

227
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,611
and,
and,

228
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:04,250
and performance and characters and you
dress up and I'm a night or you know,

229
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:08,360
I'm a princess or whatever
it is. Um, and um, so for me,

230
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:13,160
like I was still on film sets as a kid
and like, I saw my dad, like, you know,

231
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:17,150
with a gun and a badge
and I'm like, what? Like,

232
00:14:17,151 --> 00:14:20,760
who can play? And they're all adults and
they're still doing this, this, this,

233
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,090
this is ridiculous. And, um, um, um,

234
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,070
so I got introduced to it,
like,

235
00:14:28,071 --> 00:14:32,300
just that part of playing was
just so fun for me. And then, uh,

236
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,160
I never grew up, so here I am. That's
awesome. Thank you both for being.

237
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:37,910
Thank you.

238
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,070
Yeah.
Over here.

239
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:45,580
Thanks for coming. Um,
I was curious about, um,

240
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,440
your accents, if you had to do some
sort of training for this or if, uh,

241
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,570
well, what was the training like if
there was one. And also, you know, if,

242
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,150
uh,

243
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:01,150
when talking to press in the u s you're
sort of still sort of making an effort

244
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:04,720
to stick with a particular,
uh,

245
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,450
American accent or it's just
become ingrained in your speech.

246
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,530
Uh,
well this is how I talk now.

247
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,940
So, um, and I don't know,
like I, I traveled, I was here
a lot as a kid growing up.

248
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,770
So, um, and then, um, I dunno.
So this is just how I talk.

249
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,720
Same here. I mean, I'm German.
Germans don't really sound like me.

250
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,000
Um, I was, I grew up
speaking French, German,

251
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:38,990
and French, so I think that my
posture is different. And, um,

252
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,330
I started watching
family guy when I was 15.

253
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,020
That's why she speaks like Peter
Griffin. Yeah. It's bad. It's bad.

254
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,900
Be careful because I mean the thing's
been on people, sand, family guy or not.

255
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,800
Yeah. Um, but um, yeah,

256
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:58,801
so I learned English from watching family
guy and friends and sex and the city

257
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:01,570
and all those great shows.

258
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,310
But also to answer your question, like
yes, we've both worked on it. Like,

259
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,860
Oh yeah man,
I got to a party,

260
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,080
no TV show couple of years
ago where I played in America,

261
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:12,510
which was my first American part.
Um,

262
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,130
so then you worked with a dialect
coach to sound American. Um,

263
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,190
and also for this one too, like we had
a, uh, a dialect coach, you know, um,

264
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,630
and you know, Theo James is
British, so he hasn't, you know,

265
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:26,720
someone of those solid
set all the time to, to,

266
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,950
to make sure that we sound
like we're from here.

267
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,940
Yeah. And she would like come
over and be like, I don't know.

268
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,640
And then you
do it differently.

269
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,370
Do you have any words that you,

270
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:44,180
I have trouble with something that is
kind of that thorn in your side and

271
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,040
pronunciation? Not really. I mean,
I definitely have to, I just,

272
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,290
I all said that before. Like, I mean,

273
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,710
I never spent more than five months
in this country. Like, you know,

274
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,740
I came out here in October and I've never
spent more time in the United States

275
00:16:57,741 --> 00:17:02,720
then then now. And um, I'm sorry. Um,

276
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,210
so I, I just, I'm always very afraid
that I sound like a college girl.

277
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,420
I mean, I'm not college girls aren't,
it's not bad to sound like one,

278
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:15,080
but my vocabulary in,
in German is so much bigger and you know,

279
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:18,200
I could not talk to you about
politics or economy probably,

280
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,050
and that's a little bit
frustrating. But, um,

281
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,620
so if he's be in German to meet,

282
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,170
to find out that I'm okay smart.
Yeah.

283
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,410
That I'm smarter than I
sound. But yeah, for me

284
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,580
it was, um, a lot of the words, like we
don't have the t h sound, the Swedish.

285
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,180
Um, so I would have
problems with when you know,

286
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:46,130
where you would have like tea
that when you would go from a,

287
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,580
and also just this,

288
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:52,380
it's just so subtleties like you with
sound for and if you over pronounce things

289
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:56,360
too, like if you over pronounced
take things you sound for like,

290
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,540
it's just like,
so did you work on it to just sound lazy,

291
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,190
less lazy as an American?

292
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,930
Yeah. Hi. Um, I wanted to ask,

293
00:18:08,931 --> 00:18:10,040
when you're acting,

294
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:14,660
there seem to be a lot of like three
dimensional CGI stuff going on.

295
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,140
What do you have to do differently as an
actor to be able to act out those type

296
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:22,280
of scenes as opposed to,

297
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,330
let's say regular scene without a lot
of three dimensional CGI going on?

298
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,000
Is there anything,
any special techniques or how do you,

299
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,950
how do you work with that?

300
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,030
Well, we've, we've gotten
that question a lot.

301
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:36,800
And the thing that people don't
realize is when we shoot a film,

302
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:39,480
even if it's a small little independent
movie and you're sitting and you know,

303
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:42,930
and just you and the scene is takes
place. It's just you and your, you know,

304
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,090
dying mom and then have this
bedroom. Um, there's still,

305
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:51,050
from where we see, there's like guy
holding the boom. There's just like,

306
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:55,850
there's so much going on behind the
camera that you as an actor pretend that

307
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:58,880
it's not there, even though you
don't see it through the Lens.

308
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,170
So when you don't see it through the Lens,
but you will add it in post,

309
00:19:03,171 --> 00:19:07,220
it's kind of the same thing. It's like,
um, we don't, we know it's not there,

310
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,930
but we pretend it, that it is there.
And in terms of the film crew, we know,

311
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,860
we know they are there, but we
pretend that they're not so, so, um,

312
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,490
it's just this,
you know,

313
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,780
that sense of like imagine imagination
and just completely being true for the

314
00:19:20,781 --> 00:19:25,250
scene. And it's a special thing
because you really don't see the,

315
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,590
the, you know, the crew members
standing behind the camera.

316
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:29,690
You don't see them at all.
And that's a special thing.

317
00:19:29,691 --> 00:19:32,270
And it's the same thing where you're
like, okay, so this is, you know,

318
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:35,960
a plane come here is coming here and in
the scene you actually see the plane,

319
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:37,670
even though it's just like
a, you know, a laser point,

320
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,560
like the little dot that you're
following for eye line. It's, it's weird.

321
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,060
They want like also when, you
know, like that's saying, um,

322
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,960
dinosaur movies. Um, I mean there
aren't like real dinosaurs, but it's,

323
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,250
it doesn't really like when I,
when I have to act that, you know,

324
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,240
my boyfriend is dying.
I have to, you know,

325
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,670
make myself believe
that I love that person.

326
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:04,190
And I probably just met two days
ago and that now he's dying.

327
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,220
So that's the same imagination has just,
you know,

328
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,470
imagine imagining that there's a
t t t racks attacking me. So it's,

329
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,800
you basically just use your imagination
for everything and then you use your

330
00:20:18,171 --> 00:20:21,590
imagination. Then you really have to make
yourself believe it from it, you know?

331
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:26,510
True. Coming from it. I'm
sorry, I'm, I'm a beginner.

332
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:30,800
Him coming from a true place and then,
yeah.

333
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,700
Yeah. Just, just like you said, Bell,
right? Like being a kid and just, yeah.

334
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,690
You're just playing.

335
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,560
Exactly. It's going back to
that whole thing. Yeah. Kids,

336
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,500
kids pretend and play and you know,
if there's not lava on the ground,

337
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:45,980
but you sure believe that it
is at the time when you're
playing. There's, there's,

338
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:46,814
there's rules.

339
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,000
Exactly. Well, thank you
both so much for coming.

340
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,050
It was great having you here for cargo
and we're excited to watch the movie on

341
00:20:56,051 --> 00:20:59,380
the team. Yeah. The acting
thing doesn't work out.

342
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,740
Is there like a possibility?
I could maybe do an inches.

343
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,580
We have a lot of positions
available we can talk about.

344
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,070
I don't have any education though.
I speak French and German and English.

345
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,950
Your experiences is very
important to Google,

346
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:20,540
much more than what school you went to.
So we can

347
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,830
thank you both so much.

348
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,120
[inaudible].
