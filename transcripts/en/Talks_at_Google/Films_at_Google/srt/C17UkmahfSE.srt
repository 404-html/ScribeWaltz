1
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,160
Hi everyone.
Welcome to talk to Google today.

2
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:11,430
It's my pleasure to introduce Justin
Lynn and John Cho for star Trek.

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,960
[inaudible]

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,030
aw, thank you guys for
being here. Thank you.

5
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,740
And other you for being here.
Oh,

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,460
I was wondering what he was holding the
a communicator to communicate it. Yes,

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,080
I'm familiar with that.
I pay attention.

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,090
That's fair. Um, Jesse, do you wanna
tell us a little bit about this film?

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,450
Can I see it? Um, the process?

10
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:53,740
So, sure. It was about 18 months ago

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,470
almost. Exactly. Um,

12
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,990
I was shooting something in Ventura and
my phone rings was Jj Abrams and I never

13
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:03,970
met him before and we just
started talking and he said,

14
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,600
do you have any connection to star trek?
And it was a really cool talk and he,

15
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,760
I said, okay, well I'm shooting.
So it was a Thursday. I said,

16
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,710
let's meet up on Monday. Let me
think about it. And, uh, and I,

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,960
I remember driving home
just thinking about,

18
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,670
I knew star trek was part of my life,

19
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,750
but I never thought about
maybe like participating in
the franchise, you know. Um,

20
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,680
and it was a really cool
drive. And I, at one point,

21
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:32,620
I just decided to call my
parents and I said, hey, look,

22
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:33,490
can I just have dinner with you?

23
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:37,870
So I drove there and we had this great
dinner and was at that moment I felt like,

24
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,390
let's do it, you know, I mean,

25
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,410
at the logistical challenge that was
ahead of me and the team was insane.

26
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,713
Like, you know, I,

27
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,640
I do the fast movies and they used to
be two years to get that from idea to

28
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:56,110
delivery. And that's insane. And
here it's 18 months, you know.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,490
And so the next thing I knew,
I'm,

30
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,070
I'm on a plane to London with Doug and
I'm in the hotel room with Doug and Simon

31
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:03,904
and Lindsey,

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,460
and there was no idea and we had
to get something by June. Um,

33
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,580
but I think it was really, it was
really great exercise because, um,

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,300
I felt like it was a worthy challenge,
you know, and, and everybody in that room,

35
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:24,010
even though it was like really
relentless, uh, we love Star Trek. And so,

36
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,950
um, that was, that was our starting
off point. And I felt like,

37
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:30,310
especially with 50
years, uh, of Star Trek,

38
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,870
I felt like if we can kind of really
kind of deconstruct or try to deconstruct

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,540
why we love it so much
through these characters,

40
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,150
then hopefully by the NL reaffirm our,
you know,

41
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:43,600
the passion that's been there and
hopefully we can contribute to the legacy.

42
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,950
Where did you eat?
What was that dinner I had,

43
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,500
I remember Simon Simon was eating
this healing with your parents.

44
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,710
Oh, they, they, they, they
know I like, I'm healthy.

45
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,430
I don't eat really healthy, but
they, they think I eat healthy.

46
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,060
So they like steam a lot of vegetables
and like go crows and stuff like that.

47
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,760
This is a year.
Is that how house

48
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,290
painting at ut you're healthy you have to
hit, yeah. Yeah. That sounds good. Yeah.

49
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,410
Um, speaking of characters we love, John,

50
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:20,270
you have been with this sort of iteration
of the cannon for a while now. Um,

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,740
what was it like stepping
back into the shoes of sue?

52
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,750
Uh, it's always, it's
great. I, I consider it, uh,

53
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,480
an honor to put on the uniform and,
um,

54
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,360
I've always admired star trek.
Uh,

55
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,950
as a piece of American popular
culture that's, you know,

56
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,350
uh, put forth something, um, you
know, but the idea is that it is,

57
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:48,410
spouses are a beautiful,

58
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,390
and I feel like it's a,

59
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,630
it's a worthy piece of
culture to be associated with.

60
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:55,620
And so I take it seriously and,
um,

61
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,700
it feels great to put that uniform on.

62
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:03,290
And then there's obviously
a team of people that I
really loved working with the

63
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,930
cast of course. And, um,

64
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,850
and then I was reunited with Justin this
time around. And uh, so that was very,

65
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:11,684
very special

66
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,000
for you. Was it sort of
interesting you, you know,

67
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:17,640
the last time Justin is at
the helm of one of your films,

68
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:22,140
it was probably on a much smaller scale
and slapping their buck credit card

69
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:22,660
movies,

70
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,840
just different limits.
That was,

71
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,660
that was a diners club card
and this was a mx black. Yeah.

72
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,660
But,
um,

73
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,910
but I was, I was remarking
that in, in a lot of ways. Um,

74
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,530
I saw Justin's independent
spirit come out in this. I mean,

75
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,540
he just described that he had
a truncated a timeframe and,

76
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:51,180
you know, uh, they went in and,

77
00:04:51,181 --> 00:04:55,380
and he had to start making decisions
without having a completed script. And so,

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,820
you know, just from when I'm, when we,

79
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,450
when we had that initial
meeting at paramount and you
were working on stuff and

80
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:06,470
then I could see the gears
going and you were, uh,

81
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,600
making gut moves, you
know, and think, well,

82
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,370
I know that we have to do this.
That's what I feel.

83
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,500
And then we will have to write around
these three or four decisions that he had

84
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:21,990
made early on. And so, I mean,

85
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:26,280
that's an unusual way to
work at this scale, you know?

86
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:30,960
But it was kind of great seeing,
seeing what I felt, I mean,

87
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,670
from my vantage point was sort of an
independent spirit and improvisational

88
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:40,110
spirit, uh, colliding
with this giant thing.

89
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,680
Yeah. So it was very exciting,
a little dangerous. Um,

90
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,270
little scary, but
eventually, uh, I mean, I,

91
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,820
I saw the movie eventually satisfying.

92
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,030
I think your stamp is very much on this
film and in a great way. It's, it's,

93
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,120
I think we're seeing things we
haven't ever seen in star trek before.

94
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,970
And some of it's just because you know,
technology,

95
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:03,800
but I think a lot of it's
due to your influence.

96
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:08,000
So what were some of your favorite things
that you were excited to bring to this

97
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,870
sort of beloved?

98
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,730
It's funny because, um, I
grew up engaged in, you know,

99
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,860
my parents had this little fish
and chips restaurant, you know,

100
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:20,380
and they close at nine and
we'd have family, family
dinner at 10 and, uh, you know,

101
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,410
Star Trek came out 11 back in La,
you know, and, uh, my brothers and I,

102
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:29,060
we'd talk our way into staying up with
them. And so from eight to 18 hours,

103
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:32,420
our family time, you know, our
engagement was on the original,

104
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,290
the original series and every night.
And so my,

105
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,090
I remember even as eight
years old, I didn't understand
the, the notion of reruns.

106
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:44,660
So my, my like, so filing when I
saw the episode repeated, you know,

107
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:49,040
it didn't make any sense to me, you know,
so it was, it really was a great kind of,

108
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,440
uh, environment. Um, but
I, I think because I,

109
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,480
my engagements offer reruns, um, by
the time I saw it like the fourth time,

110
00:06:56,481 --> 00:07:01,040
the fifth time, um, I kind of wanted
to fan fiction mode, you know,

111
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,850
because every, it's this, the
show is so compelling and fun. Um,

112
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,950
but I've always wondered,
well,

113
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,220
what happens to Sulu and Chekov when
they leave the bridge, they hang out,

114
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,070
do they like each other? You know,
like little things like that.

115
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:18,071
And so in constructing this movie that
I wanted to at least explore that and at

116
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:20,600
least be able to showcase some of that,
you know,

117
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:23,600
and that that to me was aside
from all the actions and stuff,

118
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,330
those for me on a personal
level where the most rewarding,

119
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,740
sure. To note that I'm pretty
sure Sulu is taking a selfie

120
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,060
that's a modern sooner the
selfie survives into the, um,

121
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,040
no, I think, I think you, you
hit on it like a great point.

122
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:44,070
Like for me that's a very
shared experience actually
because that was the only

123
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:45,490
thing we were allowed to watch growing up.
It,

124
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,950
star trek or sesame street
creates a very weird,

125
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:51,420
like sense of what the
television landscape is as a kid.

126
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,620
Yeah. I was, uh, you know, the first
time I started thinking about, well, I,

127
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:58,630
years ago,
I don't want to brag,

128
00:07:58,631 --> 00:08:01,510
but I did a showtime movie
called the Tiger Woods Story.

129
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,740
I played Jerry Chang, uh,
his Stanford roommate.

130
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,520
Okay.

131
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,380
And, uh, did a lot of research, um,

132
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,420
but, uh, Lavar Burton director of that
movie and I was, I remember being really,

133
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:24,421
really impressed because he was in roots
reading rainbow and star trek and I was

134
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:29,320
like, this guy is, uh, making
a mark on American culture.

135
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:32,830
And I meant very seriously,
you know, and uh, anyway,

136
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,270
so did dovetails into, uh, my
admiration for the franchise.

137
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,330
I think it's the same,
it's like these,

138
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,850
there are only so many things
in our lifetimes that have
this level of impact on

139
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:46,700
such like a global scale. And like I, I,

140
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,180
I just think star trek is one of
those things. It speaks to everyone.

141
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:51,850
I think everyone identifies with
a different thing in it. You know,

142
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,460
for some of us here we are at Google.
I'm sure a lot of people are, no,

143
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:59,510
I'm tech tech and TV, like star trek is
inspired so much of real technology. Yeah.

144
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,050
Um, so what would you say, like
some of the things that you really,

145
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:05,940
really identified with, um, work

146
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,730
a first for me it was, um, you
know, um, I'm an immigrant a,

147
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,650
um, and we immigrated to Houston, Texas.

148
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,300
And, uh, as a kid, I'm watching
this show in the early eighties,

149
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,940
or there just wasn't anyone else on
television that looked like me. Um, Eh,

150
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:32,590
you know, except for like Kung Fu theater,
which loses, who's a disappearance.

151
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,790
I bemoan, but, um, uh,
but aside from that,

152
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:41,650
it was George and he was in a
cast in a heroic light if limited,

153
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,300
you know, on the show. It was, it
was heroic. He was on a spaceship.

154
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,180
And, uh, so that was just
a momentous for me and I,

155
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,990
and, and I didn't realize how important
it was until really later. But,

156
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,450
um,
that's my first memory of it.

157
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,990
Yeah. For me, I remember we,

158
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,280
we had just immigrated also to the states
and it was just my parents and me and

159
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:09,120
my two brothers. And, uh, it
was, it was Kinda, it was,

160
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,510
it was a bit scary trying to like you
halfway around the world and you'd have to

161
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:16,180
learn the English, you know, new
language and everything. Um, but I,

162
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:19,210
I remember kind of watching
star Trek and real,

163
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,430
I think that family kind of
goes beyond blood. You know,
it's, it's a, it's a group,

164
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:26,460
people coming together going
through the shared journey and, uh,

165
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:29,910
that really had a really very
powerful can imprint on me.

166
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,210
Yeah. And I think it's, it's an ideal
that we're still struggling with,

167
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:35,230
sort of working towards,

168
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:38,620
but it's nice and it's nice to have a
star trek movie coming out now. You know,

169
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:41,800
we're not in the greatest of times.
It's nice to sort of have a reminder of,

170
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:44,680
I think this film does a good job
of being like, yeah, it's like,

171
00:10:44,681 --> 00:10:47,200
hope there's hopeful. Um, John,

172
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:50,710
I want to go back a little
bit to something you've
just said is, um, you know,

173
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:54,250
I think, uh, the Asian representation,
like I don't want to go too much into it,

174
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:54,701
but you know,

175
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:57,430
starring John Cho was such an exciting
thing to see because it's like, yeah,

176
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,620
and you're starring in
this, you know, it's,

177
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,630
it's nice to have you continuing that
mantle and, um, I think it's, oh, thanks.

178
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,343
Uh,

179
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,920
I'll ask myself a question.
How did you feel?

180
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,250
Yeah, it was crazy. Um,

181
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,870
oh, we, which is an
example of, I mean, uh,

182
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,150
I'm not just kissing ass
cause I'm a Google, but, uh,

183
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,270
it was like a strange moment of,

184
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:32,430
um, populist expression that
happened online, you know? Um,

185
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,720
I, I don't know, you
know, if we could have,

186
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,700
if that could have happened,
uh, in 1990, you know,

187
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,150
I'm, I'm assuming not, um, or any,

188
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,560
how it would have happened
in 1990, obviously. Um,

189
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,180
so it was brilliant.

190
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,210
It was simple and I always thought it
was interesting that that guy used the

191
00:11:56,471 --> 00:12:01,460
tools of, um, movie makers. You know,

192
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:03,730
we just sometimes, you know, if
you go to the American film market,

193
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,290
they'll just have a poster of,
you know,

194
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,880
Stephen Dorff on a jet ski and it's
called, you know, uh, you know,

195
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,910
terminal snow and the, the,
the script isn't written yet.

196
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:18,820
And some Russian guy,
we'll plunk down, you know,

197
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,240
7 million a and say, okay,
write me the script. I mean,

198
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:26,050
they present the poster before they
write this screenplay and, and because,

199
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,770
because it's a really effective way
to sell an idea, you know. And um,

200
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,900
and the starring John Cho thing was
just a bunch of really well done posters

201
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:37,360
that got people talking.
The, the most interesting,

202
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:42,100
I read an interview with the guy, William
you who, who started it and he said,

203
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,800
um, the most interesting
thing he said was, if,

204
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,570
if you find this funny,
you should ask yourself why.

205
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,580
Um,
there was no question.

206
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:56,470
So I haven't technically failed to answer.

207
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,350
I think you asked the question that I
realize that I'm just fluttering calls.

208
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,320
No, I think it's a, it's like a question
that we should still be asking you.

209
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,130
And the other side of it.

210
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:11,550
It's also very nice to have representation
behind the camera. Um, I think it's,

211
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,780
it's nice to see,
you know,

212
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:17,100
directors of color and it's exciting to
see something is epic is this, you know,

213
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:18,960
have that sort of influence.
And I think, again,

214
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:21,330
it's going back to like the
roots of Star Trek, you know,

215
00:13:21,331 --> 00:13:24,510
and it's not just Asian Americans. It's
like you have Nichelle Nichols, you have,

216
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,330
you know, all these sort of
groundbreaking things. And, um,

217
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,920
I just appreciated seeing
sort of diversity again in
this star trek movie and

218
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:33,720
not just the ones like humanoids.
I'm,

219
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,420
the thing I was super impressed
by was the aliens on this. Um,

220
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,380
you did some stuff with the aliens
and I was just so impressed by,

221
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:41,580
and it's no longer,
you know,

222
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:44,390
we've come a long way since just your
painted green in a body suit and that's

223
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:47,290
suddenly you're, you know, a sexy
alien lady or something like that. Um,

224
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,330
did you always know that you wanted
to include such, like a wide berth of

225
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,070
Oh yeah. I mean, I, that was one of the,
uh, the perks of the job, you know, and,

226
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,900
and Joel Harlow, who did it
such an amazing job. I mean,

227
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,010
as soon as I signed on know,
we were looking at a different creatures.

228
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:07,350
We're looking at the history of trek and
you know, especially with crawl, like I,

229
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,570
you know, interest elbows,
Keller character. Um, it,

230
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,170
it was really interesting because we
really want it that designed to embody 50

231
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:16,840
years of trek creature. So, you know,

232
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,980
cause the nature and there's
a twist you guys, you know,

233
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,270
it's the whole thing is that,
you know, we want it to, I mean,

234
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,670
we wanted to make sure that
as we were designing it, uh,

235
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,180
we were very mindful of
the history, you know. Um,

236
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,300
but I also feel like the
aesthetic now with filmmaking,

237
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:36,220
we have more tools now than ever in
cinema. And it's, especially with like,

238
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:36,850
um,

239
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:41,850
visual effects and CG and it really kind
of has a vault to its own aesthetic.

240
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,640
And it was,
it was cool to kind of try it.

241
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,000
One of the goals is to bring this
tactile nature back into film.

242
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,210
So it was really cool to go in the shops
and would've like molding it and stuff

243
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:57,050
and you actually can feel and touch and
build these characters. You know, I was,

244
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,920
it was a lot of fun,

245
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,410
John, for you. Was having like
it visually show that like the,

246
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,540
the sort of nature of like,
Hey,

247
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,420
there are a lot more buttons this time
and aren't just like pads, like for you,

248
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,560
did that help you even more get into
this sort of further iteration of Zulu?

249
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,780
Uh, I don't, I don't prepare
that much. Um, all right.

250
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:19,070
I'm not that serious of
an actor. Uh, but yes,

251
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,490
I mean that it's,

252
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,620
that the enterprise is like a very,
um,

253
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,880
maybe it's because of all the mythology
surrounding it and all the culture

254
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:31,010
surrounding it.
That's like a,

255
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:36,011
it's an obviously recognizable pieces
is very a cathedral like for me,

256
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:42,680
you know, and then, um, so it's something
I've known. It's something very familiar.

257
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:43,880
And then,
uh,

258
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:48,881
to come on this on the new bridge is
a strange because it's new and old.

259
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,060
Um, and the bridge is just, it's
very easy to pretend there. Um, and,

260
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,460
uh, I'm a limited, I'm an
actor with limited range,

261
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:03,380
so I need as much help as possible and
everything seems to do something or you

262
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:04,840
can believe that it does.

263
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,390
Thanks. So, no, I was
impressed though. I mean,

264
00:16:07,391 --> 00:16:10,930
I'm the Newbie here and when I walked
on to you and Anton and everybody,

265
00:16:10,931 --> 00:16:13,450
it's like they just go into
it and they're in that mode.

266
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,510
I believe that I believe. Good. Thanks.

267
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,970
That's beautiful. Uh, Justin,

268
00:16:26,971 --> 00:16:31,050
you did, you did a very short for
us. You did a great story. What,

269
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,680
was there anything sort
of you learn from that,

270
00:16:34,681 --> 00:16:36,330
that you brought to star trek with you or,

271
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,110
well, what I loved about that
experiences, um, I didn't want,

272
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,350
I want it to be fully immersive and,
um, a lot of times, you know, I,

273
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,280
I feel like as a filmmaker I'm
always looking for areas to, to trim,

274
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:53,620
prove and try to grow every day, you
know, and with the fast movies, um,

275
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,100
that aesthetic was something that I,
it was out of practical,

276
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,770
um, interaction. You know,

277
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:05,630
like I would come up with crazy ideas
and all these great people that's crass,

278
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,750
people around the world come in
and try to make it happen. Like,

279
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,120
but there'll be like the weirdest
little thing where I'm like, okay,

280
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:11,570
it's going to,

281
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,480
the car's going to crash and the
land and I want to lay down his roof.

282
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,340
And they'd never land on the
roof. Never. You know? Um,

283
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:20,630
so like editing,

284
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:24,560
always kind of like you always ended up
doing one or two extra cuts. And, uh,

285
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:27,830
the thing doing the VR was I really
wanted to challenge, you know,

286
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:31,940
because it was going to be live
action and to do it with no cuts. Um,

287
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:36,530
that took a lot of prep, a lot of people
coming together to bring that to life,

288
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,543
you know?
And,

289
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,750
and the thing that I learned about that
is there's some really talented fucking

290
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,040
talented people in this world. So if you
could think it, everyone's going to come.

291
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:50,490
And, and that passion just
drives it. It was so inspiring
because, you know, I mean,

292
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:53,820
if you have to really think about it,
live action going like lights,

293
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:56,340
cast shadow and then yet how
are you going to do three 60.

294
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,340
But like if you just have an idea
and you present it out there,

295
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,380
it's amazing how like a group of people
come together and make that come into

296
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:07,760
reality, you know? And so, um, I
really appreciate it. You know,

297
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,930
I felt like I was in like editing
crazy editing world for awhile, um,

298
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,590
which is my own doing.

299
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:17,250
And I really loved that experience
because there was no cuts, you know?

300
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:20,550
So that really dovetailed into
this film where I, there's,

301
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:24,840
there are a lot of moments where I
think also because the cast is so great,

302
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:27,770
you know,
where I can just let the camera flow and,

303
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,310
and there's a sincerity
about that, you know, I think
edits are great, but it also,

304
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,820
it's cheating, you know? And
so people that get that, uh,

305
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,220
and to be able to have that kind
of controls, it was pretty amazing.

306
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,420
Speaking of the cast. Uh, so I have
to ask about the Dubsmash thing.

307
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,980
Who started that? It officially started
with, uh, if you don't know, uh,

308
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,830
we had just had been, do you
know the APP? Dubsmash? Uh, no.

309
00:18:54,831 --> 00:18:57,660
It's a lip syncing APP. And, um,

310
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,350
Zoe started at Zoe Saldana started it,
um,

311
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:08,590
and it got really out of hand and
we spend all our time doing it.

312
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:13,660
And then we had a Dubsmash, um, uh,

313
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,700
crisis because,
um,

314
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,190
we were texting them to one another
and the weekend we really started in

315
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,810
earnest. Um, we, I mean,

316
00:19:23,811 --> 00:19:28,811
I think we'd done like 80 all together
and there was on this super long text

317
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:35,000
chain except, uh, Karl urban
was not, uh, who plays bones,

318
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:38,960
was not, um, uh, texting back.

319
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,610
And,
uh,

320
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,600
which was weird because
it was like very him.

321
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,990
And when he came back to work
that Monday, we said, uh, we,

322
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,130
we've been weeds Dubsmash
Dubsmash and he's like,

323
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:55,340
what are you talking about?

324
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:01,190
And we realized that we had been
texting an old number of his,

325
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,013
um,

326
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:09,610
to a production cell phone that he
had a while shooting the last movie.

327
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,650
And it had been going
to a landscape architect

328
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,970
and we were very scared
because, uh, you know,

329
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,470
Sophia was doing stuff in makeup,
full hair and makeup and,

330
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:28,730
uh,

331
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,810
there's a lot of secrecy around these
movies and we were revealing everything.

332
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,670
There's a lot of evidence
and uh, anyway, so,

333
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,210
um, it turned out it was uh, yeah,
so, uh, we thought that Carl was,

334
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,040
um, effing with us and
um, but it turned out he

335
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,420
was real and we had to
call him this man and a,

336
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,530
beg him not to, uh,
since sell these things.

337
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,410
Um,
he was very cool.

338
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,780
And did you not participate back?
Cause that would have been,

339
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,530
I wish, I hope we sent him a
bottle of Scotch or something.

340
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,100
We'll take audience questions in a minute
if folks want to line up. Um, okay.

341
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,580
I some sort of rapid fire questions
for you guys, uh, for both of you, um,

342
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,090
for you in real life. Not Relating to any
character of you have made a plate. Um,

343
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:24,120
engineering science. There's
security department, red shirt,

344
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:24,954
yellow shirt or blue shirt.

345
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,593
Okay.

346
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,820
Generics, science, science.

347
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,490
Is there an arts department?

348
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:42,240
Um, if you had B one alien species
within start talking about, would it be,

349
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:49,160
I, I would, I would love to be strong and,

350
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:51,440
uh, like a Klingon. Okay.

351
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,750
That sounds good. Clean on. Okay.

352
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,790
What's one piece of technology from the
Star Trek University you'd like to see

353
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:02,420
realized sooner rather than later?
Like a holodeck.

354
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,620
Replicators warp drives.

355
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,170
I mean the food stuff, right? Like
the applicators. Right. That's,

356
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,040
that's pretty cool.

357
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,890
She ain't chick filet in space
chick filet and Sushi guys.

358
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:19,340
You've got to try that. We survive post
productions, chick fillet and Sushi.

359
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,580
It sounds really healthy. Um, would
you rather deal with the Mirror Mirror,

360
00:22:25,581 --> 00:22:28,900
alternative universe version of
yourself or a triple infestation

361
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:34,190
mirror Tribble that that's,

362
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,690
that's there's something about masses of
something that's very nightmarish to me.

363
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,290
Yeah. Bumps. I said I'm scared of bumps.

364
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,710
Okay.
Um,

365
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,710
who from the cast do you think is
actually most qualified to run a startup?

366
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,690
Wow. Simon. Simon Parr.

367
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,880
Yeah, but you know things.
Zack, is he so believable?

368
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,830
He like when he jokes around
like it takes me like 10 seconds.

369
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:04,740
So even laughed because I realize
that it's Zach and not Spock.

370
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,800
I go show up on set, he has a band job
cause he's always probably things banjos.

371
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:13,470
I'm like, wait, Spock holding
a banjo, that's still,

372
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,260
it's still having a hard
time getting used to.

373
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,780
That's certainly something that would
probably be very visually disconcerting.

374
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,330
Um, well speaking of that, uh,

375
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,720
the Internet is kind of an interesting
place for fandom and what's probably the

376
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:30,140
most unique piece of Fan art you've seen?

377
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,290
Yeah.

378
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,450
Oh yeah, the Spock Kirk
stuff. Oh No, I was,

379
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,310
I just in general,
fan fiction gets gay fast,

380
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,490
you know, I'm sure there's
some like nice, heroic. Yeah.

381
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,700
Okay.
All right.

382
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,800
Going south real fast.
Um,

383
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,550
do either of you have like a sort of
Kobayashi Maru story where you kind of

384
00:23:58,551 --> 00:23:59,950
cheated the system a little and,

385
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,080
and yeah,
this whole film was a Colby

386
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:09,580
when I signed up. I don't know what
happened before me, but you know, it,

387
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,570
all I know's Jj came to the call and
you sit, hey, go make it your own.

388
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:17,980
Be Bold and just do it. Go.
And then once I took it every,

389
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:20,380
I wanted to be ambitious
in every idea I had.

390
00:24:20,381 --> 00:24:22,810
It felt like we didn't have enough money,
you know,

391
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:25,990
so I felt like we were back into
doing their big indie movie, you know,

392
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:29,650
and that like, we got sequences
in the movie where, um, you know,

393
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:33,760
we need probably 20 more days, first unit
in 20 days, 20 more days, second unit,

394
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,280
you know. But we would do stuff
where we'd shoot first unit,

395
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:40,030
everybody would go home and I'd stay
and shoot second unit all night and then

396
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:43,270
they would go home and the first unit
show back up and we shoot first unit all

397
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,140
day. But, you know, it was like that was
the process for this movie, you know,

398
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,010
it was totally worth it, you know, and
it was great. And, and, um, you know,

399
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:53,980
just everything like the, uh,
some of the sequences we shot,

400
00:24:53,981 --> 00:24:57,880
like the motorcycle sequence was shot in
a day and a half. That was a total, like,

401
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,270
I used it, I literally smoke the
mirror out of that sequence, you know,

402
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:03,950
and I'm sending cameras
out and just shooting. And,

403
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,760
and it was just prepping and
using every trick, uh, up to, uh,

404
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,770
to this point in my life. I know I use
every trick on this, on his phone. So,

405
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:16,700
so at any point did you ask Jj Abrams
how he got your number? Like re

406
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,110
Jj Abrams just calling you?
It's kind of interest

407
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,490
saying like, you know, um, at
this point in my crew, like
sometimes the phone rings,

408
00:25:30,491 --> 00:25:33,880
I just don't know who it is and you just
kind of pick up and it could be anybody,

409
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,040
you know,
it's kind of cool.

410
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,410
No, no, no accidental.

411
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,140
We'll go to our audience.

412
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,780
Cool. Thanks Justin. This
is a question for you.

413
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,550
You're a big star trek
fan and a big fast man.

414
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,820
So it was fun to see you're
involved in this project. Thank you.

415
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,470
Could you talk about
what it's like to try it?

416
00:25:56,471 --> 00:26:00,560
When you create something that fans have
like a connection to something that's

417
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:01,394
familiar?

418
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:05,480
The challenge of keeping it familiar and
like making that connection for people

419
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,800
but then also making it interesting enough
that they want to show up at things.

420
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:08,634
He's something else,

421
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,560
you know, the reception. So far, I mean,

422
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:17,110
whether they like it or not, I think it's
hopefully they feel respected, you know?

423
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,610
Um, I remember when I, when I, you
know, jumped into the fast franchise,

424
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,130
I'm not a car guy.
I didn't know anything about cars.

425
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:28,720
I think have a better appreciation for
it, but that's not my passion, you know?

426
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:32,500
And so I remember I would go and hang out
with guys that were drifting and stuff

427
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:35,020
and, and really just hang
out all day and just hang,

428
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,190
like really trying to understand their
passion. He's like, I love basketball,

429
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:43,440
you know, but that's my passion. And
I, if, if, if I watch something, I,

430
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,320
that's basketball related, I hope
they are respecting my, so that,

431
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,770
that was what I learned through that.
And Luckily I think with Star Trek, um,

432
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,190
this is the original series is
based on the original series.

433
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,930
And I do have a love for maybe different
at different levels, other people. But,

434
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,860
um, that's something that
I think we were very, um,

435
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,170
I was very clear on, I mean, when
you do this, you know, especially at,

436
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,590
at this budget level,
you know,

437
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,830
you really do feel like that's where
the art and commerce just collide.

438
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:14,460
And some of the meetings you go in and
the fights that you have to, you know,

439
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:18,340
really go. It's pretty
intense, you know. But I,

440
00:27:18,341 --> 00:27:23,180
I feel like at the end of the day that
that first meeting I had, uh, not with Jj,

441
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,000
but with the studio was very clear
what we were going to do. You know,

442
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:29,890
I think sometimes when you get in a
room, people are like, oh, you know,

443
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:30,511
it's been 50 years.

444
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:33,090
Should we try to make star trek
more like this or more like that,

445
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:36,360
or more like this. And, and I just felt
like that was the wrong approach. Like,

446
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:40,470
we have the goods, you know, Potter Star
Trek's about these great characters.

447
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,520
It's about this,
you know,

448
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:46,521
really the shared journey and the
sense of exploration and discovery,

449
00:27:46,591 --> 00:27:50,370
you know. And, uh, and part of the
mandate of star trek is to try new things.

450
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:52,690
So I really felt like it
was all there and, and,

451
00:27:52,691 --> 00:27:54,260
and sort of trying to be something else,

452
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,750
like let's really kind of find
them within and, and, and, and,

453
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:57,920
and really celebrate that.

454
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:02,220
I will, amen that by saying,
I mean this is not bs. He, he,

455
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:06,180
he did talk about the fans
during production all the time.

456
00:28:06,181 --> 00:28:09,150
And it was this constant, uh, I mean it's,

457
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,200
it's helpful just on a practical
level too, for as an actor, you're,

458
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,110
you're pretty self centered.
And I mean,

459
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,540
I mean like internal you'll
focus is internal. And um,

460
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,520
one of the, the sort of spines he
kept coming back to was what did the,

461
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,170
what would the fans want?

462
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,390
And it is this like a constant
thing that you would hear from Jeff?

463
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,930
I think that there'll be clear too,

464
00:28:33,931 --> 00:28:38,580
it's not to pander to try to understand
why there's so much passion. You know,

465
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:39,660
like again,

466
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:43,650
I come from the fast world and sometimes
people think fast and it's just fast

467
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:46,350
cars, good looking people. And
you're like, well, if it's that easy,

468
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,590
the studios would make like 10
of them every year, you know.

469
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,540
But it's not that easy. I think there's
an emotional connection that we have

470
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,360
and, and the, and that's a
relationship that's very dear.
You know, and I think, uh,

471
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,010
but part of that relationship
is also sometimes having to put,

472
00:29:01,011 --> 00:29:05,300
put it in uncomfortable places,
maybe challenging certain
notions. Um, and that's,

473
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:09,050
I think that's part of the fun
of, of, of doing being a part of,

474
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,340
of something that's so special.

475
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,170
We saw it with sort of a mix of people
who are maybe only familiar with the

476
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:18,830
newer ones and people who've
been watching it since forever.

477
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,090
And I think everyone felt like they had
a good time for those who have been with

478
00:29:23,091 --> 00:29:26,080
it. Like, you know, the characters longer.
It felt respected and really enjoyed.

479
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,020
And I think there are wonderful little
nods to the sort of those of us who've

480
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,890
watched the original series
and watched it through. And,

481
00:29:30,891 --> 00:29:34,190
and yet it's still really like
inclusive to new audiences.

482
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:38,920
So thank you so much for joining us
today. Go See Star Trek. Thanks guys.
