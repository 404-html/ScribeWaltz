1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,290
The
toxic.

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,660
I'm Kevin Valcon. We're here with the
suicide squad cast, so let's welcome them.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,160
Yeah.
Are you guys

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,480
the real versions in the mini
versions of you guys? Cool.

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,080
A huge blockbuster hit coming up this
summer for you guys on August 5th so thank

6
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:31,200
you guys all for being here.
David, this is your movie.

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,220
I'm just absolutely
phenomenal. And you know, it's,

8
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,800
it's essentially a film about a villains
brought out of Arkham asylum and jails,

9
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:41,830
all orchestrated by Ed Amanda
Waller played by Viola Davis.

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,970
And she gets pretty during the film.
But so people were going crazy with this,

11
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:50,530
with comicon and it's, you described
this movie as bad versus evil,

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,820
which is really interesting.

13
00:00:51,821 --> 00:00:55,300
So you need to talk about just what's
the difference between bad and evil,

14
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,020
bad and evil. Uh, you know,
the thing about evil, it's
like a, it's like pornography.

15
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:02,000
You know it when you see it

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,870
like, oh yeah, that's a
ass dad is definitely,

17
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,850
but at the end of the day,
look, it's, it's, yeah, sure,
these are the bad guys, but

18
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,770
I think could flashback. That's a good
way to start. That's a good way to start.

19
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,060
Yeah, finally. Right?

20
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,890
No, no. Look, at the end of the day,
it's, you have a group of a bad guys.

21
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,220
He's a super villains,
right?

22
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:35,640
But they do have good hearts and maybe
they don't know that about themselves in

23
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:36,061
the beginning,

24
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:38,760
but along the way they discover that
and they actually see the good in each

25
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,590
other,
formed this incredible family,

26
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,580
and then go on to do some wonderful
things together and you know,

27
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,260
maybe save the world in the process.

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,440
Awesome.
And so will you play dead shot,

29
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,680
big popular villain and Batman's know
gallery? Why did you choose dead shot?

30
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,750
So it would, they probably had your
choice of superheroes, I would imagine,

31
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,960
or villains. And so why did you
choose this role over any other?

32
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,860
Uh, actually I didn't, it was

33
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,180
mighty
awkward.

34
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,950
No, Dave came in, he pitched everything.

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,330
I loved the character of
Diablo. I was like, Yo,

36
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,660
that's crazy. And Dave was
like, dude, you did shot.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,833
Yeah.

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,970
Oh, okay. Okay. Uh, you know,

39
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:25,260
but really we all, we all see everybody
signed on without a script, right?

40
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:27,570
Nobody knows. So there
was no script. You know,

41
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:32,571
I had just seen fury and I knew David's
work and he came and pitched the idea.

42
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:37,350
And really as a, as a testament
to David, we all signed on with,

43
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,210
with without a screenplay.

44
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,980
He pretty much laid out the characters
that he saw for us in, in his mind.

45
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,480
And we all signed on.

46
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:50,440
It became a family with
like sort of a kind of a,

47
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,870
a, a loving, uh, malicious abuse,

48
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,820
abusive father,
right?

49
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,080
Yeah.
Normal family

50
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,600
and Margo, you play a Harley Quinn,
so it is absolutely phenomenal.

51
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,060
You nailed the character. Um, it's, it's,

52
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,290
she's really insane and you get to see
the origin story of Harley Quinzel and

53
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,430
it's, it's really, really just
amazing how that's done the film.

54
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:18,490
But what was the toughest part about
getting her writes about? Just saying, oh,

55
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:19,324
I found her,

56
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,640
uh, I mean the physical training and
stuff started six months before we started

57
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:23,941
shooting.

58
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:27,450
So that stuff was more mechanical and I
knew it was something I could learn if I

59
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:30,420
put in the hours. The hard part was, um,

60
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,770
finding the vulnerable side
and not being scared to like,

61
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,290
I mean the rehearsal process.

62
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,380
I'm sure you guys have heard David has
a pretty rigorous rehearsal process that

63
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:44,310
everyone has to be involved in and,
and it's super painful, but um, that,

64
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,330
that side of it was tricky.

65
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:48,360
And also trying to figure out
the dynamic with the joker.

66
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,960
I just couldn't understand why she was
with him when he tries to kill her all

67
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:56,470
the time. But it's your voice. The
voice was hard to get to. I didn't, it,

68
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,390
it's hard because the only
portrayal of Holly's voice is super,

69
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:02,490
super high pitched and
animated and comical.

70
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,490
But when you're doing a David Ayre film,
there's going to be like really deep,

71
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:08,460
gritty pots as well.
So we needed to find an in between ground.

72
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,850
That's your Jay, uh, your character of El
Diablo. It's without spoiling anything,

73
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,270
the dynamic between you and
will's character of Deadshot
is interesting because

74
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:18,130
you see in the trailer as well where it's,

75
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,730
he provokes you a lot and you kind of
want to contain your powers it seems like.

76
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,200
And he just wants to bring them out.

77
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,710
Well, there's a, there's a really a,
an important part of the film where,

78
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,581
you know,

79
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:33,581
his backstory is revealed and he's afraid
to really open that side up because,

80
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:39,050
uh,
he did something horrific and this,

81
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,520
this new group of people is becoming his
surrogate family and he doesn't want to

82
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,080
destroy them the way he's destroyed
other people. So yeah, it's,

83
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:49,500
it's interesting to sort of
see that and be revealed, uh,

84
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,390
during the course of the film.

85
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,060
Gotcha.
Okay.

86
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,480
No saying it could be,
is it,

87
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:58,481
was it just his character is the most
powerful really out of all of us.

88
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,460
And he choose, he doesn't want to
fight. And uh, that, that's, that's,

89
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:06,320
it's such a beautiful thing. And yet
you haven't seen the movie yet, right?

90
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:08,090
You guys haven't seen
it. Okay. So yeah, so

91
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,740
I was making sure I was about to do it.
Joel Ketamine show.

92
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,880
Tell him how to tell him how it ends.
Joel is great. It's really good.

93
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,990
This is his, his nickname
is spoiler alert. Well,

94
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,020
Joe will tell any face.
I can't say that I take the mic.

95
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,040
When you were talking about, I was
like, did I say that in the interview?

96
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,990
But I tell him about his backstory.

97
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,990
Gara Gara you play a in Tantra switch,
your character is as scary as hell.

98
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,260
It's crazy. It's, you play
dual roles. It is, it's crazy.

99
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:49,220
And janitors is absolutely crazy. And uh,
you know, you played archeologists. Yeah.

100
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,300
So he played an archeologist
and then, yeah. And so, um,

101
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,920
but then in chapter it's
like takes over your body.

102
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,700
So we won't reveal how
that happens. But, uh,

103
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,570
what was it like playing just one of
the creepiest villains we've seen? Yeah.

104
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,850
The dates. I don't think she's not
scary. She's just a little daddy.

105
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,780
I'm just saying she needs to go off or
something. Um, I mean, I had a great item,

106
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,680
had such a wonderful time, especially
playing two characters. Um, it was just,

107
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:15,740
I think the only thing I've found is
difficult was that hair makeup. Every day.

108
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,640
I still have dot. I'll never know how
many hours. Three, three, three. I mean,

109
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:22,650
I didn't go through as much as
I'd Warlow but it was more the,

110
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,050
the scrubbing at the end of the day,

111
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,640
it was the layers and layers
of blocked up dot. Just fine.

112
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,560
And you guys, you guys had a really good
dynamic on the set, right? Cause it was,

113
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:34,190
you guys had a group text going on and
was like, suicide, suicide squad for life.

114
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,010
Your suicide squad. Yeah.
It's still going. Yeah. Yeah,

115
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,590
yeah. Well no one's getting
agree to these anytime soon. No.

116
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,540
Oh yeah. And Tattoos. Yeah.
So it's tattoos, Dave. Oh,
he got the squad? Yeah. Joel,

117
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:50,290
show them yours. Joel has this biggest
one. The biggest one will did that one.

118
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:54,720
I did that. Why did that
one huge, huge mistake.

119
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:55,923
Yeah.

120
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,730
We're asking wheel. So when
are you getting your rank?
And he's like, oh, tomorrow,

121
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:01,940
tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow again

122
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,440
at rap rap. Yeah. Rap. Yeah. I don't
want to get it. Why are we shooting?

123
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,210
But Margo brought the gun though that
you didn't you bring the Tattoo Gun. Oh,

124
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,420
let's do it. No, no, no,

125
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,800
no. This is the problem. This
is the, I say all the time,

126
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:26,180
this is the problem with 40 year olds.
Hang with 20 year olds. It goes wrong.

127
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,540
It goes wrong and it ends in the hospital.

128
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,340
But it wasn't so bad cause you did Joel's
cause I think Joel you asked for the

129
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:36,174
Tattoo.

130
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,640
Well we were all going to get them and
then I was like yeah we'll do mine.

131
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:43,760
And then when he started I was like
what the, what's up? Thank you.

132
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:49,460
Can you describe it as like watching a
drunk baby fly helicopters were exact

133
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,420
descriptions of that. So yeah, I
didn't want to, I didn't want to do it,

134
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:58,720
but everybody was so excited. You
know, I got wrapped up in a moment.

135
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll do it, I'll do a joke. And
that energy that he had right there,

136
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:05,100
that was the energy he
had while he was tattooing

137
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,400
crazy stuff that happened
on set year. You're shaving
off people's eyebrows. Yeah.

138
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,590
Margot's and you're helping shave at
gyse beard. Jumping off Karen's Harris.

139
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,430
So what, what does that with
your, your process is amazing,

140
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:26,310
I think is all this stuff that was coming
out of this set of how you get inside

141
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:29,520
people's heads.
So where did that develop?

142
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:32,420
What like did you start with that when
you first started filmmaking or did you

143
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,120
okay. In the Navy I did
cut hair in the navy,

144
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,190
you know, I cut hair on the submarine. So,
you know, I've, I've used clippers before,

145
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,240
but it's part of the process. It's, it's
like a, you grab someone out of rehearsal,

146
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,970
you know, alter their
look, throw him back in.

147
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:51,880
It's a little bit like being in
prison I guess. And uh, you know,

148
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:55,410
they get mocked by the other prisoners, so
it just helps, uh, helps them get there.

149
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,690
We're in the rehearsal

150
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,210
space and he left with Karen
and came back with her scalp.

151
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,650
He walked in with like the hair. It
was like, oh my God, it's a garden.

152
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,950
We it to Margo.
And she didn't like that Karen,

153
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,310
his hair was midway down her back,
you know,

154
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:18,600
and it was beautiful and we're like, Oh
wow, it's beautiful David. Say, dude,

155
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:22,170
come here, clip, clip, and just
cut her hair off. I was like, Yep.

156
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,103
Ah,

157
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,950
and all I could do with this.
Take a picture of it on the floor.

158
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,013
Okay.

159
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,570
Post this Karen.
Okay.

160
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,850
You play, get them boomerang. And,

161
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,440
which is probably one of the
funniest parts of the film.

162
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:42,360
He's the most hinged on hinge character.

163
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,690
So can you talk about just developing
that character in his, his crazy psyche?

164
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,490
Uh, yeah, I had to go
pretty, pretty crazy.

165
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:53,900
A undergo a pretty crazy trends, uh,
transformation to a, to find him.

166
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,180
It's a stretch. I'm obviously
nothing like the character. Um,

167
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,480
keep it together at all times. Uh, find it
hard to step out of my, out of my shell.

168
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,460
Um, and uh, so it was, it
was pretty intense man.

169
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,330
And uh, it's, it's been
hard to shake off, you know,

170
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,340
what's it been like about 30 years now?

171
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,830
Now here's the thing I like,
I've, I've done movies with,

172
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,960
with actors before. I, you know,
I've had love scenes where, you know,

173
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,010
you use all day long, you're shooting
a love scene with, with someone.

174
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,400
And I've still managed
to see GI naked more.

175
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,780
That was like, dude, just, you
don't just put some clothes on man.

176
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:43,780
You don't have to, you don't have
to be naked and you're outside.

177
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:48,400
Do you know you're outside?
We're outside doors.

178
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:51,070
It's November.
Well it's a damn clothes on.

179
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,370
You got to stay out of base camp,
stairway from the trailer,

180
00:10:55,371 --> 00:11:00,170
stay on sad at safe on set. There's
grownups there. You got to base camp.

181
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:01,060
Anything could happen.

182
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:01,631
Yeah.

183
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:04,600
Well I hear there's a story where you
chase David at the end of the shooting

184
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,950
naked and he just sprinted away from
you at the end of a 20 hour shoot day.

185
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,990
Me, me, me, me and me and Jay,
we were in giant trailer and a,

186
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:18,190
and Gi was in the shower and um,
and David comes at,

187
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:21,430
peaks his head and the trailer and
he's like, hey dude, what's going on?

188
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,480
And the Gi comes out of the, out of the
shower and he's only wearing a towel.

189
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,590
And as soon as he sees David,
he just, he drops the towel

190
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,430
and David just instinctively
just like darts out and tag.

191
00:11:36,431 --> 00:11:41,431
I was Diego's second boy and try just
takes off running and he's chasing David

192
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:45,390
like terminator style,

193
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,050
but make it around the whole studio
parking lot and then is a predator.

194
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:54,250
You don't run from him.
Instinctual things happen.

195
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,370
It happened when they smell blood. We
have Karen Karen's voice. Like, Hey,

196
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,070
I never got him. I never got him.
Oh, David wanted no parts of it. No.

197
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:11,920
And I come out, I come out my gym
like what it's going on. No, no GI.

198
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,210
I don't put that on him.

199
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,620
The end game there. What were you going
to do if you did catch him? I, no,

200
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,560
I mean I didn't think about that.
We would have found out when I,

201
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,240
when I get on and David David
told us later, he was like,

202
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,510
I was just trying to find some glass on
the ground that I could run over this

203
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:36,690
slowing down.
He was barefoot.

204
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,210
Yeah. Now this, this, uh,

205
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:45,270
this cast was a thoroughly and
perfectly chosen role by role,

206
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,890
uh, perfectly for what, what
are, uh, personalities can, uh,

207
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,770
uh, accurately display on camera.
Yeah, I think it was that pretty,

208
00:12:56,771 --> 00:12:59,130
that was pretty good.
Right. People, right job.

209
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,940
Yeah.
And there's no transitions.

210
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,300
No segue. But Adam, nothing I
can do for that. There's no,

211
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,380
there's no right to quit around
it. So speak. Speaking of penises.

212
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,493
No,

213
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,560
get out of I, there's no way Gary,

214
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,860
keep talk about this. Jesus, the
development of your characters, uh,

215
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,390
just with your training and

216
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,690
got it. Training. The best thing
about it, me and my wife become,

217
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,840
became more bonded because I said Babe,

218
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,120
um, David, uh, called and uh,

219
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,950
he wants me to learn
how to use these ropes

220
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,340
and here we go. Bear rope. Bad
rope. No, we're very much in love.

221
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,430
It brought us closer.

222
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,710
Can I do to tie the knot?

223
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:55,530
Okay.

224
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,620
Views expressed by the suicide squad
are not necessarily the views of Warner

225
00:13:58,621 --> 00:13:59,420
brothers pictures,
right.

226
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,253
Will Smith.

227
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,840
Well,
Adam was wailing during treating.

228
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,430
Yeah. Air Squat even. Right.
It was embarrassing. Yeah.

229
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,190
They were hard squats,
man. I think Adam, we are,

230
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,920
came in and Jai,
I think Dji,

231
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,630
Margo and Karen were like
the most already in shape.

232
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,310
You know,
like they were in shape.

233
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:30,180
They hit the set ready and the rest
of us kind of had to get in shape and,

234
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,840
and Adam was, Adam was
like this. Adam was here.

235
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,953
Yeah.

236
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,380
I love this

237
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,770
one. Squat for today. Hey Adam,

238
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,860
what are you squatting?
Gravity man.

239
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,850
Wicked heavy.
Black Day to day.

240
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,390
So Garrett, Garrett,
how about your trading?

241
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:12,570
Cause I'm guessing it wasn't like that.

242
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,560
Yeah,
well I got trained by Guy Norris,

243
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:20,650
my stunt double or Molly Ong and Richard
Norton who have worked on Mad Max fury

244
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:24,740
road. So I got the best
training in the industry. Um,

245
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,070
I didn't have any prior
experience with sword fighting,

246
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:32,360
but we did a month and a half
of preproduction. I, no, no, no.

247
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:33,200
It's funny because

248
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:40,160
in my audition email it said you're
going to do a little bit of martial arts,

249
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:43,520
some acting, and then if you have
a sword lying around at home,

250
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:48,350
just bring it just in case. I
was like, who? Who just has one?

251
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,410
But sure enough, I did
have a friend, yeah.

252
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,950
With this, this is Karen's first movie.
She's, this is the first movie she, Yep.

253
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:02,810
Yeah.

254
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,700
Pretty, pretty much all downhill
from here. Starting from the bottom.

255
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,930
Well, you're phenomenal at
getting down to get down to, um,

256
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,630
so I want to go to go around and what
are your character's greatest weakness or

257
00:16:16,631 --> 00:16:19,180
weaknesses? So we'll start with you.
Well, you could actually, David,

258
00:16:19,181 --> 00:16:22,030
if you could do Jareds because he's
not here for Jared Leto for the joker.

259
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:24,430
But let's start with you. But your
greatest weakness, your character,

260
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,250
a character's greatest weakness.
Well,

261
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:31,251
what's interesting about dead shot is he
looks at his love for his daughter as a

262
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:38,080
weakness, which is really interesting
when you talk about, you know, good,

263
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,650
bad and evil, right? So in his mind,

264
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,280
he considers his daughter his
Achilles heel. God, if it,

265
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,510
if I didn't love this girl, I could just
kill people and not feel bad about it.

266
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:54,690
But I got this chick now I feel
bad when I picked miss this guy.

267
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,270
All right, so it's like, it's
flipped in his mind. What,

268
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:01,900
what is good and bad and right and wrong?

269
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,380
Um, I'd say June, like
you got to cut it yet

270
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,080
it was an accident,
but it was really cool.

271
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,270
I think so. Yes, I do. I tried to us.

272
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,670
So I'd say June means weakness is probably
the enchantress and the enchantress

273
00:17:14,671 --> 00:17:15,930
is weakness is probably June.

274
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,480
Well, I thought about that. Farm ditzy.

275
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,050
So the joker's weakness is probably a
Harley Quinn and it's definitely a love

276
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:34,540
hate, uh, you know, relationship.
And I think that he hates study,

277
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,380
loves her and would never admit that he
loves her and he doesn't even know that

278
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:39,510
he loves her and he doesn't even
know that he's capable of love.

279
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:43,260
And I don't think any of us are sure
if he, if he even is capable of love.

280
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,990
I want to know David's weakness.

281
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,280
Oh yeah. Not Us, us,

282
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:55,620
you guys.
Um,

283
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,760
Holly's weakness.
I mean the obvious answer is the joker,

284
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:02,750
but I think it's actually his self
esteem and that's why the joke is her

285
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,673
weakness.

286
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,540
Okay.

287
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,350
Uh, Diablo, his weakness is
probably his family. Simple as that,

288
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,513
right?

289
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah. I'd go with the same
kind of theme that flags,

290
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:21,980
weaknesses, uh, is his
love for June or honey,

291
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,070
but that's awesome. But that's
also strength. It's also strength.

292
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,980
Absolutely. Strength. Strength to, it's
like, it's two sides of the same coin.

293
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,980
I think Katana's weakness is
her willingness to, you know,

294
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,020
sacrifice her own life for justice.
Or you know,

295
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:42,280
for a husband.

296
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,070
Yes.
He was in a sword.

297
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,900
Euler, Jeez, I can't do this.

298
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,173
Yeah,

299
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,280
he's in. He's in, that's the word.
And don't think you just know that.

300
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:04,840
That's now Adam Guy caught up.
Yeah.

301
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,740
Damn it out. Um, I mean,

302
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,060
this guy over here like
spoilers all the time. I mean,

303
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,410
really,

304
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,100
we all work so hard and then I like
that comes along and just ruins it for

305
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:22,360
everyone.
I mean,

306
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:29,710
slipknots is just women. He, he
likes and he likes, time them up,

307
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:35,060
gets caught looking at women. That's
basically it. No, no, no. Not,

308
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,100
not Adam.
Slipknot to character.

309
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,770
Character. Okay. Um,

310
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,123
women.

311
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,370
Boom. Right? He's got a Bruno, he's
got, got a weakness for plush toys.

312
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,410
Weak at the knees.

313
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,610
Well, a suicide squad is out August
5th, Friday. I'll get spit this week.

314
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,220
It is absolutely phenomenal. We cannot
think guys enough for being here.

315
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:07,054
Thank you guys so much.

316
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,820
[inaudible].
