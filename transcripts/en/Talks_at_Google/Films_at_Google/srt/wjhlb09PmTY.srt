1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:06,630
[inaudible]

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,900
I'm Richard Generous, uh, for those of
you don't know me, head of news at Google,

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,790
but that's not what
we're here about today.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,330
We're here to talk about
Hollywood and is fascinated,

5
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:18,950
is sometimes folks are
with the tech sector. Uh,

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,440
we know people are even more fascinated
with Hollywood and, and we are too.

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,880
We share that. So I'm really
delighted to have you both here today.

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,110
So when we first said, just start by
having, by, by giving a bit of background,

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,240
first of all, Michael,
Michael Stuhlbarg, um, you,

10
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:40,960
you're one of those phenomenally talented
actors who I, who I sort of feel that,

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,330
that many of us may not know,

12
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:46,900
but we do know in the sense that you,

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,210
you so immerse yourself in your roles,
that you lose your own personal identity.

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,680
Um, which is I think, a
remarkable, truly remarkable thing.

15
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,590
Uh, but for those who
aren't as familiar, just,

16
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,100
I'll just mention a few of
the highlights, uh, that,

17
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,010
that quietly vicious
mob boss, uh, you know,

18
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:09,490
Arnold Rothstein and
boardwalk empire. Uh, the,

19
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:11,790
the hauntingly trouble Larry,
uh,

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,410
Gopnik and the in the Cohen
brothers movie a, a serious man. Um,

21
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,270
and then more recently, uh,
someone I know you portrayed, uh,

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,430
the Mac programming genius,
a Andy Hertzfeld in Steve Jobs.

23
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,510
Uh, uh, look forward to getting
some perspective on that.

24
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,590
And of course in Trumbo,
the,

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,710
that deeply conflicted and key role
of the actor Edward G. Robinson.

26
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:39,430
So, uh, thank you for being with us today.

27
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,860
Glad you can join us. And then we
get to Jay Roach, Jay Roach is by,

28
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,850
by many accounts, uh, the
nicest men in Hollywood. Um,

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,260
and, and interestingly, you
have not let that hold you back.

30
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,600
It's not stopped, can be, uh,

31
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,980
a kind of left handed compliment you,
you know,

32
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,280
you don't necessarily get a,
you know,

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,710
get a lot of respect instantly when that's
the first thing people say about you.

34
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:11,010
But, but I'll take it. I like
people and you know, I'm glad,

35
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,450
I'm glad that that comes across
well in it, in it does come across

36
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,391
and no,

37
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:21,391
it's not stopped you from becoming a
extraordinarily successful as a director,

38
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,900
uh, with many films across
many genres. Uh, uh,

39
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,760
you have course the tremendous commercial
success with the Austin Powers movies

40
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:35,200
with meet the parents, meet
the Fockers, uh, you also,

41
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:39,190
which many folks might know
produced the, uh, two of those,

42
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:43,830
a outrageous Sasha Baron Cohen,
uh, films, uh, Barat and,

43
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,170
and Bruno. Um, very
interesting shift there.

44
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,360
And in the last several years,
you've,

45
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,340
you've directed a number of more political
films with a recount about the Bush

46
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,160
corps, uh, presidential election, uh,

47
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,520
game change about John and,

48
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,970
and the intimate Sarah Pailin and
you're just finishing shooting. Uh,

49
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,030
is it recalled Lyndon Baines Johnson the
stage play Lbj on her way all the way

50
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,120
into a film. Um, and of course, uh,

51
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,620
what we're here to talk about today,
uh, with, with Trumbo. And by the way,

52
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:21,280
if this guy doesn't need an
additional coolness factor,

53
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,880
he's been married over 20 years
to a bangle, Susanna Hoffs,

54
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,440
that's probably the best,

55
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,380
the more, you know, tables at restaurants
than anything else. It's my wife.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,860
Exactly. So, um, but today we're
going to talk about uh, about Trumbo.

57
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,810
Uh,
your film about Dalton Trumbo,

58
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:44,640
the legendary screenwriter who in the
face of the communist witch hunts of the

59
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,870
forties and 50s,

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,320
became a true American hero in his
efforts to defend the first amendment and

61
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:55,710
free expression. So, uh, obviously
we'll, we'll talk a lot about that.

62
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,750
One bit of disclosure before we begin
from my end is that I should come clean on

63
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:02,870
is at 35 years ago, I was, uh,

64
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,850
usually fortunate enough to convince a,

65
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:10,570
an amazing woman by the name of
Mitzi Trumbo, uh, to marry me. Um,

66
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,530
and her dad of course is,
is Dalton Trumbo.

67
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,920
And over the years I got federally
immersed in the close knit families

68
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:22,750
challenge, uh, with the blacklist
years and a challenge. It was, I mean,

69
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,070
mid to the age of eight was,

70
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:29,700
was kicked out of these junior girl scouts
called the blue birds because her dad

71
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:31,860
was a, was a commie. I mean, it was,

72
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:36,420
it was real stuff and challenging
stuff and hurtful stuff. Um,

73
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,860
and over the last two years,

74
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:42,690
I've had the great pleasure to get to
know you and many members of the cast in

75
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:47,050
the making of this film. So, but
let's get to the meat of this. Uh, uh,

76
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,810
why don't you introduce the
story of, of Trumbo, um, and,

77
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:52,501
and as you're doing,

78
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:56,880
so give us a sense of why you felt it was
important to make the movie. Yeah, sure.

79
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,570
Uh,

80
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,470
the,
the,

81
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,580
the kind of a one paragraph Hook that
got me was Dalton Trumbo was one of the

82
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:08,130
most successful mainstream
screenwriters in Hollywood, uh,

83
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,640
in 1947,
um,

84
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,640
and was suddenly deemed a threat.
Uh,

85
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,700
an enemy of the state called
subpoenaed to testify, um,

86
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,300
decides he won't testify and won't
answer the questions about what political

87
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,920
affiliations do you have, who are
your friends that might have, uh,

88
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,770
some kind of ties to, to a
leftist organizations. And he,

89
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,850
by refusing is charged with contempt
of Congress and goes to jail,

90
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,290
immediately gets blacklisted
by the studios who all
agreed that anybody who was

91
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,980
part of the Hollywood 10
would have to be fired. Uh,

92
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,240
and the blacklist began based on
these 10 men who were called up.

93
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,080
He though, instead of succumbing, uh,

94
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,160
writes screenplays for the next
13 years under other names, uh,

95
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,470
and encourages other writers
to do the same thing.

96
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,270
Ends up winning two Academy Awards
for two beautiful movies, uh,

97
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,150
Roman holiday and the brave
on and then write Spartacus.

98
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,340
And which by suddenly are
finally being named, uh,

99
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,340
you know, the back of the
blacklist kind of dissolves.

100
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,920
Otto Preminger announces that
he's gonna put his name on a,

101
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,000
Trump has name on exodus and Kirk
Douglas puts his name on Spartacus.

102
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:30,740
And in a way, the spell is broken
by, by just writing. You know,

103
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:31,041
they,

104
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:35,270
that just by writing great screenplays
he gets and the other writers doing the

105
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:35,901
same thing,
it,

106
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:40,901
it exposes the blacklist for being just
not only lunacy and unfair and unjust,

107
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:47,360
but also completely ineffective,
didn't accomplish anything. And, uh,

108
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:50,590
and he kind of throws water on
the wicked witch, you know, um,

109
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,340
in this case played by Helen Mirin,
uh, Hedda hopper, the, uh, the,

110
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,250
the infamous gossip columnists.
So that's a little more than a paragraph,

111
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,780
but that's, that was the hook for me. I
was like, oh my God, how did this happen?

112
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:06,290
I can't believe this
happened. And, uh, you know,

113
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,690
how I'd like to find out everything,

114
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,940
everything I can about this story.
Um,

115
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,870
and to figure out what it had to
do with today too. That was a big,

116
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,430
a big part of it for me as well.
You know, interestingly, um, as, as,

117
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,810
as you know, when he testified,
uh, he and the Hollywood 10, uh,

118
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,500
did not, as others did plead
the fifth amendment, which says,

119
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:31,650
I will not incriminate myself. They
pleaded the First Amendment right, uh,

120
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,460
based on their belief that they had the
right to express themselves and to think

121
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:40,370
your thoughts without government
questioning. Um, as you know, um,

122
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,920
uh, yes, held in contempt,

123
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,420
found guilty and the supreme court
upheld that a conviction, well,

124
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:51,840
basically by re, by choosing because
they, there was a liberal majority, uh,

125
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:54,890
at the time they started this process and
they thought the first amendment would

126
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,240
get them through it.

127
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,740
And even if it didn't that eventually
the Supreme Court would throw it all out

128
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:00,850
as being ridiculous,
but,

129
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,700
but then to liberal justices
died within a month and a,

130
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,410
and so the supreme court, by refusing
to hear the appellate decision,

131
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,200
essentially a validated it and,
and the, uh, the conviction stood.

132
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,810
Yeah, it was a pretty, it's an
amazing, uh, it's an amazing, um,

133
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,130
predicament these guys kind of put
themselves into, in a way they,

134
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,260
they were so a progressive and
thoughtful and, and, and, uh,

135
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,470
defensive of certain, like
union, you know, issues.

136
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:38,300
They were very antifascist and somehow
they kind of became targets because,

137
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,830
uh, people who wanted to calls, you know,

138
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,560
people unamerican who were a
little more progressive, uh,

139
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,300
succeeded in exploiting the fears and
just went after. And by the way, writers,

140
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:53,450
nine of the 10 of them were writers
who were always the first ones that get

141
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:57,710
thrown under the bus in Hollywood.
Um, so, uh, it was, uh, yeah,

142
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,670
it was an interesting that,
that decision,

143
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,010
we portray that decision to choose the
first amendment over the fifth, uh,

144
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,810
and just, uh, to, to actually,

145
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,280
they decided very carefully to answer
the questions, answer all the questions,

146
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,630
but in their own way,

147
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:17,631
which meant a kind of interesting
circuitous way back to always.

148
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,710
You really don't have any right to be
asking this. I'll answer in my own way,

149
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,210
but I'm just going to keep reminding.

150
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:28,170
You have no right to ask me about my union
affiliation, my political affiliation,

151
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:31,980
or who my friends are who might
have similar affiliations. Exactly.

152
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,890
So
as we know of that period,

153
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,080
a lot of folks were forced
in a very difficult position.

154
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,990
So let's let Michael, let's look
at your role in Trumbo. You,

155
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:48,950
you play the, the acting legend
and Edward G. Robinson, uh,

156
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,960
the gangster of all gangsters that
were, um, and, and Robinson well,

157
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:58,100
deeply opposed to the committee's
efforts. Uh, and, and,

158
00:09:58,101 --> 00:10:01,520
and certainly had his,
his political leanings were,

159
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:04,370
were far more left than not.
In the end,

160
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:09,230
he eventually named names. Um,
you know, it's a complex role.

161
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,270
It's the role in a sense.

162
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:15,410
It's the position that none of us wants
to ever be in of having to make those

163
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:19,520
kinds of decisions. In fact,
as, as Trumbo once said,

164
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:23,270
after the blacklist period,
there were no heroes.

165
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:28,390
There were only victims because everyone
was ultimately forced to do things they

166
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:34,310
would not have otherwise done.
So from your perspective,

167
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,620
uh, you know, and sort of what
made you take this role and, and,

168
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,630
and how did you approach it,
that level of complexity?

169
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,490
Um,
well,

170
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:51,491
Jay presented me with the opportunity and
we sat down and had a meal and chatted

171
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:53,150
about the prospect of it.

172
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:57,560
I was just coming off of about four
years of working on boardwalk empire in

173
00:10:57,561 --> 00:11:00,770
playing someone who was
renowned as a kind of gangster.

174
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:05,360
And I was a little concerned that maybe
I would be taking on something too

175
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:08,400
similar, uh, with the life
of Edward Robinson. But I,

176
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,430
I had started looking up
information about him and, uh,

177
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,270
they couldn't have been more different
except the fact that they lived at a

178
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:18,960
certain time. And that, uh,

179
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,540
Mr. Robinson for a while got
to be known as someone, uh,

180
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,560
in the gangster world.
Uh,

181
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:33,010
so I read a lot about him and I watched
his movies and was delighted at the

182
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:38,990
fact, uh, that, uh, uh,

183
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,940
relearning about somebody who I thought
was one thing and he turned out to be a

184
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:46,910
whole other thing altogether.
Um,

185
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,370
in terms of what is
nature was like, what, uh,

186
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,703
the,
uh,

187
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:59,610
and then the size of his talent in terms
of the kinds of roles he was capable of

188
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:04,960
playing as opposed to the ones that he
had in some cases became famous for. Uh,

189
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,020
but I learned about his love of art,
his massive art collection.

190
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:12,550
I learned about his life in the
theater before all of that, uh,

191
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,470
about his political
affiliations, about, um,

192
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,290
how generous of a spirit he was, how he
would give money to anybody who asked,

193
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,700
um, and, uh, how he was, you know,

194
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:29,080
one of the friendliest guys in, in the
community, in the Hollywood community.

195
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:33,490
But he loved him, you
know, so, uh, as the,

196
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,910
uh, all of this political
stuff started heating up,

197
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,990
he kinda got torn in between,
uh,

198
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,280
a lot of different factions in
terms of his own friendships.

199
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:46,803
Um,

200
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,600
and then he started a showing up
on what they called gray lists,

201
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,860
which were people who were,
uh, being lumped together, uh,

202
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,420
into, uh, onto lists of,
of suppose it communists,

203
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:04,780
but had not joined the party.
He was very political.

204
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:09,690
He was a liberal democrat. Um, and,

205
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,033
um,

206
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,950
yeah, he, uh, um, he,

207
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,960
he found himself in a
position that became quite,

208
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,120
quite difficult, um, and went out
of his way to get in front of the,

209
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,480
the Hugh Act Committee to
explain his affiliations to,

210
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,130
to explain where he gave money,

211
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:35,131
why he gave him money and a otherwise
it seemed as though people just weren't

212
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:37,910
going to hire him anymore. Yeah. Uh,

213
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:43,030
so in the end he had to get up there and
say some things that he did not want to

214
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,870
say, and he had set himself that had
it been a different day or, you know,

215
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,240
had he not been under the
stresses that he was under,

216
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:50,770
he may not have done what he did,

217
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,820
but he did and lived with it.
Uh,

218
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,870
eventually got to go back to work again.
Um,

219
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,250
but he doesn't seem to be one of those
individuals who was lumped together with

220
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:07,870
those people who were
supposedly, uh, uh, um,

221
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,910
considered those who named names.
He gave them information they already had.

222
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,250
Uh, it's a, he's lived a
fascinating life. Uh, and,

223
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:23,020
um, you know, I listened to his voice
a lot. I watched those performances,

224
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:28,021
particularly around the 1947 48 period
in which he had pretty much exhausted

225
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:34,480
being a leading man and was starting
to venture into the world of,

226
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,680
of uh, getting what was
called character parts. Um,

227
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,690
and,
uh,

228
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,760
and I watched as much as I
could about who he was, uh,

229
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,150
away from the iconic, you
know, cigar chomping gangster.

230
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,060
A lot of people knew him as,
um, and found him to be quite,

231
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,470
um,
area date.

232
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,730
And our script written by John Mcnamara,
uh,

233
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,480
really explores more of that
personal side than it does, um,

234
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,510
the icon that he was known before.

235
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,010
Yeah.
And as you and your character point out,

236
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,860
the blacklists destroyed the careers
of thousands and thousands of people in

237
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:22,350
Hollywood, most who never had the
opportunity to truly develop a career. Uh,

238
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,660
interestingly, uh, you
know, writers, um, uh,

239
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,890
could do work under an assumed
name started to be very clear.

240
00:15:29,891 --> 00:15:33,370
They went from making large sums
of money to tiny sums of money.

241
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,810
But as you point out,
you can't act under an assumed face.

242
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,050
You have only one

243
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,750
these days. You might be able
to actually though, you know,

244
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:46,230
with the digital technology, uh, yeah,

245
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,570
he couldn't do it at that time.

246
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,590
That's when it, that's one of the most,
um, compelling parts of the whole Trumbo,

247
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,030
the Hollywood 10 story Wa was,
was Energy Robinson's dilemma.

248
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:02,090
And it got to that question that we hope
the film puts in front of any audience

249
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:08,220
member, which is what would you do? What
would you do if you really had no choice?

250
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,270
Trumbo did have a certain kind of a
set of choices which was just cave and

251
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:16,080
disappear or keep writing. But
other, uh, other keep writing,

252
00:16:16,081 --> 00:16:19,410
but under other names,
uh, actors, directors,

253
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:23,250
I happen to have a directing teacher
who was one of the Hollywood 10,

254
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:26,580
Edward Dmytryk, uh, who taught at
USC when I went to film school there,

255
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,750
he was the only non writer,
uh, you know, of the 10, he,

256
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,180
he was put in jail for the same reason,

257
00:16:33,181 --> 00:16:36,990
blacklisted and then decided to come back,
uh,

258
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:42,020
and name names and he named a few names
who hadn't been known to the committee

259
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,880
supposedly. And, um, uh,

260
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,780
by the time my God to be a student of his,

261
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,970
you could see the, the co
the damage, you know, of the,

262
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,200
just how conflicted he
was as a person need our,

263
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:57,840
he'd made a whole bunch of films.
He had,

264
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,440
he had made this decision and got work
out of the decision. You got work.

265
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,040
He started to be able to make money again,
we're it all his writer friends, many,

266
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,920
many of them lost their homes,
lost their,

267
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,360
their families in some
cases lost their health.

268
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,770
And then there were even suicides.

269
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,280
So I'm sure there was a kind
of survivor guilt. I mean,

270
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:17,910
this is just me speculating. I never
really spoke to him in depth about it.

271
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:21,850
He didn't really like talking
about it for lots of reasons. Um,

272
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,760
but that the, that same dilemma
was similar to a energy Robinson.

273
00:17:26,761 --> 00:17:30,960
There was no choice. There wasn't another
way through it, the way there was for,

274
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:31,950
uh,
for the writers.

275
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,480
Okay. In your view? Um, you know, I,

276
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:40,320
I'm actually one of the reasons
you'd do a film like this is to, um,

277
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,330
is to convey that story and
convey the lessons within it. Um,

278
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,830
as I think you pointed out,
um, in the political that

279
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,450
the greatest tool of all his fear.
Yeah. So when you look at this,

280
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,980
yeah, we'll, we actually learn a
lesson. Can this happen? Again,

281
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,280
it's a, it's a really hard question to
answer without speculating, but you,

282
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,420
you do see a pattern in
political propaganda too.

283
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,130
If you want people to conform or do what
you want them to do as opposed to what

284
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:15,060
they want to do,

285
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:20,540
the way to intimidate them and in some
cases bullied them is to hurl labels at

286
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:27,240
them that conjure up fears of
real threats. In this case,

287
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:32,100
it was totalitarian communism that was
real. Russia had occupied eastern Europe.

288
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:35,720
There were very deliberate
efforts to by the rush to, uh,

289
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,560
by Soviet Union to extract
secrets of how to build a bomb.

290
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:42,660
And that's where their
knowledge of the bomb came from,

291
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:46,800
was spies from an American scientist.
So that was all real.

292
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,700
But by calling someone a
communist, Eh, you know, or, or a,

293
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:55,140
in this case Trumbo was a comics bike
by calling him a trader and accusing him

294
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:57,660
of being a puppet of Russia,

295
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:02,920
then you could neutralize him.
And nowadays it would be, um,

296
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,860
calling someone a, you know, friendly
to terrorism or somehow unamerican uh,

297
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:12,030
you know, in a, in a world
post nine 11. So it is,

298
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,920
I do fear, feel like, uh, that, uh,

299
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,200
fear is the most useful propagandist
tool and the most useful political

300
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,850
manipulation tool. And you see
in, in today, you still see a,

301
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,530
you know, ridiculous waste of
taxpayers' money, uh, by Congress.

302
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,360
People trying to make
names for themselves,

303
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:38,250
doing congressional investigations that
lead nowhere. I mean, that, this, the,

304
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:40,680
the investigation of the queue,
I can lead to nothing.

305
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:44,010
There no was no one ultimately
charged with any real subversion,

306
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:48,990
no films pulled out, you know, or even
even, you know, banned or censored.

307
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,740
There was, they couldn't point to any
one particular case. It was just, well,

308
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:55,890
he might've known somebody
who knew somebody who maybe
had something to do with

309
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:58,860
that other thing.
It was all hearsay.

310
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:03,780
And that stuff is easy to manipulate and,
and,

311
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:08,310
and it does happen today. It happens
in every, in every era. I think. So.

312
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,380
I hope the film just raises your,
raises, people's skepticism,

313
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,570
keeps the conversation going a about
where are we being manipulated, ah,

314
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,830
based on fear as opposed to being a,
you know,

315
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,200
asked to consider anything that's
a genuine threat around us.

316
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,450
And in doing that often the
misuse of labels, you know, the,

317
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:33,930
the equation of communism who terrorized
totalitarian handle the equation of

318
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:38,850
being Muslim with being a terrorist. Yeah.
It's so easy to twist these and, and,

319
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:41,610
and, and use these for,
and they're really bad,

320
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:46,670
bad ideas that the idea that all Muslims
are terrorists is a great example of

321
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,590
it.
That's a,

322
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:52,590
that's a kind of bizarre mutated
equivalents that costs people,

323
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,480
you know,
in some cases their lives.

324
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,200
There's some there it can fan
as sort of hate based, uh,

325
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,580
approach to life, you know. Uh, and
so it's such a cynical, a choice too,

326
00:21:08,581 --> 00:21:13,450
to use fear that way. Just to try to
get people to conform or be more like,

327
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,500
you know, you want the world to be. Yeah.

328
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,530
Well let, let's, let's shift it a
touch lighter. Yeah. Sorry. Um, so,

329
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,560
uh, so early you assembled
a marvelous, cashed, uh,

330
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,840
with Trumbo in addition to Michael,
you know, Helen Mirren, Louis C, k e,

331
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:34,030
John Goodman, Elle fanning. Um,
but also you landed Walter White,

332
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,830
um, another well known gangster, you know,

333
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,560
the beloved Bryan Cranston.
And interestingly,

334
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:45,700
you're working with him
again on, on Lbj. Um, so,

335
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:48,940
so what's the deal with that? I mean, is
it about that drugs? Is this, is this,

336
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,200
is this about crystal blue persuaded?

337
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,320
What does that, what's the
attraction? Just a, yeah,

338
00:21:54,321 --> 00:21:58,370
he got me hooked and then I have
to, to, to pay for my habit.

339
00:21:58,371 --> 00:22:02,750
I have to keep casting and foresight. No,
he's um, he's amazing. That's what it is.

340
00:22:02,751 --> 00:22:03,380
It just a,

341
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:08,380
and he has not just the passion
and depth of someone like Trimble,

342
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:11,000
but he has the wit and that,
that that's,

343
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,810
it does give me a chance to transition
to something else that goes on in our

344
00:22:14,811 --> 00:22:15,644
film.

345
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:20,390
There is humor and we have Louis Ck in
the film and we have John Goodman and my,

346
00:22:20,391 --> 00:22:22,640
one of my favorite scenes in
the whole film attacking a,

347
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:26,920
a union leader who's trying to
pressure him into caving to, uh,

348
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,920
to the House on American activities,
uh, committees, desire to,

349
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:33,840
to not employ blacklisted people.
Uh,

350
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,750
and it's because so many of these guys
coped with this predicament by being

351
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,340
hilarious. Uh, Trumbo was famously funny,

352
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,040
uh, in, in letters, many,

353
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:50,480
many letters he wrote from jail to
his family, to his, you know, to,

354
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:53,180
to Mitzi saying, ego is upper
and go to bed. You know,

355
00:22:53,181 --> 00:22:56,300
like as if he was still there
in the room and, and to enemies.

356
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,650
He called one enemy, one, one, one
producer who had betrayed him, uh,

357
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,400
who was trying to have it both ways, a
political hermaphrodite. I was like, Oh,

358
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:08,180
I wish I could, you know, Landa,
an insult like that to someone.

359
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,030
And He,
they were all funny.

360
00:23:11,031 --> 00:23:15,650
His own funeral turned into a roast
because his buddies just couldn't help

361
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:18,650
themselves. Big, give him a hard
time, you know, even in the grave.

362
00:23:18,651 --> 00:23:21,920
And that's the kind of guys they were.

363
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:25,820
So in it licensed us to,
to be more authentic.

364
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,100
We needed comedy actually.

365
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,840
And even in the midst of all of
this kind of psychological terror,

366
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:37,790
if you will. Um, there was, there
had to be humor. And so we cast,

367
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,440
uh, you know, a whole people
with a whole range of, of skills.

368
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,690
There's some, um, Edward G. Robinson
has a couple of really great lines.

369
00:23:47,691 --> 00:23:51,640
Uh, when he, when he talks about the
NPA and says they're all fascist,

370
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:53,120
that they just don't have
that they're all Nazis.

371
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:56,090
They just don't have the uniforms.
I mean, everyone who's in, in,

372
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:01,390
in the middle of horrible sort of
crisis and battle can also be funny,

373
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:03,320
uh,
to cope with it.

374
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,470
Well, let me pursue that notion
of just a little bit further, um,

375
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:13,760
because you, you have done,
uh, you know, serious films,

376
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:19,110
films with serious subject matter,
um, and, and obviously, uh,

377
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,580
many films like that. You know, I'm a
big fan of Paul Thomas Anderson Films,

378
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:25,770
but you know, they're
different. Um, and, and,

379
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,770
and often not accessible,
but I, which makes me wonder,

380
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,200
as you approach a serious subjects,

381
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:38,201
do you explicitly go after the use of
comedy as a means of making the subject

382
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:42,020
more approachable?

383
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,180
Well, I don't, I mostly, again,

384
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:47,630
I just try to have it honor the story and
honor the characters. I'm going to end,

385
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:51,670
by the way I, I can think of an
exception to what you were just saying.

386
00:24:51,671 --> 00:24:55,580
It using an actress who I worked at the,
um, Julianne Moore in Boogie Nights,

387
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:57,500
boogie nights is so dark,

388
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:02,390
it's so twisted and it has some really
funny performances by Bill Macy, uh,

389
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:06,860
by Julianne Moore and, uh, casting
someone like Julianne to play.

390
00:25:06,861 --> 00:25:10,410
Sarah Palin is a great example because
she gets where the ironies are.

391
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:14,810
She gets the absurdities and she's playing
them with a complete total commitment

392
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:19,760
to capturing the essence of that person.
But there is with their, you know,

393
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:24,440
and I, that's why I cast people like
Michael Stuhlbarg and John Goodman and,

394
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:28,580
and, and Brian too. But we
have Louis CK plying, you know,

395
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:29,870
a hardline communists.

396
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,190
And the reason is because we needed
someone to the left of Trumbo, who was,

397
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:34,581
you know,

398
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:38,210
had joined the Communist Party during
the war when we were aligned with a

399
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:39,290
communist superpower.

400
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:44,450
But we needed someone much who
was actually a good party member,

401
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:46,430
which was Louis Ck is character.

402
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,620
Whereas Trumbo was not that
great of a party member.

403
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:51,020
He wasn't that conformist
even to the Communist Party.

404
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:57,080
So he now you have someone like Louis C
K busting him for being a hypocrite and

405
00:25:57,081 --> 00:26:00,290
for being so full of himself
and, and for, as he says,

406
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,830
talking like every single thing he's going
to say is going to be chiseled into a

407
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:06,970
rock. You know, that's,
that's why you that,

408
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:11,971
that they're the actual men themselves
made an obligation to cast funny people

409
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:14,990
because they were funny
just to be authentic.

410
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,570
Yeah. Um, let me shift a bit. Um,

411
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,760
over the years, my wife and I often joke
when we see a film that start off with,

412
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:28,960
based on a true story, which is
not the case with trombone. Uh,

413
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,100
we always had to Wikipedia and aero is
to find out that more often than not,

414
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,480
the keyword is based.
Not True. Um, uh, and,

415
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,130
and of course there's been a lot of
discussion about that recently. Uh,

416
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,710
most specifically with the
film Steve Jobs, you know,

417
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,870
Aaron Sorkin and sin in their criticism
of Aaron Sorkin with regard to his,

418
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,200
his take license is license with,
uh,

419
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,620
with that real life
character into a character.

420
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:59,640
And a lot of people say did
not really exist. So, um,

421
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:05,280
Michael First, um, again, you
played a real life character
with Edward G. Robinson.

422
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:08,220
You didn't have the benefit of
spending any time with Edward G.

423
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,660
Robinson since he's long passed,
deceased,

424
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,940
but you also played a real life character
with Andy Hertzfeld in Steve Jobs. So,

425
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,990
you know, from your perspective
as an actor, how do you approach,

426
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,980
how do you approach these roles that
are obviously not based on fictional

427
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:27,780
characters? I mean, what's your approach
to, to the verse similitude I mean, is it,

428
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:30,510
is it impressionistic? Is it
realistic? What do you strive for

429
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,470
truth, however, right. I

430
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,620
can get to it, I suppose.
Uh, yeah, I mean,

431
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:41,240
my experience on Steve Jobs was unique
in that it was the very first time I got

432
00:27:41,241 --> 00:27:44,840
to meet the person that I
was going to be playing, um,

433
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,280
uh, at a different time in
his life. I'll be it, uh,

434
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,170
or three different times in his life.

435
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:56,060
But it was a wonderful opportunity for
me to observe him, to asking questions,

436
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:59,030
to absorb as much of
his energy as I could.

437
00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:03,710
And he was free with his time and was
very honest with all of his experiences

438
00:28:03,711 --> 00:28:07,580
regarding Mr Jobs. And, um, he
couldn't have been kinder to me and,

439
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,170
and more generous.
Uh,

440
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:14,330
so that was a very positive experience and
really it's my job to be, you know, to,

441
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,560
to not judge anything, just to absorb
it and try to reflect that back,

442
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,730
I guess.

443
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:24,730
And taking into account as well the text
that I am given to tell that story with

444
00:28:25,251 --> 00:28:28,280
Mr Sorkin's dialog. You know, there's,

445
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,460
there's no improvisation in terms of,
you know,

446
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:34,550
might participating in what
that story might be. It's,

447
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,740
it's there for me and,
uh,

448
00:28:36,741 --> 00:28:41,360
it's my job to give it truth,
give it life.

449
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,950
Uh, uh, interpret it. Um,

450
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:50,110
in this case it was a much more sort
of a collaborative process because I

451
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:51,651
became,

452
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:55,820
and often it's the case with telling
the story of somebody who actually lived

453
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,600
you.

454
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,070
I find that I have to become the authority
on that character because then nobody

455
00:29:01,071 --> 00:29:05,330
else has time in out to say,
well, actually, you know,
he did this or he did that.

456
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:10,160
I have to know as much as I can.
Uh, in the case of boardwalk empire,

457
00:29:10,161 --> 00:29:14,870
I got to know as much as I could about
Arnold Rothstein and, uh, and uh,

458
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,710
was able to, you know, throw
opportunities. It's just
about options, you know,

459
00:29:18,711 --> 00:29:23,120
say this happened, you know, if you want
to use it, that's great. In this case,

460
00:29:23,121 --> 00:29:27,080
it's not a story about necessarily
about Edward G. Robinson.

461
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:31,760
Our focus is Dalton Trumbo, so I offer
as much as I can. If it's helpful, great.

462
00:29:31,761 --> 00:29:36,270
If it's not a let it go,
you know, it's, uh, I,

463
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,540
uh,
I try to offer as much as I can.

464
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:41,830
I don't want to become a burden and I
don't want to overstep my boundaries,

465
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,660
but I feel like at least it's,
it's out there as an opportunity,

466
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:50,260
as something to, to share it, to
help with. Yeah. And by the way, I,

467
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,300
I happened to know Andy and I know he
very much appreciated your, your, uh,

468
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,910
uh, um, the way you played him. I'm
glad. I'm glad. I think that's the,

469
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:03,130
the thing is, is to, to be authentic,

470
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:06,710
to find an essential truth.
Um,

471
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,480
someone asked me, uh, when we were
screening in Toronto, you know,

472
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:14,260
how much of the film is not true?
And I said all of it,

473
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:19,840
you realize they're actors, right? You
realize that he's not an energy Robinson.

474
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:24,520
He's interpreting it. Richard Robinson.
It's not history. As John McNamara says,

475
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:27,550
it's a story about history.
And it is,

476
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:31,720
I think a little bit of a distraction
to focus so heavily when you're,

477
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:36,400
when you're watching a movie that's
derived from historical thing on all the

478
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:41,020
factual, you know, uh, uh,
accuracy. Things like, wait,

479
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:42,280
that didn't happen on that day.

480
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:46,480
That happened on a different day or that
that though, you know, this is their, um,

481
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,650
you know, they changed the names of that
character. They did this, that's not the,

482
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,530
the restaurant where this happened, that
happened at a different restaurant. Well,

483
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,910
if you are so slavish to
that level of accuracy,

484
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:01,690
you would have had to tell this film and
you'd have to sit in a theater for 13

485
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:04,150
years to watch it because we condensed it.

486
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,430
That didn't really happen in two hours.
It happened.

487
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,540
So the point is not to be facetious
about it because I do think there is

488
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:12,690
validity and comparing a truce,

489
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,000
true story to history.
That's,

490
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:20,230
there is something because you learn about
the storytelling from the differences,

491
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,090
but to dismiss a film,

492
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:27,090
which happens a lot these days and
some great films recently because it's

493
00:31:27,091 --> 00:31:31,390
somehow took license. I think
if it, if the license is,

494
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,120
gets you further from the truth of the,

495
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:37,570
essentially the essence of what happened
or the essence of who the people were,

496
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,550
that's a really legitimate criticism.
But if the film,

497
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,830
as we tried to do is trying so hard to
get it right in terms of what it was

498
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:52,720
about, what every character cared about,
um, who they were as people, what,

499
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,730
what,
what their dilemmas where and there,

500
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,820
then I think there is,

501
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,880
it would be ashamed to say no film is
valid if it's not perfectly adherent to

502
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:07,390
the, to the facts. Otherwise you
have to throw out Shakespeare.

503
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:10,570
You have to throw out.
There's never been a film,

504
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,030
never in the history of filmmaking.

505
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,280
And I would argue never in the
history of playwriting either,

506
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:20,170
that has been so faithful to the
facts that it couldn't be, uh,

507
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,980
you know, uh, um, you know, that
it couldn't be ripped apart.

508
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,640
And when you started comparing it to
what really happened, I think that,

509
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:32,530
I think that's very valid. Um, but it
is an interesting, interesting question.

510
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,120
We see this in the world of
politics. I mean, Cheney, for
instance, Dick Cheney was,

511
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:41,270
you know, the common technique. He was
the leak something to the New York Times,

512
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,560
right? And then three days later when
it was reported by the New York Times,

513
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:48,470
he'd point as reported in the New York
Times where he would actually manage to

514
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,780
transmute ally and too,

515
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:55,250
but I think there's a big difference
between claiming something is factually

516
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:59,840
accurate and and versus saying this
is a, an interpretation. For example,

517
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:04,040
we use a lot of archival footage in
the film to say this actually happened.

518
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:08,990
There's real Ronald Reagan sitting at a
table. There's uh, you know, the real,

519
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,820
the real room where this took place,
the walls of our set we're at,

520
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:18,710
we shot on green screen and he lack
hearings and went to DC and shot stills of

521
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:21,200
the actual walls of the actual room.
All right,

522
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:26,590
so we went to that level of accuracy
and then I do this trick I Dolly and on

523
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:31,250
Bryan Cranston as Trumbo intercut with
real footage of the real hearings.

524
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,960
Now our footage is made to look black
and white to match as if some in some

525
00:33:35,961 --> 00:33:37,070
weird reality.

526
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:41,660
Bryan Cranston's Trumbo is there at the
hearings in 1947 that you've just seen

527
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:46,661
actual footage from and I move the
edges of the screen out to the full one

528
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:52,160
widescreen format. I dissolve to color,
right? Is Bryan Cranston and saying,

529
00:33:52,161 --> 00:33:55,700
I'm not going to answer yes or no because
you know, to answer some questions,

530
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,100
yes or no,
you'd have to be a moron or a slave.

531
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,500
And we push in and put the sound
into the wide, the wide speakers,

532
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:04,580
you know the surround sound,

533
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:09,650
and I'm saying this is now
officially not history.

534
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,750
This is a construct.
This is an interpretation.

535
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,910
It's an actor who I've
craftily tried to blend in and,

536
00:34:15,911 --> 00:34:18,230
and take you there,
but remind you,

537
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,120
be skeptical and be a
participant and ask what's real,

538
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:25,520
what's not. That's part
of the deal here. You're,

539
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:29,480
you're being asked to take this as
an interpretation and go with it.

540
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:34,040
But I'm reminding you that I'm
going to mess with you. And that's,

541
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:36,260
I think that that's different from saying,

542
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:40,040
know what I'm saying is the facts and
you should base every decision in our

543
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:44,930
political system or whether we go
to war on, on this claim that I've,

544
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,590
that I'm due to it. Does that make sense?
Absolutely. And you know, I mean look,

545
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,310
you start from the basis
that what is truth?

546
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,620
I mean so much is perception and not,
yeah.

547
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,800
I mean there are very few things that we
can easily label is binary, true or not.

548
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,690
But then you ask, you know, Mitzi, uh, and
Nikki, you know what's true about this?

549
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:04,940
And there were lots of debates about some,

550
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,040
some licensed we took
and they were very valid.

551
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:10,060
And some in some cases they got us close
so much closer to the truth cause they

552
00:35:10,061 --> 00:35:13,250
gave the details of what really
felt like to be in that family.

553
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:18,490
But then they bow had to have said the
way Brian portrayed their father was so

554
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,920
close to some essential
truth of who he was.

555
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:26,030
That it was disconcerting sometimes
and even surreal. And that's,

556
00:35:26,031 --> 00:35:30,410
I think that's the greatest compliment
to how Brian came at it, was that he was,

557
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,620
he was that committed to the truth.
And I really think Michael's,

558
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,140
that story of Edward G.
Robinson is so heartbreaking to me.

559
00:35:36,141 --> 00:35:37,500
It was so important to,
and I,

560
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,460
he did go so much deeper than I
had time to go and each character,

561
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:46,190
so he would bring an idea, various cool,
simple detail that I love was that he,

562
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:50,010
Mac, John Mcnamara had it in
the thing that this first real,

563
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,160
the film within our film that goes
wrong in the middle of a take,

564
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,460
he flubs a line and he knew
from reading about about energy.

565
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,880
Robinson Robinson would never blow a line,
but he was terrible with props.

566
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,700
So we put in there that he,

567
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,660
he has a prop gun that he's supposed
to be super threatening with,

568
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:13,900
but in a weird gesture, the, he
mishandles the profit flies up,

569
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,180
the bullets fly out of the gun and land
all over the stage. And it was, it was,

570
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:23,390
it was so cool to know that that
was an essentially true part of who,

571
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,760
who Robinson was. Whereas what we
were going to have him do wasn't,

572
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,180
so we went for the
authentic thing, uh, as,

573
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:33,390
as close as we could and it just
enriched the story. And that's what,

574
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,720
that's what happens when you're working
with such a great actor who is so

575
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:38,940
committed to some,
to the,

576
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:43,690
to the nuances and the details that that
give something a life to it. That's,

577
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,930
that's, that was amazing. Well,
by the way, interestingly in my,

578
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,740
my wife not with Brian
refers to him as dad,

579
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:54,450
which is a little younger than both
of them. They seem doctor Freud,

580
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,240
exactly an answer to that.
So Michael,

581
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,390
let's switch that around again
because you've worked with,

582
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,660
with many filing directors and
imagine all of them have very,

583
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:07,150
very different approaches to
how they work with actors. Um,

584
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:12,150
do you select directors as carefully
as you select role? I wish.

585
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,040
What do you want? What do
I wanted to direct your
question? I was the answer that

586
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,740
no, I mean honestly it changes from
job to job because sometimes you can,

587
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:27,130
you can just know it in the deepest
part of who you are as to what a moment

588
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:29,000
should be about or what
a character is like.

589
00:37:29,001 --> 00:37:32,600
And other times you might
have no idea. So, uh,

590
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:37,601
in some cases I want to be a collaborator
and absolutely share every thought and

591
00:37:37,761 --> 00:37:42,320
idea with a director and to say, what
should we do together? What can we do?

592
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,550
Help me be on the outside,
help guide me through what I'm doing,

593
00:37:46,551 --> 00:37:51,320
cause I can't look at myself while I'm
doing this or I don't want to look at it

594
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:56,030
while I'm doing it. Um,
uh, uh, and in some cases,

595
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,150
I know a lot of actors don't
want any direction at all.

596
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,090
They just want to get up there
and do their thing and you know,

597
00:38:02,091 --> 00:38:06,440
you can cut it how you're going
to cut it. Uh, it's, it's,

598
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:10,200
it's often described as
a director's medium. Um,

599
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,850
and uh, I agree with that to
a great extent. However, uh,

600
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,410
depending upon the length of a shot,
you know,

601
00:38:18,411 --> 00:38:20,810
if you shoot something
for a very long time,

602
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:25,130
it depends upon what it is you're
shooting. So it's, it's, uh,

603
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,080
you know,

604
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:32,000
I like to think of the collaboration
with the director as a collaboration,

605
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,400
uh,
as opposed to there being any,

606
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:40,330
a sense of hierarchy. Uh, um,

607
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,100
and like I sort of inferred a,

608
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,510
it would be great if I could choose
which directors I wanted to work with.

609
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:49,810
In my case it's been
just dumb luck honestly,

610
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:53,530
to get to work with the folks
I've gotten to work with. Um,

611
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,740
and really just trying to
make the best of my situation.

612
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,480
Great.
Well,

613
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,900
we're at Google and we can't have a
conversation at Google without having some

614
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:05,400
question and related to
technology. Um, and you know,

615
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:08,740
obviously we're a company born of the
Internet and the Internet has had a

616
00:39:08,741 --> 00:39:11,600
massive impact on how all forms of,

617
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:14,520
of media of being
distributed and accessed. Um,

618
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:18,340
we talked once a about this
and you mentioned for instance,

619
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:22,120
how dramatically different the
financial structures and frankly,

620
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:24,130
compensation was based on say,

621
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:28,180
a studio financed and distributed
film versus an independent film.

622
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,130
And we're now potentially moving into
an era where there could be such a thing

623
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:37,960
as a self distributed film. Um,
what are your thoughts on that?

624
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:41,620
I mean, I, I know you're a very tech
savvy person, but how do you look at that?

625
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,770
I think, well, I, you know,

626
00:39:45,771 --> 00:39:49,700
I think most artists would answer
and say the more you could, uh,

627
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,550
connect directly to the audience.
You know, I was very envious of, uh,

628
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,520
listening to Louis Ck last
night. Talk about the way he, um,

629
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,400
you know, comedians work
their business when they're,

630
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,260
when they're working at the scale
he's working at where you go,

631
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:08,000
they go and rent a place, you think
of, Oh, I'm played Carnegie Hall,

632
00:40:08,001 --> 00:40:11,200
Carnegie Hall. So someone at Carnegie
Hall invited him in to come in and put a,

633
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:13,400
or Madison Square gardens. But, uh,

634
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:18,460
he like all comedians and I think most
musical acts to go and rent the space and

635
00:40:19,131 --> 00:40:21,140
then pay the overhead and pay.
But the,

636
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:25,340
the world of how it's done and all
the business is theirs. They own it.

637
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:30,110
And film has always been
owned by the studios,

638
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:32,270
every aspect of it,
including the copyright,

639
00:40:32,271 --> 00:40:35,680
which is always astonishing to me
that unlike in theater, uh, you know,

640
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:38,260
are the writers get to keep
their copyright and licensing.

641
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,570
The studios have set it
up early on that they,

642
00:40:41,571 --> 00:40:44,560
because they were the capitol
and the, the, the, the,

643
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,990
you needed the big buildings
and the big machines to do it.

644
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,800
They owned everything and
that worked out great.

645
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:55,760
And I think the studio system,
you know, made, has made so much,

646
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,390
so many great films. I've, I worked
almost all in the studio process.

647
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:02,090
I think in the comedy world in particular,
they're very good at it.

648
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,180
But I'm so glad to see
other models kicking in. Uh,

649
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,410
a,
I've had a great time working at Hbo.

650
00:41:09,411 --> 00:41:13,010
I think their model is really
interesting where they're just, you know,

651
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:17,570
not we can box office oriented or
not, uh, you know, ratings oriented.

652
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:22,930
But the new thing that Netflix and Amazon
and Google and apple to some extent to

653
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,290
where it's, it's a whole different, uh,

654
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:32,350
more I think more direct shot
to the consumer is promising.

655
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,500
And the, as the technology
simplifies, as you can see,

656
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:41,150
as you can actually shoot a
feature film on an iPhone now, um,

657
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,530
and cut it on an iPhone if you want, you
can cut but it's easier to use a laptop.

658
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:46,700
Uh,
you,

659
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:51,560
you may or may not still need to go
through such a gigantic bureaucratic,

660
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:56,660
um, sometimes, sometimes artistically
controlling organization to,

661
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:00,920
to speak what you,
to tell the story you want to tell.

662
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,110
That's thrilling. That is reeling
because it will become more like,

663
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:09,710
I'm just going to sit down and write a
novel today or, or a short story. You can,

664
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,390
you can, you know, my kids
are, my, my one son is,

665
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:17,150
is making short movies and he can
post them on youtube, you know,

666
00:42:17,151 --> 00:42:20,570
and they're there. And if you work
it out through, through whatever,

667
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:24,800
you can get a little piece
of the financial action, you
know, just, just yourself,

668
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:29,300
just you uploading it to
things. So I think that's, wow,

669
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:33,980
that's thrilling. And I, I see it as
the future, you know, it really is.

670
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,330
It's happening, but I mean, it's going
to really start happening now, uh,

671
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,550
in a very short, short term future,
I suspect to you, what do you think?

672
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,840
I think without question, I
mean, we have seen, you know,

673
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,300
as we've seen the internet evolve.
I mean,

674
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:51,470
the one thing that is clear is we're
seeing vastly more expression from vastly

675
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:55,890
more voices than we've ever seen in the
history of civilization. You know? Yeah.

676
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,670
Stop.

677
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,700
It's new. And News is, that
was the first to go. I mean,

678
00:42:59,701 --> 00:43:02,370
you can suddenly be your own news outfit.

679
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,430
Precisely. Yeah. And that's,
uh, you know, as I often say,

680
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,510
it's the back to the first amendment
again. It's a, you know, you can,

681
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,730
it's easy to look at the
Internet, uh, you know,

682
00:43:11,731 --> 00:43:15,880
in the United States and think of it as
the first amendment come to life in that

683
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,330
ability to have that access to
distribution. And now, you know,

684
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:22,320
the first amendment guarantees
you to write, to express yourself.

685
00:43:22,321 --> 00:43:26,410
It doesn't guarantee an audience who's
going to listen to or quality or quality.

686
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:29,900
And that is certainly true in
spades with the Internet. Uh,

687
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:33,810
I don't suggest that the Internet is the
solution to all things as I often point

688
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:38,280
out. It has value, but it
doesn't have values. Uh, it's,
it's all what we make of it.

689
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:42,480
That someday some other
longer conversation about
how news is evolved and how

690
00:43:42,481 --> 00:43:45,840
under the fairness doctrine and
when there were three networks,

691
00:43:45,841 --> 00:43:49,170
somehow news was so, uh, you know, so,

692
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:52,590
but it was controlled and we didn't know
how much you filtered it was, but it,

693
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,311
you know,

694
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:57,150
was it better back then with Walter
Cronkite and Huntley and Brinkley or,

695
00:43:57,151 --> 00:44:00,390
you know, did it ha, you know,
has it, has it evolved to a,

696
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,980
it's hard to tell when you
watch CNN and Fox and, you know,

697
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:08,180
it's hard to tell if they've got
better. So it's a really, uh,

698
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:12,200
it's a really interesting thing
of, of uh, yeah, what, what, um,

699
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,560
what the democratization of,
of our media has accomplished.

700
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,890
And I suspect that a jury
that will always please

701
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,730
be out. Yeah. And we never know.
I mean, cable, I, you know, I was,

702
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:25,190
I was there at the beginnings
of that and you know,

703
00:44:25,191 --> 00:44:28,880
cable television is actually proven to
be a rather remarkable disappointment for

704
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:29,960
the purposes of journalism.

705
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,610
It's turned into nothing more
than a continuous sequence
of confrontational chat

706
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:39,390
shows. Yeah. Um, uh, you know,
hopefully we'll see that.

707
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:43,520
And I think we are seeing will evolve
hopefully. Yeah. So promising for awhile.

708
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,390
Yeah,
it is.

709
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:49,170
I mean we're seeing great investigative
journalism done by small outfits that

710
00:44:49,171 --> 00:44:51,600
are willing Pulitzer prizes.
On the other hand,

711
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:55,260
I would suggest that the birther
movement would have not taken hold.

712
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,000
We're not to the fact that you can find
hundreds of sites that will back up

713
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,810
people's fears and disbeliefs.
Right. So as you point out, you know,

714
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,740
free expression doesn't guarantee quality.

715
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,990
It simply guarantees the opportunity
to put your voice out there.

716
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,080
And I think the challenge for all of us
in society now is to try to figure out

717
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:18,480
how do we sift through that to find a
way to separate to wit from which I have,

718
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:21,900
which I think is cool about some of the
stuff you guys are up to that, that is,

719
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:25,740
that is the p the pickle. And I think,
I do think it's a healthy thing,

720
00:45:25,741 --> 00:45:30,620
but it's going to be very chaotic for a
while, still longer. Um, um, before it's,

721
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:34,590
before it becomes, as, as it
lives up to the promise. Well,

722
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:38,490
I just want to thank you usually for
coming and spending the time here and, uh,

723
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,950
um, uh, for Googlers here for Googlers
every word watching the live stream,

724
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:47,460
and we'll have that video available on
Youtube for others to look at as well.

725
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,320
Okay, great. Yeah, thanks. Thank
you very much for having me.

726
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:53,580
Thank you.
