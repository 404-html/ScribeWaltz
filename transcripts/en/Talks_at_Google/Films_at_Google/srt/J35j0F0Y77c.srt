1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,530
Please welcome to the stage director,
Catherine Hardwicke,

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,280
actress Toni Collette and Jacqueline
Bisset and screenwriter and marina back.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,210
So how are you all doing? Pretty well.
Thanks. Yeah, thanks siding. Yeah,

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,630
glad to be here. And the brain test. Yeah.

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,750
So how did you all get
attached to the project? Uh

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,250
Oh, everyone's going to be okay with you.

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,810
It started, it did, it did, yes. Um,

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,120
wrote the screenplay and our director,
our director,

9
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:41,920
I'll produce a Chris Simon
had met Catherine at a film
festival and I think in

10
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:43,270
London and a few years back.
Yeah.

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,200
And when we were looking for a director
for our, for our film, he said,

12
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:50,500
I know just the person. And Luckily
Catherine said yes. So that's,

13
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:54,910
that's the short form. And Tony was
a mango tree and then there was,

14
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,390
there was a mango tree in there somewhere.

15
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,120
And then Tony was involved with
the project right from the start,

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,370
from way back when.

17
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,000
And then actually initially I was offered
to play the role of Jess and somebody

18
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,130
else was playing Millie and that's
somebody else dropped out. Yeah.

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,110
And it went through a few
different Millie's that
nobody was sticking and yeah,

20
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,680
well she just demanded that she was
going to be milling, let's be honest.

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,953
Eventually

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,550
to me was I was doing a play on Broadway
and I was playing was last year,

23
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:28,660
the realistic Joneses. And I was
playing a very capable, grounded,

24
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:32,830
solid person who holds the world together
for lots of other people. And, um,

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,910
I was frustrated at the last, Millie had
fallen out of my friends, said, well,

26
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,220
tell me about film because
I was so eager to make it.

27
00:01:39,221 --> 00:01:43,280
I was attached to it for several years
and I just think it's so special. Um,

28
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,630
and when I explained to the characters
and their dynamic, she was like,

29
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,780
why would you play that role again?
I've just watched you do it on stage,

30
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,530
you need to be the hot mess.
And so that's when I told the guy.

31
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,970
And then as soon as that happened,

32
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:58,690
actually everything lined up and fell
into place and it obviously it was meant

33
00:01:58,691 --> 00:01:59,524
to happen this way.

34
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,180
So you felt as if, um, the
characters were more or less,

35
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,930
you kind of got attached right
away when it comes to that,

36
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,640
or at least when you were introduced that,

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,590
oh, when I read it, it was
almost like I had no choice.

38
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:19,591
It was like a soul connection to this
story and I just fell in love with it and

39
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:23,730
I had to do it. It was an, it
was an, it was a need more. Yeah.

40
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,330
Oh, it was, it was, you know, Tony's kind
of passion for it was fantastic. Was it?

41
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:31,870
At times when you kind of think what,
you know, this is, this is, you know,

42
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,570
is the long haul. And then, and
then when Catherine also, you know,

43
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,710
join that was just, you know,
then it, then it really took off.

44
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:42,500
I did find out something last night from
one of Tony's longtime best friends, uh,

45
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,490
speaking about the hot. Yeah. It kind
of embarrassed. Okay. Because Tony,

46
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:51,360
you know, said, okay, you should play the
hotness, will your best, do your best.

47
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:54,540
Friends told me that she thought
this part was the closest to you.

48
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,830
Have any parts you've ever played?

49
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,860
I actually,

50
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,430
I think I'm a combination of both.
Yeah.

51
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,680
That could be embarrassing,
but it nearly is great.

52
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,880
Did you guys like Millie
or what'd you get to say?

53
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,930
I mean she's horribly flawed and
has made some very bad decisions,

54
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:21,310
but she's very charismatic and the life
of the party who doesn't admire that?

55
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,313
Mm hmm.

56
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,490
What I found interesting with when he
came to both the cast and the setting was

57
00:03:26,491 --> 00:03:30,920
that it was all set in England where
the Dewberry Morris character as, um,

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,570
the American that comes through.
Um, were you thinking about, uh,

59
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,430
what the story would be if it
weren't said in England? Yeah,

60
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,530
well, I'm, Lorena, uh, lives in England,
wrote it for London. So it was a very,

61
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,750
I think it's,
I mean it's kind of odd to me with,

62
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:48,440
I mean that question luckily hasn't come
up too much in terms of how, how can,

63
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:48,861
how come,

64
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:52,490
how come she's an American from that
because it's so kind of multicultural

65
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:57,260
London as it has our most large
cities and my kids are at school with,

66
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,270
with kids from all over the world.

67
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,920
And so it didn't seem that strange to
me too. You know, too when we were,

68
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,920
you know, when, when Tony, where
did that role yeah, exactly. For,

69
00:04:06,921 --> 00:04:08,900
that's a bit of that to be the case.
Um,

70
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,840
and actually I think it really brought
something to it. So it was, it was good.

71
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:12,640
Hmm.

72
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,230
And speaking of the script,

73
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:17,200
I heard that the film was based
off your radio play goodbye.

74
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,000
First podcasts on the BBC four.
Um, and I guess Catherine, you, uh,

75
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't know if you heard
of a can buy prior to this?

76
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,360
Um, no I hadn't and I never actually
heard that. It's not actually,

77
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,260
it's actually not based on that. That's
a bit, no, that's that, that is, no,

78
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,240
it's kind of Nice to be able to just say
that it's not, that was a project that,

79
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,870
that, that preceded them is in a
very different form with, uh, and,

80
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,420
and written with a different impetus. And
this, this, this sort of started a fresh,

81
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,210
um, although it's a same subject matter
because like lots of writers and you,

82
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,440
you keep going back to the same
subject matter. But it, yeah,

83
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:53,870
it touched on the same thing. It
was very different project. Yeah.

84
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,070
And he also spoke, uh, mentioned
that you wrote this, uh,

85
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,460
to be sending England to be
put there. Um, how exactly,

86
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,710
how did you like filming around England?
How was that for every

87
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,310
freaking awesome. I didn't
want to leave the city.

88
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:12,040
It's such an ex culturally exciting city.

89
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:15,170
It's changed so much after
him over the years. Actually

90
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,330
I used to be an architect. I
loved it. The old architecture,

91
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,260
the new architecture adds this
great energy. Like that combination,

92
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,170
the part of the world where
they shot it to that the house,

93
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:29,610
her house with her husband
was down near, um, the,

94
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,990
what's it call that big round thing that
goes around the London, the London eye.

95
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,390
Yeah. Great area. Yeah.
Really, really cool.

96
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,180
And it was fantastic to see it through
your eyes as well actually to see it on

97
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:41,490
the shot through Caspian size because
it's just the place that I'm in every day

98
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,900
that I walked through that I,
you know,

99
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:44,370
and then it's kind of
just seeing the kind of,

100
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:47,010
the breadth of vision that you had
was really, really cool. I love that.

101
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,540
I didn't want it to be like a nodding hill
where people live in those terrorists,

102
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,300
townhouse walk ups that we've
seen in a million movies.

103
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,280
So that's why we tried to find it.
We down that Great Gina, which was

104
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,880
a forge brick building that this new
architecture would come in and put all

105
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:06,230
these ramps and made it really fun.
Lots of different levels and yeah,

106
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:08,830
we love shooting in London.
We want to go back.

107
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,090
Any noteworthy points from
the entire shoot that you had?

108
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,513
What a broad question.

109
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,880
Oh,

110
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,650
do you want to talk about it?
Okay.

111
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,180
I've got a very determined
to bladder tack.

112
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,590
Tony kept saying, well,
when we're doing that tax,

113
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,500
the are we going to stop in a
minute because I'm really busting.

114
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,830
And they said we can't find a place
to stop. They kept saying that.

115
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:49,831
So Drew's addicted to this ice to teach
her drinking out of those styrofoam.

116
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,360
Very not very green at all. Um, Styrofoam
milkshake cups. So she'd finished,

117
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,220
offered it to me and I took her up on
the offer and we had coats like trying to

118
00:07:00,221 --> 00:07:04,560
hide Tony like right in the middle of
downtown landlording, those black taxi,

119
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,800
very roomy. And I didn't feel
it once I filled it twice

120
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,220
go.

121
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:17,020
There wasn't a crew member when I did
the [inaudible] window that people drove

122
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:21,910
by like
healthy green tea.

123
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,390
It's no great.

124
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,480
Maybe that's not the anecdote type it in.
And

125
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,201
it was actually,

126
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:38,560
I'd have to say the moment that the scene
where not giving anything away because

127
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:40,270
you didn't seen it, right? Yeah. Okay.

128
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,230
Where Tony head is shaped there was,

129
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:47,730
I mean that for me was really amazing
because we did that really early on,

130
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,270
didn't we?
In the shoot days.

131
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,050
I felt so responsible as it could be shit.
And Tony Shaved her head and you know,

132
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,630
we did it like nobody likes it and
anything that was real, that was real,

133
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:06,100
that was not liked.
And that actress Frances de la tour,

134
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:10,580
she was so brave. She did was bring
shady named one of the heads right.

135
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
She practiced Paul Paul yet the second 18

136
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,870
she was going so fast. I was like, could
you slow down Francis Cause I couldn't,

137
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:22,150
we could barely even see it on camera.
She was brave.

138
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,910
Has anybody here ever shaved her
head? It feels great. Cherry red.

139
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,470
In fact,
I did it until about mid college.

140
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,120
Now you're doing it don't look
like recently you haven't,

141
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,340
it's very refreshing once you shave your
head and then everyone kind of wants to

142
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:41,490
touch it. It's like, oh you're a port.

143
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,060
No, you got stop touching you. So yeah,

144
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,190
although that's what she,

145
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,630
I think she's done it before. You've
done it before. I haven't done it before.

146
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:56,040
Everyone was freaking out.
They gave the vote cause you're

147
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,410
like calm my nerves. But I'd
done it five times. Five Times.

148
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:03,360
When did you do before I,
when I turned 25, I was in
Mexico. I had a lot of Tequila

149
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,600
speaking true to the
character that might've been
a slightly merely my bit. Um,

150
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,890
she would never shave her head,
you know, for other purposes. Um,

151
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,230
I did it for Peter Greenaway film,
actually called eight and a half women.

152
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:18,180
I did it three days
after meeting my husband.

153
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,990
I guess I was that one meant to
challenge. Wow. He, he was like,

154
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,140
yeah.
And I did it for,

155
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:27,570
a friend of mine is a designer
and I modeled in a show of hers.

156
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:32,571
We'd been in Tibet together and so I was
attempting to get kind of the look of

157
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:37,500
it. So just for a special treat to
Google, we're going to do it again today.

158
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,300
We know
you love your hair.

159
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,590
Cool.
Yeah.

160
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,130
Unless, unless she does it, she
plans to do it again. Just, um,

161
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,920
I guess that's kind of cool.
If you were to plan to do it again,

162
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,220
I've done it five times.
The likelihood of doing it again is high.

163
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,340
I just want to remind everyone
that we do have a mic set up, uh,

164
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,690
on both sides of the stage if you want
to come up and ask some questions. Um,

165
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,570
but I can continue going on with
more questions that I have here.

166
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,800
One interesting part that I found about
the movie was this entire theme of

167
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:16,190
reckless, this kind of seems to
go rampant throughout the movie.

168
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,640
We saw your character go through
quite a few reckless action.

169
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,440
What with initially with the cancer's
sprinting around because you know,

170
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,470
she didn't get regular checkups and that's
kind of how it started. And you know,

171
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,450
right after the birthday scene where, you
know, just just go to the Moore's. Um,

172
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,160
uh, in particular what I was
kind of curious about, um,

173
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,440
how'd you approach this
entire reckless attitude?

174
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,360
I don't know if you projected
anything personally.

175
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,690
I mean, it was all in the script.
We had the brilliant gifted,

176
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,820
this beautiful script and their story.
And the thing that I love about, um,

177
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,990
not just my character, but all the
characters, they're so fully realized.

178
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:59,170
Sometimes you watch a movie in the
lead characters seem to be, you know,

179
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,530
like real people you can relate to
and then the other character's somehow

180
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:03,430
becomes secondary.

181
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:06,420
And I think the film suffers on the whole
because then you're not invested and

182
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:11,230
you don't believe in the real world.
This is a fleet realized rich,

183
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,980
dense life shared life that
these people are living.

184
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,200
And I love the complexity
of all the characters.

185
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:21,880
I love that my character is completely
flawed and he's kind of, you know,

186
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:26,700
maniacal at times and outrageous and
completely selfish and narcissistic and it

187
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,910
does make some bad decisions,

188
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:32,911
but she's also incredibly charismatic
and that in itself is basically lets lets

189
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,950
her get away with murder
where she takes advantage of

190
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,640
any particular point.
Why it kind of seems as if reckless,

191
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:42,740
which was such a strong
theme in the movie.

192
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,990
I think, I mean, just the,
for me, I, I, you know,

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,040
I'm very much the strong opinion that
people don't get diagnosed with cancer and

194
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,860
study to become saints and
heroes. I think it, I think they,

195
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:54,310
they the best they can.

196
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,550
And, and, and given certainly the women
that we all spoke to, you know, the, the,

197
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,130
the research that we did and
the, and the, and the, you know,

198
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,010
everybody drawing on experience,

199
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,030
you're just trying to get on
with your life and you kind of,

200
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,820
you have cancer for a while and have
one kind of helps look after you.

201
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,090
And then particularly what we were
looking at was diagnosed in younger women.

202
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,150
You have to get up and do
the school run and you know,

203
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,900
clean the house and do all the things and
the kind of the help slowly falls away

204
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:22,590
because people can't sustain it. Nobody
can sustain it. And that's about all,

205
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,570
you know, you're not sort of, you're not
constipated. And I think that was what we,

206
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:27,500
we sort of wanted to look at.

207
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:30,010
It was just how life goes on and
how that impacts on everyone.

208
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,370
And so that's why all the characters
had their own viewpoints and we're all

209
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:37,060
trying to be good and we're all trying
to kind of help everyone get through it.

210
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:40,710
But everybody kept making it difficult.
Uh, you know, at every turn and you know,

211
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,640
Catherine sort of grasping that and
giving each character that their real

212
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:50,010
identity filmic identity was, was
fantastic. So yeah, it was about them.

213
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:52,850
It's all about complexity wasn't, it was
about how hard it is. You know, I'm for,

214
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,520
I'm for Jaclyn's character.
Oh,

215
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:59,070
I'd love to hear more about that because
like as a mother, I'm hearing this,

216
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,140
it's an interesting perspective to
get. Well, I haven't gotten dota like,

217
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,960
yeah, Millie, what a handful. I mean,

218
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,420
the fact that I,
my character was away a lot,

219
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,130
set up a situation where she resented
me, I think, and was annoyed with me,

220
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:20,370
completely annoyed with me that she
was, she didn't, I don't think, oh,

221
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:23,130
near the very end when she says,
Mommy, you've still got it.

222
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,860
Got Her almost into the taxi.
Um, but my only salvation,

223
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,210
but of all the rest of the time,

224
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:33,630
I think she knows that her daughter
thinks she's just really just, you know,

225
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,490
I don't even think she has respect
for my daughter actually. Do,

226
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,570
do you think she had respect
from her daughter? No.

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,110
No, not really. Not really.
No. But I think I have my
character had respect. Really.

228
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,030
Yeah. Part of, I mean when you,

229
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,990
I think when you facing at your own
potential mortality, that's very, uh,

230
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,230
kind of lonely solo journey
that you have to take.

231
00:13:56,231 --> 00:14:00,730
And I think a lot of the things that
Millie learns, I mean, what I love you,

232
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:03,550
she doesn't change that much, but she
does learn to appreciate what she has.

233
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,970
And what she has is a Ford mother and she
has is flawed and probably see as much

234
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,630
of herself in her mom. Um,
they're two peas in a pod.
It kind of takes one to know.

235
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,140
I thought, well, I thought
Miranda was adorable in many ways

236
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,660
and then I thought, but then

237
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,230
Millie was the doorbell in many ways too.
If she hadn't been my daughter,

238
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,080
I'd probably want it to hang out with her,
you know?

239
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:28,360
But I couldn't get in there
between she and drew. I mean,

240
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:31,630
there was just no space for Ms.
Miranda for between those two.

241
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,800
When she goes to got sick. I mean, apart
from the fact it was in total shock.

242
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,880
I don't think she knew where to start to,
how to get in because they would,

243
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,920
they'd went to each other.
These other two friends,

244
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:45,180
they went to each other for
comfort on every level, you
know, pretty much. And um,

245
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,593
I mean there were even more,

246
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,480
there were almost more engrossed in
their friendship than they were in their

247
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:53,840
husbands in a way. They were sort
of, um, just very, very close.

248
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,630
And uh, I've been in the
scene when I visited, um,

249
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,190
Millie in the hospital and then
her friends arrive, you know,

250
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,170
and she's much happier
to see the friends come.

251
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,500
Then she has to see me ride
with my puree of God knows what,

252
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,720
what was it? I can't remember what it
was, but there again, you know, she,

253
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,000
Miranda was like, ah, you
know. Okay, great job.

254
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,690
She was not minding, but she was not
really able to find a place to be.

255
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,430
I think so. I mean, when I was sitting
by the bedside, I remember thinking,

256
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:32,120
this is so hard for me to sit here and
not take over. I mean, let me Jacqueline,

257
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:33,890
I mean I would've been,
you know,

258
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,410
I would just before I was
given permission to take over,

259
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:38,300
cause she says I want
to go to the hospital.

260
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,340
But before that I'm there by the bed and
I'm thinking, oh me, Jacqueline would,

261
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,840
I just would have taken over a
million things. So because I'm very,

262
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,740
we didn't know that
but I had to sit there.

263
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,980
Yes. I had to sit there and
be, you know, be be Miranda,

264
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:59,570
which was to sit there and fall asleep
and wake up and think God knows what's

265
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:01,760
going to happen next and she's going
to die or what's going to happen.

266
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,760
It is he looking after her and everything
and is he really looking after and he

267
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:08,240
gives up to her quickly and he goes
out of the room and then she takes her

268
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:11,060
charge immediate, she gets five minutes
and she's out the door. She said,

269
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:11,894
I want to go.

270
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,350
She her husband's word of I'm going to
get the nurse to get to stop you from

271
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:16,184
wanting to go.

272
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:21,170
Now let's not tell the whole story.
Whole sticks in the film. No,

273
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,470
but this is going out alive,
right. Or somewhere it's recorded.

274
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,190
It's going into the world. Okay. Well,
I've been the, anyway, so I didn't know.

275
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,840
I thought it was a complicated,

276
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,080
but it was nice. I liked it. And, um,

277
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,470
one thing that was fun, uh, a couple of
times you came and said to me, I think I,

278
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,710
I can't be very nice because these
characters don't seem to like me,

279
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:46,460
so I don't get to be myself.
My Nice, compassionate itself.

280
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:51,440
You guys planned to be worse. Yeah. She
wanted to be more prickly and outrageous,

281
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,460
which I loved. If you
got a question. Oh yeah.

282
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,220
Um, first of all, well done.
Everyone knows a beautiful film. Um,

283
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,650
but I also wanted to just really get
to the crux of this movie was the

284
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:07,340
relationship between, um,
you know, the two girls.

285
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,850
And what I thought was done so beautifully
was that opening scene where you got

286
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:14,210
us to really buy in to that friendship
and buy into that relationship,

287
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:17,420
which is where I think a lot of
movies on a similar theme fall short.

288
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,750
So I was wondering two fold.
What was your inspiration? Um,

289
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,440
and also what did you guys do as a
cast to make sure that that happened?

290
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:25,850
That connection showed on screen?

291
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,040
Uh, when you're talking about the opening,
you're, you're thinking about the,

292
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,770
yeah, exactly. Yeah.

293
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,250
And that's what it was a tell I that
was one of our toughest things to get

294
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:38,470
together. I think Catherine don't, yeah,

295
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,740
we kind of kept writing and rewriting and
trying to reorganize it and figure out

296
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:46,130
which bits were going to be crucial
in which bits. We don't need that,

297
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:50,340
but do you need that? And that was, I mean
that was really, I have to really, again,

298
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,120
defer to Catherine who, who had all the
raw footage and, and, and more and the,

299
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,480
and some of my favorite moments in that,

300
00:17:57,481 --> 00:17:59,130
that is the kind of girls
running in the little,

301
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,280
just this kind of texture or moments
which made that piece really rise and,

302
00:18:04,721 --> 00:18:07,020
and, and you know, helps
you buy into it. You know,

303
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:11,280
I really have to hunt the Caspian
sentence of texture and the story and the

304
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:14,160
commitment to that friendship and
understanding the history. So we worked,

305
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:15,990
we worked on that one really
hard and we'd kept thinking,

306
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,320
I'm never sure if we've got this.
Yeah. I think in the, you know,

307
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,250
in the end it will as it
was well done. And then, um,

308
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:27,820
how did we create a bond? I mean, Tony
and drew had barely met each other.

309
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,870
A couple drive bys.
Yeah.

310
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,600
A bunch of mutual friends and we'd
met a couple of times, but we weren't,

311
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,030
we put some crazy reason.
We just never hung out.

312
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,140
I wrote a letter to her kind of
basically talent. It was a love letter,

313
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:43,380
basically begging her to be a part of
the movie and talking about why I thought

314
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:46,170
she was right for it,
which is that she emanates such warmth.

315
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:50,760
She's the ultimate girls go.
And, uh, she's, you know,

316
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:54,990
if you dreaming of best friend,
there is nobody better. Um,

317
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,160
we would all pick drew,
right? Yeah. And uh,

318
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:02,130
and I talked about why I thought the
film was important and, and I, and she,

319
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:06,990
and why I thought it was rare and she
agreed because she loved it and we had

320
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:10,710
five days of rehearsing together.
I was like praying,

321
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:14,280
I hope they get alone. He
Must Jay, you really can't.

322
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,740
But we'd already communicated with.

323
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,890
We'd been writing a little and we both
had really great intentions for the

324
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:20,581
experience.

325
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:25,350
And I think the fact that we knew we had
friends in common and I knew they loved

326
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:26,760
her. It kind of just, you know,

327
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:30,870
it makes you realize you're not gonna
be faced with a crazy person, um,

328
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,390
because they are already in the circle.
Um,

329
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,830
but we just got on like a house on fire.
It could not have been better.

330
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,510
And I think it gives the film something
so real because we kind of just fell in

331
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:46,110
love with each other as friends and we're
at the end of the movie, we grabbed,

332
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:48,270
our family's, caught the train to
Paris. We didn't want to let go.

333
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:52,140
We had a week there and we've had several
holidays together and weed, weed, weed.

334
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,170
I, it's very rare to come away with
a friendship. But I have to say,

335
00:19:55,171 --> 00:20:00,030
I wonder also whether it's
just the material,

336
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:04,800
the story is so profound and it was such
an amazing experience that perhaps the

337
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:08,370
two people playing that those parts,
it was inevitable that we're going to be,

338
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,310
honestly, it's just I, you know,
but how fortunate, well, I mean,

339
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:16,710
I think that you can write, you
can write shorthand, you can write,

340
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,050
you can write kind of banter.
You can,

341
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,020
you can write to two people kind of
acting like they're friends and if it

342
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,510
doesn't fit authentic, you
just see it. You can't,

343
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,040
you really can't kind of fake it. You
can't put those two together. Um, and you,

344
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,110
and you did. And you know, they,
they're, they're great devices as well.

345
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:36,240
The Fun thing would build on what Lorena
road and then they were just crazy shit

346
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:40,590
comes out of her mouth and through his
mouth all the time and original like neat,

347
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,830
interesting stuff. That's
like gold. I was like, yes,

348
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,400
back there behind the camera
and say Betty in that, that it,

349
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,440
that they sort of really inhabited those
characters and that friendship became

350
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:54,160
an authentic one. That was sort of there
on the page and then I was in real life,

351
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:59,230
ladies and gentlemen. All right.
You have another question here?

352
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,990
Um, yeah, first I was going to say, I
really enjoyed the film. It was beautiful.

353
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,860
Thank you. Um, and then I just wanted
to ask, kind of along that same note,

354
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:11,540
I thought what the film
did really brilliantly was
infused comedy to scene. So,

355
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,150
you know, I'm on the verge of tears
and then you're kind of laughing.

356
00:21:14,151 --> 00:21:17,690
So I just wanted to know how you found
the balance between that and how you knew,

357
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,780
you know, when you could make it
fun, even though it's, you know,

358
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,640
such a tough subject matter.

359
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:26,190
Thank you. Thank you very much.
That's really nice. What I think is,

360
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,810
it's basically the way that I see
I see the world and uh, you know,

361
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,320
probably I'm a bit twisted, but, uh, you
know, something, something bad happens,

362
00:21:33,321 --> 00:21:36,460
then I'll probably laugh at it. You know,
it is, it's kind of nervous reaction,

363
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,303
but it's also,

364
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,580
I think life's like that you kind of stuff
comes out and you undercut it all the

365
00:21:40,581 --> 00:21:45,040
time. And that's sort of who I
am. But also I grew up, you know,

366
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,520
I kind of came out of a comedy background
and I was always kind of horrified

367
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,020
that, that, that can kind of comedians.

368
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,490
So pigeonholing and I think some of the
best comedy act as well as some of the

369
00:21:55,491 --> 00:21:58,070
best dramatic actors as well.
And vice versa. You know,

370
00:21:58,071 --> 00:22:00,500
that you find very dramatic actors,
you've got fantastic comic street.

371
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,470
And I think that I really wanted to kind
of bring that to the script and given

372
00:22:03,471 --> 00:22:06,890
it, it's a tough subject. You've
kind of got to go somewhere with it.

373
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:08,480
That takes me in and out of that.

374
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,360
And when you have a tragic
moment to undercut it with,

375
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,270
it was not like a deliberate, it
wasn't mathematical, but it was,

376
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,360
it just always felt right
to try and offer some,

377
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:21,370
and actually there are moments when
you kind of can't do that. And,

378
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,340
and the sort of the beauty of,

379
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,830
particularly towards the ending
where it becomes right to 10,

380
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,630
you just have to calibrate it. And again,
you know, the, the activism and Catherine,

381
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:34,820
you know, that's, that's that,
that, that genius as well. So,

382
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,700
you know that, thank you. Good day to you.

383
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,340
Thank you.

384
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:43,100
[inaudible] of the things I loved about
it totally is so exciting because I find

385
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:46,460
like straight drama or you know,
just bring broad comedies,

386
00:22:46,461 --> 00:22:47,630
both of them equally dry.

387
00:22:47,631 --> 00:22:52,430
I think this film is so lifelike and so
relative because we traverse between all

388
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:55,630
of those areas and it's, yeah, you
did it so beautifully. Bless you.

389
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,680
When I'm actually,
and again

390
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,280
the women that we spoke to who were going
through this and then they were funny

391
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,210
and they, and they were, you know,

392
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:06,211
they were kind of urging us to kind of
talk about the more taboo and of the end

393
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:10,190
of the film kind of relationship,
sex, how it is, you know, the kind of,

394
00:23:10,191 --> 00:23:14,680
the way that your sexuality
becomes so challenged by, by,

395
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,650
by what happens by, by, by
IVF, lung cancer. You know.

396
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:21,430
So I think it was just in the other
part of the story. So, you know, it was,

397
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:24,590
I think it felt right to reflect into
reflect the way that the people are

398
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:27,370
feeling about it. Can I ask a
question? Yes, you can. Did it,

399
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:31,990
did it occur to you that, that ever, ever
in this version that she might not die?

400
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,620
No, no, no. So it was, I would say
if anyone hasn't yes. Yeah. No,

401
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,410
no, no, no. That was
always, that was always,

402
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,230
obviously we can recut the end and
do a sequel, but, um, but no, it was,

403
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,250
it was sometimes

404
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,450
people do get, yeah, I know. I
know. Yeah. No, no, I know what
you mean. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

405
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:55,130
yeah. No, we don't want to give
this away to everybody. Okay.

406
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,350
All right.
We have another question here.

407
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,020
So moved on so many levels by the film.
Um, the writing, the acting, it was,

408
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,530
I was bawling like a baby for
great. You know, I was happy,

409
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:10,850
I was sad and it really made me think
about two kind of main relationships in

410
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:14,540
life. One with a really great
girlfriend and one of a mother.

411
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:18,800
I have a one year old and it makes
me think about how, you know,

412
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,960
life gets in the way,
work gets in the way,

413
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:25,640
and just films like these kinds
of make you think like, do you,

414
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:29,210
do you do something different with your
time to take advantage of that time that

415
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:32,990
you do have that's outside of work and
outside of kind of daily responsibilities

416
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,180
before something like this happened.

417
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:39,110
So I just wanted to ask whether as mothers
or I don't know if you guys have kids,

418
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,810
but as mothers or you know,
great friends,

419
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:45,470
has it made you think differently about
the time that you have on earth and you

420
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:47,540
know,
before something like this happens?

421
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,420
Well,
I think a lot about this anyway,

422
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:55,250
but this film for me was incredibly
Cathartic and it took a long time to

423
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,290
separate from it. Uh, so yeah, I do.
I think about it and there are scenes,

424
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,970
particularly there's a scene with young
owner who plays my daughter and the

425
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:07,730
scene where I'm having a very tough
conversation with her and I just,

426
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,620
I'd get into bed at night to read through
the script and I just could not do it.

427
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,270
There were just some moments in there
that are so kind of intense, but yeah. Uh,

428
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,600
yes, it's, um, it's an it,

429
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:23,900
I mean it's inevitable on any film you're
working on for it to kind of seep into

430
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:27,110
your life and for you
to ruminate and ponder.

431
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,020
I love it when people walked out of
the theater and told me that, you know,

432
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:34,200
they went to call their best
friend or one guy said, hey,

433
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,690
I called my best friend to
bury the hatchet, you know,

434
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,510
that we've got to like be buddies again.

435
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:44,490
Or people called their friend to go on a
road trip. So I think that's fantastic.

436
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,000
Yes.
Still

437
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,050
want to call the person who
have to tell them exactly,

438
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:51,640
which just means like for films, it,
it, it opens people up. You know,

439
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:55,210
this film actually opens
people up. And I, I love that.

440
00:25:55,211 --> 00:25:57,250
That's part of the reason
I want to make movies.

441
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,510
I think also disconnected and numb
and for film to do that and make you

442
00:26:01,511 --> 00:26:03,940
appreciate what you haven't
really pause and think about it.

443
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:08,980
It's bloody fantastic. Thank you. Thank
you for that. That's really lovely.

444
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:13,390
I think it has been Cathartic and I think
actually for some of my male friends

445
00:26:13,391 --> 00:26:16,720
who came and I know it's a, yeah, I
know that is because this is sort of a,

446
00:26:16,721 --> 00:26:20,050
it's a trope or a cliche that you know
that men, the expressing of women do.

447
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:23,110
And I, and I don't think that's true.
Again, my whole thing in the film was not,

448
00:26:23,111 --> 00:26:25,720
not to my stereotypes was to try and go,
you know,

449
00:26:25,721 --> 00:26:28,570
something can talk about the feedings,
you know, till the cows come home,

450
00:26:28,571 --> 00:26:32,200
some income. But um, I
think it has had a quite,

451
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,390
quite a cathartic effect on,
on,

452
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:38,920
on several men I know who weren't able
to sort of say how they felt about recent

453
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,370
experiences that have been
very challenging for the
mishap, sat in the theater.

454
00:26:42,371 --> 00:26:47,160
And, and just bald. And that was
shopped them. Actually, you know,

455
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:48,900
one of them had to go home and drink

456
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,070
isotonic drinks. He's like, yeah, yeah.

457
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,840
One Guy told me that he was sitting
there and he started crying.

458
00:26:56,841 --> 00:27:00,050
He didn't want any other guys to see
him cry. So he kind of looked around,

459
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:03,110
he saw the guy next to him was crying
and he saw the other guy was crying.

460
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,380
Then he saw the cheese Nachos guy was
crying. It's like, oh well whatever.

461
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,340
He said the guy had been eating cheese,
not just,

462
00:27:16,341 --> 00:27:19,280
didn't even think he was watching the
movie and then then he looked over there

463
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:21,320
and the cheese Nachos
or like getting soggy.

464
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,480
It's kind of unfortunate that there
isn't the male cast here to also speak on

465
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:29,540
the roles, you know, as, as
everyone's kind of going. Right.

466
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,530
Cause we love the guys in the movie,
didn't you guys like the guys?

467
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,140
They're hot and dimensional and you know.
Cool.

468
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:39,974
Yeah.

469
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,950
But how did, um, how did you want to
portray the male characters? You know,

470
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:49,040
watching all these sorts of experiences
that are strong in terms of some sort of

471
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,680
a feminine hit, you know,
having a mastectomy, you know,

472
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:56,940
I'm dealing with breast cancer
at at least with, with guys.

473
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,270
Well I guess we also have a
chance of getting breast cancer,

474
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:05,040
but it's not as likely as
girls mastectomies. Probably
a bit more attached to,

475
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,030
um, other women in terms of
something emotive. But how did, uh,

476
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,930
how did you want to portray the men when
it comes to something observed like this

477
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,200
one thing? You know, a lot of times
men feel like they can, they know,

478
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:20,560
save the day or solve the
problem or be protective.

479
00:28:20,561 --> 00:28:25,060
And it's not very easy when your
enemy is cancer. You know, there's,

480
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,690
that's something that a man can
feel helpless, you know, and they,

481
00:28:28,691 --> 00:28:31,870
they want to be supportive
and these guys are like,

482
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:36,550
I think they're great man in the movie.
I love these characters and you know,

483
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,790
and Dominic Cooper's character,
Tony's husband, I mean, he's,

484
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:45,150
he's just like really a great guy and
stands by her even all the bad things.

485
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:48,340
She was, you know, and
he's a great dad, you know,

486
00:28:48,341 --> 00:28:52,990
which is unexpected when you, you know,
look at other roles at Dominic's played.

487
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,890
I kind of think that I expect him to be
like a bad boy or something like that.

488
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,780
And he really stood up and it was
like, great man. You know, I love that.

489
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,970
And a lot of times we just seen
movies where the men, they,

490
00:29:04,971 --> 00:29:08,630
if their daughter gets
kidnapped, you know, they go
out with a gun and kill yeah.

491
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,790
100 people right there.
Couldn't revenge. But, you know,

492
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,530
that's one way to be a good dad.
You know, there's other ways.

493
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,120
I think so narratively as well.

494
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,320
Potentially the easy thing to do would've
been to have made the husband having

495
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:23,154
an affair.

496
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,560
And then all this empathy lies squarely
with the person who's going through the

497
00:29:26,561 --> 00:29:31,540
illness. And that did occur to
me at one point as an option.

498
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,800
But, but I, but I, I,

499
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:38,220
I think it was so much more
challenging and complex and I,

500
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:43,200
I hope, um, dramatically, uh,

501
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,400
kind of challenging and
satisfying that did that.

502
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:48,160
It was that it was a character who was,
who was sick because,

503
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,210
and also the character that
Tyson Ritter plays as well.

504
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:55,350
That how he handled that because of it,
that's going to be a challenging role.

505
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,920
Somebody to be able to pull that off
really. And do you guys like Tyson,

506
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,020
you know him from all American
rejects is pretty good.

507
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:05,840
Cool. Right? Yeah. And how many women
wouldn't have enough here or would have

508
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,440
to have a guy that could
kind of pull that off?

509
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:14,500
Oh, he's so deeply likable. So
I, I, you know, I think it was,

510
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,670
yeah, the, I was, I was glad that it
turned out that way, but it wasn't a,

511
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,240
it was an easy choice to make thinking
we're going to go with this one.

512
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,160
What did you guys do with him?
You mean? No, no. The, the,
the, the, the fact that, that,

513
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,270
that the cat, that Tony's character
was the, the, the, you know,

514
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:31,280
in technical terms of sort of
the transgressor narratively,

515
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,020
and it wasn't the guy that would afraid
that would have placed the sympathy.

516
00:30:36,021 --> 00:30:37,270
There have been a different movie.
Yup.

517
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,220
Can you comment on,
um,

518
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,230
what your thoughts were in trying to
contrast both the relationship with those

519
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:49,210
two with, with, with uh, Toni
and kit and Tony and ace in the,

520
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,020
what do you think it's, I
mean, I mean, these character

521
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,913
chameleon

522
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,470
obviously they had,
they had to represent

523
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,920
something different. Um,
and again, I didn't want,

524
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,430
actually there's a line
that a pretty constant says,
yeah, don't make a, you know,

525
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,980
the, the Jayco character when
he just wants to have a baby.

526
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,550
And it just didn't make me the
bastard for wanting to have a baby.

527
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,520
And I sort of felt like quite a lot of
the time that could have come out of

528
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,540
anywhere. Don't make me, don't make it,

529
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,910
don't turn me into an evil person
for doing this. Yes. So, you know,

530
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,810
twice wasn't an evil person,
you know,

531
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,450
the husband wasn't an evil person
because he couldn't love her the way she

532
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:29,320
needed.
They have a floored it and everybody's,

533
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,270
everybody's got good and bad and they
will just trying to get it right and

534
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,440
getting it very wrong along the way.
It's all winter.

535
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,170
And I both thought of Friends
of ours that are very, like,

536
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,120
what would Tyson's character be like?

537
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:44,800
People that are really open minded
and you know, like really kind of fun.

538
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:49,530
They love every wind people that just
kind of, they love everybody, you know?

539
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,680
Yeah.
Embrace.

540
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,470
Yeah. There was a one scene I found
in particular that was quite strong.

541
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:04,471
It's when Millie opened up to her
scars to Jess and they kind of,

542
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:09,070
it kind of slowed down the entire movie
kind of slowed down for you to absorb

543
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,610
what was going on. And there was also
in that moment with, with Ken as well,

544
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,140
you know, when, when that was
first revealed, um, how first,

545
00:32:17,141 --> 00:32:19,690
how did it kind of start out? Like, um,

546
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,280
how much makeup did you have to go on
or how did, uh, how did you want it

547
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,640
physically? How did we achieve
that, do you mean? Yeah. Uh,

548
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,660
I don't have very much here.
So it was very easy to strap down

549
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,120
and B flat and,
and then this,

550
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:39,940
we used to CGI and post to
make it look. Yeah, yeah.

551
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,080
Got It was right. So we, you know,

552
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:45,830
the company in London would send me
photographs to make sure that it,

553
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:50,210
cause most CGI companies, they don't do
that kind of work so much. They do more,

554
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,540
you know,
something growing things up and stuff.

555
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:58,520
So this was just very subtle to look
really natural. And the first time,

556
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:03,110
uh, the first image that came back,
well took a few rounds to get it right.

557
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:03,944
Let's just put it down.

558
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,090
But I think it in the end came out
as a very sensitive and you know,

559
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,960
beautiful scene,
which I love that scene I do to your face.

560
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:17,650
That scene when you look up,
it's just kills when, well,

561
00:33:17,651 --> 00:33:21,210
what kills me is the way he looks
at me. Do you has this thing? Um,

562
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,090
she's such a nice
person. I, and I watched,

563
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:29,170
I watched her in this movie and
when she's feeling the most pain,

564
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,250
she smiles and the way she looks at,

565
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,520
this is what I think the crux of
the film is between these two women,

566
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:42,130
the way she looks at Millie and she
smiled at her and accept her when Millie

567
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:46,690
feels at her lowest kills me every time.
So beautiful.

568
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:51,620
When she did that smile when we were
on the set, you know, I just kind of,

569
00:33:51,621 --> 00:33:56,621
almost gas because I felt like a laser
beam of love came and I could see it on

570
00:33:56,991 --> 00:34:01,130
the set and on the Monitor I
was like, wow. It was powerful.

571
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,990
You see it in the film. It's
amazing. Yeah, she's a good,

572
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:06,824
she's a good one.

573
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,050
Strong.
Um,

574
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:14,480
another theme that was also played
through was the juxtaposition of life and

575
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:14,840
death.

576
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,730
I was totally expecting for some reason
when Jess was trying to give birth, that,

577
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:22,190
you know, a million would kind
of die in there and it'd be,

578
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,920
it would just be guessing.
It'd be a bit too much.

579
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:29,000
Just see both that life and death kind
of go through all at the same time.

580
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:31,670
But I really appreciated the fact that,
you know,

581
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,520
there was the portion of the scene
where she finally gave birth.

582
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:36,200
We focused on celebration of life.

583
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:39,950
We focus on that sort of effort with
everyone in the room and sharing that and

584
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:44,650
then, you know, did another dedicated
scene where we flashed through uh,

585
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,200
Millie's life and then she kind
of slowly, slowly parts away. Um,

586
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,493
okay.

587
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,590
Yeah, I think it's, you know,
the story's really special.

588
00:34:58,591 --> 00:35:02,340
It's birth death and everything, you know,
birth, death, life, everything in between.

589
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:05,180
And it's an incredible
that you changed it,

590
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,200
they said to less than two
hours and managed to kind
of really reflect something

591
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:15,510
very, very real and very human.
It amazes me. Bless you. Well,

592
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:20,250
you know, maybe with me basically from
the end to know how many, but yeah,

593
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:24,450
it was, it was very gratifying
to see that, that, that
that's, that sort of working,

594
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,430
you know, for that has, it has an impact.

595
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,730
We got another audience question.
Yep.

596
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:34,600
Hi. Thank you all for the movie. It
was beautiful. I was here in tears. Um,

597
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:38,100
my question I guess is
mostly for Tony, um, on this

598
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,290
film and or maybe other films,
you know,

599
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,290
I'm watching you for two
hours and falling apart. Um,

600
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,460
what is it like for your family and
friends to see you in a movie like this or

601
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:51,780
I'm sure other films to um, to,
to watch her, they used to it or,

602
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,250
um,
is that something,

603
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:56,220
is it hard for them to see you fall
apart on screen even though you might be

604
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:56,530
right now?

605
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:00,160
You know, one of my best friends, I've
known him since I was 13, he said, oh,

606
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,170
it was really,
really hard watching your diet,

607
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:06,250
but it was a much harder
watching you have sex.

608
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,190
I think my parents felt the same way.

609
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,830
I mean, yeah, it's, I mean,

610
00:36:23,831 --> 00:36:27,190
I found it weird playing someone
who died. I got to of, I mean,

611
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,890
I can't imagine how it is for people
who really know me and love me to watch

612
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:35,860
that because it's quite realistic.
Yeah.

613
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,410
Um, so how was, uh, how was
it working with the kids?

614
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,290
Not much has been said about that.

615
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,680
It's like

616
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,890
all the, all the, all this serious talk
about like life and death and it's like,

617
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,820
yeah, there are also children here. How
was, how was it working with them so much?

618
00:36:51,821 --> 00:36:51,850
It's

619
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,110
fine. I mean they're just so
free and honest and present.

620
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,170
That's what you want from any actor
that you're working in. Um, but we,

621
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,250
the house that we lived in,

622
00:36:58,251 --> 00:37:02,300
we spent how much time in rehearsal
with them to do that. No week anything.

623
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,570
We basically lived there. We didn't
sleep there, but we spent all day.

624
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,700
Then the meals and yeah,

625
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:10,490
we had lots of activities and hung
out and we went through scenes.

626
00:37:10,491 --> 00:37:13,100
But it was just,
I think more than anything,

627
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:17,540
just getting to that comfort level so
that people feel natural and comfortable

628
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:19,490
and at ease with what they're doing.

629
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,860
I know I'm one of the first days I had
a plan that we would rehearse during

630
00:37:24,861 --> 00:37:28,580
lunch and then I would have you and
Dominic make the lunch for the kids.

631
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,590
I think you guys were
a little bit shocked.

632
00:37:30,591 --> 00:37:35,000
Like the cater isn't bringing lunch
in and I know you're the parents,

633
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:38,210
you got to make the lunch and the kids
would come up and they didn't like the

634
00:37:38,211 --> 00:37:42,320
food and I'd say go ask your mom,
go ask your dad.

635
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:47,150
So I was trying to like have little
arrangements where they had to become the

636
00:37:47,151 --> 00:37:52,100
mom and dad, but you know, honor
is the girl is very professional.

637
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,440
And then our little friend,

638
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:59,420
the boy is like a wild maniac Ryan.
And for example,

639
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:04,450
member when he puts the honey and the
sister will let discussing that was his

640
00:38:05,331 --> 00:38:05,751
favorite.

641
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:09,800
He could not wait until we did that and
he every minute do I get to put more

642
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:13,040
honey on? And then he was
just so excited about that.

643
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:17,470
And then the worst thing was I didn't
realize he was drinking the honey.

644
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:23,270
And so by the time she was so hyped up
that he was just bouncing around like

645
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,840
what? Like running around
up and down the stairs.

646
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:31,370
He had to monitor the amount of sweets he
got to eat. After that I was just like,

647
00:38:31,371 --> 00:38:35,320
if I saw his dad or anybody walking
with a cookie torn when I'm like, no,

648
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,850
take it away. No more sugar. Cause
the guy was, he was a maniac.

649
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:45,850
He never acted how he, I don't think
he had done like one commercial saying,

650
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:47,830
you know,
eating probably some honey

651
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,910
some days I saw he was testing your
patients. Tony, I saw him testing yours.

652
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:01,760
Oh, he'll never, he'll never watch this.

653
00:39:01,761 --> 00:39:02,594
He'll never hear this.
And

654
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:10,000
I really love, I love him.
I think he did a great job.

655
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:15,020
That's beautiful to work with. It's very
hard am I think it traditionally that,

656
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,830
that probably feel quite bad
saying this, but the British, um,

657
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,110
Gerald actors and not as
naturalistic sometimes as, as,

658
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:27,520
as American job actors and I don't know
why that he got some bad ones in America

659
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:31,090
today. It goes from having these two
really. What, and you know, you, you,

660
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:34,050
you saw a lot of people for it
and, and, and, and, you know,

661
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,970
even though you knew that, that, that,
that was going to be challenging. It was,

662
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,270
well, I was trying to find
the kid that had, you know,

663
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:43,210
a lot of life and energy and you know,
rambunctious.

664
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,130
That wasn't like a stage train kit.

665
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:50,460
So the person we almost hired was so
energetic that he tackled me to the

666
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:55,620
[inaudible] ground. I was
on the ground. I was like,

667
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,150
whoa.
So this one was like,

668
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:03,270
that was like def con five and I got a
def con four one is who we ended up with

669
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,343
Ryan.

670
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:12,330
But he's so natural to what she captured
them just in their own world and it's

671
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:17,260
perfect. And she's very emotionally
intelligent as well. She was,

672
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,130
she was from another planet.
She is,

673
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:26,370
oh, we do have another one. Yes.
Um, I really loved the movie.

674
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:30,570
Thank you very much for coming. Um,
one thing I wanted to ask is, um,

675
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,870
so it's a very recent trend that we see,
uh,

676
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:38,010
women in their forties or late
thirties as main characters are films.

677
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,290
We're used to seeing them only very young,

678
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:44,520
as romantic potential romantic
partners of main male characters.

679
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:48,090
And then you don't see that actor for a
few years and then they suddenly are the

680
00:40:48,091 --> 00:40:51,240
mother. So, um, what a
wonderful trajectory.

681
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,900
So, so yeah, so this is,

682
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,930
I mean I was very happy to see this as
one of the very few movies around as you

683
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:02,100
know, having women in that. Yeah.

684
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:08,660
So how do you wish it was a trend?
Yeah, that's what I wanted to be a trend

685
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,300
I think.
Is it that trend?

686
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:14,050
What role do you think this film
plays in that hopefully a trip.

687
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,550
There is a big conversation going on,
you guys,

688
00:41:16,551 --> 00:41:20,570
I'm sure aware of it that everybody's
talking about. Why aren't there more?

689
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,290
Why are there equal pay for, you
know, male and female actors?

690
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:27,110
Why aren't there more
wonderful parts for women?

691
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,230
Why aren't there more female directors?
Why aren't there more female writers?

692
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,560
And this is like, uh, you know,

693
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,780
great thing about gender
unconscious gender bias.

694
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,040
I actually understand that you guys have
had training here at Google to really

695
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:41,210
change that proportion,

696
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:45,470
that balance and your group is
really an inspiration to us all.

697
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:49,580
We've been talking about you guys a lot
that we had some people come and gave us

698
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:53,450
a training workshop that worked with
Google and told us how the culture really

699
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:56,630
changed here and got more
productive and kind of more awesome.

700
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,960
So we hope that the rest of our industry,

701
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:04,370
we hope that the film industry learns
a lesson from you guys to have a better

702
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:08,540
gender balance, you know, but it's
not happening yet. As we know,

703
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:10,670
the statistics are pretty sad.
It's,

704
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:14,930
we're actually have the worst report
card of any industry almost, right? Yeah.

705
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,800
The film industry,

706
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:19,460
you would think we would be more
creative and more forward thinking.

707
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:23,600
But we love that you guys are
like leading the future, you know,

708
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:25,910
leading the pathway, you know, and you're,

709
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,270
you're on the right side of history
and you're ahead of the game.

710
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,890
So we want the film industry to be the
same way too. We want to change this.

711
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:35,290
Okay.

712
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:39,950
Not just the film industry, the world,
but we only care about the film.

713
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:45,640
Okay. Well, but if we can tell
stories that encourage, you know,

714
00:42:45,641 --> 00:42:50,620
people of diverse, diverse
voices, every kind of person,

715
00:42:50,621 --> 00:42:54,580
you know, women and men, every,
every nationality, every buddy,

716
00:42:54,581 --> 00:42:58,460
we want that kind of, those voices
out there, you know, I mean, you,

717
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:02,650
we love orange is the new black
where everybody looks different.

718
00:43:02,651 --> 00:43:05,650
Nobody looks perfect and it's
beautiful and people like it.

719
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:09,580
So it works when you do it,
you know, people respond.

720
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:14,080
But how do we get these slow
moving dinosaur, you know,

721
00:43:14,081 --> 00:43:19,081
film studios to change and catch
up with 2015 catch up with Google.

722
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:25,560
Do you have any, uh, major takeaways
after working on this movie? Like,

723
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:29,350
did you learn anything from playing your
character is working with other, uh,

724
00:43:29,351 --> 00:43:31,210
other characters and the other actors

725
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:40,100
she taught us, we learned from these.
He is to, you always learn something.

726
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:41,973
Hmm.

727
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,330
But I think some of the things that we
all talked about and our friend over here

728
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,240
mentioned, you know, it's like cherishing
those moments in life, you know? And,

729
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,570
and it does make you think when you
meet with a lot of people that are

730
00:43:53,571 --> 00:43:55,990
caretakers and, and people that are, uh,

731
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:00,830
that are survivors that you do want to
value every moment and make your life

732
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:05,000
count and make what you do something that
you're proud of and excited about and

733
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:06,320
you know,
so yeah,

734
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:11,321
I think it makes us all like empowers
us all to try to do cool shit.

735
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,820
There was that I'm seeing right at the
end where he saw it red on the wall

736
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:21,230
before I die and then there's
a blank. Um, yeah. Was,

737
00:44:21,231 --> 00:44:24,190
that was an actual thing. I've
never been to London before, but

738
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,080
around the world and like 80 countries
around the world, Candy Chang,

739
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,900
actually she lives in New Orleans.
She's a city planner.

740
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,520
Have you guys heard of this before?

741
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,850
She started this idea and talks
about her idea for creating this.

742
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:41,160
She's amazing in the, and people can put
them up like you guys could call her up,

743
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:42,060
she'll send you the kit,

744
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:45,810
you can put it up on the wall and
everybody can write stuff. And it happens,

745
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:47,970
happens spontaneously
all around the world.

746
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,570
One day we were driving to the set and I
just saw it out of the corner of my eye.

747
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:55,860
There was one up there. I'm like, Hey
Tony, do you want to skip lunch today?

748
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:59,760
And we're going to take the five d
camera over and just film a little scene.

749
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,950
And Tony said, yes. And then Dominic said,
where are you guys going? I want to go,

750
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:08,340
you know, cause I thought I'll just
have Tony. So we went over there,

751
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,050
we didn't have the DP,
none of the crew,

752
00:45:10,051 --> 00:45:13,290
and we just filled that little cool scene.
That was the one.

753
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:14,270
It's one of the most,

754
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:16,910
well that's an example of one of the most
exciting things about working on this

755
00:45:16,911 --> 00:45:20,810
movie.
Catherine is very open and very free.

756
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,740
And the amount of times I would turn up
to work with an idea of what was gonna

757
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:28,040
happen and that would happen,
but then it would move completely off.

758
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:32,900
It was so exciting.
It was so exciting to be like,

759
00:45:32,901 --> 00:45:34,820
don't you want to be surprised in life?
You know?

760
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:38,640
And the film was very,
um,

761
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:44,390
passionate and uh, and I loved
it, but that was just one,

762
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:47,520
one thing that just, I didn't know
that was going to happen. You know,

763
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:48,354
it was really great.

764
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:53,100
And even like, oh, for example, in
that same taxi scene after them,

765
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,800
the cup incidents,
okay,

766
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,750
then we're driving along in the
taxi and suddenly I'm like, okay,

767
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:04,980
we're going to do this closeup on drew
and the camera person whispers in my ear,

768
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,880
we don't have any more cards
for the camera. I'm like,

769
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:13,230
aren't we like on a major motion
picture? Well, indeed picture.

770
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,570
How could we run out
of card to the camera?

771
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:20,550
And so I didn't really want you guys
to know that we were like amateur hour.

772
00:46:20,551 --> 00:46:22,500
So I'm like,
hey,

773
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:26,010
why don't we do this park
like selfies on the iPhone?

774
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:29,460
So I pulled out my iPhone,
let's do this scene like that.

775
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,600
And then of course through,

776
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:34,350
and Tony did that awesome scene that you
see in the movie that's filmed on the

777
00:46:34,351 --> 00:46:38,760
iPhone five and recorded on the iPhone
vibe we're getting out of London.

778
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,470
Uh,
so that was one of those,

779
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,490
yeah. I was like, Ooh, Shit. What
Cameron? All I've got left is the iPhone,

780
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,280
but it's a very cool scene.
Right?

781
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:56,060
Because it feels real and it was and yes.

782
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:59,480
So we try and there's another
scene filmed on the iPhone pipe.

783
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,520
Did anybody figure out what it was?

784
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:09,520
Come on you guys. Are there any
technical, geeky cause warts at there?

785
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:15,680
Um,
it was it the birth scene.

786
00:47:15,681 --> 00:47:19,070
I know there was that there's the face
time interaction or not winning. Oh yeah.

787
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,510
Good.
But that wasn't it.

788
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:21,743
Yeah.

789
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,250
I'm not going to tell we're going to
give a prize. If anybody figures it out,

790
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,790
you're going to get something special
in the mail. It might be a cup. Oh,

791
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,310
this is what we worked for.
You.

792
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:38,983
Okay.

793
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,910
I bet you didn't put anything on,
on the wall on filling in the blanks.

794
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:49,980
Oh yeah. Tony and Dominic both rode
on the wall. What did you put a, well,

795
00:47:49,981 --> 00:47:53,970
it says before I die. Dot Dot.
Dot. Before I die. I want it to,

796
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,440
and I wrote fear nothing. And that's
what you see her writing in the movie.

797
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,890
That's amazing. Um, did you guys
want to put anything, uh, when, uh,

798
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,190
when you saw that or would you
of wanting to put something up?

799
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:11,070
Well then it became a whole exercise
at the end. Credits is the entire wall.

800
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:13,440
So they spent months creating
things that they would want to tell.

801
00:48:13,441 --> 00:48:16,940
We sat there with a chop
board while we were editing,

802
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,050
like doing the final mix of the movie.

803
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:23,340
Me and my assistant just wrote like all
the things got people to write all this

804
00:48:23,341 --> 00:48:27,000
stuff by hand. That's the end
credits of the film. I love it.

805
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,690
It's fun.

806
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,650
Well,
it's time to wrap up soon.

807
00:48:30,651 --> 00:48:33,740
So do you have any parting words of advice
for anyone going through life's crazy.

808
00:48:33,741 --> 00:48:35,150
Athens sands is with a best friend.

809
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:37,263
Keep on trucking,

810
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:39,840
make them laugh,

811
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,820
try to make them laugh and
see the fun side of it. Yeah.

812
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:46,470
And for anyone watching here,

813
00:48:46,471 --> 00:48:49,590
the movie will come out in theaters
and two weeks on November six.

814
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,660
Thank you ladies for having us.
I giggle.

815
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:56,420
Thanks for having us guys.
Yay.

816
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,580
Thank you for all the fun stuff you guys.
