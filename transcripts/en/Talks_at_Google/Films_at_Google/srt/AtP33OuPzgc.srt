1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,510
So thanks for coming. I really
appreciate you my first time at Google.

2
00:00:08,511 --> 00:00:11,880
It's kind of overwhelming. Really. Yeah,
I had imagined, but you know, Pixar,

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,260
you like a postage stamp.
This is like a country. Uh,

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,320
the city of mountain view
was very generous to us. So
most of the time. Um, yeah.

5
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,780
So thanks to cliff for arranging this and,

6
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:27,850
and the authors program and thanks to
Disney for bringing you out and arranging

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,820
the clips and stuff. Um, oh, that's, no,
that's the guy who's the Mars rover guy.

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,770
Really? Yeah. So you should tie that I've
talked to you. Yeah. So, uh, John Carter,

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,090
John Carter. So I actually would like to
start in the will drive ab people nuts.

10
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:44,870
I'd love to have the concept art from
when you were, how old were you? Uh,

11
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:49,280
it was a 11. You're 11 years old.
Perishing draftsmen skill. So this is you.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,170
This is you here or it's me.
So you were 11. I was 11.

13
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:56,990
And then I think if there's
another one there that's a,

14
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:59,660
that's Mark Andrews at age 10.
Look how good he could draw.

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,010
And he really kicked it.
But I hate him. It's, um,

16
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,640
and then I think also you have a
Michael Shay bond froze nine. Yeah.

17
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:10,350
Putting himself that's a little bit
more accurate for nine years old. Yeah.

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,650
I'm like his,
his foot robot.

19
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,890
The one thing come between all three
of us besides that we all wrote on this

20
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:20,690
picture was that we all were infected by
the book that this movie came from, uh,

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,860
called a princess of Mars.

22
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:26,861
And we'd all read it similar ages and
all couldn't sort of drop the images and

23
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:32,150
um, and characters that stuck in our
heads as we grow, grew older. I mean,

24
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:35,990
we all have things that sticking
our heads in the formative years,

25
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:39,110
whether it's an album we've heard or
movie we've seen or a book we've read.

26
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:40,310
And this was one of them.

27
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,293
Yeah.

28
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,830
So we said we had to have a little
club once we found this out.

29
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:48,190
We didn't know this until we were all
writing really. And we said we should, oh,

30
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,330
now that we have to make it,

31
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:52,540
like if any other writer comes on this
at the right half to have a drawing

32
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:56,520
improve that they like read this book
when they were a kid. That's really, yeah.

33
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,310
I didn't discover burrows
until much later. Fortunately.
No, I couldn't. Like I, I,

34
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,930
I'm actually, I shouldn't even
be on this day. Um, but it's, uh,

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,711
it's interesting cause you know,

36
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:10,420
1917 and I just haven't seen was
when it was published, compiled,

37
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,570
but it was, we actually started 1912
was when he started in copyright.

38
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:17,140
I might point you exactly.
And so it, uh, it's,

39
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:21,220
it's literally a hundred years to last
month. Wow. That's pretty amazing. So,

40
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,030
so this brings up the question of
an anachronism, right? So, you know,

41
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:28,530
people are like, well, he gleefully
embracing anachronisms the book.

42
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,900
So what did you think about this? Did
you ever hit a point where you're like,

43
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:35,830
well, it's just not Mars enough,
it's just not real enough? You know,

44
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:37,240
there's this weird assumption

45
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:38,883
that

46
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,310
you have to modernize,
contemporize or bring, I mean,

47
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:47,470
I made a movie about fish that talk
underwater that was inaccurate.

48
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,770
I find that if you have a problem
with me taking license with Mars,

49
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,910
then it's a sad world.

50
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:56,810
You live in that you can't take license
and have stories where you take a couple

51
00:02:56,811 --> 00:03:00,340
of things. You mean Grimms fairy
tales have like, there was a sausage,

52
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,710
a burden of mouse and they lived in a
house together and you're like, okay.

53
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,040
You know what I mean?
It's, it's, it's a, it's,

54
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,890
that's just the fun of stories is taking
a couple of things are one thing and

55
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,920
just going, what if, and that's
what Burroughs did. You know,

56
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:16,660
that was the period of time
when telescopes had just
gotten slightly improved

57
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:19,180
and they could see a little bit
better on the surface of Mars.

58
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:21,940
And they saw these lines and some people,
you know,

59
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:25,030
I think it was personal low that just
thought that they were canals and it got

60
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:27,190
everybody thinking about
maybe people live there.

61
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,140
And then you just see
this plethora of, of, uh,

62
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,560
just fantasizing.

63
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:36,670
And imagination go on that
didn't have a title to it yet,

64
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,180
but it wasn't until the 30s or forties
that they started calling it science

65
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:42,200
fiction in a sort of,
you know,

66
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,750
common way that we do not denigrating
way back then. It was still horrible.

67
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,020
Yeah. Pulp. But the
interesting thing is that I,

68
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,120
the thing that I loved about the book
and what we felt was the DNA about it,

69
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,030
the theme,

70
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,490
the thumb print about it to capitalize
on that hadn't been done by anybody.

71
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,730
Even though it's inspired so many things.
Yeah.

72
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,890
Was that it felt like
a romantic adventure.

73
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,930
It felt like somebody that just wanted
to explore and find one more last

74
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:12,160
continent on our planet.

75
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,970
It didn't read like somebody that wanted
to travel in a spaceship and go to

76
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:18,070
space. It was almost
against his will. He's like,

77
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,520
I have nowhere else I can uncover.
The guy got to go off the planet.

78
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,520
But it was like, it was sort of
like a reluctant choice in it,

79
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:28,510
but it was really this sense of desire
to, to explore, find a new culture,

80
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,720
find a new war,
um,

81
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,180
civilization that had been going on in
parallel the whole time that we just

82
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:37,690
didn't know about, which had been
happening for a hundred, hundred 50 years.

83
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,230
Honored.
And so that's what I loved about the book.

84
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:44,770
And it reads like a tourist that's gone
there and kept a journal on in some ways.

85
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:46,330
I mean,
you made it very clear in the movie,

86
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:50,490
which you were Nice enough
to show me when that you, um,

87
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,860
you made it really clear that John
Carter was looking to get the hell out of

88
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:57,100
what we knew as being the world, you know,
he needed to get away from it. I mean,

89
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,270
that was, that was, that was something
we added, um, again, because of the,

90
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,230
one of the downsides of the,
uh,

91
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,930
antiquated nature of the book was that it,
uh,

92
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,180
it had very sort of simplistic character
development and some of those things

93
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:20,050
very quickly became tropes.
They were cool for a while.

94
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:22,870
When you're doing flash Gordon and uh,

95
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,260
and even early superman and buck
Rogers where you had just the,

96
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,820
the hero that would fight anything and the
Damsel's would go, oh, help me. And uh,

97
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,480
but that was not interesting to us
at all and I wouldn't expect it to be

98
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,860
interested in anybody else.
We took that,

99
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,910
we took sort of these core elements of
them and kept them as starting points.

100
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:42,400
But if they were any character that
we had been developing in on anything

101
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:43,840
original and anything else I've worked on,

102
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:47,280
we would've said it's nowhere near
enough. We need to, we need to, you know,

103
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,720
add a lot more to them. So we, we said,

104
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:54,490
what if it was more of an origin story
of somebody that had that nature of

105
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,340
fighting for justice no matter
what did they compelled to,

106
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,230
to help others,

107
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,430
but they had gotten bitten really hard
for it and they were afraid to sort of

108
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,970
venture out again to do it. And
that made it interesting. Yeah.

109
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,720
We're running out of power
because the lights are going down.

110
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:13,170
I think people are turning off their
laptops and maybe it's surging. Yeah.

111
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,700
Um, so, uh, I asked a friend of yours,
well, a colleague of Yours, Rob Cook,

112
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,470
so I don't have any friends.
You don't have any friends?

113
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,970
It's the cost of Hollywood and the
Hollywood. I live up here. Well, I,

114
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:29,970
you know, I live in mill valley.
I work at Pixar, so that's nice.

115
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,320
The cost of mill valley,
the cost of living in the
Alleles, it's a horrible place.

116
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,580
Uh, no, I'm kidding. My, my wife's
family's from there. Um, so,

117
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,220
so rob cook, uh, who was who, who
just retired after 30 years at Penn?

118
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,040
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Um,

119
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,980
so he just retired and he became the
first like concerned Meritus or whatever.

120
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,760
Yeah. That's going to go to his
head. Yeah, it is a, and I said,

121
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,680
is there anything I can ask him that he
hasn't been asked before? He was like,

122
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:58,680
I don't think so, man. And so I wanted
to talk to you about feet, feet.

123
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,670
So early.
I used to work on games.

124
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,930
And one of the problems of courses
when you would, when you would,

125
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,700
when you would have these
artificial characters, you know,

126
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,050
their feet never looked real.

127
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:11,900
I see the way the feet and met the
ground never really looked right.

128
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:14,990
And it's like, and, and you guys
picks her really mastered this.

129
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:17,480
And then you're thrown into this world
where you have human beings you have to

130
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:19,670
deal with.
So how did you deal with these?

131
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,820
And you mentioned earlier a little bit
of the trouble of having to deal with

132
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:27,590
live action and real things and sets
that you'd never done at Pixar. And so,

133
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,270
yeah, it's like, well,

134
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,380
I'm going to try to make a connection
between those two and feet. Um, well,

135
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,310
I don't really like feed that. You know,
the thing he's talking about his weight,

136
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:37,940
right?

137
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,480
And that's the thing that you see first
time animators make the mistake of all

138
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:45,520
the time. It's not giving things
proper weight. Um, there's just the,

139
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:49,190
there's a sense of weight to everything
in the world and whether you're really

140
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:53,030
conscious effort to not, and
that's, that's what, uh, the, uh,

141
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,490
Disney animators had really
mastered and figured out and we,

142
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:59,740
and we had sort of pulled from and
John and added to Pixar and definitely,

143
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,430
you know, made that a big deal when we
were, uh, animating on, on this picture.

144
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,160
What a lot of people don't know is that
this movie is got more in a character

145
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:10,090
animation in it than any other
movie I've ever worked on. Um,

146
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:15,110
putting the fish movie, including that
fish movie that we will not mention email.

147
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:20,600
Um, and, uh, it's, um,
it's, so it really was not.

148
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,280
I did and I never swapped one form of
making movies for another. I, I felt like,

149
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:25,521
oh,

150
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:30,521
I had to use everything I knew and
then add on top of it a live action,

151
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,410
uh, skills that I had to
sort of learn on the go. Um,

152
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,180
and the big myth,

153
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,480
this even happened on the set I would
get on set on the first couple of weeks

154
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,920
ago.
What's it like to work with people?

155
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:48,010
Humans like I have never
directed a computer or an
inanimate object in my life.

156
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,150
All I've ever done is to talk to a human
being and I've talked to people that

157
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:56,250
had to be good at their job,
that had special talents and skills

158
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,490
specifically at whatever they did.
They were great at modeling something,

159
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:01,770
they were great at lighting something.
They are great at camera.

160
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,160
All of all of them having not only much
more intelligence than me but mostly

161
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:09,090
more talent in whatever the arena was.

162
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:12,330
So I was used to debating all the time
and you guys, I don't need to convert.

163
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:12,840
You get that.

164
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,830
Like if you and I were talking about
where the camera's going to go or what the

165
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:21,390
model is going to be on a computer, we
can like debate for a couple of minutes,

166
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,120
hours, days about it. Just the,
you know, just, just creatively.

167
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,800
And then you've got to ask the box to
do it and then it becomes this unwieldy

168
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:32,730
toddler that will not cooperate and not
do what you want and you start banging

169
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:35,550
on it, you're cursing. And that's
where you run out of time and money.

170
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,370
That's where like everybody thinks
I get it from, I mean I've been,

171
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,430
I'm just coming off of a world tour where
every person that asks from the press

172
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:45,091
thinks,
well,

173
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:47,280
what's it like to come from a world
where you can just do whatever you want?

174
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,030
And I'm like, wow, wow.

175
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:53,520
You have never worked with computers,
have you?

176
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,680
Because I felt like I could get whatever
I wanted on the live action set.

177
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,470
I've never told this story.
This is a good one. Um, the,

178
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,070
the way the way picks are set up is based,
you know, we just made up how we made,

179
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,560
how to make movies. We did it with
our gut and with our instinct.

180
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:14,660
And I think that helped us. We use logic,
which turns out Hollywood doesn't. And,

181
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,210
and we based it around how
John lasted or work to.

182
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,380
So John always knows what he wants.
I mean,

183
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:22,440
or at least he's always good at
facilitating how to know what to want and

184
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:23,730
whether it's micro or macro.

185
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,860
So we built a machine that works
based on how well the director knows.

186
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,550
There's stuff. If the director
doesn't know what what's going on,

187
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,540
the machine doesn't move forward at all.
Um,

188
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,980
and if they really know or they start to
get an idea of the machine moves really

189
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:39,510
well in live action,

190
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,450
the machine moves whether the director
comes out of his trailer or not.

191
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,750
Which is a real sad that happened to
statement. Well no but, but, but it,

192
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,790
but it was really fascinating.
There'd be days where like,

193
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,260
they're called setups when you're gonna
move the camera to another place and

194
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:54,600
start a new shot, there'll
be days where like, okay,

195
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:57,390
we finished that shot and before I could
tell anybody what we were going to do,

196
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,910
they'd all start moving the camera and
putting it somewhere else and I'd play

197
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:03,360
this little, um, you know, just
functional game of going there.

198
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,700
I'm going to wait and see if anyone's
going to ask me what we're going to shoot

199
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:09,720
next because they seem to not care. They
seem to be putting it where they will.

200
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,360
I haven't had to talk
that much with Brad Bird,

201
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:14,730
but we did compare that that was
happening to both of us were like,

202
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:17,370
is anybody going to ask me what
they want the next shot to be? Wow.

203
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:18,270
They seem to be fine.

204
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:20,550
I'm just gonna let them set it up now
and then they'll find out without,

205
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:24,420
I don't want that camera there.
And um, it didn't happen a lot,

206
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,580
but you started to realize it was,

207
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:32,210
it was based on just you have to get it
done regardless of if you have an inept

208
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,740
director or the best
director in the world,

209
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:36,840
they have to work with the
lowest common denominator,

210
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:41,250
which is really kind of sad. And
uh, but, but they're also bay.

211
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,760
They're there live actions based on,
nobody wants to look bad.

212
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,960
Nobody wants to look like they
weren't ready for any request.

213
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,350
So they're all like on edge, like
whatever he says, whatever. He says,

214
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,380
you know what I do?

215
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,550
And I finally figured that out about three
months into the shoot and we were out

216
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,390
of London in,

217
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,890
in Utah and I'm in this western set that
they've built out in the middle of Utah.

218
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:04,750
It's fantastic. Is that where the arena
was built? Is that what I was reading?

219
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:08,550
It's where everything was built, whether
you saw it side and um, and so I'm,

220
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,830
I'm Taylor who is the lead
is walking through a doorway.

221
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,190
It's your classic cowboy coming
into the saloon kind of shot.

222
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:20,191
And I was feeling like it was a little
too cliche and I had no clue that anybody

223
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,590
had any of these or anything.
I just went,

224
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,770
we need two chickens here

225
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,340
and five minutes, here's
chicken. There were two chickens

226
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,510
and if you see the movie,
you'll see there's two chickens.

227
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,300
And I really didn't need to chickens.

228
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,460
I just at that point wanted to see can
they get three to chicken? And they did.

229
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,330
It was amazing. So, um, I never
wanted to do abuse that privilege,

230
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,390
but it is kind of a,
that's to go back to,

231
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,190
I could get that faster than if I
ever asked for two chickens at Pixar.

232
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,050
Six months would go by and
then we debated, do we really
need to do it? You know,

233
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:02,760
how should they be model what color
feathers do? My Gosh. And so it's,

234
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,720
that's a long answer from way back
when that question, but two chickens,

235
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:10,190
that's kind of cool. So we get back to
the question of CGI actors now, right?

236
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,470
CGI actors. So, so one of the
things when rob gave his talk here,

237
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:18,240
as he talked about how much work you put
into matching was [inaudible] up with

238
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:21,140
Billy Crystal's mannerisms and the
way he moves his mouth, right? Grass.

239
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:25,440
And then you have these things with
mouse that are twice as wide. Yes.

240
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,240
And forearms. So they don't
really or not, you know,

241
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,370
the torches are not gonna match
up like that. Nope. They would.

242
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:33,330
So how did you approach this? Well,
every, to be honest, there's no science.

243
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,290
I mean every, there's a philosophy,
but every single character

244
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,400
do you model every single, uh,
voice you add to it is a different,

245
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,430
uh,
problem to solve.

246
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,640
And it's no different than an actor
being given a new role in another movie.

247
00:13:47,641 --> 00:13:48,000
There's,

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,880
there's hopefully something new and
different about it with the same goal of

249
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:53,250
making you believe that that
character really exists.

250
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,440
So that's part of the thrill.
I mean,

251
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:57,810
if you don't enjoy trying to figure that
out, that you shouldn't be doing it.

252
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,550
I mean, that's, that's part
of the fun. Um, and, um, I,

253
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,420
you know, all I ever wanted when I read
that book was to believe it. I want it.

254
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,670
I didn't see the world in animation.

255
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:11,160
I didn't see the world in
cartoons when I was a kid. I just,

256
00:14:11,161 --> 00:14:13,170
when I read something,
I w I was transported,

257
00:14:13,171 --> 00:14:17,190
I was there and I always wanted to
know what it would be like to be on the

258
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,750
surface of Mars and meet
one of these creatures and,

259
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,610
and believe them as much as
I believe anybody else that
I'm talking to right now.

260
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,540
And, uh, when we did a test for
this movie a year in advance,

261
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,360
we made sure our test wasn't flashy,
wasn't jumping around,

262
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:31,530
it was just two guys talking.

263
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,900
And would I take it as simply as a quiet
moment between butch and Sundance in

264
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:39,660
the, you know, like, and uh, and
that was the goal because I said,

265
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:42,840
if we can make that
work, then, then we can,

266
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,390
it's possible to do this film
in the airspace. I want to,

267
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,750
I feel a little frustrated
sometimes because in the marketing,

268
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:51,000
all they can do is show 15 seconds,
30 seconds,

269
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,450
and it gives the impression that's this
Whizzbang, you know, going to movie.

270
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,910
And it's not, it's, it's,

271
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:59,670
it's a very much about emotion and
relationships and romance and adventure in

272
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:01,760
quiet moments. And we're, and that's,

273
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:05,950
to me what's so sexy about it in a weird
way was the quiet stuff was just the

274
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,240
like, wow, we're, I'm just
really talking to these people.

275
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,070
And I knew to believe that,

276
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:14,300
that you would fundamentally not only
have to pull what I was used to at Pixar

277
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,380
for the animated characters,

278
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,130
but I'd have to believe the live
action characters as much I can.

279
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,720
I feel like I can tell when an actors
acting against the tennis ball or a green

280
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:25,260
wall.
Um,

281
00:15:25,261 --> 00:15:28,250
and you can also tell when an actress
does activity against another actor and

282
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:30,350
they're not getting anything.
Um,

283
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,230
I wanted there to believe that
there was just a real engagement,

284
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:36,560
a real just in the moment.
So I thought, well,

285
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:41,460
I have to have great actors up against
great actors, so I need, you know,

286
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,860
somebody that like, uh, willing to
foes stature and Samantha Morton's, uh,

287
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,080
to be willing to play these ultimately
CGI characters because I know what's

288
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:54,860
going to remain at the end of the
day is their voice, their eyes,

289
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,230
and their movements.
And,

290
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,500
but I also know that none
of that comes for free.

291
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,010
There's been a lot of misdirection
about talking about Mo cap.

292
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,860
Like it's going to actually
do the job for anybody.

293
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,070
It's just a pencil and
it's only as magic fairy.

294
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,490
It's only as good as the
user that uses it. And again,

295
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:15,890
I'm preaching to the choir here.
You guys all know this.

296
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,930
It's all about who you have,
not what you have.

297
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,000
And I knew that I needed a great
actor on one side and at the back end,

298
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:25,730
a great animator.
And as long as I had those,

299
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:28,910
we'd struggle through whatever tools we
thought were the smartest way to work

300
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,810
and what drove the tools we worked
between it was what's going to give me the

301
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:36,470
most believable presence
on, on, in the actual shot,

302
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:39,140
while I felt I don't want
it to feel synthetic,

303
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:41,240
I want to have as much screen real estate,

304
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,360
be real and warm and, and, and, and, uh,

305
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,830
uh, sort of, uh, uh, what am,

306
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:53,690
what am I thinking of broken and imperfect
and not be cold calculated in video

307
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,330
gamey at the end of the day,
no matter how good it looks,

308
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,910
you can feel a little bit of a separation,

309
00:16:58,911 --> 00:17:02,780
a little bit of coldness when too much
is CGI in a live action combo movies.

310
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,780
So I said, well, to
guarantee that won't happen,

311
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,170
let's actually go to the most
cool desert location we can,

312
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,050
let's actually put the actor in front
of the camera and let's actually put the

313
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:14,030
other actor that's going to
be CGI in front of the camera.

314
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:16,670
But because they're nine
foot tall or 10 feet tall,

315
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:19,190
I need to make sure that the eyes are
going to be exactly what the other eyes

316
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:20,450
are going to look.
Or else again,

317
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:22,340
it's going to look like they're not really
looking at each other and they're not

318
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:27,110
really reacting off of impulse. So I need
these other actors to stand on stilts,

319
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:32,000
wear gray pajamas with weird head gear
and be like mountain goats and go up and

320
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:34,090
down like you know these desert hills and,

321
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,850
and that's how I actually sold it
to people like Samantha and Willem.

322
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,201
I said,

323
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:42,590
how would you like to wear gray pajamas
on stilts and with headgear and being

324
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:46,460
120 degree heat in the desert?
I figured, why hide it?

325
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,200
And that was literally the first
pitch line I would have to them.

326
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,390
And it was like, it was, it kind of had
this great reverse psychological effect.

327
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:55,020
There was, it was like a dare.
They were like, really, really?

328
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,550
Nobody's ever dared me to do that before.
I think I'll take it, you know, and,

329
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:04,230
and, and it worked. And it was,
and they loved it because these,

330
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,570
they've made so many movies, they just
wanted to be challenged again and um,

331
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,810
it was difficult, but nothing effort,
nothing that looks effortless in art,

332
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,480
uh,
is effortless.

333
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,560
It typically is that if it looks
effortless and it looks like it was always

334
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:20,520
ordained to be that way,

335
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:24,720
that means a tremendous amount of
inverse effort went into it. Um,

336
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:27,300
so it was a really difficult
shoot along those lines. Actually,

337
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:30,510
the relationship that was
expressed in the film between Tar,

338
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,350
starkist and Sola was probably in some
ways the most poignant, right? Yeah. Well,

339
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:37,890
again, I had willing to phone Smith
more than acting against each other.

340
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:40,640
I just had to get out of the
way. Did they have a lot of, uh,

341
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,830
did they do a lot of work with your
animators and your folks know it was very

342
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,461
separated,

343
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:48,960
but the people that were our head
animators are supervising animators that

344
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,460
basically it's trickled down.

345
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,580
They basically are as the guide that
keeps it on track because you always have

346
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:56,130
multiple animators doing a
single character. You know,

347
00:18:56,131 --> 00:19:00,200
there was 50 animators on Dora yet it
had to come across like w only yelling,

348
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,740
just dreamt, generous seem to be
acting it right. As an example. So, uh,

349
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,880
you have the people that were the
supervising animators, they were on set,

350
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,930
they were on set all the time so that
they could just firsthand be aware of what

351
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:15,410
was going on. Also be there
when they heard, you know,

352
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:18,450
what I liked versus what I didn't like.
If we came up with ideas,

353
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:22,170
we could discuss it and it wouldn't get
lost in the ether. And a year later,

354
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:22,420
you know,

355
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,930
or actually for me it was like eight
months later when we were suddenly in

356
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,330
animation production,
uh,

357
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,810
we would have a shorthand and
a then that's how it worked.

358
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,340
That's really interesting.
It's funny,

359
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,370
Dory. So we'll have questions, uh, in
near the end of the, of the talk here.

360
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:39,470
So, uh, you don't want to
line up or anything now,

361
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,920
but if you want to fill it
out and moderator, or if
you want to, uh, go to the,

362
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:45,500
Mike just made me think of your questions
cause I'm not gonna get all the good

363
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:50,210
questions, I assure you. Um, so going
from people, the crowds, I mean,

364
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:52,310
you had some fairly amazing

365
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,950
collection. Yeah. You
know, um, there was, uh,

366
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,870
there were days when I had 500 people
in front of the camera. It was wild.

367
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:07,330
Um, it was thrilling. I
mean, you can't help but, um,

368
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,020
I would explain to people on days that I
like when, when you had days like that,

369
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:14,890
when the set was that big or you'd have
an entire air ship that's like on a

370
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,040
gimbal left and right, that took
up a gym, you know, to, you know,

371
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,330
a half a football field or,

372
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,940
or you were out there on the
city street with 500 extras.

373
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,780
Sometimes if you thought too hard about
it, you'd shut down. So I just go,

374
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:29,650
just pretend it's digital. Just pretend
it's digital. You've worked with worlds.

375
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,930
They're 10 times bigger than this,
you know,

376
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,990
just pretend it's digital and then you
kind of overcome it and you're fine.

377
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,823
All right.

378
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,990
So, uh, Tar Sarkis it's
all, they're all great,

379
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:44,991
but in some ways I found the most
fun of the movie was in the dog dog,

380
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,243
you know?
Yeah.

381
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,940
He's got the easy job of just
being entertainment. Well, he,

382
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:54,670
he's that entertaining in the
book if you want to talk about it,

383
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,560
cause I don't want to ruin
the role. I mean, you know,

384
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,340
I don't want to give too much away
about how you meet him, but um, he's uh,

385
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,400
he's basically the equivalent of a dog
or a small bear or something like that

386
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,110
in, in, in a, in this world. Um,

387
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,480
and we tried really hard because there's
so much flora and fauna and so much a

388
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:19,540
nature that is described in these books
as again, it's, if you had gone there,

389
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,790
right, that we wanted the stuff
not to come across like fanboy.

390
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,750
We didn't want to come across
like this with somebody.

391
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,510
That's been drawing this
character on their, their,

392
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,160
their notebook through school for their
whole life and all they've ever want to

393
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:33,250
do is just realize it on the screen
since they were 11. Exactly. No,

394
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,520
and we wanted it to, we wanted
it to feel like I'm, no,

395
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:40,110
this is what nature intended and
this is what nature required, uh,

396
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,650
and evolve to for anything on this planet.
Um,

397
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:48,640
so we pulled from every kind
of, uh, animal creatures,

398
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,880
sea life, whatever it
was that to, to find a,

399
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:56,230
a sort of continuity and logistics
behind all the physiology behind every

400
00:21:56,231 --> 00:22:00,310
creature here. Um, but you know what,
let's just a fun, fun character.

401
00:22:00,311 --> 00:22:02,980
I don't know if you're going to show a
clip because if know we're showing a clip

402
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:05,660
of will. I don't want to, all right.
I still don't want to ruin them.

403
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,330
You'll enjoy Willa. Yeah, he's great.

404
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,110
And it's funny and the reaction of the
audience when it was shown was what it

405
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,270
was just, you could hear the glee,
you know, how they appreciate them.

406
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,020
I want to believe that, you know,
when Burroughs wrote the book,

407
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,910
he had never written anything before.

408
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,220
He was very frustrated with what he was
reading for adventure stories. And I,

409
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,080
and I think he was trying to
read stories to his son and he,

410
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:28,930
and he just sort of winged it and fit.

411
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,660
And I think you said I could basically
write better than what I'm reading,

412
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:35,980
you know. And um, and I, I know
weird way I think for doing that,

413
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:38,750
even though you can look at the
book and find all these in a,

414
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,890
this sort of naive writer and a
lot of things that could be better,

415
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:44,470
better character development,
maybe some better plotting,

416
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,890
it still holds up because
it's made with such sincerity.

417
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,920
I really feel like somehow he tapped
closer to real myth for being innocent and

418
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,330
unafraid to just jump into it.

419
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,680
And I find a real kinship to that with
what it felt like with being with the

420
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,990
gang. When we first started
making toy story, we,

421
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,480
we didn't know how it was
done with collectively.

422
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:08,160
We had sort of half the knowledge
you needed. And, um, and,

423
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:12,250
and that's what really drove
us. Uh, and, and, and I, and I,

424
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,370
I'm so glad we didn't know better or
else we wouldn't have made some of the

425
00:23:15,371 --> 00:23:19,450
glorious mistakes we made that led us
to some of the better answers. And, um,

426
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:22,780
and so I think that
that's why in a weird way,

427
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,610
there's a lot of elements to his stuff
that holds up today. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

428
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:28,240
it's funny,

429
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,720
the Pixar nerd in me wants to ask you
like how you would have done Wally

430
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:35,550
different after doing this, but it
seems like such a Weirdo Wally. No,

431
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,150
nobody's ever asked this.
I'm wildly,

432
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:40,900
really was a great movie

433
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:48,080
set up or prep. Yeah.
For me to do this movie,

434
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:51,680
because it was all about imperfection.

435
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:57,230
It was all about trying to figure out
how to make them for Wally make it feel

436
00:23:57,231 --> 00:24:02,090
like you just discovered this guy
and life with this life was going on,

437
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:03,800
whether you documented it or not.

438
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,440
And so it is a sad thing that when
you do an all computer graphics movie,

439
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:13,430
nothing comes for free. You have
to plan everything. So we were,

440
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,470
we had to plan for imperfection.

441
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,020
We had to break down and deconstruct
what tells you that you're using a camera

442
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:22,790
because of the imperfection in the Lens.

443
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:26,420
What tells you that a human being's
holding the camera because of the inertia

444
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:27,830
and the muscle fatigue.

445
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:32,030
What tells you that you're working within
an actual space that's really tiny and

446
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:33,270
you have to change your,
your,

447
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,800
your choices of how your camera work is
because you're stuck in the corner with

448
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:39,350
the camera.
Like all of that stuff was planned.

449
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,030
You don't get any of that for free.

450
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:45,980
So anything that felt kind
of gritty and imperfect, uh,

451
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:48,670
in any of our movies,
let alone that one was planned,

452
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,460
which can drive you insane.
Um,

453
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,640
and but I knew that that was the thing
to embrace and try to capitalize on and

454
00:24:58,011 --> 00:24:58,821
again own.

455
00:24:58,821 --> 00:25:03,821
But I get a lot more for free for shooting
a in the conditions that we shot for

456
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,540
Carter.
So that again,

457
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:08,750
it would feel like this is probably
really happening somewhere.

458
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,220
So like real so,

459
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,090
so it's funny cause so thank God I made
Wally before it or I wouldn't have had

460
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:18,650
that instinct. Yeah. Now you can sort
of in some ways, and I know that,

461
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,220
uh, up was not so much
yours, but you know,

462
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,530
you can sort of trace this sort of like
animals, that Pixar sorta thing really.

463
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,610
And I sort of in some weird way,
maybe it's me and that's okay. Um,

464
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,190
but you know, where you see,
you know, animals like Doug,

465
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,630
I look to Molly and all the
rest of, you know, leading
the things like, right. Yeah.

466
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,870
So, so that you can see like there's a
history there and you sorta want to, well,

467
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:42,810
it's a natural instinct.

468
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,360
It's a much more natural instinct for an
animator to give life to something that

469
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:52,220
isn't human, right. Because it's just,
I, it's just how you're wired up. I mean,

470
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:55,790
humans, do you have the
exact example? Exact example.
They're right. They're right.

471
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,470
And when I was in, uh, you know,

472
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,180
I grew up in this small town where there
wasn't as many kids like me that liked

473
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:06,850
all the exact same thing. We were all sort
of, you know, smaller minority game on,

474
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,860
you know, Andrew's. Yeah. And, um,

475
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,130
so it wasn't until I went to college for
animation that I met other kids of my

476
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:16,070
tight and that I realized
that I was a type like, oh,

477
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:18,800
you also thought your
bike was cold in the rain,

478
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,320
that a fish was lonely in the fishbowl.

479
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,330
That of leaf was afraid of
heights when it fell. You know,

480
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,990
I couldn't stop myself from
looking at things like that.

481
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,880
That was just the way I
always looked at the world.

482
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:32,510
And so imbuing animals and
inanimate objects with things is,

483
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:37,140
is sort of like a, I don't know,
animation one-on-one. Yeah, I bet. I bet.

484
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:41,150
Now it's funny because, so one of
the questions that I mentioned, uh,

485
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,100
like you should ask him
about how he did if for

486
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,030
these guys and stuff.

487
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,350
But I want that and I want you to tell
us about that because that's always

488
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,500
really interesting for, for
me. Uh, and me again. Uh,

489
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:56,370
but the thing that really struck me when
I was watching the film is I was trying

490
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:59,020
to find the things that were
truly alien. Right? Yeah.

491
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,430
Because whenever people do alien
worlds, different worlds, unfortunately,

492
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:06,990
sometimes they're awfully, you
know, us Los Angeles looking thing.

493
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:10,090
Oh really? But, um, but for me, the,

494
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:13,590
the flying machines and the
interfaces and the interface,

495
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:17,550
the interface to use that
word, I'm so sorry. Uh, so,

496
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:20,780
but the interface for controlling
that flying machine, you know,

497
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:25,360
you have this fellow from, you know, you
know, they're just coming out of the, the,

498
00:27:25,361 --> 00:27:29,550
the war, you know, and
something he's presented with
having to fly this thing. Yes.

499
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,290
You have to figure it out. Yeah. I mean,
how much did you work on making that? Oh,

500
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:35,124
it was so fun.

501
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,470
I worked with basically
two people, uh, on all the,

502
00:27:38,471 --> 00:27:40,900
all the props and the machines
and stuff. It's, again,

503
00:27:40,901 --> 00:27:43,510
those are described in the books,
not down to their detail,

504
00:27:43,511 --> 00:27:47,740
but to their major functions.
And stuff. Um, it was with the,

505
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,240
my production designer,
Nathan Crowley,

506
00:27:49,241 --> 00:27:53,200
who works on all of Christopher Nolan's
movies, most of them. And uh, and um,

507
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:58,230
Brian Church who is an incredible concept
artist and a who had ironically worked

508
00:27:58,721 --> 00:28:03,490
on other, uh, failed, uh, attempts to
put a princess of Mars onto the screen.

509
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,520
And,
uh,

510
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,310
we finally came around to it and I just
kept saying without knowing what I was

511
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:10,450
looking for in the very beginning,

512
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:13,810
I just want it to be a period film
of a period I didn't know about.

513
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:18,430
I just want it to look like we researched
our marsh and history and did really,

514
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:22,120
really well. I want it to be
in historical costume drama.

515
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,080
I want it to feel like the satisfaction
you get when you go, oh, this is my,

516
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,060
what be what it was like
to be an ancient Egypt.

517
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:31,420
This is might be what it was
like to be in feudal Japan. And,

518
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,720
and even though nobody knew
that this existed before.

519
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:38,470
So we did a lot of discussion that when
Burroughs wrote this book and when he

520
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:42,550
kind of places the time of things on
earth, it was pre industrial revolution.

521
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,610
And what does that really mean?
Well,

522
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:49,570
it means pre automization for a lot
of things or even the stuff that was

523
00:28:49,571 --> 00:28:54,070
automated, it was so rudimentary, you
could look at it and figure it out.

524
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,970
You had the luxury of just seeing
how everything was connected,

525
00:28:57,971 --> 00:29:01,510
how they're all the gears were attached
and it usually still required a lot of

526
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:06,490
manpower. And so that's very visual.
That's very cinematically friendly.

527
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,490
So we said let's make it in depth
preindustrial revolution on Mars.

528
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,580
Um, I kept saying tall
ships in the sky. Yeah. Um,

529
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,400
when you look at tall ships, I don't know.
I still, I mean my father's not a call.

530
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:24,160
I've been out on boats most of my life
and I still can't figure out half of what

531
00:29:24,161 --> 00:29:28,000
a tall ship does, but I can look at it
and know that everything I'm looking at,

532
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,360
you know, the rigging, the Wa, the
ropes and all the gears and the wood.

533
00:29:31,361 --> 00:29:34,970
And I could tell that like
they all have a function and,

534
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,030
and that's very kind of, um, satisfying.

535
00:29:40,031 --> 00:29:44,620
I mean it's very cool. You, you feel a lot
of history and depth and, and of, of, of,

536
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,700
of, uh, learning that has
happened to, to get to that,

537
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,620
that vessel to that point.

538
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,750
And that's what we decided to do
with everything on Mars was, uh,

539
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,310
make it feel that you
could see the manual labor,

540
00:29:57,311 --> 00:30:01,450
see all the purpose and the function
and culture behind everything.

541
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,880
And then one of the brain teasers was,

542
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,420
if we want to make it feel that
this has been concurrently going on,

543
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,890
then how do we,

544
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,780
how do we not let it accidentally look
like earth had anything to do with it?

545
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:15,790
Because in other words, if you suddenly
saw a doorknob on a door, you'd be like,

546
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,770
Earth, Earth lame. You know, and
suddenly you're down to like, okay,

547
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,720
I'll look at the Burbank.
Yeah. Fundamentally. How to,

548
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,380
how did they come up with windows? How
did they come up with doors? And you know,

549
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:27,041
it was hard,

550
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:30,190
but it was so satisfying to come up
with those answers because again,

551
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:32,230
none of that stuff's ever pointed out.
It's never,

552
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,900
there's never a spotlight on it. But
if you've done it right, you feel it.

553
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:39,100
I learned a lot of that from just making
worlds at Pixar. I'm like, there's, again,

554
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:41,470
not in a single detail gets on
the screen without planning it.

555
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,680
So I'm used to over planning and making
sure that everything in the mid ground

556
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:48,460
background had a reason and whether
it ever gets addressed or not.

557
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:52,510
And so that really paid off also for a
film like this, sort of like Andy's room,

558
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:56,230
but Mars, yeah. Auntie's room. But
Mars, wow, here's the sales pitch.

559
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:01,450
Here's the sales pitch. I'm
not, but so the language,

560
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:04,400
which sort of dominates his
relationships with them, you know,

561
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,950
sort of mid movie Red Way Ish,
you know, earlier. Yeah. Yeah.

562
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,520
But you obviously put an awful
lot of work into it. I mean, well,

563
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,060
break your heart to go all Babel
juice on it. I mean, you know,

564
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,960
Burroughs did a lot of that. I
mean, he had written 11 books, uh,

565
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,380
of this series by 1960.

566
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,460
And so when I was a kid in 1976 and
found this book at 11, it was already,

567
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,660
it was already done. It was
my Harry Potter. I mean, I,

568
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:31,990
there were so many adventures and you
could just tell the desire to keep

569
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:36,100
discovering places that hadn't been mapped
on the, on the, on, on the, on the, uh,

570
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:39,670
on the world, on the globe was really
what drove each book. It was like, oh,

571
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:42,200
we didn't know about this part of the
world. We didn't know about this country,

572
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,030
didn't know about these people.
And you,

573
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:49,090
and you travel with this little group
that we all meet in the first one and over

574
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:53,110
11 books. That's a lot of Martian
language that he had slowly compiled.

575
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,840
And fortunately, I, it's
called a guide to Barsoum.

576
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,580
Somebody in late sixties early seventies
took the pains and never left their

577
00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:04,810
basement and put it all together in an
encyclopedia. This is before we keep him.

578
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,990
So I think we bought every
copy of it for off Ebay.

579
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:12,140
Everybody in the art department,
Production Really? And a,
yeah, and we were able,

580
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,860
it was half my work done for me.

581
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:17,920
I mean that's usually two years at Pixar
working on something is coming up with

582
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:21,670
that stuff and it still wasn't full
languages. It was only like he wasn't,

583
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:25,090
he never thought about it from like
this wide about how it all connects,

584
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:29,800
but it was enough information that
we could give it to a linguist.

585
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,680
We gave it to a guy named Paul from or
who actually did all the languages for

586
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:33,131
Avatar.

587
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:35,800
And at first I was a little reluctant
because I didn't want to look redundant,

588
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:38,320
but then it turned out to be the smartest
thing because he didn't want to be

589
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:41,750
redundant. And so he wanted to
go a whole nother direction.

590
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:45,020
And also he had a book that
already had a starting point.

591
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:49,290
He had to work in this pool that
burrows had set. And so, um,

592
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,370
and the whole movie, you know, it
doesn't work in Martian language.

593
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:57,080
It only works for maybe a quarter of a
movie. So, uh, it really works out great.

594
00:32:57,081 --> 00:33:00,230
The, the, I, I don't know if this
would thrill than anybody else,

595
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:02,780
but one of the most
thrilling moments for me,

596
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:06,590
we had a week to a week and a half before
we started shooting where we called it

597
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:11,420
the dark camp, um, where we taught the
actors that were going to play Sarcs,

598
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,540
how to walk on stilts,
how to work with Mocap,

599
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,840
how we were going to shoot specific
things and functions that they had to do

600
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,840
with, uh, within certain scenes
and how to learn the language.

601
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,010
So they worked with a,

602
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:27,020
a language coach and they had all their
lines read to them on us on a CD so that

603
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:28,940
they could play it back all the time,
uh,

604
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:31,670
from Paul Fromer for they
get the pronunciation right.

605
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,910
And so they sat in a circle once,
a twice a day,

606
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,500
and they would talk back and forth
to each other with their lines, uh,

607
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:42,350
even though they didn't actually
functionally have a column response.

608
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:44,570
And then what the meanings behind the
lines where they were just to be able to

609
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:47,120
look each other in the eye and talk and
get more used to hearing how each other

610
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:51,470
talk and they start adopting the
same accent. And it was the cool,

611
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:52,310
it was the animator and me.

612
00:33:52,311 --> 00:33:55,490
It was the coolest thing is the
first time I heard Polly Walker,

613
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:59,570
Thomas Haden Church, uh, Willem Defoe and
Samantha Morton all talk to each other.

614
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,440
And I didn't look and I could
tell exactly who was who and I,

615
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:06,410
that's when I knew we were in good hands
that we'd have no problem being able to

616
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,020
follow who was who in the movies. So, so,

617
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,290
so as I'm watching this
and I kept on saying, well,

618
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,620
with the exception of a Darryl's
Hybris character, right?

619
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,710
It seems like it would sort of break
your heart as you're going through it,

620
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:19,610
as you're building this over what,

621
00:34:19,611 --> 00:34:24,470
four years you worked on this by five
years you keep on leaving behind things

622
00:34:24,471 --> 00:34:26,120
like you leave behind the language,

623
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,570
you'll leave behind Bryan Cranston and
now it's like you leave behind all these

624
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:32,240
people and you really,
you have these core people of course,

625
00:34:32,241 --> 00:34:35,210
who you carry through the whole movie,
but it doesn't it kill you to say, oh,

626
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:37,810
we're not going to visit that
language again until the next move.

627
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,260
A real nice problem to have. I mean, it
must be, yeah, that's what the books were.

628
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:46,190
Yeah. We tried to, again, I don't
want to be called hidebound.

629
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,870
I approached all of this.

630
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,050
I don't think I made a single
career choice on this thing.

631
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:55,370
It was all about wanting to finally
see after 36 years as a fan,

632
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:56,610
this thing up on the screen.
Right.

633
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:00,830
And hoping that it would start a snowball
that would start a series that would

634
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:05,270
go as many movies, if not
more as the books, which would
weigh outlive me. I mean,

635
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,820
I can't, I have, there's no way
anybody can promise that'll happen,

636
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:11,060
but that's your hope. So you
have to plan for that. So I plan,

637
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,330
we got the rights to the first
three books and we mapped it out,

638
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:19,360
Michael Mark and I like a good TV
season so that everything has a Meta

639
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,160
underlying goal with it.

640
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,070
And also not being able to be
afraid to like hold something back.

641
00:35:25,071 --> 00:35:26,330
That might've been
great in the first book,

642
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:28,750
but we couldn't find a
narrative excuse for right.

643
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:32,120
And use it in the second or it'll come
up in the third with a much grander

644
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:32,930
purpose.

645
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,350
And the same thing about pulling somebody
or something from one of the later

646
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:37,980
books and put it in earlier and

647
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,750
have the competence and comfort of knowing
there's a grand design that this will

648
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:47,670
all satisfy, uh, if we, if we can keep
going. But I also hate cliffhangers.

649
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:51,600
I hate being left in the dust right
before. I hate the Hubris of like, oh,

650
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:55,890
we'll definitely be back. You know, I
just, I just, I just find that cocky,

651
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:01,080
but Groupons and I'm still frustrated
from buckaroo. Banzai well,

652
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:05,390
thank you. And, and I mean,
I want, I'm still waiting.
Yeah. You know, playing a 10.

653
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,010
So it was a little of what it was.
How do you,

654
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,820
how do you let it so that it
can continue on if you want,

655
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:16,560
but you've been emotionally satisfied
and come to a conclusion at the end of

656
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,270
each of these stories.
For us,

657
00:36:18,271 --> 00:36:22,410
it's a trilogy and each of
these have a very wrapped up,

658
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,250
complete narrative emotional
statement that we're doing,

659
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:30,120
but there are greater things that
will go on if we're allowed to. So,

660
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,640
so if you want to start
lining up to ask questions,

661
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,660
now's a great time to do that. Um, uh,

662
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,530
because I really only have one
question that I, I'm just dying to ask.

663
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,970
So consequence.
So you said,

664
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,600
you mentioned that at your Ted talk in
a way that basically without consequence

665
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:47,040
there is no drama, right? Yep. And
unfortunately as I've gotten older, uh,

666
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:48,180
you come to say,
well,

667
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,570
it's extremely unlike the John Carter
is going to die in this movie, right?

668
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,120
It's extremely unlikely the data
tourist is going to die this movie.

669
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,370
So is there really a consequence?
How do you,

670
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,710
how do you sort of try
to pull out that drama?

671
00:36:58,711 --> 00:37:00,550
I don't want to give away anything,
but you know,

672
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,390
the whole time you're watching it, he
goes back to Earth. Yeah, that's true.

673
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,100
That was part of the narrative
structure. Yeah. So, uh, please

674
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,210
ask,
you're making decisions as a director,

675
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:16,530
how do you conceptualize the audience
of your mind? Is it, is it yourself?

676
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,830
Is it your 11 year old?
Exactly. No, that's it. I mean,

677
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:23,430
I've been asked this question
for 25 years now, 22 years,

678
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,210
and I got mad at the press recently.
I just said, my Gosh, you know,

679
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,880
I'm going to answer this
the same way in five years,

680
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:33,910
in 10 years and 15 years of the same way
I've been answering for the last 20. Uh,

681
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,900
I don't think about who the audience is.
I think about the audience.

682
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:41,970
If I'm ever thinking of the audience,
it's the audience member and myself,

683
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,550
like I can't, I disassociate
myself and go, okay,

684
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:47,670
I'm going to the theater and I'm going
to go see this, would I like this?

685
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,300
But that's the most I would ever
ask from anybody that I love.

686
00:37:51,301 --> 00:37:52,710
That's an artist that I follow.

687
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,400
I'm not sitting there hoping that
Scorsese's tried to second guess my

688
00:37:56,401 --> 00:38:01,401
demographic or tried to test anything or
the Picasso ever did though the Beatles

689
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:06,410
or the stones. I follow them because
I find them to be the tastemakers.

690
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,170
I find them to be the people that they
can see farther past the horizon than I

691
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:14,930
can. And I want to know what
they're getting into that I'm,

692
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,850
I'm not clear on yet. And, and that's,

693
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,990
that's always been obvious to me
that that's what I, I somehow,

694
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:26,850
because movies are these big things with
armies behind them and lots of money

695
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:29,670
and a lot of anxiety from a studio,
uh,

696
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:34,720
it starts involving the
audience and I just feel it.
That's the kiss of death. Um,

697
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,130
and we've never followed

698
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,940
it at Pixar. And Steve got
that from the beginning. So he,

699
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,980
he really is credit.

700
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,060
I always got to get more credit than I
ever do about how much he just firewall

701
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:50,260
does from everything and just let us do,
make all the mistakes,

702
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:54,790
all the gut instincts that we would have
done had we never left home and just

703
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:58,810
we're making this thing for ourselves.
Anything we've made, I've made so far.

704
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,350
Knock on wood, I could care less. I've
ever get to show it to anybody else.

705
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:07,270
I've satisfied me and maybe the people
that I care about peer wise artistically

706
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,550
and that has stood us in such good stead
were superstitious now of ever doing

707
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:14,120
anything more than that.
So,

708
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,420
and I would never want anybody
else to do differently.

709
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,850
I just find it's a little
disrespectful of the audience.

710
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:20,950
It's like Steve had a great saying,

711
00:39:20,951 --> 00:39:25,240
which is it's our job to know what people
want before they do and I think that's

712
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:27,370
incredibly ballsy and
incredibly insightful.

713
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,950
Is that really hard to instill
in the people you work with?

714
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:33,470
Some those coming from the rest?
Not at all, no. The Hollywood,

715
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:37,090
I find that really artistic people get it.
People that don't, I don't really care.

716
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,050
Okay.
I'm glad to hear

717
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,230
you mentioned, you know, you as an artist,

718
00:39:42,231 --> 00:39:46,130
you have to kind of go about your vision
and then kind of see, uh, you know,

719
00:39:46,131 --> 00:39:49,580
once it's out in the world, what people
think of it. Do you ever get into,

720
00:39:49,581 --> 00:39:51,800
you mentioned that the
previous or John Carter,

721
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:55,460
you may not accurately reflect kind
of what your concept is for the movie.

722
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,230
Do you ever have a,
you know,

723
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,600
Journal dialogues with marketing
folks or how did you go about,

724
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:02,970
how do you get to crying like a,
it's not,

725
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:06,660
I've never worked on a movie that was easy
to sell unless it had a two behind it.

726
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:14,610
And so it's, it's, I've, I've had,
I've, I've said to mark and I said,

727
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,570
just get used to, it's never going to
be easy. You're going to get, you know,

728
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,540
silent robots, rats that cook, you know,

729
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,620
Octogenarians with a Korean boy scouts,

730
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,040
romantic adventures that are from 1912.
I mean it's,

731
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:33,930
it's not going to be easy for
you get used to it because

732
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:41,450
people always say to the marketers
and to the studios what they want.

733
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:45,720
They want the door knob. But the truth is,
is that they don't know what they want.

734
00:40:45,721 --> 00:40:45,871
They're,

735
00:40:45,871 --> 00:40:49,920
all they are capable of
doing is describing what they
liked last because they're

736
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:50,754
searching.

737
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,140
But what they really want is a new color
that won't be as cool as the last color

738
00:40:55,141 --> 00:40:58,830
they had saw and they don't know
how to describe that new color.

739
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,480
That's our job.

740
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:05,340
And the marketer said job is to
say it looks exactly like orange,

741
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:10,200
but it won't look like orange. It's a
tough job for them. I'm not trying to get,

742
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:14,310
you know, get them off, you know, off
the hook. But I get it. It's, I mean,

743
00:41:14,311 --> 00:41:17,790
I've had nothing but full cooperation.
I just get the W it's tough. I mean,

744
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,600
I know that once they're in the theater,
they'll go, oh, I always wanted this.

745
00:41:21,601 --> 00:41:23,560
I just didn't know it.
You know? And that's the,

746
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:27,120
that's the feeling I want when
I see or hear something, it's,

747
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:30,960
it's just you're in this weird betwixt
and between prior to to release of

748
00:41:30,961 --> 00:41:32,850
anything. Cool. Thanks. Cool.

749
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,150
Hi. So first of all, I'm a big fan of
the fish movie, so thank you for that.

750
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:42,260
I don't say it,
I don't know.

751
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:46,310
Why can't we say that it
finding Mimo, right? It's,

752
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,980
it's like the movie that must
not be exactly what we call this,

753
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:53,030
the finding Voldemort, the Mars
movie. I, you know, anyway,
so speaking of marketing,

754
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,250
um,
so the book is a princess of Mars.

755
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,470
And when I first started
hearing about the movie,

756
00:41:57,471 --> 00:42:00,110
it was John Carter of Mars
and now it's John Carter.

757
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:02,870
And I know there's obviously a lot of
people in a lot of factors that go into

758
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,771
the title of the movie.

759
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,590
And I was wondering if you could talk
about how that evolved in this case.

760
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,400
I'm at a place now where I'll ruin the
movie if I tell you exactly what I,

761
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,770
why I finally came up with
the decision that I did,

762
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,280
but there was a real sort of testing
that went on with groups and stuff that I

763
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:21,620
couldn't ignore that,
uh,

764
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:25,900
about the title that happened last year
where they found that a large portion of

765
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,360
people, and this is again the wrong
place to say it's too, don't like sigh.

766
00:42:29,361 --> 00:42:33,170
I think they don't like Scifi or think
they know what Scifi means when they hear

767
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:38,120
that word. And the Mars thing was
just boom. It was like saying, um,

768
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,710
will you watch a movie with subtitles?
I don't like to read. I won't see it.

769
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,370
And you just know the,
how many movies you've done,

770
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,480
been denied of what you might enjoy.
You know,

771
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,240
had you just got over that Hump and then
she didn't showed subtitles from the

772
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:55,040
Mars. Shaun's um, I can't,

773
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:59,090
I couldn't ignore that fact. And so,
but then nobody was making me change it.

774
00:42:59,091 --> 00:43:03,230
It was more like, well, how do we want
to deal with this? So I slept on it for,

775
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,250
I dunno, a week and I started
to realize, you know what,

776
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,710
just from a narrative
storytelling standpoint,

777
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:14,270
it's about John Carter and I,

778
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,930
and then I had this idea that
I pitched to Disney. I said,

779
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:21,940
if you'll let me have it the way I'd
like when they leave the theater and then

780
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:25,160
I'll be willing to go the
way that everybody would
feel more comfortable going

781
00:43:25,161 --> 00:43:29,030
into the theater because of Mars is not
going away and it's going to be an every

782
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:32,520
other title if it ever comes
back. So that was really, it

783
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,390
came down to it. So we'll
see. Thank you. Thanks.

784
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,440
Um,
hi there.

785
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:43,180
So I'm a huge fan of Pixar and one thing
I really love about the movies I've

786
00:43:43,181 --> 00:43:45,880
seen is it's more than just a fun story,

787
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:50,440
but there's always a bigger meaning
behind them. Like, for example,

788
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:54,270
maybe it was just me that saw this
or it's all in my head. But um,

789
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,420
like cars for example,

790
00:43:55,421 --> 00:44:00,421
I saw like I saw situations there that
reflected the economy or about how up has

791
00:44:01,781 --> 00:44:03,960
some concepts of like materialism in that.
Yes.

792
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,110
Is that something that you purposely
think of early on when you're coming up

793
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:09,070
with these stories?

794
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,010
I think I can pretty much say of though,

795
00:44:11,011 --> 00:44:14,560
I can't speak for every
filmmaker that at Pixar that no,

796
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,840
because we're so emotionally driven,

797
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:25,010
but we love that anything that starts
to create parallels or feel like it does

798
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:28,890
naturally link up to truths that are
out there, whether they're economic,

799
00:44:28,891 --> 00:44:32,130
political or emotional.
Great.

800
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:36,180
Let's use them because you just want
it to feel that much more grounded.

801
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,040
The last thing any of us want to do or
like having done to us as being preached

802
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,150
when we watch a movie,
um,

803
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,550
I think you want to feel something and
if that turns out to be connected to a

804
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,580
deep truth that you are inspired by,
again,

805
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:53,730
politically or environmentally were great.

806
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:57,510
But what matters to us is
that you're touched here,

807
00:44:57,511 --> 00:45:00,870
not here more than anything else.
Um,

808
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:04,560
it's also just the curse of I'm the guy
that likes the music and then I don't

809
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:07,590
even know what the lyrics were
for years, you know. Oh, you know,

810
00:45:07,591 --> 00:45:11,990
that's about incest. What? I had no idea
coming in that tomb for years, you know.

811
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:16,290
Um, somebody just showed me the lyrics
come my Sharona and they're awful.

812
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,990
They're horrible. I had no
idea. So, but, uh, anyway,

813
00:45:19,991 --> 00:45:21,490
I know my little pretty thank you.
Sure.

814
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,690
Please play full rounded off.
I'm sorry. Got It. Oh, sorry.
Yeah, thanks for coming.

815
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:29,880
I think, I think Wally's actually
one of my favorite Pixar movie.

816
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:33,090
You think you're gonna hear that
a lot and I just had a question.

817
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:35,500
I hope it doesn't offend anyone
at Pixar or you, but, uh,

818
00:45:35,501 --> 00:45:39,150
it just seems like since Disney is like
petting, like, no, he has acquired eight.

819
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:42,630
It's, it seems like Pixar is now
be trying to book some being other,

820
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:44,160
more commercial, like for example, Bait.

821
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:47,640
They suspended production on newt to
focus on cars too. And No, it's just,

822
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:50,010
you worry that there's a tension there.
The sts, cause like, you know, that's,

823
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:54,360
you guys perceiving it. Uh,
it's, it's, it's, it's more
scrutinized now. Okay. There's,

824
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:57,690
we had other projects that we've
killed that we spent years on.

825
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:59,340
We just weren't so publicly.

826
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:04,341
The world is so exposed and transparent
now and everybody cares and everybody's

827
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,050
watching.
We could've,

828
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,230
we could've announced to the high heavens
all the things we killed in the first

829
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:13,800
10 years and nobody would
have listened. Um, so

830
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,270
yeah,

831
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,200
also again,

832
00:46:16,201 --> 00:46:19,440
if I've learned one thing about human
beings for having to study them,

833
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:24,470
so specifically for writing is that
we're born to be conspiracy theorists

834
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,490
and we hate that we can't
make patterns out of things.

835
00:46:29,491 --> 00:46:32,660
And we hate that we can't
connect the dots. And, uh,

836
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,010
we do it without even trying.

837
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:38,870
And I can promise you that there is

838
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:42,200
okay.

839
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,520
Maybe this is too much to say,

840
00:46:43,521 --> 00:46:46,970
but some of my favorite things
of Pixar are yet to come.

841
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,070
So great. Thanks for reassuring
this. Sure. I don't think
that's too much to say.

842
00:46:52,071 --> 00:46:53,900
I mean it's pretty, I don't
want to be cocky. Alright.

843
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:58,560
So one final question. We got it from
the, the livestream actually. Um,

844
00:46:58,561 --> 00:47:01,650
it references your, your Ted talk that
you did just a few days ago. Oh, okay.

845
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:02,020
They're,

846
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,520
they're asking you to explain
the difference between
making the audience to work

847
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:09,930
for their meal and making them feel what
you want them to feel and perhaps tie

848
00:47:09,931 --> 00:47:11,850
that into the work you
did for John Carter.

849
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:16,330
Well, it's just story. It's
the basics of storytelling
it, which is, um, you know, I,

850
00:47:16,331 --> 00:47:21,090
I had this, this, this, this theory
for a while from toy story on once we,

851
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:25,240
you know, toy story sort of left us
with this like, wow, did we do that?

852
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:30,040
And there was a lot of time spent sort
of looking back and, and analyzing and

853
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,640
Rican and deconstructing what,
what the hell did we do? And uh,

854
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,460
and we used to curse that movie
all the time. We're like, Damn,

855
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:40,200
we made that movie too good because it
made us have to, we had to, you know,

856
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:43,300
still would buzz light year.
We had to keep the bar up to that every,

857
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,610
and you know, it's actually a
blessing, not a curse, but man,

858
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:47,110
does it make your life hard?
Yeah.

859
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:52,620
One of the things I remember starting
to get a discovery of a four now seeing

860
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,110
the behind the scenes of making a movie
is I could go back and look at all my

861
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:58,000
favorite movies and with a different eye,

862
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:01,810
a little bit better understanding of
why did I like all these other movies so

863
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:06,190
much? And um, and I realized that, um,

864
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,350
that you're always problem solving,
that you're always in a, in,

865
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:15,040
in good hands being asked to
sort of, uh, hold this thought,

866
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:17,110
put that together,
wait and see where that's going to go.

867
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:21,090
And it's all very orchestrated and,
and um,

868
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:22,840
you were actually working for your meal,

869
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:26,590
but it's done in such an entertaining
and engaging way. You don't know it.

870
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:30,850
And that was what I finally concluded
was that audiences want to work for the

871
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:32,200
meal. I just don't want to
know that they're doing.

872
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:36,900
Yeah. So along those lines as
we're wrapping up, um, but yes, I,

873
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,530
I apply that Don Carter apply
that on everything that I
do. Sorry. That's fine. Uh,

874
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:47,230
so help us cheat on this work, right.
Not by giving us a spoiler or anything,

875
00:48:47,231 --> 00:48:48,550
but like the chickens,

876
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:51,070
everyone who goes to see John Carter who's
seen this now it's gonna look for the

877
00:48:51,071 --> 00:48:53,860
chickens. Right, right. And, and I'm,
I'm thinking about too, when I saw it,

878
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:56,680
cause I didn't have the pre knowledge
of the chickens. I'm like, why?

879
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:00,130
Because it didn't seem different than the
standards for guy walks into a bar and

880
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:04,660
gets punched out. Kind of. Yeah. Right.
I'm not, that's what happened. But anyway.

881
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,870
Um, is there, is there a
direction you want them to,

882
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,120
to have in mind?

883
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,300
Is there something you want them to think
about when they're watching the movie?

884
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:13,601
No.

885
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:18,601
My hope is mommy to go hope is seriously
because we tried so hard to capture

886
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,870
what it felt like.
Not only to read the book,

887
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,680
what it felt like to see so many great
movies in the 70s when I was a kid. Yeah.

888
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:33,720
There's no for knowledge. Oh, exactly.
We knew nothing. I mean, it was,

889
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,920
I look back and I realized how lucky I
was that I didn't know anything before I

890
00:49:39,141 --> 00:49:41,480
saw any of what are
considered these great movies.

891
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:45,920
We just all went to the movie theater,
pay their money, walked, sat down,

892
00:49:45,921 --> 00:49:46,940
and were surprised.

893
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:52,180
And when I think about how much surprise
everybody is denied now kids are denied

894
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:55,810
now. It makes me real
sad. It makes me, it.

895
00:49:55,830 --> 00:50:00,830
They're never going to know what it
was like to just go and discover.

896
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,280
And it's the most glorious
feeling. It really is. And,

897
00:50:05,281 --> 00:50:09,830
and I just wanted to,
the best we could do,

898
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:13,800
make you be swept away in the
same romantic adventure way that,

899
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,180
that we were with not only the book,
but, but the movies of that time.

900
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:22,850
And I've shown trailers for things
like a alien. And so honestly,

901
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,111
in a weird way,

902
00:50:24,111 --> 00:50:27,740
I almost wonder if it's a blessing in
disguise that the trailer's really given

903
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:28,040
you what

904
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,160
it's like, because maybe you'll be
that much more surprised, you know,

905
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,750
in a good way. Okay. Well thank you
so much for coming and thank you.

906
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:40,751
[inaudible].
