1
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,840
Truth is like,

2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,490
hey guys,
good morning.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,153
How is everybody?

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,670
I'm assuming all the giddiness is
for me, right? Because that's, Huh.

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,370
Very,
very excited to have you two here.

6
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:31,200
So many of us have either
read the book or saw the film.

7
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:34,740
We had a screening last night,
but for those of us in the audience,

8
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:38,010
or maybe who will be watching
the recording later and
who haven't seen the film

9
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:41,160
with book, Do you want guys want to
give us a brief synopsis of the film?

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,790
Sure. Why not? Uh, it's, um, uh,

11
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:49,110
it's about a Asian American professor,
a complaint by Constance Woo.

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,910
Uh, and, uh, she's teaching at
Nyu and she is dating this guy,

13
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,480
uh, Nick Young, uh, who and
who gets invited to, uh,

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,350
his best friend's wedding and
Singapore and he invites her along.

15
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,100
What she doesn't know is that he's
the richest from the richest family in

16
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:07,440
Singapore.
So all his ex's socialites,

17
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:12,000
family members are out to
destroy this American girl.

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,590
So, uh, it's, it's a fun, fun romp,
but has some, uh, I think some,

19
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:19,290
a deeper cultural messages within at all.

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,860
Yeah. And so let's take
anti a little bit. Um,

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,420
so this film is an all Asian
cast and, um, you know,

22
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:30,860
here at Google week we've talked about
is this is the first Hollywood film with

23
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:35,690
an all Asian cast in 25 years. The last
one being the joy luck club in 1993. So,

24
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,780
um, what are your thoughts about the
significance of this film coming out?

25
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,160
You know,
in 2018

26
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,710
I think it's beyond the right time.
It's, it's too late, if anything.

27
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,040
Um,
John's been a bastion for,

28
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,100
for Asians all around the
world and I think now is,

29
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:57,620
is, is a, is the correct time
for this. And um, you know,

30
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:01,490
when we were creating and, and, and
sort of putting together the film,

31
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,070
he literally scoured the earth for
the correct actors for each role.

32
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:12,320
And those actors were, were Asians from
America, from the UK, from Australia,

33
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,220
from Malaysia and Singapore.
Um,

34
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,410
and to hear the stories of how important
this project was to them really

35
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:24,050
resonated throughout the
entire costs and crew.

36
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,840
We knew there was something
special about this, but we,

37
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,680
we didn't feel too much
pressure because we were such,

38
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:32,980
so in the moment that we were,
it was,

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
it was such a joyous kind of experience
being the show of all being the star of

40
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:41,840
our insurer. Um, previous to this,

41
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,320
a lot of the roles in Hollywood where a
sideline does as the lecture characters,

42
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,420
no one with a, with a
particular voice. Um,

43
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,130
but this time everybody had their moment
to shine and damn. Did they deliver?

44
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,010
Yeah, we've got fantastic costs.
Comedians who just, Aquafina

45
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,110
is hilarious. Can Job Jimmy. Oui,

46
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,910
Ronnie Chang because Santas,
um, so it was, you know,

47
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,930
it was,
it was something very special for us.

48
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,990
Yeah. And um, so recently an article
came out in the Hollywood reporter,

49
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,540
um, and um, I think, um, John, you,

50
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,440
you were in the, in the article, but
there it seems like in back in 2016,

51
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:28,680
there was a big decision to be made.
Um, you guys had competing offers,

52
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:31,140
you had an offer from Warner brothers,
a studio,

53
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:34,670
and then you also had an offer
from Netflix. Um, which would have,

54
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,750
would have given you guys a big payday.

55
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,020
Can you walk us through why you decided
to go with Warner Bros and what was the

56
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:42,630
significance of putting this
felled on the big screen?

57
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,830
Yeah. Well, when we started,
when I started the movie,
um, only a few years ago,

58
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:49,350
it was, um, you know,

59
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:52,170
we didn't know if it would ever
get set up at a big studio.

60
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:54,570
It had not been done for so long.
Um,

61
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,370
there wasn't some gigantic star that
could like push it through. Um, and,

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,880
uh, and so we developed it on
our own. I brought in Adel Lim,

63
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,820
who's a Malaysian American
writer who I'd worked with on a,

64
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:12,120
on a pilot. We got into, into shape that
I thought was a really great shape. And,

65
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:16,260
um, then we went out to the studios
and what we found was of course,

66
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,910
Netflix, uh, they have a lot of money and
know how to throw their weight around.

67
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,050
And, uh, and I love Netflix, doesn't,
there's nothing wrong with that. Um,

68
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,730
I just felt like, um, and Kevin and
I, and our producer's credit to them,

69
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,490
deferred to Kevin and I
to make that decision.

70
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,740
We had 15 minutes to make this decision.

71
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,540
A Warner brothers was going to pull
the offer in 15 minutes. So, uh,

72
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,400
they didn't even make, they said we were
going to give you, I know this pastors,

73
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,660
um, uh, they said they were
going to make the offer in the,

74
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:49,530
we had 15 minutes to decide.
Uh, so, uh, we had like 21,

75
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,130
like different lawyers, agents,
everyone there and our, and our,

76
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:55,110
and our producers defer to Kevin and I,

77
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:58,290
and Kevin and I had talked kind of the
night before and had to like a heart to

78
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,330
heart about like, why
are we doing this? What,

79
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,530
what brought us together and what we
realized and we knew might come down to

80
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:05,430
money.
We didn't come.

81
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,570
We didn't know it was gonna come down
to that big of a gap of money. Uh,

82
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:13,770
so it's a little harder. I kept thinking
in my back yard, could use a Redo.

83
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,830
I could use that new thing. Uh, I'm
still thinking about it right now.

84
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,340
Um, but, but it came
down to, you know what,

85
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:24,390
it's important for Hollywood studios to
put a movie like this on the big screen

86
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:27,120
because it sends a message,
it sends a message across the world.

87
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:29,430
It's still cinema, it's
still cinema. And it says,

88
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,260
when you put a piece in the museum,
it anoints it as special annoyance.

89
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:36,900
It as something worth your time and
energy. You have to leave your house, pay,

90
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,170
go fight with parking, pay for
the ticket, pay for your food,

91
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,100
jumped into a dark room,
turn off the license.

92
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:46,470
They told me a great story and
I think that energy, um, is,

93
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,730
is saying you were worth your time.
Um,

94
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,270
and I think subliminally that means so
much and it trickles to all media at that

95
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,440
point. And we knew we were in a
position, we didn't need money.

96
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,400
I'd done enough films.

97
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,410
He had done enough that everyone
had done enough stuff here.

98
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:03,740
No one was desperate. And so
if anyone was do it, we could,

99
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:07,280
we actually thought maybe we donate a
percentage of the Netflix money to great

100
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:09,530
causes for Asian American.
And then it was like, no,

101
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:13,520
it's all trying to trickle down to
this moment right here. So, uh, yeah,

102
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,770
I had sweat things that I
never knew I could sweat.

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,180
But it actually really helped us.
And ultimately like when you double down,

104
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,690
triple down on something like that,
it makes everybody more invested.

105
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,740
And now it was on us two pressure Warner
brothers to publicize it the right way

106
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,550
to market it the right way and credit to
Warner brothers they have come through

107
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,510
in,
in spades.

108
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,660
And I think the important thing is, you
know, not just telling the story of the,

109
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,470
um, of the Asian American story as well,
but you know, growing up in the u s so,

110
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,900
you know, not that many films portraying
Asians, even on television, you know,

111
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:49,110
constants is in fresh off the
boat was just, um, you know,

112
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,610
a sitcom with featuring a full
Asian cast. And so, um, John,

113
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:55,850
you had a great quote in that article and,
um,

114
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,640
I just want to share
with the group, um, you,

115
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,010
you said you wanted to do a film in a
way we haven't ever seen Asians before.

116
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,480
Contemporary, stylish at the top of
art and fashion. Emotional, funny,

117
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,060
sarcastic, unapologetic, confident.

118
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,600
Why do you think there aren't more
films portraying Asians like that today?

119
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,160
I honestly don't know. This is the world
we live in. These are the people I know.

120
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,540
These are the people I've interacted with,

121
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:22,310
both here in Hong Kong and
Singapore and Taiwan. So, uh,

122
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:26,390
I guess I didn't even realize myself
that people didn't see this because I

123
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:28,730
already had seen all of it. So, uh,

124
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,500
I think it was when I was showing
people my pitch and showing my friends,

125
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:34,940
they're like, Whoa, I didn't know this
existed. I didn't know this music existed.

126
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:38,360
I didn't know they could be,
could dress so cool. And I'm like,

127
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:43,160
what are you talking
about? They, uh, so, uh,

128
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:45,710
so I think it was more of like,

129
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,360
it was so obvious and I think we all
a lot of us know this world. And then,

130
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,800
and then also,
but through the,

131
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,310
through talking to Henry and meeting all
these other agents from all around the

132
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:56,360
words,
which I did not know,

133
00:07:56,361 --> 00:08:00,020
I didn't even know Ronnie Chang who's
on the daily show lived in Australia was

134
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,350
what was it straight. I just saw him
as the guy on the daily show. Um,

135
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,670
learning about their experiences was
a huge learning experience for me and

136
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:09,010
opened my brain a lot.

137
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,560
I didn't know a lot about Singapore either
before jumping into the movie. So, um,

138
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,920
yeah,
I think it was just a,

139
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:18,890
a matter of sharing what we already
know and hopefully that cracks the door.

140
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:22,100
Cause I'm sure there was other things
that I don't know that we don't know,

141
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,370
but people have great stories in history
that just haven't been shown in the

142
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,204
light.

143
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,170
Um, so Henry, um,

144
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,100
there's been some controversy around
the casting of your role and, um,

145
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,850
it's led to a dialogue of what it means
to be Asian enough to be cast in this

146
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:38,280
film.
And he said in an interview with instyle,

147
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:40,510
there should be a conversation
about it. And, um,

148
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,440
I think we should be educating people.
What sort,

149
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,830
what sort of education do we
need to do about this topic?

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,380
Yeah. You know, we talked so
distinctly about black culture,

151
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:53,660
Asian culture,
Latino culture,

152
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:56,490
but there's nothing
that is being discussed

153
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,290
about mixed race people and
how they can own the, um,

154
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,980
their ethnicity. Uh, and so we, we,

155
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,510
we sort of fall in this limbo where when
we try to speak up, they're like, no, no,

156
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,040
no, no, you're not Asian enough
or you're not white enough.

157
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,980
I was never wide enough for the UK. I was
never very good enough for a Singapore,

158
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,620
Malaysia.
Uh,

159
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:21,390
but I sure as hell wasn't going to let
that put me down and not have the ability

160
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:26,160
to own and be proud of my heritage.
Um, so I did that very young.

161
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,360
Um, and so I've been finding out my entire
life. So when that, when that came up,

162
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,660
but it wasn't a surprise. It was,
it was just a, another thing.

163
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,520
But at this point we have the platform
to be able to discuss these issues.

164
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,480
Um, you know, talking about
Asian rights, it's, its,

165
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,190
its rights in general.
It's about being, um,

166
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,800
Portuguese mixed with Malaysian.
Like in Malaysia, in Singapore,

167
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,690
there's so much mixed heritage from
the Portuguese, the Spanish, the Dutch,

168
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,150
um,
all integrating into culture.

169
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,100
So why can't we be proud of that and why
can't we own that as a badge of pride?

170
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,310
Um, so for me, um,

171
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,390
I knew through and through that I
was the right person for the job.

172
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,660
There was no question about that.
I was more Asian than,

173
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:16,250
than I can possibly
describe. Um, and, and,

174
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,750
and John John,
John,

175
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,010
John saw that and I was the
right fit for the character.

176
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,760
They had extensive searches
for every single person.

177
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,320
That's why the costume was so good.

178
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:31,710
They wanted to find those voices that
could bring these characters to life.

179
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,510
And I think people get confused.

180
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:37,090
I think they think the movie takes
place in China or something and cause,

181
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,220
cause Singapore,

182
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,090
it has like so many different and
this and he's all mixed together. Um,

183
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,360
and the character nick had to
have been educated in the UK.

184
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,800
So like when you're looking for
is very specific. One I was very,

185
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,420
very sure of Rachel.

186
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:56,370
I wanted her to be Chinese American
because in that, in the movie she, uh,

187
00:10:56,371 --> 00:11:00,780
in the script she talks specifically
about Chinese culture and specifically

188
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:04,650
about what she wants to be. So that was
a very thing. But for nick it was like,

189
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,100
especially talking to Kevin
and his real history, he was,

190
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,810
this is all sort of based around his
life. When you find someone, uh, like,

191
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,480
like Henry Golding,
it's that perfectly.

192
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,140
And we searched all around the world
and of course he ended up being in the

193
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:22,260
exact place of the book, told us he
would be, he was living in Singapore.

194
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,620
We could have saved a lot of
money. And uh, so anyway, yeah,

195
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,470
when someone's perfectly, well,
I think when you watch the movie,

196
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,840
all that bullshit argument goes out
the window. And originally Henry,

197
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:40,841
I think you were hosts on
BBC and you weren't acting.

198
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:45,000
So did it take some convincing for
you to like audition for this role?

199
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,240
It took a lot of convincing.
Um,

200
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:52,290
I had been a presenter for travel shows
and news channels for a good eight,

201
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,630
seven, eight years. Um,

202
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:59,860
so I was kinda stuck in that
mindset of being stomped and,

203
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,260
and kind of could into this category
of this is your lane, the sticks where,

204
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,940
because you're not going to
be great at anything else.

205
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:11,620
That's some of our problems is
that we limit ourselves. Um,

206
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,251
and the,

207
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:17,200
the auditions came around and was huge
sort of noise in Singapore and Malaysia.

208
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:20,200
So much excitement for this movie that,
that John was attached to it.

209
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,190
Warner brothers had bought these riots,
they had such faith faith in this book.

210
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,530
Um, and a couple of couple of
emails came through as well,

211
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,850
do you want to audition for this role?
And I was like, ah, I'm not an actor.

212
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,420
I'm not right for this. There's
somebody out there who deserves this,

213
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,810
who's worked hard, um, who's
going to represent the, uh,

214
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:42,760
this community or represent actors in
general for this really pivotal role.

215
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,040
Um, and it wasn't until, uh,

216
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,330
a mutual friend Steve Jang
and here in San Francisco, uh,

217
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,710
put us together.
It was our mutual friend on Facebook

218
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,510
that was cyber stalking. John went
through my Instagram, he went pretty deep,

219
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,730
slid into my dms,

220
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,170
pretty much trying not to like anything
too fast so that he couldn't see that I

221
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:05,550
how deep I was married.

222
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,110
But uh,
but he,

223
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,950
he got in touch and we had this amazing
hour long conversation and he was in la.

224
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:21,530
I was in Singapore and we spoke about
what it meant to have grown up in,

225
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:25,330
in, in all different sort of
Asian environments. Him In,

226
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,350
in Los Altos here in Los Angeles,

227
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,440
San Francisco,
myself

228
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,250
in Malaysia on the east coast.
And um, he, he, he was like,

229
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:39,070
I've got two questions, you know, can,
can you act and will you read for me?

230
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,040
And at this point I was like,
there's this,

231
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,040
everything is pointing towards this
moment and it's, it's ridiculous.

232
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:49,050
If I do not just switch that,
that mindset and,

233
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,410
and throw myself into this.
It's crazy if I don't. Um,

234
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,820
and then we went on to the
audition process and now
my life has completely done

235
00:13:57,821 --> 00:14:00,940
a one 80, and I think it's going to
be doing some somersaults person.

236
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,430
And what I love about Henry too is like
my big brother, I'm the youngest of five.

237
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:10,410
So my big brother, he's like six, two
good looking, athletic, all the opposite,

238
00:14:10,411 --> 00:14:11,060
right?

239
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,893
And

240
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,980
I showed him the movie and when Henry
comes out in his white suit attire,

241
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,210
so park and it's like this beautiful shot
of through the bushes and he's coming

242
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:24,140
out, my brother starts crying, which I'd
never seen him cry. He's not that type.

243
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,910
He's like, you have no idea. All
the years have I felt so, um,

244
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,290
so different than anyone else
and not seen as as this symbol.

245
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,710
And so Henry represents
this to so many, uh, uh,

246
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,820
at least for Asian men I know,
and myself included,

247
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,940
to see someone that is an
aspiration and inspiration and,

248
00:14:46,281 --> 00:14:50,200
and everything in between.
A total gentleman of someone
from like another Arrow,

249
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,560
a movie star, another era. And
you could be in any ethnicity,

250
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,000
doesn't matter like Henry was.
It has,

251
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:59,120
it has this star quality that
makes you want to be a better man.

252
00:14:59,121 --> 00:14:59,954
And I think that that,
yeah.

253
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,450
Will you marry me is what I'm saying?

254
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,430
Um, yeah, so in the film, piglet has
a wonderful line like Damn Rachel,

255
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,870
it was like the Asian bachelor
and as a fan of the bachelor,

256
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,350
many amazing life. Yeah. Best lines

257
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,790
a lot that didn't make the car too dirty.

258
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,233
Sure.

259
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,590
So, um, with the cats, it's pretty
national. International, you have English,

260
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:35,500
American, Malaysian. Um, so Henry,
you're both Malaysian and English. Um,

261
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,060
what was the experience like working,
um,

262
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,900
working in Great Britain are different
or similar to like Asian Americans in

263
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:43,490
Hollywood or Malaysians in Asia?

264
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,940
Yeah. You know, in, um, in the
UK when you're labeled as Asian,

265
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,840
your South Asian, nothing wrong
with that. It's just that,

266
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,820
that is for some crazy
reason. That's a, it's you're,

267
00:15:55,821 --> 00:16:00,630
you're either of Pakistani or Indian
descent, um, and that's Asian in the UK.

268
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,520
So I was always sort of Chinese or,
or something weird like that.

269
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,500
Um, but they, but over in America,
when you're Asian, you're, you're,

270
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,090
you're of East Asian, the
set. And so for myself,

271
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:17,440
it was,
it's really interesting to,

272
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:23,070
to have had the group of
such international sort of
be people who, like I said,

273
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:27,330
we're, we're swapping these
stories of how they struggled, um,

274
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,690
in the different areas in comedy, in, in,

275
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:34,650
in sort of the acting and
the odds. Michelle Yeoh, uh,

276
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:38,730
for instance had a completely different
story to tell. She grew up in Malaysia,

277
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,570
in Malaysia, but she was in the Hong
Kong industry for the longest time.

278
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,930
And there's no lack of representation
there because it is a Chinese market and

279
00:16:48,451 --> 00:16:52,380
it's, it's the Chinese demographic. So,
uh, John always brings up, like when,

280
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:53,490
when they were first told me,
she was like,

281
00:16:53,491 --> 00:16:56,400
I don't know what you guys are talking
about. The cinema is great for us,

282
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:02,070
but that's because it's, it's
so different, but on, on,
uh, on, on sort of Western,

283
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,480
um, media, uh, representation
is a big problem. Um,

284
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:11,250
so that was, was sort of an
exchange of, of learning for us. Um,

285
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:16,251
so I think we all grew such a broader
perspective and I think that's something

286
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:21,741
that the film really promotes is the fact
that you can be of any Asian descent,

287
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,700
any, any different ethnicity to, to the
one that you've been adopted in, in,

288
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:30,480
in this, in a particular country.
Um, be able to be proud of it,

289
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,670
be able to speak your thoughts,

290
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:36,510
be able to make your own mind
up if of who you want to be,

291
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,740
where you want it to go.
Um, and so hopefully this,

292
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:42,660
this just triggers more conversation.
Uh,

293
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,900
it triggers more avenue for expression.

294
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,400
So I don't know if everyone in the
audience knows, but father, um,

295
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,180
is the famous chef chew and his restaurant
is a landmark in silicon valley.

296
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:59,030
You guys structure here.
Um,

297
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,920
so questions.

298
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,980
What were your parents like?
Were they very traditional?

299
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:06,080
Do they expect you to take
over the family business?

300
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,560
What did they think when you
went to USC to study film?

301
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,740
Um, they're both traditional and
very, not traditional. I mean,

302
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,100
we were in a Chinese restaurant.

303
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:19,460
They came to the states not knowing a
word of English and started this business

304
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:22,990
and 50 years later, it's still
there. Uh, and they always,

305
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,850
they actually never let us
work in the restaurant though.

306
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:29,400
They always said do everything we couldn't
do. So they put us, I took drums, sax,

307
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,700
Violin, piano, guitar. I was
in like tap dance classes.

308
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:35,020
We took etiquette classes.

309
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:38,740
My mom really thought we were going to
be like the Kennedys, so she dressed us.

310
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,740
She dressed us the same.
We took ballroom dance classes,

311
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,940
we went to shows in the city every
weekend, whether it was opera season,

312
00:18:45,941 --> 00:18:50,650
ballet season, uh, our musical
season. So we had a very different,

313
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,730
uh, bringing in that way. But my,

314
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:57,190
my father was very
traditionally Chinese to, uh,

315
00:18:57,191 --> 00:19:01,420
didn't want us to drink soda at dim
sum table and things like that. Um,

316
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:04,780
so I had these two different things.
My mom was like,

317
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,830
go pursue your passions,
just be happy. Um,

318
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:12,040
and my dad and my mom
also at the same time,

319
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:15,880
it would be like about family first
and sacrifice yourself for family.

320
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,660
So I'm like, what the hell? I don't know.
What to do. I'm so stuck. And that's,

321
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,920
that's actually a big theme in this movie
of an Asian American going to Asia for

322
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:28,630
the first time and going through this
culture identity. I remember being scared,

323
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:33,190
going to school that people that I would
smell like Chinese food or that my food,

324
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:35,850
that my parents packed me,
the dumplings I've been playing with,

325
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,890
like smell up the room.
Um,

326
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,290
and one day on Chinese New Year,

327
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:45,550
my parents came and did a presentation
for our like second grade class and they

328
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:49,690
brought the lion dancers and they brought
a red envelopes for all the kids and

329
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:53,920
chocolate gold cup. And I became
like the most popular kid in school.

330
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,100
And it was the first time I was
like, oh, I'm proud to be as,

331
00:19:57,101 --> 00:20:00,400
and then we went to the restaurant
every time after like sports games or

332
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:04,240
whatever, everyone wanted the food. It
was, it was through to their hearts,

333
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:08,470
through the food really. And so,
um, uh, to do a movie about it,

334
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:11,950
which I also never did a movie about
my own culture. I then it was always,

335
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,230
you know, you don't want it if
you're the only Asian in the room,

336
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:16,270
you don't want to just do the Asian thing.

337
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:19,600
Cause I feel like everyone then marks
you as that and just silly thing.

338
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:23,770
But it's a reality that you
feel. Um, and a certain point,

339
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:26,920
I think online when everyone was
reacting to the whitewashed out movement,

340
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:29,860
all that stuff, it made me realize
that, oh no, I earned the spot.

341
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:34,090
I don't have to apologize for my spot.
I can explore these things as an artist,

342
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:38,320
as a filmmaker, the way every other
artists gets to do that. Um, and uh,

343
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,050
and look, people are showing
up for it. It's a, it's a,

344
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:43,960
it's an a very empowering
feeling when you see the result.

345
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:47,440
And this was not guaranteed to have people
come out to see the support the other

346
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:48,010
end.
So

347
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,843
it means a lot.

348
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,990
Um, so we have one more.
When we had our press tour,

349
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:57,780
the restaurant yesterday, it
comes full circle. It was amazing.

350
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,330
Uh, his dad went out to the car
or the brought out family photos.

351
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,320
Oh,
they took them all off the wall,

352
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,910
put them in the trunk so they could
show the reporters. They took my awards,

353
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,600
they put them on the
tables of the restaurants.

354
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,490
These were her words when he was
like seven years old. It's true,

355
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,920
isn't it? 100%. You're cute.

356
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,680
So we organize a Google,
um, family dinner.

357
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,960
The restaurant is your dad fly your
words again? Guaranteed. All right.

358
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,210
I have told them not to for many
times and then, okay. All right.

359
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,370
We might have to organize that later.
Um,

360
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,820
so we're going to do one more question
here and then we're going to open up to

361
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:40,870
the audience. So if you guys
have any questions, please
line up at the mic. So, um,

362
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,310
similar, um, question for you
Henry. Um, kind of about your,

363
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,770
your upbringing in your career
and how your family concerned it.

364
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:49,590
Cause you kind of had a shift in cry.

365
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,340
I think your eyes are red
on your trained hairdresser.

366
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,040
I was a half size for a long time.

367
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,070
And then you became a presenter on
BBC and now you're an actor. So how,

368
00:21:58,071 --> 00:22:01,260
how did your family, you know, I think
about this transition and careers,

369
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:05,320
you know, they're there, they've
always been very open. Um,

370
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,250
and if you consider sort
of back in their day,

371
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,880
mixed race couples weren't
overly accepted. Um,

372
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:17,440
so for them they've always had a
very open mind about most things. Um,

373
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:22,300
so for from what they taught us, it was,
it was mainly, you know, be good to,

374
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:26,330
to others, um, try to sort of, uh,

375
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,340
promote kind of a wellbeing and in,
in terms of,

376
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,610
of helping others and, um, don't
do any, anything stupid and, and,

377
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,450
and be safe. Those were the rules. So
when I, when I told him one day, I,

378
00:22:38,451 --> 00:22:42,250
I want us to be a chef, they're
like, okay, great. Do the chef thing.

379
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:43,570
I did the chef thing for about a week,

380
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:47,440
gave up and then I became a
hairdresser and they're like, amazing,

381
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:50,020
like go do that, follow your passion. Um,

382
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,740
and so it was a half size for four or
five years. As soon as I finished school.

383
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,590
Is it true that all the old ladies would
want to make appointments with you?

384
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:59,860
So you can say, I have to
do so many, so many pounds,

385
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,490
my hands like

386
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:07,160
bleeding. Um, so, but then,
but then I, I was like,

387
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:09,720
I'm going to be,
I'm leaving the UK,

388
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,200
I'm going to move back to
Malaysia and Singapore.

389
00:23:12,201 --> 00:23:16,280
I wanna I want to find myself there and
I want to get into this amazing industry.

390
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,440
Um, and, and they were like,
absolutely just, just, just be goods.

391
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:25,070
It can be good to people and um,
and just stay safe. And that was,

392
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,670
that was them sending me
off. Um, so it's, you know,

393
00:23:28,671 --> 00:23:32,330
it's having this sort of movie,

394
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,830
just really drill home, kind of the
aspect of family, the aspect of,

395
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:42,050
um, identity. It's, it's been warming
cause you, you look onto yourself,

396
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,070
you know, it almost sweet. It
sparks something within all

397
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,820
of us. Uh, we never were
always sort of going forwards.

398
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:54,290
We never consider the traditions
of family or traditions of culture.

399
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,770
Um, sometimes it's nice to look
back and appreciate all of that.

400
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,660
And as of like yesterday,

401
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:02,750
his parents weren't coming to the
premiere and we're like, dude,

402
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:04,250
you got to get them to the premiere.

403
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:07,280
I don't think they understand what
this is or you got to force them.

404
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,240
Your job is to get them there.
And so now they're going to show up.

405
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:15,200
So I think they're in for a whirlwind
of a day. It's be pretty crazy for it.

406
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,650
Um, okay. So why don't we
move to audience questions

407
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,170
first one honey. Sounds good. Hi,
I'm Connie. Uh, ever since Constance,

408
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,980
we're starting to becoming like a thing.

409
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm thinking about going back constants
cause I feel like it's a cooler, Nina,

410
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,410
so you can tell her that. But
I was wondering, um, John,

411
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:37,010
you kind of touched on this earlier,
but I was wondering for both of you, um,

412
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,270
how is it shifting from me,
uh, environment where I'm not,

413
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:45,310
everyone was Asian and everyone's from
diverse backgrounds to moving, um,

414
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,530
to a team where most of the
cast and crew were Asian.

415
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,380
Were there any you'd like
expected or didn't expect?

416
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,770
Um, I mean, I've made movies
overseas before in London
for now. You see me and, um,

417
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,850
it's always a little cultural shock as a
person just going over there and living

418
00:25:00,851 --> 00:25:05,440
there for nine months or so. Uh,
this one was our most global, uh,

419
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,140
crew.
I think they were also during Ramadan.

420
00:25:08,141 --> 00:25:11,050
So we had to their
fasting at the same time.

421
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,840
So I was learning about our crew.
It's like a circus. So you, you,

422
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:18,610
you have these very intimate moments
with people you don't know yet.

423
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,370
And it's very quick.
But we became a family.

424
00:25:21,371 --> 00:25:24,550
We knew that they couldn't eat
till whatever time. So everyone,

425
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,840
we had to pace them and then,

426
00:25:25,841 --> 00:25:28,750
and then other people were bringing
things to the table that you didn't know.

427
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:31,510
Styles and things that since
we're shooting in Singapore,

428
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:35,560
in Malaysia about Singapore
being educated about, you know,

429
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,070
wealth here isn't about size
even though we know they,

430
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,420
you think Vegas and big columns and big
doors, uh, Singapore and the small island.

431
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,000
So like a $20 million place
looks like a small apartment.

432
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:48,250
But actually it's worth a lot.
Things like that.

433
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:53,050
Cultural things that I had
to learn, not just from our
crew, from our, our cast. Um,

434
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,550
it was a, a, you know what I love
about making movies? Everyone asks me,

435
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:01,000
what's that one movie you're going to make
that will make, you know, that's when,

436
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:02,770
you know, you made it. I don't have that.

437
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:06,240
When we had movies or something that
feels like an exercise for me, a breed,

438
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,390
I need to do it. It's like breathing. Um,

439
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,950
and this was another one of those ones
that like sort of transitioned me into,

440
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,960
uh, into a different part of my life
where I got to learn a lot from them. Um,

441
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,540
so hopefully you feel that in
the movie when you walk in,

442
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:21,480
you get to go through the same
journey that I did. In a way

443
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,700
I wanted to start by saying that this
is like a really important movie for

444
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:26,910
people.
Uh,

445
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,200
this one of the first movies search
humanizing Asians in North America.

446
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,060
I say North America because I'm Canadian.

447
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,093
MMM.

448
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:38,940
On that note, like I look to hear more
about casting decisions of the movie.

449
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:39,811
Like Henry,

450
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:43,830
you mentioned that this film allows you
to own your Asian heritage and you know,

451
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:47,850
everyone in this room is really how
people that I don't like mean to take away

452
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:50,250
from that at all.
Like I grew up also in a mixed household,

453
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,240
but I do want to hear like Urin John's
thoughts that there is discussion within

454
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:57,180
our community that the
main male lead is not,

455
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,180
not a complete representation
of what Asian men look like.

456
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:04,650
And casting like a lead with mixed western
and Asian features might perpetuate

457
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:05,880
stereotypes of how Asian,

458
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,900
like really Asian looking men still can't
be romantic leads even in movies that

459
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,773
representative.

460
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,950
Well I think one thing,
I had a lot of discussions about this.

461
00:27:14,951 --> 00:27:18,190
I think what it's great to
have a discussion what a
privilege to actually have a

462
00:27:18,191 --> 00:27:22,150
discussion about casting
Asians as leads a um,

463
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,470
and um,

464
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:28,830
and what I found was it's one we've found
the perfect person to play this role

465
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:34,231
isn't a very specific movie
about Singapore with a
person from Singapore and was

466
00:27:34,511 --> 00:27:37,540
living in this life and has a
British accent and was all that,

467
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,230
all those things that aside,
I don't blame people.

468
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,990
At first I was angry at people
for saying these things.

469
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,890
Is Barack Obama not black enough?
Is Halle Berry not black enough?

470
00:27:47,891 --> 00:27:52,540
Like why do other people get why? Why
do other people get the okay and so, um,

471
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,960
but I actually, I don't,
I blame the system itself.

472
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:00,040
I blame that when you've been hit in
the face 20 times and then someone comes

473
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:04,390
over and tries to give you five and you
duck in and jab them in the abdomen.

474
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,370
It's whose fault is that?

475
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:09,270
It's not the person who's been
victimized over and over again. I,

476
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,480
I know that feeling. I've
been there. Um, it's, it's,

477
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,580
it's whatever this environment that
we've created and it's a shame that one

478
00:28:15,581 --> 00:28:19,150
movie is supposed to define
everybody's experienced.

479
00:28:19,151 --> 00:28:23,890
That's just an unfair idea.
Um, and, uh, so, so I don't,

480
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,120
I have no ill will about,

481
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:28,930
and I think it's a very healthy discussion
that we should have and it's nice to

482
00:28:28,931 --> 00:28:31,360
have. Um, there's other
discussions like, can you,

483
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:36,570
can you hire a Japanese person to
play a Chinese person and vice versa.

484
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:38,740
And Meryl Streep can play any ethnicity.

485
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:43,260
So why do we have to say that
this is whatever. I Dunno. Um,

486
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,530
so I think it's just a discussion that
we have to make the decision on our own

487
00:28:47,531 --> 00:28:52,450
for, and my hope is that this
movie, um, because we have,

488
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,200
it's a book, so it has very defined
characters and we cast accordingly.

489
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,810
We saw so many thousands of people all
around the world. And I had to, uh,

490
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:04,570
there are people that I could not hire
that were great, um, uh, for roles, uh,

491
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,360
but not in this movie because they don't,
we just don't have them.

492
00:29:07,361 --> 00:29:11,290
We only have a certain amount. So I hope
that this actually gives more movies,

493
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:15,430
opportunities to get out there. Cause I
think that's the bigger picture. Um, uh,

494
00:29:15,431 --> 00:29:19,270
what's the Bruce Lee about? A
line about when you're, when you,

495
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:22,960
when there's a finger pointing to the
moon, don't focus on the finger. Um,

496
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:27,560
focus on the, the enormity of
this moon that we're headed
towards. And I think, um,

497
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:31,810
we want other filmmakers and other writers
to be telling great stories so we can

498
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,800
broaden this out.

499
00:29:32,801 --> 00:29:35,440
And there's not just one character
we're looking on and be like, well,

500
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,650
why doesn't that represent all everybody?
Um,

501
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:42,130
so that's what we hope and
that's why when see you guys,

502
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:44,860
when I meet the journalist that we've
met in the past where we would go to

503
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:47,470
youtube and see all the
youtubers and all these creators,

504
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,710
it gives me a lot of hope because they
are writing the stories and coming up

505
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:55,540
with the things and having the expertise,
uh, to, to expand this dialogue.

506
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,860
Um, and, and yes, let's have the dial.
Let's go. This is, this is great. Um,

507
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,690
but at the same time, let's
focus on the bigger, on the,

508
00:30:02,691 --> 00:30:05,500
on the bigger destination that
we're headed towards. Terrific.

509
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:06,540
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

510
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,340
Hi. So I think you started touching on
some of this a little bit when you talked

511
00:30:11,341 --> 00:30:14,870
about can't, you know, represent all
of Asian American, this one film. Um,

512
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,520
I do want to have you expand
a little bit more on that.

513
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:20,860
So it's clear that the film holds
important significance and, um,

514
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:24,600
it's really momentous for the
Asian community. Um, there
are, of course, you know,

515
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:28,440
criticisms around the film not actually
being representative enough of the vast

516
00:30:28,441 --> 00:30:32,730
diversity that exists in Asian America
today. Um, some of sad, you know,

517
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,860
it perpetuates the model
minority in some ways,

518
00:30:34,861 --> 00:30:38,160
which is a damaging stereotype
for the Asian community.
And some of sad, you know,

519
00:30:38,161 --> 00:30:38,671
like you said,

520
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:42,960
this is one step closer to where we
want to be and where we want to go. Um,

521
00:30:42,961 --> 00:30:46,460
so just want to hear a little bit more
about your thoughts on that and how, um,

522
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,810
how you might respond
to some of those ideas.

523
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,091
Well,

524
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:54,091
my first thing is watch the movie and
then maybe make a opinion about it.

525
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,990
I'm mostly,
people have not watched the movie.

526
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,690
Maybe they read the book and
which has very specific things,

527
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,020
but that's not the movie. Um, and
then when we watched the movie,

528
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,640
then let's have a conversation and
listen, this is, this is the point of, of,

529
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,970
of movies is to have a conversation.
When I watched joy luck club,

530
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:11,920
my dad got us all into a van.

531
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,670
We didn't know what movie you were
watching forces to go into this theater at

532
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,760
the earliest showing 10 in the morning.
Right.

533
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:22,170
Save the money,
I'll discount,

534
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,050
give us some afterwards.
And we loved it so much.

535
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,410
We were quoting things from it cause
we're like, oh, that's like our auntie.

536
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,460
I'm not your Auntie.

537
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,440
She says certain things
that we like and um,

538
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,250
and for you,

539
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,350
and we had like a three hour conversation
and that's what the power of movies

540
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:40,760
and um,
you know,

541
00:31:40,761 --> 00:31:45,050
obviously the d that didn't open up
everything for all Asians at that point.

542
00:31:45,051 --> 00:31:49,200
It was a success. And I think for
us it gave us this, this light, um,

543
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,570
and uh,
uh,

544
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:54,350
but hopefully this starts conversation
that can create other work.

545
00:31:54,351 --> 00:31:58,290
Like I sort of said before that that will,
um, that will create the platform that,

546
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,700
that we need. This is again, not just
a movie. We would keep saying this,

547
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:03,440
this is a movement.
Um,

548
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,660
and maybe that's a little self serving
because we have a movie that we're

549
00:32:05,661 --> 00:32:08,510
releasing,
but the reality is that's where we are.

550
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:11,210
That's what Hollywood is going to
be watching that opening weekend.

551
00:32:11,211 --> 00:32:13,520
If people don't show up
that opening weekend,

552
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,850
it's going to be many years before the
guys, we're going to still fight for it.

553
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,130
Don't get me wrong,
but it's just,

554
00:32:19,131 --> 00:32:21,710
this could be a really nice
jolts to get us jumpstarted.

555
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:26,060
There's four projects at
least in Hollywood right now
that are ready on the line

556
00:32:26,061 --> 00:32:29,810
and they have not greenlit and waiting
to see how this one does and in a lot of

557
00:32:29,811 --> 00:32:34,150
more stars other than this guy and
other than this guy to actually, um,

558
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:38,990
get out there to the world. I just want
to add on to that also is that, um,

559
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,610
you know,
a lot of people are concentrating

560
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,340
on the Asian American view.

561
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,390
There's a lot more Asians out there in
the world who don't live in America who

562
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,230
face the same exact challenges,
uh,

563
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:56,120
voices in the Philippines,
Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand. Um,

564
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:01,180
but people seem to be thinking that
the only Western Asians are American.

565
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,940
Um, so it's the voices like
Michelle's, uh, like myself,

566
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:09,830
like Ronnie Chang is from Malaysia is
Roger Whole, um, jinx from Shanghai.

567
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:14,990
Um, those, uh, tales that
should be told in other movies.

568
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:19,550
It's it what, what John said, it is unfair
to have though the weight of the world,

569
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:22,390
the weight of, um, Asians in general on,

570
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:26,120
on this one particular mood
on this one particular movie.

571
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:28,660
It's like having the
world balanced on a pin.

572
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:33,500
There's so much to tell and
so many unique cultural,

573
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:37,970
culturally significant stories
to expand people's horizons,

574
00:33:37,971 --> 00:33:40,820
expand beyond that of just being American,
Asian,

575
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:45,500
being a American Filipino
American tie. Um, you know, it's,

576
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,120
it's, it's stunning. W we're, we're
opening, we're cracking that door open.

577
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:54,560
We're hoping that not only
filmmakers but reporters, reviewers,

578
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:58,970
people in all sorts of industry
step up and be proud of,

579
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:02,750
of writing stories no
matter what Asian ethnicity,

580
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,930
even if it's not Asian American.
Um,

581
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:09,160
and so we need to look at the broader
picture and, and, and, you know,

582
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,970
there's no label for, for just being
Asian as many subcategories and,

583
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,350
um, you know, like how can we just have
the love that you see in the movie,

584
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,960
you know, that that is the
true translation of everything
we're trying to do is,

585
00:34:21,961 --> 00:34:26,030
is that story of coming together,
fighting adversity.

586
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,600
And we find it together as the only
way we're going to win. Thank you.

587
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:35,080
Okay. Um, we have one more last
audience question. Okay. Thank you. Hi,

588
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:38,290
I'm Kat John. I'm a fellow bay or
native. You don't have to tell you.

589
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:43,240
I watched never say number twice.
Nice believer, believer. I see you.

590
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,440
And growing up I was told by my family to,
you know,

591
00:34:47,441 --> 00:34:51,550
pursue a medical position when I got to
college or like pursue a tech position.

592
00:34:51,551 --> 00:34:54,730
But I've always had creative interests.
And for both of you,

593
00:34:54,731 --> 00:34:59,470
what advice do you have for
someone, especially with my
background, our heritage,

594
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:04,330
to really just break out of that sort
of internal pressure to really pursue

595
00:35:04,331 --> 00:35:08,200
those endeavors. And specifically for
Henry, do you feel like in your next role,

596
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,220
do you feel pressured to choose a
character that breaks the common Asian

597
00:35:12,221 --> 00:35:13,054
stereotypes?

598
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:14,790
Okay.

599
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:17,960
Uh, uh, Constance, uh,
who was with us yesterday,

600
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:19,220
she had to go back to shoot her show.

601
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,040
Said something great to when someone
asks a very similar kind, she said,

602
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,423
uh,

603
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,610
you don't have to listen to your parents.

604
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,660
I'll tell my mom that.

605
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,990
I guess that's as simple as that.
I know it's hard and a,

606
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:40,300
you have to figure out how
to do that. But, um, um,

607
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,150
the reality is I think we're in and, uh,
yeah, I mean that's, that's growing up.

608
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,810
That's uh, uh, that's saying,
yeah, we're good enough and,

609
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,560
and you don't have to have the baggage
that your parents may have from a,

610
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:57,180
from another era and another time. Um,
men, women, young people, whatever class,

611
00:35:57,181 --> 00:36:01,320
whenever it doesn't matter, um, we
can, we can determine our own destiny.

612
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:04,290
And now if you're a creator, if
you're a writer, if you're a director,

613
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:07,810
my advice is always, if you're a director,
you've got to direct. If you're ready,

614
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,390
you've got to right.
There's no excuse you.

615
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,360
Nobody has to give you permission to that.
You can borrow a,

616
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,390
a phone camera from somebody
you can edit on your phone.

617
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:19,200
You can get it on online and get it to
people. Um, if you are a storyteller,

618
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:22,920
you tell stories and that's just
innately in you and you do it.

619
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,780
It's like being an entrepreneur.
You can't train someone.

620
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:26,460
They're either starting a
business or they're not.

621
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,890
You can't aspire to be an entrepreneur,

622
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,330
uh, for myself. Uh, you're talking about
my, my next roles and things like that.

623
00:36:34,331 --> 00:36:39,110
And for me it was, it's really, you
know, being, uh, an Asian lead in,

624
00:36:39,111 --> 00:36:42,820
in, in a particularly Asian
movie. I'm super proud of that.

625
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:47,821
But my real goal was the normalization
of being a different face in,

626
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:53,760
in this big sort of industry of Hollywood.
Um,

627
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,960
and normalizing the fact
that it's an Asian lead, uh,

628
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,240
that it's not a particular role
that's written for an Asian character.

629
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,730
My next film is called a symbol favor.

630
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:08,860
I played Blake Lively's husbands
Adda Kendrick's love interest.

631
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,410
Um,
my name is Sean Townsend.

632
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:19,000
There's no, there's no, it's not
necessary to explain my ethnicity.

633
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,280
That's where we need to get to.
Uh,

634
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:26,281
we need to get normalize this fact that
we have all these beautiful Asian faces

635
00:37:26,351 --> 00:37:31,351
on the screen and not have to explain
where they've come from or what they're

636
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:35,920
doing there. Um, and so that's the
level that we want to. So for me,

637
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:40,300
I just want to be a leading man in these
amazing movies and spread inspiration

638
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:44,320
to people who think that they're not
good enough, that they, that they,

639
00:37:44,321 --> 00:37:46,880
because they were born somewhere else,
that they don't belong in,

640
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:51,670
in the country that they are
in now. Um, so I think, um,

641
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,440
you know,
I'm going to be tracking away at that,

642
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:56,170
but that doesn't mean that I'm not
going to be taking Asian roles.

643
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,310
My third movie,

644
00:37:57,311 --> 00:38:01,210
I was playing an Asian in that and that
was playing a gay Asian or that I'm

645
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:04,840
super proud of that. And it's, it's,
it's, it doesn't matter the sexual,

646
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:06,620
it doesn't matter the race.
Um,

647
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,990
I just want to be a spokesperson
or a role model for,

648
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:13,610
for people who felt like
they didn't have that choice.

649
00:38:13,611 --> 00:38:17,980
So they can't aspire to be
something great. Preach. Thank you.

650
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,860
Today if you guys,

651
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,400
um, haven't seen the film, I highly
encourage it. I saw last night, loved it.

652
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,770
So be sure to go opening weekend
and support the film. I'm sure you,

653
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:36,190
you guys would appreciate that.
Tell your friends or your family.

654
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:39,640
It's a great movie. Um, and with that,
I know you guys have a packed schedule,

655
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,890
need to be on your way. So thank
you so much for visiting your call.

656
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:43,580
Sure.
