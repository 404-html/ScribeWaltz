00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,010
Hello everyone. I'm Kevin
Belk. Welcome the toxic Google.

00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,570
And today we have the creative
team behind Disney's new movie,

3
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:13,410

4
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,470
So we'd like to welcome the
director tomorrow land, Mr Brad Bird

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,530

6
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,290
Welcome guys. Thanks for being here today.
Thanks. Thanks. Thank you for having us.

7
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,510
So we know bread, uh, from such films,

8
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:47,110
the writer and director of syndromes such
as a item iron giant, the Incredibles,

9
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:50,920
Ratatouille, mission impossible
goes protocol and Damon Lindelof,

10
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,870
I was co creator and show runner of ABC's
hit show lost and a is helpful, right?

11
00:00:55,871 --> 00:00:59,950
Such film to stark ended into darkness
and the and whole bunch of stuff.

12
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:03,820
So welcome guys. Uh, so two of you
guys wrote the script with Jeff Jansen,

13
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:04,930
but Damien,

14
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,960
you were on the project of a while before
Brad was pulled as a director, right?

15
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:10,390
Yes. Okay. So what was
the genesis of that?

16
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:13,870
The idea of it and where this
all kind of come from? Um,

17
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,460
I, uh, I was having
lunch with Sean Bailey,

18
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:21,630
who's the president of production at
Disney, and we were talking about, um,

19
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,070
uh, what, what is a Disney movie?
They hadn't bought Lucasfilm yet,

20
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:29,940
but they had marvel and I think that they
understood that they can remake their

21
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:32,930
animated movies. They were doing
Cinderella, they were doing maleficent.

22
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,060
But what other space was there? And
I said, I'll be honest with you,

23
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:39,900
when I first heard years ago that you
guys were doing pirates of the Caribbean

24
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:44,160
as a, uh, as a movie, um, I kind
of turned my nose up at it, but,

25
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,680
but it actually is, it's
sort of genius and, and that,

26
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,340
that's a way to make an original
movie because it's a ride,

27
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:53,790
but there is no story there. You get
to actually kind of craft the story.

28
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,130
So there's the sandbox,
there's a sandbox. Am I,

29
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,060
my son is eight years old when he
goes on pirates of the Caribbean.

30
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,680
He thinks that the ride is based on the
movie because that's what came first in

31
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:05,401
his perception.

32
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:08,610
So he asked me if there was anything
in the park that sparked my interest.

33
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:12,810
And I said, if there was a movie called
tomorrow land, I would go see it. Um,

34
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,900
and that was kind of the beginning
of a, of the ride. And I,

35
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:20,901
and I feel like Brad and I had worked
previously and we talked a lot about close

36
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:23,330
encounters and how they're,

37
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,510
there weren't any movies like
close encounters anymore.

38
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,040
They were just sure wonder awe,
discovering movies.

39
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:33,240
It's like the plot of that movie is
so simple. Guys see something amazing.

40
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,420
It feels like it means something and
then he just goes in pursuit of it.

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,520
It's like,
is that the backbone of a story?

42
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:41,790
And I think that Jeff and I started
building the iceberg that was going to be

43
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,210
under the water. Um, and once
we had constructed, you know,

44
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:48,650
how tomorrow land came to be,
I was able to sort of, uh,

45
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,930
coerce a Brad, uh, into,
uh, uh, into, into,

46
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,110
into tiny tip of the iceberg.
Yeah.

47
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,760
Working on the tiny tip of the iceberg
and the code name for it was 1952 up

48
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:03,460
until 2013 when you guys announced
they would be called tomorrow land.

49
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
And so the significance in 1952,
uh,

50
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,700
ut is a little bit in January when you
reveal the mystery box that you guys,

51
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:10,840
there's a whole story behind that.

52
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,920
And then you went more in
depth with the d 23 expo,

53
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,720
kind of showing the contents,
talking through it.

54
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:19,810
So can you talk about that kind of bread,
the reveal of that and the teasing of,

55
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,870
well, to me the interesting thing
was that when it was called 1952,

56
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,640
there were all these
very elaborate theories,

57
00:03:25,641 --> 00:03:30,410
which Damon is very used to on
lost, uh, about what it could mean.

58
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,030
But the super interesting thing was that
when we finally revealed that it was

59
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:37,630
tomorrow and everybody went,
oh,

60
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,560
like they knew what that was like, now I
know what it is. And you would ask them,

61
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:45,950
okay, what do you think it is?
And they were all over the map,

62
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,310
but they had a feeling that,
that,

63
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,110
you know what the word tomorrow
and means and you know,

64
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,120
that's why we were intrigued by it is
that word tomorrow and means something to

65
00:03:59,121 --> 00:04:02,690
people. And we were trying to kind
of capture that feeling in the movie.

66
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,130
Can you talk about the idea of the box
and the contents that were in it and the

67
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:08,680
whole kind of reveal of that?
Yeah, I think one of the problems,

68
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:12,370
particularly if you're not making a
superhero movie or a sequel or something

69
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:13,204
that is,
you know,

70
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,740
based on a book like the hunger
games or a reboot is people you know,

71
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,720
the same well to where reboot SQL to
a reboot or a reboot of a sequel. MMM.

72
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,050
That sounds good. Uh, is,
is, um, followed by that,

73
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,620
that enthusiasm of, Oh, you
guys are making tomorrow land.

74
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:32,200
I think that there's the sense of
like, well, what is it? You know,

75
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:34,660
I need to know what it is.
Like if you want me to come to it.

76
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,130
And we hadn't started shooting the
movie yet. And I think that we,

77
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,430
we needed something to show people we
needed to give people a sense of what the

78
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:43,570
movie was going to be.

79
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,190
And since all the things that we were
talking about was a while a Walt Disney

80
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,820
early imagineering, the world's fairs,
particularly the 1964 world's fair. We,

81
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,260
we, in the same way that when you
go to Disneyland or Disney world,

82
00:04:56,261 --> 00:05:00,260
you have to wait in line for, you know,
an hour or 90 minutes while you're online.

83
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,670
There's a story being told to you before
you go on the ride for two and a half

84
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:07,060
minutes. And the box was really sort
of our line experience. So it was like,

85
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,310
let's put, you know, let's,

86
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,960
let's take the things out of this box
that are going to begin to get people a

87
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:14,110
sense of the movie and the story
that we're telling. Interesting.

88
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,420
So what was the process of
weaving and kind of, you know,

89
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:19,930
history and real life elements with a
Scifi film because of the movie is based

90
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:23,170
on obviously, you know, it doesn't
the park's property, but you,

91
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,220
that's not really it. I mean, you know,
a, it's not even a ride. It's a land.

92
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,570
So it's a lot more wispy. Uh,
what it's about for us. I mean,

93
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:35,270
it's not about the,
the theme park at all.

94
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:39,590
It's about what does that world mean to
you? What does that word mean to you?

95
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,450
You know, tomorrow is a, is an a
femoral word. It's, it's vague,

96
00:05:44,451 --> 00:05:48,980
but it's coming and it's, there's hope,
you know, and land is Tara from it.

97
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:53,240
Solid. And, and the, the crashing
together of those two words is,

98
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:55,480
is there's something happens.
And,

99
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,380
and I think we were in pursuit of
how do we wrap a story around that?

100
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:03,660
Something that could happen.
Interesting. So, and you, you,

101
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:08,260
so you have a low experience brand cause
you went from, um, you know, doing, uh,

102
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,560
original work with the Incredibles
and Ratatouille and you know, you've,

103
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,230
you've talked a little bit about maybe
visiting the world again with Incredibles

104
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:17,000
two and that's a sequel,
but what,

105
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,890
what was it like kind of going
with the original property,

106
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:20,180
you just kind of take
the name tomorrow land,

107
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:23,750
but you're doing a completely
original world in live action.

108
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,470
How was that transition? Well, that
was just really exciting to me. I mean,

109
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,570
because I, I make a point
of kind of, you know,

110
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,860
regularly saying that I think the movie
industry dedicates too much bandwidth,

111
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:41,000
a big budget bandwidth to
ideas that are too, you know,

112
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:45,500
that are familiar. Uh, I think
people simplify that into, oh,

113
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:49,110
he doesn't like sequels. It's obvious
that I liked sequels. I just did one, I'm,

114
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,930
I'm about to do another one. Some of my
favorite movies are sequels, but I, uh,

115
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,470
a lot of my favorite experiences in,

116
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,200
in movie theaters are films where I
don't know what's going to happen.

117
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,150
And then star wars at one point was a
really weird radical idea that very few

118
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:05,990
people got.

119
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,310
And George Lucas had to fight every
step of the way to get it made.

120
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,860
E T I don't think people were ready for,
I mean they clearly were ready for,

121
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,960
but they didn't know what it
was when it first came out.

122
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,760
And those are wonderful experiences
to have at a movie, uh, uh, theater.

123
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:27,140
And, and when Damon mentioned this
idea to me, I was leaning forward,

124
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:31,040
I wanted to know, uh, about this
place and what could happen there.

125
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,890
And so I was,
I was really happy to join.

126
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,370
So was there any pressure from the
studio just kind of to incorporate more

127
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:40,050
tomorrow? Land space, mountain, stuff
like that? It was just kinda like, no, no,

128
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,030
it was at, it was actually the
opposite. I think early on we said, hey,

129
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,810
just so you know that there's probably
not going to be a space mountain in this,

130
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,240
in this movie because it
does feel like it's the,

131
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,950
it's the thing you need to check off.
And again,

132
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:55,300
to go back to pirates of
the Caribbean. Um, the,

133
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,120
the idea that like there's a little Easter
egg in the movie where there's a dog

134
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:02,480
holding the keys in its mouth and you
kind of go like, oh, that's from the ride.

135
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,820
But it, you know, it's, it's
more of a wink and a nod.

136
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,390
Space Mountain makes a glimpse.
Yes. Right. You see the structure,

137
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:12,830
but there's no like set piece.
Right. But I think that ultimately,

138
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,890
especially when you're talking about a
new piece of Ip or an original movie,

139
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:18,620
we actually,
we don't need to sell tickets to the park.

140
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,600
The park needs to sell tickets
to tomorrow land. Um, and,

141
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,850
and so they were completely in totally
on board with that idea. That's great.

142
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,390
And so was there,
cause I think the visual is still though,

143
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:31,580
but you kind of took a lot of the visuals
from tomorrow land, which was awesome.

144
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:35,780
I thought like a little bit. It's more
of a feeling. Yeah. But, but again,

145
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:39,890
we were not, you know, they, they
were incredibly supportive of us.

146
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,810
That's being free range chickens.
No.

147
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:46,190
And I tomorrow land is one of my
freelance ranger tickets. Yeah.

148
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,060
Uh, but tomorrow, tomorrow land is
one of my favorite parts of the park.

149
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,950
But I do think that a, even from when I
first went there when I was 11 years old,

150
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,660
always struggled with
identity in terms of,

151
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,540
is it the Jules Verne tomorrow
land that's sort of based in,

152
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,450
in the late 19th century?
You know, is it? Well,

153
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,310
I think the thing that's
interesting about it, um, is, uh,

154
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,120
Disney essentially designed that one
section of the park to be perpetually

155
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:19,020
frustrating to businessmen because
you can never be done with tomorrow.

156
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:20,550
Tomorrow is always in motion.

157
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,200
And so it's the one part of the park
that's going to go out of date relatively

158
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:29,550
quickly if you don't keep reinventing it.
And I think during the Eisenhower era,

159
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:33,720
they, they dealt with it by like,
I can't we just be done. You know,

160
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,430
they dealt with it by putting it in
the past and hopefully we're done.

161
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,900
And I think that kind of, now there's an
impatience to do something new with it.

162
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:43,201
I mean,

163
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:48,060
you go into a imagineering and they're
chomping at the bit to reinvent it

164
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:51,630
because I think they're
more, uh, uh, you know,

165
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:56,370
excited about the wall type idea where,
where it's continually coming. It's not,

166
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:01,050
uh, a galaxy far, far away.
It's, you know, it's, it's uh,

167
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,850
something that, that actually may
happen and it's coming and, and uh,

168
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,970
you know, I think that they're
invigorated by that idea. And, and listen,

169
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:13,140
I would love a star wars land as well,
but I don't think it's the same thing.

170
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:16,340
I think there's star wars land and
there's tomorrow land and though they're

171
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,880
separate things and they do separate
things. And I would be excited about both.

172
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,930
And I think what's crazy is if you think
about the future as projected from the

173
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,630
60s with flying cars and jet packs
and you know, gleaming metropolis is,

174
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,540
did we decide on what the plural was,

175
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:34,680
is a metropolis Shawmut metropolises the,
the,

176
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,630
that still hasn't manifested itself.

177
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,350
So the Jetsons still feels like a sh
it's a show about the future in the year

178
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:41,101
2015,

179
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:45,630
we were just kind of nuts and we still
don't have our jet packs were guys do.

180
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,810
Yeah, you guys maybe I saw
some parked outside. Yeah.

181
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,010
And so in you give them the animation
world. So you went to cal arts,

182
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:55,140
your college Grad,
and you start,

183
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,560
you had your time with the Simpsons and
it does mean, and so kind of what was,

184
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,530
what did you learn kind of from animation
that you're able to take into live

185
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:04,460
action? What was difficult?
What was easy? Well, what,

186
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:07,380
what's funny is when I
did animation exclusively,

187
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:12,381
everybody kept talking about how it felt
like live action and then you go into

188
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,260
live action and they got, well, it feels
kind of like animation and it's like,

189
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,670
it's all just film to me.
And, and uh, you know,

190
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:25,671
I am excited about both mediums and the
cynical animation friends I had is that

191
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:30,320
when I did mission impossible,
they're like, ah, you're
never coming back. You're,

192
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,360
you're so happy to be sick
seated at the grownups table.

193
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:38,160
You're never coming back. And unlike,
no, I love the animation. So, uh,

194
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,760
I would,

195
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,590
my ideal career would just be bouncing
back between the back and forth between

196
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:46,410
the two because I think they're
both great ways to tell stories.

197
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,510
And the kids table is more fun anyway.
You get grow food and, exactly.

198
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,620
Chicken fingers. Well like I don't
want to talk about know there's a,

199
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:54,100
there's a clip

200
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,630
out there that's a,
there's a,

201
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,660
it's a beautiful hand drawn animated short
film that was released the origins of

202
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:01,330
Plus Ultra and uh,
you,

203
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,830
it was animated by amazing ours to Newton
and Energy Mendez and Ryan Woodward

204
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:10,390
blue at Montereau, Dan Jupe,
Paul, uh, Abdellah. So was that,

205
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,160
that was so interesting
and it was so cool.

206
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:14,740
Was there ever any interest
in point in that in the movie

207
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,030
designed initially to be a sort of,
um,

208
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:24,410
first step in designing a dark ride
that the lead character as a child,

209
00:12:26,341 --> 00:12:30,540
the George Clooney character as a child
goes through and it was going to be done

210
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,350
as if it were a ride made
in that period of time.

211
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:38,130
And we use that as like the starting
point. Okay, here, here are the ideas.

212
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:41,100
Here's the way it looks.
Now we've got to put it in a ride.

213
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:43,170
Contacts and Ilm started doing it,

214
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,530
but we couldn't get away from the fact
that it was our lead character watching

215
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,090
something, uh, you know,

216
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:56,091
being told to him and it's kind of stopped
the story debt and it's great in and

217
00:12:56,851 --> 00:13:01,500
of itself. I mean, as, as I think it's
interesting, but in context of the movie,

218
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:02,460
it stopped the movie.

219
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:06,720
So we decided to just kind of separate
it and put it out there separately.

220
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:09,720
But it is kinda good to know. I
mean, it's good backstory stuff.

221
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,030
You guys haven't seen it. I'll look
it up. It's really, really great.

222
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,520
And so [inaudible] Damon, you
know, there's a lot, you know,

223
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,740
this movie is huge and it's complex.
And, and what I love about the movies,

224
00:13:19,741 --> 00:13:23,250
you really don't spend a lot of time. It's
fun. It's so, oh my gosh, that's so much.

225
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,690
Everyone's like to ride the hi Fi.
Uh,

226
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,680
it's a plate full of vegetables.
I don't know if I like that. Yeah.

227
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,700
But there's a, there's a great balance
because you're not spending, you know,

228
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:39,120
30 to 60 minutes of exposition. You
know, you just get right into it.

229
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:41,970
Like you get right into the world's
fairs where kind of the story begins and

230
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:43,110
your, um, you know,

231
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,230
then get right into tomorrow land and
it's great because it's a slow burn,

232
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:48,240
the slow reveal over
time and it's engaging.

233
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:51,330
So what's the balance of not giving
the audience on spoonfeeding them and

234
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,170
talking down to them,

235
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,430
but like really kind of keeping it
engaging and keeping that balance,

236
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,220
getting it in the popcorn?
Exactly.

237
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,770
Yeah. I think that we really struggled
with that and the storytelling, you know,

238
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:05,980
the, the writing of it, it felt
like we had found the right balance.

239
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:10,040
But then after we made the movie and got
into the editing room, I think that the,

240
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,110
you know, is Brad, Brad was, was sort
of hinting at, there's that idea of, um,

241
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,070
can I follow this story without having
it explained to me? And when you,

242
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,390
when you go off the rails there,

243
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,390
you need to stop and have a little bit
of explanation or else the audience gets

244
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:23,224
confused.

245
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,200
But then there's a line that you cross
and it's razor thin where you're,

246
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,960
you've suddenly explained too
much and you're in, you know,

247
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:33,070
you're in the second matrix movie and
the architect is basically like neo,

248
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,510
I'm going to break it down for you.

249
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,180
I'm going to basically tell you everything
that happened in the first matrix

250
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:39,540
movie, everything that's
happening in this make movie.

251
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,270
And then I'll tell you everything that's
going to happen in the third matrix

252
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:46,350
movie. And then you heard the
temp Rhoda. So I mean, and I,

253
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,380
and I do feel,

254
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,390
obviously we wanted to make a movie
that was about something had, um, that,

255
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,800
that had a strong theme to
it and made people think,

256
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:58,640
but ultimately it's a Disney movie.
It's coming out in the summer. You know,

257
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:02,240
we want people to, this is, he's
enjoying his popcorn. He's drinking,

258
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,450
he's drinking a soda, more popcorn. He
is, something's gone down the wrong pipe.

259
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:06,950
He's clapping,
he's scared.

260
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,780
I don't feel like I'm on
Pictionary is terrifying. Um,

261
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:16,460
but, uh, uh, but yeah, we wanted to
make the movie really entertaining.

262
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:20,000
And I do think that it's hard
to say we want to, you know,

263
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,510
we want this movie to appeal to eight
year olds and we want it also want it to,

264
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:27,860
to appeal to 68 year olds. Um, it feels
like there's a lot of room in between,

265
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:31,250
but I, but I do feel ultimately
that that's the movie that we made.

266
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,660
Well,
I think that the,

267
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,570
the films that both of us are inspired
by or ones that are a blast to watch,

268
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,040
but later on you're thinking about them,
you know, and there's nothing wrong with,

269
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:46,720
with, um, you know, uh,
remembering a song, you know, um,

270
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,060
you know, and, and loving
it when you're hearing it,

271
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:50,620
but also thinking about it later.

272
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:56,010
And so we had attempted to
make that and we would love to,

273
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,750
you know, think that we
had, but you never know.

274
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,340
You just try your best and
see what happens tomorrow.

275
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,440
And it really drives home the theme
of innovation and exploration.

276
00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:08,350
And it seems to be really inspiring the
children of today to just imagine all

277
00:16:08,351 --> 00:16:11,380
the ways that they can help
create a better tomorrow. I
mean, the theme is really,

278
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:12,580
really driven home. So, you know,

279
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:14,890
in today's world where there's so much
technology for children, you know,

280
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:18,370
at the click of a button, um, you
know, was that ever intentional,

281
00:16:18,371 --> 00:16:22,480
kind of the common theme throughout it
and kind of pushing that all the way.

282
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:22,870
Yeah.

283
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,490
I mean, I think simply put there, you
know, there's a very Disney Disney,

284
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:29,610
a idea at the, at the core of this,
which is when you wish upon a star,

285
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:31,770
your dreams come true.
But we,

286
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,920
but what are you willing to
do once you've made the wish?

287
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,070
Yeah. You don't lie down and
let the dream, you know, happen.

288
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,810
There's a line in the film where the
George Clooney character is a kid and, uh,

289
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,310
he has built a jet pack and,
uh,

290
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,420
the Athena character,
who is our secret weapon,

291
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:54,510
and we're not going to talk about
her too much, but check it out. Uh,

292
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,620
she says to him, um, did you build this
yourself? And he says yes, and she says,

293
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:01,600
why?
And he says,

294
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:05,440
I guess I got tired of waiting around
for someone else to build it for me.

295
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,570
And that's really, that's the key
step two of the dreaming ideas.

296
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:15,460
It's wonderful to have a dream, but you,
you then have to give the dream action.

297
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,700
You can't lay down and,
and hope that it's going to happen.

298
00:17:18,701 --> 00:17:23,680
As you guys all know this, that's
totally what you do every day. So,

299
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,400
and an on a slightly more metal level,

300
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:27,140
I think that we were just
sitting around saying,

301
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,650
I wish there were more original movies
and I wish there was a movie when I went

302
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:33,560
to go see it. I didn't know exactly what
was going to happen. Right. You know,

303
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,490
when some interstellar, which came
out, you know, while we were in post,

304
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:42,080
I just was so excited to see that movie
because I didn't know what it was going

305
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:46,300
to be. Um, and, uh, we could
either sit around sort of, um,

306
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,040
decrying the, the fall of
Western civilization, or
we could try to, you know,

307
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,840
guys like Brad have earned, um,
uh, well, I mean, in the, in the,

308
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,870
in the movie world,
you have to have a great success and that,

309
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,280
and then you can go and make an original
movie. But the offers that you get,

310
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,410
it is,
it is all sequels and comic books.

311
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,780
And those are the movies that
are sort of proven. There's a,

312
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,920
there's much less risk now. They
are. Yeah. Yeah. Now they are right.

313
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,880
You have to keep reminding them that
these were actually original movies that

314
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:19,770
was scary to people like you at one
point, you know, and they go, Whoa,

315
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:24,670
no star wars. There's always been,
I had, it's like not admiral ackbar.

316
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:25,504
So yeah,

317
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,350
it's good. I love that. As far
as star wars apologist, yeah.

318
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,060
He
told magnates shaped bones.

319
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,470
That's fully got by ratio though.
There's no segue into this,

320
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:52,420
but so young, uh, frank, uh, but,
uh, but you touched upon the young,

321
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,630
uh, Frank Walker, a character
played by Thomas Robinson.

322
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,670
We're going to do the rest of this
interview as Burlap Park that will get the

323
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:02,200
views on youtube,
are going to shoot,

324
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,630
do hear bird did it in a sit down at
Google as ackbar for two hours and he

325
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:09,880
wouldn't break character.

326
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:14,450
We couldn't get him off in 15
minutes on Mon Calamari. Yeah.

327
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,000
Believable. So Frank Walker, uh,

328
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,050
sorry. No, you're good. You're good.
The entire beginning of the movie movie,

329
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:25,320
you know,

330
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,960
it's so much fun to watch cause it Kinda
brought me back to my childhood of just

331
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,130
being fun and going out and exploring
and just goofing off and, and it's,

332
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,521
you know,

333
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:35,460
with his character building that jetpack
and coming up with that and just being

334
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:38,330
so inspired and went back to the movies,
kind of like Goonies and,

335
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,240
and stand by me.

336
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,020
So what were your inspirations and how
would you capture that childhood spirit

337
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:44,430
is because you kind of our children
at heart or kind of what was,

338
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,630
what was kind of putting that, getting
that right? I think w you know, uh,

339
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,840
it was very hard. I mean, we
have plenty of wounds, you know,

340
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,280
along the way to get in the position
where we're in. But we, you know,

341
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,450
knock on wood, we thank our lucky
stars that were in a position to,

342
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,660
to tell stories and, and you know, uh,

343
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,720
I think that we both grew up with
storytelling being a great place to,

344
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:13,380
to digest the world. And, and, uh,

345
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,710
that part of storytelling has
always been there, you know,

346
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:19,410
when it was campfire stuff.
Um,

347
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,710
so just a chance to do it is just amazing.

348
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,610
And I also think that it was really
important to us to start the movie in the

349
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,770
60s because we were,
when,

350
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,810
whenever we went out into the
world and talked about the movie,

351
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:33,420
there was this sense that in the,
in the 1960s,

352
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:36,830
sort of in the heat of the space
race, despite the fact that, you know,

353
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,140
the world was in turmoil, the Cold War
was happening. We were on the brink of a,

354
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:44,820
of annihilation assassination. It was
just a very turbulent time. But still,

355
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,260
everyone's vision for the
future was, was utopian. And,

356
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:52,110
and now it feels like there's been
a shift into, into dystopia where,

357
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,790
why did that happen? You
know, I mean, we were,

358
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:59,310
had a lot of conversations about
what made that go away because it's,

359
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:00,144
it's kind of like,

360
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,630
you know how they deal with a lobster
where they put it in cold water and

361
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:08,110
gradually turn up the volume
and it doesn't know that
it's being cooked to death.

362
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:09,610
It's like,
when did this happen?

363
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,450
When did it become common wisdom
that the future was going to suck?

364
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:18,430
And the only point of view that
seems realistic is, is a dark one.

365
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:23,290
What change the worlds, you know, bad.
It has a lot of bad stuff going on,

366
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,080
but it's no worse than it was back then.

367
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,360
And so we were kind of talking about how
can we explore that in a sort of fair

368
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:35,260
fable like way. And you have popcorn
crunch in good times, right? Yeah. Yes.

369
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:40,150
And I mean, just touching upon this to
your casting choices are incredible.

370
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:44,470
I mean with,
with Rafi Cassidy and Britt Robertson,

371
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,000
it was Athena and Casey Newton.

372
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,550
And I wanna talk a little bit about the
character names. Not go too deep into it,

373
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:50,130
but, um, especially with Newton, that's,

374
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:53,950
it seems like an obvious tribute
to Sir Isaac Newton. Yeah, sure.

375
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:57,450
Just a or a caddy. Yeah, exactly. And,

376
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,490
or the fig big fan.

377
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,190
And we'll skip over Athena
cause I know that's a,

378
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:05,170
but obviously the Greek goddess.
Well,

379
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,680
I think the thing that's fun about
the cast is, is that we have, um,

380
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,430
people that the public knows very well,
like,

381
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,610
like George Clooney and
Hugh Laurie and Tim Mcgraw.

382
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:20,611
And at the same time we have these brand
new faces like Britt Robertson and Rafi

383
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,540
Cassidy. So it's really a popery
and Keegan Michael Key and,

384
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:30,130
uh, Kathryn Hall, Kathryn Hahn.
And it just, it's, it's a really,

385
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,580
it's a salad bar of cool performances.
Yeah. Well, I mean, George,

386
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,820
can we say in an ice cream bar,
ice cream bar,

387
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,350
the salad bar here, it was, was
very popular. I have to say,

388
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,570
much more traffic than the
dessert bar. Um, so, you know,

389
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:47,950
George Clooney's character,

390
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:52,000
the interesting thing about Walker
is when you first introduced him,

391
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,270
he's pretty grumpy and he's a
little curmudgeony and stuff.

392
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,150
And what was interesting was
that throughout the movie
you just started to like

393
00:22:58,151 --> 00:23:00,160
a more and more and more.
So kind of what was that balance?

394
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:03,460
Was it a risk or was there any kind of
pushback of kind of introducing him? Like,

395
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,920
you're not going to like, I'm kind
of at first, so he gets grumpy,

396
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:08,260
but he gets better and better and better
and all of a sudden you find out why he

397
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:11,170
is that way. Yeah, I think
that they're, you know, it's a,

398
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:15,090
it's a story that we're
familiar with and um, and,

399
00:23:15,091 --> 00:23:18,220
and well told it always works,
which is that, you know,

400
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:20,910
someone's a bit of a
curmudgeon. Um, and if this,

401
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,850
if the story in this season and this
case is about how do they get to be that

402
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:27,580
way? And again, as you say this, the
story starts with this young boy,

403
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:31,300
he grows up to be that way and
you kind of wonder what happened.

404
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:34,810
And then he becomes sort of a functioning
metaphor for this idea that Brad was

405
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:38,590
just talking about between, you
know, how we feel about the future.

406
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:42,280
So this young kid is super idealistic.
I do think that the older we get,

407
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:43,840
the more pragmatic we become,

408
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:47,940
the harder it is for us to
say everything's going to
work out fine because we,

409
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,570
we, we start to understand
life for what it is.

410
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,170
And so the movie is really about kind of
returning George back to, you know, that,

411
00:23:55,171 --> 00:23:58,760
that sort of childhood sense of wonder
that we demonstrated at the beginning of

412
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:03,610
the movie. Great. And he's an optimistic
guy. I mean, um, I, I think he, uh,

413
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,720
he plays a great grump, but, um,

414
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,080
he's definitely a guy who does
not accept the status quo. No,

415
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,880
it's that can check Czechoslovakia. It's
called great. Grump the movie. Yeah,

416
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,980
I didn't know that. There we
go. Roughly translated. Yeah.

417
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,730
Um, and I want to talk a little
about the visuals of the film. Uh,

418
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,940
the first establishing
shot up tomorrow land.

419
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,530
We as soon as a lot into teasers and
the trailers and it's on the posters and

420
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:28,290
stuff,
you know,

421
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:31,670
Newton in the field looking onto the city
really reminded me of the wizard of Oz

422
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:34,830
when Dorothy and the gang are kind
of looking onto the city. So, uh,

423
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,120
did that have a lot of inspiration of
what films kind of inspired this? Well,

424
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,560
that,
yeah.

425
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,560
Moment where the character touches the
pen and finds herself in the wheat field

426
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,080
was part of the film when Damon pitched
me the idea and that idea that this

427
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:55,190
better world was that close, that it
was, it was essentially just a, uh,

428
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,190
on the other side of an invisible
veil, uh, was really attractive to me.

429
00:25:00,191 --> 00:25:02,320
I mean,
without getting pretentious on it,

430
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:07,340
it's also on a metaphoric level is that
that better future is closer than we

431
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,350
think. And it's not an
impossible place to get to it.

432
00:25:11,351 --> 00:25:15,670
It's going to take work and it's gonna
take some sacrifice as it does in the

433
00:25:15,671 --> 00:25:20,440
film and in its own fairy tale
way. But, uh, it is that close. It,

434
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,760
it can happen. It's, it's tangible.
And you know, uh, in the 60s,

435
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:27,850
which we are talking about, uh, you know,

436
00:25:27,851 --> 00:25:31,990
President Kennedy said we're going to be
on the moon by the end of this decade.

437
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:35,650
And it happened, you
know, so, uh, you know,

438
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,510
we were just kind of trying to PR

439
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,550
you should talk about,
I was just going to,

440
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,090
I think that a big part of it
is ultimately we're trying,

441
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,190
I was just talking with a gentleman
in the back before we went on about,

442
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,020
you know, what, what is the
emotional idea behind it? Um,

443
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:54,360
because it's hard to describe a feeling
and that idea of tomorrow and really

444
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:58,680
represents a feeling that we
have. And, and, and how do
you visualize that feeling?

445
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:03,360
And I think that the idea of you kind
of need somebody to show you what you're

446
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,760
working toward as a motivator.
And it's like,

447
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,610
we want you to know that this place
exists. This is why we built it.

448
00:26:08,611 --> 00:26:11,100
It's an inspiration.
It's going to be very hard to get there,

449
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,770
but if you put your mind to
it, you can. And it exists.

450
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,610
And I think that that's one
of the reasons that, um,

451
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,820
that pop culture is so obsessed with
dystopia is it's easier to build because

452
00:26:20,821 --> 00:26:24,150
all you have to do is knock down what
we've got. You know, it's, it's easy to,

453
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,140
it's easy to knock down cities that
are preexisting or, or put, you know,

454
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:32,280
as much as I love blade runner, it
was an inspirational movie. It's,

455
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,270
it's grafted onto an existing complex.
Um,

456
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,440
for us it's much harder
to build the future.

457
00:26:37,441 --> 00:26:41,370
And it was an immensely challenging for
Brad and his entire team to basically

458
00:26:41,371 --> 00:26:44,340
say like, okay, we know what
looks like from this far away,

459
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:47,550
but she's going to actually have to go
into that city and what does it look like

460
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:48,420
from the ground up?

461
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,400
Yeah. But on another level, on
a more abstract level, you know,

462
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,370
I go through that same thing with
ideas all the time. You know,

463
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:59,750
when ideas are brand new, they are
fragile things and you're just going,

464
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,600
I don't know what this is
exactly, but here, you know,

465
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:07,601
maybe it's this and you can knock it
down like that and most people do.

466
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,350
Um, but, uh,

467
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,820
so it's easier to knock down an idea than
it is to protect it and nurture it and

468
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:17,750
help it get strong. You know, there,
there is that tendency, you know,

469
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:22,370
negativity is like a weed that that has
really hardy and doubt is. And you know,

470
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:27,050
we're in show business where it's like
doubt is always the character, you know,

471
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,080
in the room and it's the Alpha in the
room and you kind of have to win every

472
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:33,140
time. You know, I mean,

473
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,910
you can literally go through every line
of Casablanca and do it as if it's a bad

474
00:27:37,911 --> 00:27:42,570
line, you know, of all the gin
joints in the world, you know,

475
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,510
you can make any ideas sound bad
and it's easy to do. And, and,

476
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,410
you know, the, the Internet is
powerful. It is as it is, is a,

477
00:27:51,411 --> 00:27:53,150
as a way to learn and everything.

478
00:27:53,151 --> 00:27:58,151
It's also a way to snark from the shadows
and kill a positive things in their,

479
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:01,220
in their cradle.
So it's like,

480
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,750
I think that the film supports
the idea of nurturing, you know,

481
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,970
uh, uh, new ideas and, um,

482
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,200
try taking the hits it you need to
take to make something positive happen.

483
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,353
Yeah.
Uh,

484
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,900
well this is a great transition to Dana
who was with our toxic Google program as

485
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:21,060
well, and she's going
to come up here and, uh,

486
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,110
take us through something special
that, uh, Google help create with, uh,

487
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:27,000
the Disney marketing team.

488
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,630
Yes. So, uh, we're very excited because
Disney and Google partner to create,

489
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:35,610
take me to tomorrow land,
which is a 363 interactive experience.

490
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,460
Uh, so you can visit it by
going to take me to tomorrow,

491
00:28:38,461 --> 00:28:42,840
land.com or you can use Google voice
search technology and say, okay, Google,

492
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,050
take me to tomorrow land. Uh, so
we have a very quick demo here. Um,

493
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,560
if you guys want to, you know,
give us any tidbits in commentary,

494
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:52,170
you're more than welcome to

495
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,350
give you a good visual of the world
that they created and stuff. And,

496
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,950
and this is all done by, you know, the
Disney kind of marketing side of it,

497
00:28:57,951 --> 00:29:01,060
but they can't take a lot of
inspiration and aspects, uh,

498
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,810
from the film that these guys credit.

499
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,720
Yeah. Great. Uh, you know, uh,

500
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,360
not having seen the precise
demo that you're about to show.

501
00:29:07,361 --> 00:29:11,320
I think that we just wanted to try
to create the experience that, uh,

502
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,450
that the characters who
touched the pins have,

503
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,620
which is that you could essentially,
you'll look through your cell phone,

504
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:21,970
I'm at this virtual space and understand
that like there's a thin layer between

505
00:29:21,971 --> 00:29:25,990
our world and this other world
and that it would be 360 degrees.

506
00:29:25,991 --> 00:29:30,210
So depending on which direction you turn,
you would be getting a vista into, um,

507
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,960
into tomorrow land and you could actually
venture into the city in the same way.

508
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,000
Illustration of that idea that
it's that close, you know?

509
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,880
Yeah, Yup. Go ahead.

510
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:49,360
You've represent the very best and most
imagine you said the world has to offer

511
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,720
and that is why do you have
been selected to visit tomorrow?

512
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:57,370
Land secret pace and
nothing is impossible. Pace,

513
00:29:57,371 --> 00:30:00,220
where your dreams for
the future come reality.

514
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,100
If you're ready to change the world,
we need to do.

515
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,360
So. That was Athena, right?
That's the thing is voice.

516
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:15,030
And then obviously this
display is, you actually, uh,

517
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,500
I showed this to some writers on the
show that I work on and they were all

518
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:22,430
started spinning around in their chairs
and you have to see the city that's

519
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:27,270
behind you. And then you go in and there's
a variety of, of great content. Um,

520
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,850
this is a little short on the
1964 world's fair, um, where,

521
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:36,810
uh, where Walt was a
pervasive presence. He had a,

522
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:41,240
uh, audio item Medtronics there,
Mr Lincoln carousel progress. Yeah.

523
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:46,010
For attractions that were all
kind of futuristic and themselves.

524
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:50,510
And then this is, um, this
is, this is our, uh, uh,

525
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:53,110
view of tomorrow land. A lot of which, um,

526
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,380
which is in the real world was shot
in the city of arts and sciences.

527
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,610
[inaudible] Spain,
uh,

528
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,670
designed by a kind of genius
architect named Calatrava. Okay.

529
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,100
Uh, that was a little
piece of, um, of, uh,

530
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,950
a letter from David Nix who is Hugh
Laurie. And the movie to Steve Jobs, um,

531
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,780
who were saying was a
member of Plus Ultra.

532
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:17,920
I think one of the fun parts of the viral
for our campaign is we imagined who in

533
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:21,910
the last hundred years would have been in,
in the Secret Society of,

534
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,650
of geniuses and thinkers. Um, what
architects, uh, what storytellers,

535
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,110
uh, what mathematicians,
et Cetera, et Cetera,

536
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,800
because we always likened tomorrow
land to sort of, ah, ha, you know,

537
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:35,230
Hogwarts for science. Um, this,

538
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:39,220
this secret world that was created by the
best and brightest. Right. But it's not,

539
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,420
it's,
it's scientists and artists and you know,

540
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:47,070
I think, uh, you know, Hetty
Lamar is, is in plus ultra.

541
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,930
Yeah.
That's pretty cool.

542
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,013
Hmm.

543
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,180
And these are just a number
of different of bus stops.

544
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:59,900
So there's a lot of fun stuff to
explore and kick around. Um, there,

545
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,100
there's a sequence in the movie,
uh, that relates to where, okay,

546
00:32:04,101 --> 00:32:07,210
I'm not going to give it
away, but I will, hey,

547
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:11,650
you guys have Ralph
Kramden over here. Uh, uh,

548
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,790
we'll just say that there've
been things police in Paris.

549
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,480
There are many worlds fairs. Uh, yes. Uh,

550
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,750
one in 1889 there was a
particular interest interest

551
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,320
to us.

552
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,890
And was it all a fun to kind of connect
the history with the movie and kind of,

553
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,810
well, I think that one of the
things that was interesting is, um,

554
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,940
world's fairs used to be a place where
people kind of bright ideas together from

555
00:32:32,941 --> 00:32:37,320
all over the world and kind of showed off,
you know, how they imagine the future.

556
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,190
And what's interesting is,
uh,

557
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,440
their visions of the future were different
depending on which era they were from.

558
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:49,370
But they all still look
futuristic. I mean, the future in,

559
00:32:49,371 --> 00:32:54,200
in the late 18 hundreds was full of air
ships that were like giant balloons,

560
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:57,790
you know, because that's what they
could imagine, you know. And in the 20s,

561
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,300
it was Hugh Ferris in these,

562
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,570
these massive buildings that were blocks
and blocks long and wide at the base,

563
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,420
um, but just stretched into the heavens.
And it was kind of like metropolis,

564
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:11,990
you know, that fits Fritz
Lang movie. And uh, so,

565
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,200
so the visions of the future, we're
always changing, but they were all,

566
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,640
they all still look futuristic. So
we were kind of saying, you know,

567
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:24,350
what if a skyline was built up of, uh,
you know, futuristic detail from a lot of,

568
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:27,770
and we only get to touch on it in the
movie. It's really kind of a road movie.

569
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:30,460
But anyway, yeah. Thank you
for all that. That was amazing.

570
00:33:30,461 --> 00:33:32,990
A little director's
screenwriter commentary. Uh,

571
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:36,110
so Dana has some extra questions that
we've collected from Googlers and she's

572
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:38,630
going to go into those and then we're
gonna go into live audience questions.

573
00:33:38,631 --> 00:33:40,910
So if you guys want to start
lining up the mic, great. Uh,

574
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,240
yeah. So take it dinner. So these are
some questions we've collected. Uh,

575
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:46,170
and you guys have briefly
mentioned this, but, uh,

576
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,280
what's one technology from tomorrow
land that you wish we could have today?

577
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:55,360
Well, the easy answer is jetpacks
we're still waiting. Yeah.

578
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,500
But, uh, yeah, I mean,
you know, I, you know, I,

579
00:33:57,501 --> 00:34:00,850
I do think that ultimately
technology is great, um,

580
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,050
in terms of a bettering the human
condition, but I also think as,

581
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:08,830
as one of our characters expresses in
the movie, that it should be fun. Yeah.

582
00:34:08,831 --> 00:34:13,060
And I think that the things that I
gravitate to a tech technology wise, um,

583
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:16,240
are fun. And, uh, we tried to
pop the weight the movie with,

584
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:20,050
with stuff that may or may on the surface
be a bit impractical but had great

585
00:34:20,051 --> 00:34:24,940
user interface. But I think
that, yeah. But I think that,
thank you sir. That's, yeah.

586
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,700
One guy. Yeah. Yeah.
Uh, but I think to that

587
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,310
kind of the Disney aspect of it too
is, is, you know, people say, well,

588
00:34:33,311 --> 00:34:36,670
is it in the park? Is it, is
it while Disney in the movie?

589
00:34:36,671 --> 00:34:39,940
And it's like he isn't and it isn't,

590
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:44,890
but it's kind of all over the film
if it's about a state of mind and,

591
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,820
and Disney viewed the future
as exciting and, and fun and,

592
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:54,250
and full of wonder. It's not something
that is crushing or anything like that.

593
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,150
Um,
and you guys touched on this a little bit,

594
00:34:58,151 --> 00:35:01,120
but what are some of the challenges
of appealing to such a broad audience?

595
00:35:01,121 --> 00:35:06,010
You know, you want six year olds through
68 year olds going to the movie. Uh,

596
00:35:06,011 --> 00:35:06,671
and Damien,

597
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:10,180
especially some of your work has maybe
geared towards a slightly older audience.

598
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,550
Uh,
was there any fun?

599
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,600
It's a dealing with that
or I think the challenge

600
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:22,450
is that if you start aiming at any
group that you are not a member of,

601
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:28,010
you're in trouble. If you start
saying they'll love it, you're dead.

602
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:32,480
And I think that if you think about it
logically as it was we were talking about

603
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:37,040
right before this, uh, the idea of
your, your job, here's your assignment,

604
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,913
sir,

605
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,980
is to make something that will
appeal to all ages and all,

606
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,080
uh, uh, both sexes and
everything in between. And, uh,

607
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,140
uh, all parts of the world,
all faiths, all non faiths,

608
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,170
four years from now, three years
from now, that's your goal.

609
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:59,160
It's like it's an impossible job. No one
in their right mind would ever do it.

610
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:03,030
But if you make the job,
what do I want to see at the movies,

611
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:06,990
then the job becomes doable and
simple. So I think that, you know,

612
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,810
speaking for myself, um, uh,

613
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:13,140
I just tried to make a movie that I would
want to see and then hopefully other

614
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:15,250
people share that. And, you know, Eh,

615
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:19,520
simply put, I think that I spend a
lot of my time in dark territory.

616
00:36:19,521 --> 00:36:23,420
I'm really drawn to those stories as
a consumer and as a storyteller. Um,

617
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:28,750
and as much as we decried the dystopian
movies that tomorrow land is sort of

618
00:36:29,151 --> 00:36:32,180
against, I love those movie. Yeah.
A lot of them. So these are great,

619
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:33,500
but I wanted to make them,
you know,

620
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,030
but I really want to do engage
in something where, where it,

621
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:41,960
I felt good and um, and it was lighter
and brighter or without being corny.

622
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:44,210
And I think that the idea of saying,
well,

623
00:36:44,211 --> 00:36:47,510
I really think that people want to
go see the movies, go to the movies,

624
00:36:47,511 --> 00:36:48,380
especially in the summer,

625
00:36:48,381 --> 00:36:52,490
and walk out of it with a smile on their
face and not scratching their heads.

626
00:36:52,491 --> 00:36:55,210
And that doesn't mean that it needs
to be dumb and that doesn't need that.

627
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,860
It can't be a dark journey along the way.
But I do think that the,

628
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:02,420
the journey towards optimism is it was
something that we were aspiring to.

629
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:06,740
And as stupid as it is to say this,
it is true that that brings every,

630
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,350
at every age group,
every gender, you know,

631
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:13,180
every ethnicity under the sun who
doesn't want to see that. Yeah.

632
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,140
And we don't know,
but everybody loves dystopia,

633
00:37:15,141 --> 00:37:16,340
but they don't want to live in one.

634
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,230
Yeah. And, and, and for me, you were
talking about, um, uh, you know, uh,

635
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,910
appealing to different, uh,
different aspects. Um, you know,

636
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:31,030
my work in animation has been geared a
little more towards the adult side of

637
00:37:31,491 --> 00:37:34,220
things as well.
And yet when I was a kid,

638
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:38,300
I liked to entertainment that I didn't
completely understand that there was,

639
00:37:38,301 --> 00:37:41,480
you know, bugs bunny wasn't
actually designed for children.

640
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,480
A lot of people made the mistake
of thinking that it was, um,

641
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,990
but it actually was designed for the
people that we're going to see the latest

642
00:37:47,991 --> 00:37:50,630
Bogart movie as a little mint beforehand.

643
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,570
And so the jokes are
absolutely adult jokes.

644
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,910
And that doesn't mean that a kid
won't have a good time at it.

645
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,670
But it means that when you get older,

646
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,880
the films also grow old
with you and they go, hey,

647
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:06,470
I got one for Ya that you didn't get
when you were a kid. And I like that.

648
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:12,290
The next question is about the score
and working with Michael Cicchino. Uh,

649
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,310
you both worked with him before. Yeah, no.

650
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,010
Yeah. Well actually introduced us.
Yeah, that's right. Um, my, uh,

651
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,710
Michael did the score for lost
all six seasons and um, and,

652
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:29,210
and also I guess he was working on the
Incredibles first movie was incredible.

653
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,490
They overlapped a bit and then he did
the music for speed racer and Brad and I

654
00:38:34,491 --> 00:38:38,930
were both at the speed mace
racer premiere, and then
he introduced us and, uh,

655
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:43,100
we pushed him aside and started
geeking out. Uh, but it,

656
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:45,400
it's actually been a dream
come true because, you know,

657
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:48,760
Michael doesn't just write the music.
He's a, he's a real creative collaborator.

658
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,920
He's a storyteller. And that's why, uh,

659
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:56,050
I think that's why we enjoy his music
is he has all the compositional chops,

660
00:38:56,501 --> 00:39:00,040
but he's not just making music.
He's telling a story with us and he,

661
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,530
and he writes incredibly emotional music.

662
00:39:02,531 --> 00:39:06,310
I think that the idea of like he really
makes you feel something when you close

663
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:10,550
your eyes and you think about up, you
know, you can literally hear that. Yeah,

664
00:39:10,551 --> 00:39:13,840
that theme in your heart. Yeah.
Yeah. No, it's, it's really,

665
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:15,580
it's almost an eerie tone too.
It's really,

666
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:17,950
really cool what they've done
with the on the edge of the city.

667
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,950
We have one more question before we turn
it over to our live audience and that

668
00:39:20,951 --> 00:39:22,870
is in cinematic history.

669
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,050
What film do you wish you could
have directed or written? Oh my God,

670
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,550
you haven't already.
It's just a 24 hour network.

671
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,270
Can be
a Damon.

672
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,350
There's too many for him it feels
like it's a trick question. I mean,

673
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,920
because those movies wouldn't be as
good had I written or directed them.

674
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,570
That's not putting myself down.
It's just saying like, you know,

675
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,640
jaws is probably, as much as I love
star wars and Raiders of the lost arc,

676
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:52,150
those are the,

677
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:56,110
those are the two movies that I saw
billions and billions of time times.

678
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,140
I think the first time that I saw
jaws, jaws, I was just in wonder.

679
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,480
I was really aware of
the filmmaking in a way,

680
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:06,520
the decisions that were being made.
Um, uh, directorially and I, uh,

681
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:11,170
I, I just think that, you
know, essentially it's just
a movie about a shark that's,

682
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,690
uh, needs to be stopped.
But the, but the, you know,

683
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,930
but the complexity is every
single scene in that movie,

684
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:18,880
the choices that are being
made. There's a, you know,

685
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:21,940
there's a scene that Jj has talked about
between Roy Scheider and a son where

686
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:25,340
they're just sort of, uh, you know,
my each other. And it's like, it,

687
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,170
that scene is all emotion about how
these characters are feeling emotionally.

688
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:33,190
And I just think that they're, you know,
that, that that's a directorial decision.

689
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:37,960
It happens on the page. It
happens organically. And I
think this, this idea of,

690
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:42,730
I'm just trying not to overthink things
and go from the gut, go from the gut. Um,

691
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,160
yeah. And, and you know, I mean, you,

692
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,860
he says those films and it's just
like each time I'm like, ha ha.

693
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:54,010
Because they're great films and they
stick with you, you know, um, uh,

694
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,930
there's, uh, in Raiders, you know,

695
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,890
is there a better ending to a film than
that guy wheeling the thing into the

696
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:04,570
warehouse? Endless. I mean,
that's just, you know,

697
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:07,080
and it's like, that's what
makes you want to get, you know,

698
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:11,260
you see a crappy movie and you
just go, oh, movies are over.

699
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,800
They're just like, ah,
you know, I came too late.

700
00:41:14,801 --> 00:41:18,580
The art forums played out and
I've gotten in the habit of like,

701
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,800
[inaudible] got a mild creative poisoning
somehow and I need to fix it and I put

702
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:28,090
on any great movie and watch 10 minutes
of that and man, I'm ready again.

703
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,590
You know,

704
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:33,290
I watched the opening of a once upon a
time in the west and it just makes you go

705
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:37,640
westerns rock, you know, and I can't
wait to do a western, you know?

706
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,990
So anyway. Yeah, no.

707
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:41,300
Piggybacking off that a little bit
because pet man's wallet recently did that

708
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:43,000
little rant about,
um,

709
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:48,120
if there was a movie that has
not had a SQL and is like, what,

710
00:41:48,121 --> 00:41:49,340
what would you like to see made?

711
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:53,040
And he wanted to see the unbreakable
SQLs so is there a movie from the past,

712
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:55,990
like pitch the entire, the entire
thing and I was going to make it with,

713
00:41:55,991 --> 00:41:59,160
I'm not shambling I have
weird things like, you know,

714
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,860
I want to see Ambersons wells
cut of Ambersons. You know, I,

715
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:08,090
I want to see, I would love it
if I could just put Sean Connery,

716
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:11,810
take him out of diamonds are
forever and put him in, you know,

717
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,710
on Her Majesty's secret service that
have that be your last bond film.

718
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:20,350
You know what I mean? Um, so it's a lot of
that kind of super geek stuff. You know,

719
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:24,800
I kind of feel that movies that don't
have sequels shouldn't have sequels, um,

720
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,680
equal to the castle.
Because back then,

721
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:31,700
did you know that I did not
know about bill. Yeah. Wow.
Yeah. Yeah. I'm not kidding.

722
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:32,490
No,
but I,

723
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,470
and this isn't to take anything away from
back to the future two or back to the

724
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:40,580
future three, but I think that, you know,
doc Brown at the end saying, you know,

725
00:42:40,581 --> 00:42:44,090
there's something wrong with your kids,
Marty, and then the, and then the ants,

726
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,430
you know, and then it's
like, what's wrong?

727
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:48,110
What's wrong with his kids is that
they're assholes. If you know,

728
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,890
like that's the big payoff
is like, no, it wasn't meant.

729
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,450
It wasn't meant to be taken literally.

730
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:55,640
There wasn't supposed to be
a back to the future too.

731
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,020
And so every once in a
while you hear like, oh,

732
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,400
I hear they're talking about
an e t two and it's like, why?

733
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:04,010
Why do you need that to
happen? I mean like, do I do,

734
00:43:04,011 --> 00:43:07,970
I name God Spielberg has made sure
that hasn't had, yeah, no, it's great.

735
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:09,440
And it's just protecting that one.

736
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,940
So if a movie was great then
and there isn't a sequel by now,

737
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,590
they're probably shouldn't be.

738
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:20,260
Yup. Yup. Great. So I think we're going
to turn it over to a lot of questions.

739
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,010
So given your different backgrounds,
expertise,

740
00:43:23,011 --> 00:43:26,550
what was your process for providing input
to the visual designers for the film,

741
00:43:26,551 --> 00:43:28,470
which is very important to this film.
And Brad,

742
00:43:28,471 --> 00:43:29,940
thank you very much for
the photo of my daughter.

743
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,860
That was incredibly cool yesterday.

744
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:35,100
Oh, thank you. Uh, well it was, it was,

745
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,550
it was tough because as we just said,
um,

746
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:44,310
the tip is all we of the iceberg is all
we could show in this movie and there

747
00:43:44,311 --> 00:43:48,630
just wasn't enough time. You know,
at the beginning of a film, you, you,

748
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,860
it's a wide open and you feel
like you can go forever on it,

749
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:58,140
but the story only allowed x amount of
time and tomorrow land because the story

750
00:43:58,141 --> 00:44:02,700
is not about the city. It's
about the journey. And so,

751
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,380
uh, as, as fun as the city
was to, to, to create,

752
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:11,420
there are all these things
that I would love to do that,

753
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:14,060
that we just didn't have
enough screen time for. So,

754
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:16,790
and yeah, and for me, speaking
outside of a visual medium,

755
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,240
and I'm kind of saying the same
thing that, that, that Brad just was,

756
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:23,030
is that the city, it's really
about what the city represents.

757
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,660
It's about capturing that feeling. Cause
if you think about Oz, for example, this,

758
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:27,110
the,

759
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,350
the emerald city and I were to start
actually seeing her and I were to say to

760
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:32,010
you like,
just tell me anything about the

761
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,460
emerald city, like an adjective. Other
than that, it's green and you, you're,

762
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:40,380
you're hard pressed to do so because it's
really about, it's, it's a destination.

763
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:41,700
It's where the wizard is.

764
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:44,610
If the place that you're trying
to get to that in your mind,

765
00:44:44,611 --> 00:44:48,600
it's this amazing place in your,
you swear you've seen it in detail,

766
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,320
but that's more about the spell they,
we've, than it is about the actuality.

767
00:44:52,321 --> 00:44:56,340
You know, people talk about Bambi,
you know, and they go, man, every,

768
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:01,530
every leaf in that forest
is perfect. Actually, if you
see the film, it's not, it's,

769
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,150
it's almost abstract.

770
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:06,570
They have very little detail and they
only have little points of detail,

771
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:08,700
which is the genius of
the art direction of it.

772
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:11,760
And I think it's the difference between
the director's cut of close encounters

773
00:45:11,761 --> 00:45:13,650
and the, and the, and
the theatrical release,

774
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:16,230
which is you don't need to
go inside the ship, you know,

775
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:19,710
although he did a cut afterwards
where you don't go in the shit. Right.

776
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:22,290
Cause he realized that was not
a good idea. That's what I'm,

777
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,570
I think we're saying the same thing.
What I'm saying is there's,

778
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,720
there's the director's cut after
the director's cut. I understand.

779
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,790
I see your geeky and I'd raise it.

780
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,550
I fold.
Wow.

781
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:39,700
I bring it up.
Me Too.

782
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:45,090
If you were put in charge of Disneyland,
what would you change tomorrow? Land.

783
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:50,370
Yeah, I would, and I've talked to the
Disney guys about it. I mean they, uh,

784
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,420
you know, it's, it's, it's like a
country, they change administrations.

785
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,380
And I think there's enthusiasm
in this administration for, uh,

786
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:03,210
taking on the challenge of tomorrow. And
I think the previous administration, uh,

787
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:08,040
was frustrated by Walt basically creating
a part of the park that had to be

788
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:09,480
continually reinvented.

789
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:14,660
He designed it to be continually going
out of date and needing refreshing more

790
00:46:14,881 --> 00:46:19,530
than any other land in the park because
he was excited about that idea. But,

791
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,820
uh, uh, the,

792
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:26,250
the usual businessman is frustrated by
that at that idea because it means that

793
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:30,780
you've constantly got to work on it and
it's like, can't we just be done? And,

794
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:32,730
and that,
uh,

795
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:37,740
the version of tomorrow land that has
been there for a while is kind of trying

796
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:42,180
to, to end the reinvention of it.
Like we'll put it in the past,

797
00:46:42,181 --> 00:46:47,110
it'll be Jules Verne ask and then we'll
be done. And I think the current, uh,

798
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,540
a group of imagineers are very
excited about the possibility of,

799
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,270
of reinvigorating it and making it again,

800
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,880
a place that's an idea
that's about to come,

801
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:01,050
which is really exciting about tomorrow
land in Walt Disney's conception.

802
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,420
And I think is, is the key
to making it work. Ditto.

803
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:10,700
Thank you. And a Brad, which
of your previous work should
have a sequel of mine?

804
00:47:10,701 --> 00:47:11,910
Is it batteries?
Not included?

805
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,660
Wow. Uh, well, uh, I'm,

806
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,290
I think they did make a sequel
to batteries, not included.

807
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:24,210
Didn't they direct to video? No,
no, no, no. That doesn't count. No.

808
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:29,070
Hmm. Uh, I'm currently
writing Incredibles two, so

809
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:35,020
I'm not averse to a
sequel or too, but no, no,

810
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:38,250
I'm not going to say that
damn thing. Yeah. Yep.

811
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,390
So I saw the movie yesterday and I
thought it really captured that sort of

812
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:47,350
desire to create the future that so
many of us at Google ended up here.

813
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:51,610
So then it was great to have a reminder of
that. So thanks for that. Oh, thank you.

814
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:55,990
Yeah.
So this is about the movie.

815
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:59,940
So Governor Nixon, the movie sort of seem
to be the last person in tomorrow, and,

816
00:47:59,941 --> 00:48:02,800
and I'm curious, did he just
stack rank everybody else else?

817
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,530
Uh, we don't wanna we don't want
to spoil anything in the movie,

818
00:48:06,531 --> 00:48:10,770
but I do think that, um,
uh, the idea that this is,

819
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:15,680
this was a place that was built to be
highly inclusive or, or open source,

820
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:20,480
um, uh, it was definitely in the
design. You know, he's speaking,

821
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,770
these are the things, um, and, but,

822
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:27,800
but there is this, uh,
you know, uh, again,

823
00:48:27,801 --> 00:48:31,550
I have an eight year old son and when we
have kids come over from other families

824
00:48:31,551 --> 00:48:33,530
and they have younger siblings,
he's like,

825
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:37,190
the younger siblings are not allowed in
my room because they are going to break

826
00:48:37,191 --> 00:48:40,190
things and they are going to touch
things and they going to drool on them.

827
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:42,130
And I think that, you know, uh,

828
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,830
I think that Hugh Laurie's character
embodies many of these same ideas and he's

829
00:48:45,831 --> 00:48:48,830
not wrong. That's, you know, uh,
that, that's the idea of like,

830
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:50,300
if you build something like this,

831
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,910
you can't be afraid that people are
going to come in and mess it up.

832
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:56,160
And when you become afraid that people
are going to come in and mess it up, you,

833
00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:00,530
you closed the doors, you build
a large walls and uh, and,

834
00:49:00,531 --> 00:49:05,090
and I think both sides are right. Um,
but, but it also have to see the movie,

835
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,060
but you have to see the
movie. Yeah. Thank you Brad.

836
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:13,430
I should see the movie.
Good. It, it help. It would,

837
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,253
it's about time.

838
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:20,020
So should, I haven't seen it yet,
but I'm interested in, um, as,

839
00:49:20,021 --> 00:49:21,250
as writer and director,

840
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:25,840
how you strike the balance between a
concept which invites a lot of visuals,

841
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:26,830
just really rich,

842
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:31,690
incredible visuals and the intimacy
that in a story like how you keep people

843
00:49:31,691 --> 00:49:34,450
connected personally when
there's a lot of, of,

844
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,640
let me just say one thing real quick.

845
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,550
W which is we made a conscious
effort in this movie.

846
00:49:39,551 --> 00:49:44,290
I think a lot of movies have a cast,
a very large cast and they,

847
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,760
and they need to build
and build and build.

848
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:48,850
So that in the final set piece of
the movie, you've got, you know,

849
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:52,350
800 people fighting 800
other people. Um, we,

850
00:49:52,351 --> 00:49:55,960
we made a real other 7,000
hundred CG generated.

851
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:58,390
We made a conscious effort
to really scale things down.

852
00:49:58,391 --> 00:50:01,930
And that isn't to say that we didn't
want an exciting final act set piece,

853
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:04,360
but we said,
we're really in two hours.

854
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:07,810
We really only have the real estate
to get you to care about three or four

855
00:50:07,811 --> 00:50:10,330
people and that, and, and that.

856
00:50:10,331 --> 00:50:12,940
That way you're able to put a lot more
attention on the set piece and the

857
00:50:12,941 --> 00:50:17,410
visuals itself. Right. But
I think that also, uh, the,

858
00:50:17,411 --> 00:50:22,411
the quick answer to the visual question
is that all of this stuff needs to be in

859
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:25,330
service of the story and
the emotions of the story.

860
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,400
And so you don't just the city as a city,

861
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,260
you view it as a character that
also has an arc. And, and, uh,

862
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,200
hopefully, you know, each
character has an arc,

863
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:40,820
but the city itself has an
arc. And, uh, uh, I mean,

864
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:43,130
that's how you know,
you basically,

865
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:48,131
you try to simplify ideas so that you
can adhere to the skeleton that they

866
00:50:49,071 --> 00:50:49,904
provide.

867
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:55,060
And like in Ratatouille I had the very
simple thing above my desk while I was

868
00:50:55,311 --> 00:50:59,690
writing it that said, um, cooks
are givers and rats are takers.

869
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:04,990
And that helped me align all of the
scenes so that there was something

870
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,870
underneath them and on, on
this film, you know, we had uh,

871
00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:11,030
ideas that are kind of complex,

872
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:14,600
but we had to come up with
a series of simple ways to,

873
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,000
to construct that idea and present it.

874
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,820
So it's keeping it simple
and keeping an emotional.

875
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:23,910
Thank you. Thank you. We have time for
about two more questions. We'll do it.

876
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:24,980
We'll do three.
We'll do three.

877
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:27,050
Um,

878
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:31,760
you mentioned earlier that the future
sucks in a way that it didn't before.

879
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:36,020
It doesn't actually, can we just say that
our idea of the future that that yes,

880
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:38,540
if you go into the past that the future
was bright and shiny and things are

881
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:40,640
going to be better and now
things are going to be worse.

882
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:44,240
And this seems to be sort of a
general theme in our stories.

883
00:51:44,241 --> 00:51:48,620
It's something happened. We
got all cynical. This happened
before I was born even.

884
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:53,660
But I have this that stink man.
It really does change that. Yeah,

885
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:58,310
I do build things. My question is,
it's a lot broader than the movie,

886
00:51:58,311 --> 00:52:01,330
but why do you feel that happened? I know
it's sort of a really broad question.

887
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,560
There's probably no one simple answer,
but why do you think that happened?

888
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:05,750
Why did we drop our eyes
on the horizon like that?

889
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,970
Uh, well I, I think that
it's to see how I did that,

890
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:16,560
I think that there was a, there was
a philosophical shift away from, um,

891
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:21,210
I make the future happen, which,
which existed then and now. It's,

892
00:52:21,211 --> 00:52:25,440
the future is something that happens to
me. It's very easy to be discouraged and,

893
00:52:25,441 --> 00:52:27,930
and if, if, if everywhere you click,

894
00:52:27,931 --> 00:52:31,050
it's basically telling you we've crossed
the point of no return in terms of

895
00:52:31,051 --> 00:52:34,110
climate change.
It's very hard to motivate and say,

896
00:52:34,111 --> 00:52:37,410
I'm going to reverse this process
because that is impossible.

897
00:52:37,411 --> 00:52:42,320
And I think that generate
generationally. I was born in 1973, uh,

898
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:46,790
Jay, just as the troops were leaving
Vietnam. Um, I think that the,

899
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:49,080
the idea of there was a war,

900
00:52:49,081 --> 00:52:53,910
a great war that happened in the middle
of the past century, that Wa that we, uh,

901
00:52:53,911 --> 00:52:58,020
you know, that, uh, there was a huge
victory, you know, for humankind.

902
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,490
I'm not just Americans,

903
00:52:59,491 --> 00:53:02,720
but just sort of this idea of we came
to the brink and we won. And, and I,

904
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:06,880
and I think that sort of, uh, things
have gotten a lot muddier since then.

905
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:10,720
The clear delineation between good and
evil has gotten a lot muddier and it's,

906
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:13,170
it's,
it's just much harder to get motivated.

907
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:16,830
It's much harder to be idealistic
without being shouted down.

908
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:20,130
But mostly it's the comments
section. Um, you know,

909
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,740
it's the God damn comment section.

910
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,330
Just look below me right now.
This is on youtube.

911
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:33,150
Look down and you will know
what happened to our future.

912
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:43,090
They're just taking it as
look down to, yeah, exactly.

913
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:46,710
Hi Brad. Daymond, first of all, this
is a great honor to meet you guys.

914
00:53:46,711 --> 00:53:49,380
I'm big fans of you. And on
the piggyback, what you said,

915
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:52,710
being a veteran coming back, um, I
feel after World War II, you're right,

916
00:53:52,711 --> 00:53:55,050
everyone felt that war and
was it like entrenched in it?

917
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,690
But coming back it felt like everyone
else and feel the same thing I felt.

918
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,570
So it's, it's interesting. It's like
this intangible thing. I can't explain,

919
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,100
but going into my question.
Um,

920
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:06,450
you had mentioned bugs bunny and like
adults exits accessing the animators

921
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,220
medium.

922
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:10,890
How do you feel about you ever maybe
tackling anime as a medium or any other

923
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,270
mainstream director?
Okay.

924
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,050
Well, I mean to me, uh,

925
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,350
a lot of anime is just, just really
great staging and more adult themes,

926
00:54:21,351 --> 00:54:24,730
you know, but it's still using this,
the graphic power of the medium.

927
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:27,550
And, uh, you know, I, uh,

928
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:33,240
I don't feel the need to try to imitate
what they're doing cause they're always

929
00:54:33,431 --> 00:54:36,460
going to do it better than I would.
But I do learn,

930
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:41,470
try to learn some lessons from it
and, and as I do from all film, um,

931
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:44,410
and I just think that, um, uh,

932
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:49,300
people make the mistake of calling
animation a genre and it isn't,

933
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:52,780
it's a medium that can do any
genre. And I think that, um,

934
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:56,860
I would love to see more different kinds
of animated films being made. I mean,

935
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:02,080
when a Pixar kind of made
it okay to do animation and,

936
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:05,380
and you know, with computers, um,

937
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:09,310
and also tell stories that
are more different than the,

938
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,780
there was a tendency to do everything
as a musical back then. And, uh, uh,

939
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:18,040
but then everybody started doing this
really crappy imitations of Pixar and that

940
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:19,240
becomes its own like

941
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:20,630
again,
you know,

942
00:55:20,631 --> 00:55:25,631
it's a study of the laggy
blue and it is and it's good.

943
00:55:25,821 --> 00:55:27,200
Sounds good.
Yeah.

944
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:32,570
There's always some little thing of them
dancing at the end in the ads and it's

945
00:55:32,571 --> 00:55:35,930
just like, ah. Anyway, ah, anyway,

946
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,350
it's a wide open medium
that can do a lot of it

947
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:40,480
things.
I think Miyazaki has shown that.

948
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:44,980
And I would love to see people trying
more different things with animation,

949
00:55:44,981 --> 00:55:49,780
you know? Um, so, uh, I want
to do other animated films.

950
00:55:49,781 --> 00:55:53,860
I have ideas that, that I want to do.
I have one that's a science fiction,

951
00:55:53,861 --> 00:55:57,580
the animation thing that I want to do
that kind of verges on what you're talking

952
00:55:57,581 --> 00:55:58,720
and you have the dancing one?

953
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:02,590
No, no, I had birds dancing.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

954
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:07,270
Yeah. But anyway, uh, I,
my ideal career would be

955
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,300
be able to just back back
and forth between the two.

956
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,230
Thank you both. Thank you.
Last question. Hi. I was,

957
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:18,250
I just saw the trailer and I was felt it
was really exciting and different and I

958
00:56:18,251 --> 00:56:22,690
was just curious how it got there,
the trailer for the trailer for tomorrow.

959
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,220
And what was the question? I'm sorry.
Uh, I had just seen the trailer,

960
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,940
the one that was before vendors.
It was long.

961
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:30,910
It was a single scene and it felt very
different from all the other trailers I

962
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:33,970
had seen recently. Yeah, I was just
wondering how it, how that happened.

963
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,920
Well,
I think that the goal,

964
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:40,880
both Damon and I don't like to
have surprises, uh, blown, but you,

965
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:45,340
you have to show something and you wanted
to lay a little track for it. So yeah,

966
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:47,090
I think that the first,
the,

967
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:51,130
the first phase of storytelling was that
we wanted to sell wonder, um, Eh, and the,

968
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,920
and the first trailer was
really just as simple as yes,

969
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:57,370
this young woman touching a pen and seeing
this place and George Clooney saying,

970
00:56:57,371 --> 00:57:00,730
do you want to go with no sense of,
of what the story was.

971
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:04,570
But we eventually evolved to
a point where, um, people, uh,

972
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,240
we wanted to tell them a little bit
more about the story. Most importantly,

973
00:57:07,241 --> 00:57:10,780
that if you want to get to this place,
there's going to be an obstacle.

974
00:57:10,781 --> 00:57:13,420
There's going to be an impediment because
a place like this is going to have

975
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:17,020
people who don't want you to come in.
And so that piece of storytelling,

976
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,380
this whole sequence that took
place at Frank Walker's house,

977
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:25,450
where obviously these, uh, evil
robots are trying to kill people,

978
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,180
I think obviously certainly to,
uh,

979
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:31,720
to a broader audience that that's
massively appealing. But as Brad said,

980
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,350
it doesn't give anything away. It
doesn't spoil any of this surprise. Yeah,

981
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,120
I think that that,
um,

982
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,960
the quick way to describe the
story is that a girl touches a pen.

983
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:45,520
She's shown a place that is amazing and
then the pin stops working and she wants

984
00:57:45,521 --> 00:57:46,660
to get back to that place.

985
00:57:46,661 --> 00:57:51,280
It leads her to the Frank
Walker characters played by
George Clooney who's been

986
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:54,580
there and for some mysterious
reason doesn't want to go back.

987
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:59,470
So [inaudible] like, why is
that? And stuff like that.

988
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,920
But anyway, I'm happy you like
it and hope that you see it.

989
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:07,090
Yeah, I plan to. Sorry. All right,
excellent. Thank you. All right,

990
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:08,680
so let's think a brand
naming for being here.

991
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:14,230
[inaudible] thank you guys

992
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,690
