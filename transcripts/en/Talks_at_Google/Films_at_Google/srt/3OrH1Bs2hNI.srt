00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,580
Hi everyone.
Welcome to talks at Google.

2
00:00:07,581 --> 00:00:10,070
Today is my pleasure to
welcome director Danny Boyle.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,303
Hello.

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,710
We're here for trainspotting
t two trainspotting. Yes.
Uh, and it's 21 years later.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,270
So you guys have a crack at writing
SQL awhile back. And you know,

6
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:27,910
you'd mentioned that it didn't quite
work and so you guys came back and

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,760
revisited what was it between the,

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,100
that version and the one
you've just written that
really was like the difference

9
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:37,060
between like, this is actually a
movie we want to make. I think you was

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,580
that we were very,
um,

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,590
I'm sure that person was fine,
but we,

12
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,230
there was no reason to make it other
than the fact that urban had published a

13
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:52,120
novel and then it felt
like a commercially, you
know, a debt thing to do.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,470
And when you read it, you just feel,
you just felt wretched. And I think,

15
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,560
I think the reason for that
was that you realize that, um,

16
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,160
if you were going to approach it again
because there was this affection for the

17
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:06,460
original, the w did, it's sustained,

18
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,360
that people would be
incredibly disappointed if
you just went back for it for

19
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,610
that reason.
So it was kind of risky.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,640
Commercially it's obvious
to go back to it. Um,

21
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,920
but actually in truth it was very,
very,

22
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,180
it's very risky unless you
had something personal,

23
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,360
some real powerful reason to make it
like we had for the first time we were,

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,520
we approached the book,

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,480
which nobody wanted us to do because
people couldn't see how it could be called

26
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:36,310
Boma film and the kind of type of people
it was about was where, where would,

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,170
where would not be attractive
on film, UN, UN, UN, UN, UN, uh,

28
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,420
more than that,
that would be unacceptable really.

29
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,810
But we had a passion for that and you
have to find that passion in the new

30
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:51,370
version. Otherwise you'll, you'll, you'll
just end up disappointing people and, um,

31
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,290
and then they will crucify you.

32
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,130
And rightly so because you kind of
gone back to something that has,

33
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,210
has a value in their life that you're
lucky to have that place, you know,

34
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:04,540
so it was,
it was age really.

35
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,890
And um,
for all of us involved,

36
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,650
for me and the screenwriter
initially John who,

37
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,050
who had himself a bit
of a medical emergency,

38
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,650
I don't know if you've seen the film
of any, have you seen it yet? No. Well,

39
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:19,440
does it kind of like,
you'll see it as a kind of like,

40
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:22,240
so I know what to give away and not one,
not to give away. Anyway, there was,

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,440
he'd had a kind of medical emergency which
gave him a bit of a crisis and that's

42
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:31,150
the focus part of the film is what
triggers the re-ignition of their time

43
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:35,740
together and the, their friendship
again. Um, and then it was really,

44
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,180
it was weird doing it because

45
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,790
the film is really you really part of
making the film was realizing what the

46
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,990
first film was about,

47
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,050
which we didn't really know
cause everybody said it's
a drug film. And we said,

48
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:49,420
no, it's not. It's a film about
friendship and things like that.

49
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,250
But actually the first film is a study of
energy and you thought, or you boyhood,

50
00:02:54,251 --> 00:02:55,870
if you like,
is a better way of putting it.

51
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:01,290
And this is actually about the transition
and how badly man make it to manhood

52
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,230
really is sort of what it's about really.
And uh,

53
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,860
and we learned while making it home much,

54
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,300
although winning get terrible
flack for age and time,

55
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,730
actually women age much better than
men way, but men are terrible at it.

56
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,671
They just,

57
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:23,440
we hang onto the past in a way that's
actually eventually embarrassing and you

58
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:28,240
don't realize it. Um, and you'll see that
in the film really. And it's one of the,

59
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:28,830
and it's,

60
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,510
it's one of the things that makes the
film attracts it because they do try and

61
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,690
we live in the past. That's not
just a commercial reason to do it.

62
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,810
They literally do try and the effort
was Bravard or the past is kind of saw

63
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:43,780
attractive to them. And there's a
couple of seasons where they do that,

64
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,620
but actually it's inappropriate.
No, in a way. And, and anyway,

65
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,660
on women age and much, much faster. And
they're all women in the film who, um,

66
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,050
they don't have a huge amount to do, but
what they do, they do devastatingly well,

67
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,730
really. I'm like, Oh God,

68
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,320
yeah.
Women,

69
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,320
women have always been sort of a catalyst
for the characters in this for me at

70
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,470
least as a viewer, I'm like, okay,
well there, you know, part of yeah.

71
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,940
Of what has driven them,
these guys to do these things.

72
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,780
And it was interesting because both Diane
and Gail's characters are back in this,

73
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:11,670
it's the whole cast is back. Yeah. Um,

74
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,290
but was there ever a point
where you guys were like,

75
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,650
actually we might explore and we do see
more of that with like big beast family,

76
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,730
but were you ever considering putting more
of the female perspective in or is it,

77
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,360
I mean, obviously the first one is so
much about like these, this guy dynamic.

78
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,613
Yeah.

79
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,330
Yes. It is a, and it was
um, it was, I mean we did,

80
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,790
when we set up the film, the, the
key questions that people asked is,

81
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:39,270
would the four guys that come back
again to be at the center of the film,

82
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:42,000
would it be the same actors?
And, but the second question,

83
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:46,270
people always ask these would Kelly
McDonald comeback to play Diane?

84
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,540
And she does. And uh, and but we
had another scene for her later.

85
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,080
So she did have a bigger part to play and
we caught it because it diminished her.

86
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,650
And it's weird the way film works.
It doesn't work.

87
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:01,290
Like it is almost script
at all and it's slightly,

88
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,990
it was better that she just
has this one central scene,

89
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:08,430
which he does beautifully and UN
and it's devastating nuclear war.

90
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,110
How much more successfully she's dealt
with time then the Renton has dealt with

91
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:17,730
time. Um, and uh, so we actually,

92
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,920
if anything in editing,
we reduced it. Really,

93
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,450
their agency is very important in the,
in the film, but it is quiet. Yes.

94
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,400
And, and that's not to say there
aren't strong female characters in it,

95
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:31,630
but it was, it was interesting because
they were returning, um, uh, you know,

96
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:35,910
family and father son dynamics are also
a big part of this. Again, as a viewer,

97
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,060
at least I felt. And I'm
curious like, you know,

98
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,690
in the first one it is all about youth
and questionable moral decisions,

99
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:46,510
but adding a family layer
definitely sort of changes that.

100
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,530
Were you at all afraid that it would
adjust like the tone or was it just like,

101
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:51,490
no,
this is actually the way,

102
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:54,700
the best way to display some of
these evolutions of these characters?

103
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,350
Yeah, there's a whole bunch of kids
running around all the way through it.

104
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:59,090
Some of them are, uh, kind of from,

105
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,090
some of them are images of themselves
as children. Some of them are, are,

106
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:06,980
are there children who are
very disappointed in their
fathers and some of whom

107
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:11,530
are imaginary children in one
of the characters cases. Um, um,

108
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,720
and I know obviously it's kind of from,

109
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,290
from a commercial point of view that's
very unattractive because everybody wants

110
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,860
to believe still that there,

111
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,090
like they were in the first film
where they were running around in this

112
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,930
completely care careless world.
But it's,

113
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,590
it's honest about really
where they are and it,

114
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,990
and it was quite interesting that the
four actors all became fathers after that

115
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:35,030
film. Um, the original film,

116
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:37,490
they weren't fathers when we made that
film and they've all become fathers. No.

117
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,240
So it is very much a, uh, like you
said, it's a look at fatherhood in,

118
00:06:42,241 --> 00:06:45,710
in different relationships
with their own children and,

119
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,900
and also with their own fathers in a way.

120
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,900
There's a couple of key scenes
about their own fathers as well.

121
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,180
So that dynamics very
important to it as well,

122
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,360
which doesn't make it sound very
attractive. It makes it turn rather of,

123
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:58,820
I can hear it as I'm saying
it, you think, oh my God,

124
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:01,790
what have they done to train spotting?
But actually it's really,

125
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,150
there's an honesty in it that's
really essential to it really.

126
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,210
And you and you have to find this balance.
When you do a sequel like this,

127
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,210
there's an extraordinary balance
you have to find between,

128
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,480
everybody wants it the same but different.

129
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,940
And it's that kind of
thing where it's got to be,

130
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:18,680
it's got to have these trigger points,

131
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,050
these kind of muscle
memories of the first film.

132
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,460
But also to have any honesty it's got
to be different because they're 46, no,

133
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,410
you know, not 25. Um, so it's
the difference in that really.

134
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,030
Um, one, uh,

135
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,910
one of the things with that is like there
is a good deal of humor in this, right?

136
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,580
It's not like a dark, like we're
making it sound very dark and dramatic,

137
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:40,130
but there were like
there's a ton of humor,

138
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:43,880
but how do you balance like those moments
and how do you make sure that humor is

139
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,880
something that's universal because
there was also a lot of, you know,

140
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:50,900
a lot of it does have to do the UK
culture and the source material,

141
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:53,420
but how do you manage that ship?
Like

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,770
you can't really think like that really.

143
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:57,840
Cause that's very much
a studio perspective.

144
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,220
How can we make sure this humor applies
everywhere and it's deadly. I think,

145
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,900
you know, I mean it's not in terms
of Pixar and things like that,

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,150
you know they do it brilliantly,
but in terms of the stuff I do,

147
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:12,720
it would be deadly if you started to
worry about how's that going to play.

148
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,180
Especially with characters
like this because again,

149
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,660
the first thing you do is start
reducing their accents so they were more

150
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:19,590
comprehensible,

151
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,640
which would be incredibly on truthful
to them as characters because they're

152
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,090
there. Their accents is, it
identifies them in a way.

153
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:31,770
It's a kind of defiant pride in
in how local their culture is,

154
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:36,150
you know, verbally anyway,
and the linguistics that's
in urban while she's books.

155
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:40,200
I like that the book is a challenge to
you from the get goal as soon as you open

156
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:42,810
it, it's like that's a
challenge and can I do it?

157
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,180
And obviously as the way we know
with accents it they unlock.

158
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,100
If your patient,
they unlock very quickly for you,

159
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,820
but you can't compromise that upfront,

160
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,890
which it would be the tendency to do to
make it more palatable or to make sure

161
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:59,100
that it traveled. Really, you
just hope that it will do that.

162
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,320
People will see things in it that they
recognize across cultures, I guess.

163
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,740
I guess aging is a universal
thing across cultures,

164
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:11,410
whether or not we want it to be. It is,
it's in the post for all of us. So it's,

165
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,820
it will be there even though you don't
like acknowledging it sometimes. Um,

166
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,190
but yeah, it's there
for everyone. President,

167
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,670
whether you're president or whether
you're homeless, it's the same applies.

168
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,080
If you could go back 21 years and tell
yourself one thing about where either

169
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:27,300
your journey or where this film's
journey was going to take you,

170
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:32,070
would you take the opportunity and if so,
what would you tell yourself? Oh my God,

171
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,760
that's like those letters that people
write to themselves as younger people.

172
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,580
My God,
I don't know what I'd say really.

173
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:41,790
I've been very lucky really with
the stuff I've done. I mean,

174
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,480
I think I'd probably put more time
in with my kids. Really. I haven't,

175
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,770
because I've been out doing stuff like
this and making films and stuff like that.

176
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,580
So I suppose I'd say look out for that
a bit more really. Cause the kind of,

177
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,290
you can't repeat it back again, but us
as terribly depressing thoughts really.

178
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,670
Um, yeah. Enjoy culture, really.
That, so that's, that's the,

179
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,770
that's the most important thing.
I think it's weird.

180
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:09,450
We were just talking about this before
about, um, someone said, um, what,

181
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,630
so Renton in the film,
I was a terrible crisis.

182
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:16,540
His relationship in Amsterdam
was broken down and that's what,

183
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,050
and what's one of the things that
drives him back and he has nothing.

184
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,250
The relationship has broken down. She's
taken the hose that they were living in.

185
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,900
He has these kind of, well I won't tell
you, but uh, cause that will spoil it.

186
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:31,020
But he's in crisis about,
and this guy says to me,

187
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:33,810
what would you say to a
guy like that who's 46?

188
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,630
He has a line in the film where he says,
I'm 46 and I'm fucked.

189
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,990
And what would you say to a guy like that?
And I was trying to think,

190
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:44,991
what would you say someone like that
and I all you would say is reach for

191
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:49,310
culture really.
Cause it can save you in a way that I,

192
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,060
I've learned over time.
Um, and, and when, and the,

193
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:58,070
and the future that we all face know with
jobs becoming more Ramal or becoming,

194
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,030
you know,
um,

195
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,660
not being there anymore
because of Robert's ization
or mechanization or you just

196
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:09,060
reached for culture, you know,
it'll save you in the end.

197
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,720
That's my own personal philosophy. You
know, it's like, I think you know, you,

198
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,090
why do you read, you read that.
That's what they say, isn't that you,

199
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,690
when you read a novel,
you read to know you're not alone.

200
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,140
That's why we read weirdly,
it's a solitary occupation.

201
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:25,400
But actually you read to know you're not
alone because you recognize things and

202
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:27,780
w and that written the
reach of culture is,

203
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,480
and I know it's a terrible
time at the moment because,

204
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,190
and it certainly is in Britain a way,

205
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:36,960
culture is just sneer that and
kind of disparaged and it's an end.

206
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:38,940
It's not about politics,
culture,

207
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,380
it's actually about something much
more important than everyday politics.

208
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:47,220
It's actually about something deep
that connects people across cultures,

209
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,040
across their individual
cultures and across time.

210
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,070
I think it'd be fair to say
that the world as a whole,

211
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,770
including like the UK and the
US have changed dramatically.

212
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,740
Like politically since you
guys even film the film, right?

213
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:02,590
Like forget since the first one.
But since the production of this film,

214
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,250
we've had a lot of changes
but our horse Brexit,

215
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,240
but is there any part of the film that
took on sort of an additional context for

216
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:13,090
you because of the time that
it was getting released now?

217
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,460
Well, date, they come in and out of
focus. Weirdly, I remember we, we, we, we,

218
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:22,940
we shot the, we shot 28 days later. Um,

219
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,670
w when we, this a horror movie that we
made, we kind of butt and when we shot it,

220
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:31,720
the idea of the film was that it was
about social rage because there've been a

221
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:34,120
number of instances,
which you hear about it occasionally,

222
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,140
but there'd been a particular number of
instances in Britain of people literally

223
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,930
having arguments in,
in,

224
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:44,230
in traffic jams and getting out
and stabbing each other, you know,

225
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:48,640
that kind of incredible intolerant
rage of each other that was happening.

226
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,400
So that was our philosophy for
the film. That was like, wow,

227
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,350
we'll make a film about social rage.

228
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:57,310
And the thing that drives these zombies
was actually a kind of thing tolerance

229
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:59,110
of each other. And that was
our philosophy and everything.

230
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,650
We set it to make the film. We shot
the opening in London in the summer,

231
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,220
you know what he's wondering,
run London on his own and it's empty.

232
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,330
And then we started shooting the main
body of the film in nine 11 happened and

233
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,830
the film came home and the film was
not about social rage, it was a boat,

234
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:18,880
the vulnerability of cities.
It was weird about, and it was,

235
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,130
and it was an a think in
the film was a hit here.

236
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,680
And I absolutely know that
was the reason because it was,

237
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,300
it was the first film out with a block
that dad look up the terror of feeling

238
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:32,590
incredibly vulnerable in these amazing
cities. We build free for ourselves.

239
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,430
And you can't predict that, you know, you
just, there's no way you'll know that.

240
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,830
So sometimes they swim in
and out of focus really.

241
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:40,660
And you can't say what there'll be,

242
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:45,661
they take so long to make the bone not
to be applicable to daily politics.

243
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,060
I mean, otherwise you'd make
documentaries and make them very,

244
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:53,080
very quickly and get them out. Like
John Lennon used to say, you read,

245
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,890
sing the song in the morning and have it
on the streets in the afternoon. But um,

246
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,530
otherwise they're never
going to be up to date.

247
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,310
But you do read things into them for sure.
And um,

248
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,640
I don't know what you'd reading to this
one about Brexit and about Trump or

249
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,040
anything like that.
I just don't know.

250
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:13,030
Maybe people will see things in them
that has some kind of resonance on that

251
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:13,420
level,

252
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,110
spoil anything.

253
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,090
I feel like just because there were
a couple of months where I was like,

254
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,530
oh okay that's,
that's something that,

255
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,630
I don't know if that was
the filmmaker's intention,

256
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:21,960
but it for me where I live and you know,

257
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,480
the climate I live in that had a different
meaning that I think it might have

258
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,540
originally,

259
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,230
well we were shooting,

260
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,770
we were shooting when the Brexit
vote happened and there is a kind of,

261
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,010
there's a plot elements in it to do with
the European Union, but we kind of get,

262
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,950
we couldn't get her hedge run them
or ramifications of it. So we,

263
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,730
we just shot it anyway.
And it,

264
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,440
and it's in the film as a as
it is at the moment though,

265
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:45,980
we still don't know what will actually
happen with Britain and Europe fully.

266
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,250
Although it looks like Brexit will
happen. Yeah. And if it does happen,

267
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:52,780
Scotland will almost certainly go.
That seems very clear cause,

268
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,420
well although we were shooting there
at the time and it wasn't, it was an,

269
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,330
it was a vote to leave the European Union.
Uh,

270
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,000
Scotland voted 62% to stay in.

271
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,350
So Scotland will break away from the
United Kingdom and stay in Europe.

272
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,500
The Scots don't like the English anyway.
They never have done,

273
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,260
not since 17 or seven when
they were bonded together.

274
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,710
So the opportunity to finally get
away from them, they, they'll,

275
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,540
they'll palliate to the French. What's
more than the English anyway, the Scots,

276
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,050
they are always known for that.
That's called the old alliance,

277
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:22,850
the relationship of Scotland and France.

278
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,620
It is interesting how like the
first film just took on this,

279
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:29,850
like it became this purely Scott like
a Scottish thing, right? It's, it's,

280
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,030
is it interesting for you not being
Scottish first of all to be at the helm of

281
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:37,050
that and to see the second one
given that timing come out,

282
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:40,320
like reignite that sort of like, yeah.
Scotland pry like and you're like,

283
00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:41,890
am I going to be responsible for this?

284
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,860
It is interesting working in Scotland.
I, I did enjoy it. They are tough.

285
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,780
They don't suffer fools gladly.

286
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,060
There's no kind of Hollywood welcome
of kind of light, you know, um,

287
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,460
and you and you and you have to earn your
right to be there really to work there.

288
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,750
Especially in film terms. I felt that
very strongly in making the first film.

289
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,380
And I'm, I'm not, I'm not a nor what
I claim to be an honorary Scott,

290
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,780
I'm far to a county to ever say that.
My background is,

291
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:13,490
I actually Irish,
I come from Manchester,

292
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:17,130
return in the northwest or an industrial
town in the northwest of England and uh,

293
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,170
my heritage is all Irish really.
So maybe that was why they accepted me,

294
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,120
you know. Anyway, we did W it's Joanie
that he deploys to more than anything.

295
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:29,150
I say Johnny Lee Miller, who's one of
the four guys, cause he's not Scottish.

296
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:33,220
And um, when we made the
first film, he adapted,

297
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,280
he did that method thing where he just
adapted the Scottish accent in his daily

298
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:41,210
life as well.
And I remember Kelly MacDonald who with,

299
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:45,850
she was really upset when we
stop filming because he, he,

300
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,783
they were,

301
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,150
we were having a party afterwards and
he was talking and he's natural accent.

302
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,400
She was really upset that he'd lied
to her all the way through, you know,

303
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,320
and she was really genuinely very upset
about it. She still talks about it.

304
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:04,310
Didn't know cause she'd been completely
taken in by him. Um, as a, as an, as a,

305
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:06,430
as a a fake Scott really.

306
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,450
So that's like the highest
compliment is an actor.

307
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,800
I assume I was like got a doctor,
but you still have to deal with her upset

308
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,340
you and you and Johnny work together.

309
00:17:17,341 --> 00:17:22,020
It like super recently to write on
Frankenstein Frankenstein. Yes, yes.

310
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,240
Yeah.
Is it,

311
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:26,750
is it sort of interesting shifting mediums
like that and like coming back to not

312
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:29,270
only film with him but something that,
you know,

313
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,040
he and the rest of the cast had
been with so long ago? Yes. Yes. It

314
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,220
was extraordinary.
Like,

315
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:40,540
what are the key jobs as a director of
a large part of your job as a director

316
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,660
with actors is that they're often very,
eh,

317
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,080
they're like on eggshells at
the beginning. They bit careful,

318
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,200
a bit wary of doing too,
too soon until they find their feet and,

319
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,480
and understand what the
process is and how that,

320
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,300
how close they are to the
character and stuff like that.

321
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,320
And part of your job as a
director is to encourage them, um,

322
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,460
over that chasm of confidence
really to get them to step forward.

323
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,370
Especially because I quite
like big performances.

324
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:12,060
I'm not a kind of mumble core
kind of salt, social realist,

325
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:15,300
kind of just do nothing with the lines,
just let the camera do everything.

326
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,290
I quite like performance. Um,
but on this it was the opposite.

327
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,200
They had that built in to them cause they,

328
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,880
they'd obviously been in the first movie,

329
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:28,881
it had done very well for everyone and
they personally felt absolutely in charge

330
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:34,260
of that character and they were very
clear about what that character would and

331
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:35,570
wouldn't do.
You know they had a,

332
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,400
they knew him even though they hadn't
done him for 20 years. So that was weird.

333
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,000
They,
they um,

334
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,650
you had to step up as a crew and as
a director you have to lift yourself

335
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,370
straight away cause they were,
they were at 100% straight away,

336
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:53,230
which is unusual on a film.
You know normally your

337
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,720
pussyfooting around for
the first few days really.

338
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,990
And you can often see that in a film,
which is obviously done out of order,

339
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,360
but you can often see the
films that aren't quite,

340
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,530
and they're often the first days of
filming where people are not sure of what,

341
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:09,300
what they're doing. But there was none
of that. No, they were fully ready to go.

342
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,950
What was the first thing
you guys feel forward?

343
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,200
The foreseen we thought first thing.
So when people watch it again,

344
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,910
there's a scene under a pub with Begbie
comes back and see sick boy for the

345
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:21,140
first time.
Is that,

346
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,480
so that's the Robert Carlisle character
and the Johnny Lee Miller character.

347
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,950
And they got under the seller of the pub
and, and the, where there is adult farm,

348
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:34,130
cause he's doing a bit of cultivating
on the quiet sick boy and they have this

349
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:36,900
discussion about taking
revenge or Renton together.

350
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,690
And you'll see that's
the first scene we shot.

351
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:44,810
And the crew was shocked at how big
the scene wall straight away like,

352
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,820
um, and we all had to
lift our game from there.

353
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,420
Know, speaking of drugs. Um,

354
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,350
so again,

355
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:57,920
the world has changed a great deal since
and I don't know of heroin and heroin

356
00:19:57,921 --> 00:19:58,400
use,

357
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,790
even drug use aside from maybe like the
fight over here at least over like is

358
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:06,230
should marijuana be legal? Like I feel
like it has taken sort of a back seat.

359
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,800
And you guys do address a little bit
about like the other ways people distract

360
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,700
ourselves if it's digital, if
it's, you know, running. Um, but,

361
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,690
but was there ever a temptation to
sort of update more of the story to be

362
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:21,110
involved more of these like
other distractions that
people are more engaged in?

363
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,940
No, the, I mean there is a
big speech about it. Um, he,

364
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,410
he does have a choose life speech,

365
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:31,550
which is because of an update really
have is what was quite a famous speech

366
00:20:31,551 --> 00:20:35,000
about, you know, the choices that society
offers and eat. There is an update.

367
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:38,820
I think you guys are mentioned
in its one point. Yep.

368
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,210
That's probably,
again,

369
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,110
it's one of those objective viewer
things where you're like, um,

370
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,700
all the different choices that
are available, social media, no,

371
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:52,320
et cetera along like that. But actually
the speech is really about, it's,

372
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,000
it's actually a confession
in the end that um,

373
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,460
he hasn't made good choices really it
becomes a confession by the end of it.

374
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,230
Um, no, I, and I think like
the drug use thing there,

375
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,140
there are some drugs in
the film, but again, it's
appropriate to 46 year old guys.

376
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,810
So there's a lot more viagara
in the film. Then there is, um,

377
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:17,020
some of the other drugs of choice in
the, in, in the first film. So in fact,

378
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:20,800
Begbie takes so much Viagra.
At one point, he medically,

379
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:25,320
his heart would explode, but it doesn't
fortunately for the film. But um, you,

380
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,170
you have to see that to see what
happens. What does it explode? Yeah.

381
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,580
Is that the type of thing you have
to do research and before like, okay,

382
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,750
he can take this many people.

383
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,570
Well then you get an Edison cope
together and taking lots of Viagra pills.

384
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:42,180
So it's eight s fake. It's not
fake by I grew, but it's um,

385
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,500
Viagara from China rather than correct.
[inaudible] street.

386
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,550
[inaudible] street via
ground. Um, so what do you,

387
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,490
what do you think the role of

388
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,170
failure is?

389
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,800
Because these are characters who failed
time and time again and they keep going.

390
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,110
And I don't know, like I, I'm sure we all
are. We're humans. We experienced failure,

391
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:07,450
right? And it's, it's either
internalized and like, Hey,

392
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,150
I think this is a failure when
really it's people could be like,

393
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:11,560
this is a smashing success.

394
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,160
So what do you think like that role
plays either in the characters,

395
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,960
in film making in life?

396
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,260
The film is as characters,
they are failures,

397
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,110
absolute failures.
I mean in the first film,

398
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:30,370
the only success in the first film is
that he steals the money off his friends,

399
00:22:30,371 --> 00:22:35,140
which is, can hardly be looked
at as trial color. Um, so it's,

400
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,910
it's saturated with failure really.

401
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,650
But film is odd and especially film
that has a sense of humor and a kind of

402
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:45,010
independence of spirit.
It doesn't come across like that does it?

403
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:48,490
You don't think when you leave the other
film, Wow. Their failures aren't they?

404
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,910
If anything, you kind of like
think they're cool, you're
rooting for them. Yeah.

405
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,230
But he's like morally reprehensible,
but also they were attractive as well,

406
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,950
even though they are morally reprehensible
and it carries on into this film as

407
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:01,930
well, I think is that, you know,

408
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:05,470
they're not until spot or something
right at the end of the film,

409
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:10,180
which is truly transformational in a
way that you'd never expected on thing.

410
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,800
What they amount to his failures,
you know? Um, but again,

411
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,630
film has that weird thing of elevating
people and it's why we cut the duck.

412
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,400
The scene we were talking about earlier
about this Diane scene that we caught.

413
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,290
We caught it because it made her
ironically made her look like a failure.

414
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,950
No matter how we played it or cut it,
it made her look like a failure,

415
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,560
which is completely wrong,
you know?

416
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,730
And yet that's because
you're following Renton,

417
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:39,610
you're emotionally empathizing with
rents and really with presumably without

418
00:23:39,611 --> 00:23:42,740
fully understanding the crisis is in,
you know,

419
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,350
it is very film does mythologize people.

420
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,510
And it was one of the
interesting things about,

421
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,950
about doing this film and explained it
to the actors before we started that we

422
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:56,600
were going to unlock that image people
had of them in the first film because

423
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,340
film is extraordinary. It
is. Film is time, isn't it?

424
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,080
When you edit film, it's all you're doing
is extending time or compressing it.

425
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,840
That's what you do with editing.
It's just that the whole time.

426
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,280
And you have this additional
power where you can freeze time.

427
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,980
And I think we do that in
movies. We have, uh, you know,

428
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:17,790
especially our favorite movies.
We have an image, you know,

429
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:22,791
a mind of an actor in a path like
boomer Thurman in pulp fiction,

430
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,900
you just have an Emmy
or John Travolta report,

431
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,820
you just have an image of them
when you just freeze it in time.

432
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,300
And I said to the actors, that was one of
the things we were going to try and do.

433
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,180
It was on lock that, that, that,
that frozen moment with them. Um,

434
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,190
which would be very cruel on them
and it is very cruel, you know,

435
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:43,130
when you see them in the, in the
way you remember them, the skinny,

436
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:48,131
cool guy who smears everything and here's
the update right next to each other

437
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:49,630
like that, you know. Um,

438
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:54,260
and it is extraordinary like that
film that it can do that, um, as an,

439
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,430
as an art form it.

440
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,450
But I don't think there is another art
form that gets at this anywhere close to

441
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:02,480
having that connection with
time like film does, you know,

442
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,810
how do you achieve something like that?
Do you talking about that,

443
00:25:06,811 --> 00:25:09,630
like that particular scene where you're
bringing back basically the ghosts of

444
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,750
the versions of them passed. Like, do you
have someone on set? Who's the standing?

445
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,610
Do you show them that scene beforehand?

446
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,310
Do you wait and not show them
that scene until afterwards?

447
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,110
Some of it was still enough towards,

448
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,970
I had warned them that
we were going to do it,

449
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:25,080
but it's done afterwards in a in
effect. I mean you used tricks, you,

450
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:26,430
you can have stunned ins too.

451
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,700
We cast a lot of young guys who
look like them in the first film,

452
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:34,910
including one young guy who'd
been tormented throughout
his school life because

453
00:25:35,251 --> 00:25:39,420
he looked just like you and McGregor
in trainspotting and he'd grown up with

454
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:42,660
this. Everybody teased him about
it and finally got his own bike.

455
00:25:42,661 --> 00:25:47,070
He got to be Ewan Mcgregor. And that
was bizarre. You and seeing him,

456
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,380
you know,
for the first time we ever met him,

457
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:53,190
cause he was dressed as you and walls
in the first film and then you meet this

458
00:25:53,191 --> 00:25:58,010
kind of doppelganger like, um, what's the
great kids? Lawsky Phil is a great kiss.

459
00:25:58,011 --> 00:26:01,890
Lawsky filled the boat. The double double
life of Veranique is a wonderful film.

460
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,910
Um, you get to meet you. That's
what they say, isn't there?

461
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,650
There's a double of you
somewhere in the world out there.

462
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:11,190
There is an absolute double if you do.
But statistically I think that's true,

463
00:26:11,191 --> 00:26:12,024
isn't it?

464
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,390
Kind of the number of statistical chances
of there being someone there is there

465
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:18,810
will be somebody out there who you would,
if you met them they would be,

466
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,850
it would be like meeting a mirror anyway.

467
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,060
That was weird for the axiom that you use.
Sometimes you use a double,

468
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,450
sometimes you use footage
from the original film. Um,

469
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,220
yeah, we, we didn't use it.
They've changed so much.

470
00:26:32,221 --> 00:26:35,880
You can't use them as they're on the
stand ins at all under any circumstances,

471
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:38,910
you know, cause they really do look,
it is very honest about the film,

472
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:40,710
about what they look like. No. Okay.

473
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,010
Uh, did you experience it all like a sense
of Deja Vu because you shot in some of

474
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:44,821
the same places?

475
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:48,450
Obviously you're dealing with the same
characters and actors or was it like,

476
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:49,800
nope,
this is just a new experience?

477
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,870
The, the, the, the most acute moment
was when we went to [inaudible],

478
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,370
which was this countryside place in the
first film as if a speech where he says

479
00:26:57,371 --> 00:27:01,540
it's shite being Scottish and they go
out to the countryside for 10 minutes and

480
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:04,690
they hate it, you know, and they decided
to go back and take drugs instead.

481
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:10,180
There is a new scene out there again and
we went out there and it is obviously

482
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,880
exactly the same until the moments in,

483
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:17,020
of course these people passing in front
of it or like a fly just moving across

484
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:18,700
it later.
But that's 20 years to the moment.

485
00:27:18,701 --> 00:27:23,010
And it's just like a movement like that
that brings you down to earth. Yeah.

486
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:25,630
Ce Mark.
So that's a kind of put and it is a very,

487
00:27:25,631 --> 00:27:28,190
very important moment in
the film where they, um,

488
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:33,280
there was a reckoning moment there
really where they, uh, some of Tommy who,

489
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,850
who did, he went out to the
countryside with who died of
his, uh, his addiction. Um,

490
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,650
there's a reckoning about that in the
film as well. Yeah. At that moment,

491
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,210
I would like to know who inspires you
as a director. As a director? Yeah.

492
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,530
Where's the human? But mostly as
a director it's like different.

493
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:55,840
I like that young. I did you, did
you see don't breathe horror movie.

494
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:00,350
I thought it was so I remember watching
that as it director. You watch some time,

495
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,780
do you think arc?
You know,

496
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:06,610
he could really direct like I
thought that was really good. Um,

497
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,780
what's he called? Fetty? [inaudible].
Alvaraz is, I think he's called.

498
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,890
I remember thinking that. So sorry. That's
just jealousy. That's not inspiring.

499
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,740
Um, no, I, I, I'm one of your low, I mean,

500
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:25,420
coupler is one of my big,
huge inspirations, you know,

501
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,330
and not just as a, from everything
I've read about it. I mean,

502
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,690
I met him once actually, I was like,
it's terrible. Meeting your heroes.

503
00:28:31,691 --> 00:28:34,480
I was Jelly, absolute jelly. I mean,

504
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:38,020
I'm a grown man and I was just
shaking meeting Francis Ford Coppola,

505
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,470
who's just like, who doesn't really
care, but everybody's like that with him,

506
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:46,420
I think. Um, so that was quite special.
But everything I read about him, um,

507
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:51,700
also confirms what special person is and
I think he's work is certainly from one

508
00:28:51,701 --> 00:28:54,730
particular period is as good
as it gets. Really. You know,

509
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,540
that's a big thing for me and another
British director who's also a very,

510
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:01,000
very fine mum is very and very elderly.

511
00:29:01,001 --> 00:29:04,090
No Nicholas Roeg there they're
big inspirations for me.

512
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:06,010
But on a personal directing level,
yeah.

513
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,880
Do you find it challenging
watching other people's work? Um,

514
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,670
like do you or do you find that you're
able to disconnect or is it watching it

515
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:14,220
and just being like, oh, I want to do
that. And why did he get to do that first?

516
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,700
I'm very good and very good at shit
unless it's terrible when you do start to

517
00:29:19,701 --> 00:29:23,060
take it apart and I don't
take stuff apart at all.

518
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,230
I kind of get lost in it
and kind of cry and um,

519
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,130
it molts and shouting dog breathe.
I was shouting,

520
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:35,360
there were like 20 of us in the audience
in London watching it in this cinema in

521
00:29:35,361 --> 00:29:38,930
Stratford just, and we were shouting
and screaming at the, you know,

522
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,090
which you don't hear a lot in England.
It's kind,

523
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,430
you do get that a bit more here
in cinemas here. I like that.

524
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,290
When an audience is a molt like
that start show 10 but you don't,

525
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:52,150
everybody sits in a respectful silence
in England. Um, but uh, yeah, no,

526
00:29:52,151 --> 00:29:56,260
I'm more like, I, so I don't
take it apart. No, I didn't.
I tend to get lost in it.

527
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,230
Really. I was, I'm very
grateful. I do really. And um,

528
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,060
especially on planes,
I was reading it,

529
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,340
but someone saying why
we cry on planes g I,

530
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,800
I do cry at movies more on planes.
The non earth.

531
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,500
I've heard, I'm not kidding. I've
heard it's like the elevation.

532
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:16,180
Something about that that makes the
tear ducts Ron Moore, the pressure,

533
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,710
the pressure to do with pressure.

534
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:24,570
Keira Knightley movie and I'm crying.
He's like, wait, they said no,

535
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,530
but could be wanting to be a Rockstar,
but I'm crying anyway.

536
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,600
Um, so you've covered a lot of Sigmadek
grounds since the first one. Uh,

537
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,980
you've gotten to the slums of India,
the canyons of Utah.

538
00:30:38,981 --> 00:30:42,900
You've got to silicon valley,
a fracking site, lab space. Uh,

539
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,860
what's something you've haven't
done yet that you would like to

540
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,290
musical? Oh, really? Oh yeah, no,
that is, I think for any director.

541
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,560
Um,
that's the one that's the grail,

542
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:57,210
the holy grail that you'll, you'll,
you'll probably never get to.

543
00:30:57,211 --> 00:30:59,880
And if you do get to,
it probably won't work,

544
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:03,600
but I'm a modern,
um,

545
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,310
original musical is virtually
impossible to pull off. You know,

546
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,740
obviously there's been more
very recently that did work,

547
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,590
but the [inaudible] to get
your characters to sing,

548
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,840
to actually just start moment of singing.
That's the kind of terror moment.

549
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:22,130
Can you do that? Um, so I,

550
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,870
I still trying to do that in a way

551
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:29,950
it's going to say there's very good key
musical moment in this film that was

552
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:31,840
like fascinating to watch him,
just to give them,

553
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:35,840
they're like the stakes of
the circumstances. They were
in a good scene. Yeah. Um,

554
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,770
so, so a little bit, you can
do it a little bit of singing,

555
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,810
a little bit of singing,

556
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,900
your move isn't a bit of dancing
and all that kind of stuff. So, um,

557
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,580
but it's the original concept. But we,
we, we did a kids film called millions,

558
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:49,890
which is a lovely little
film about two boys.

559
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,300
You find a sack of money and
it changes their lives. And um,

560
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,940
and that was originally meant
to be a musical and we were,

561
00:31:56,941 --> 00:32:01,320
we had this idea that we
get Noel Gallagher to write
the songs for these kids

562
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:04,620
because it was sat in Manchester
where no comes from as well.

563
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,050
And we kind of check into away from it.

564
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,720
You need a lot of
confidence to pull it off.

565
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:12,990
And we were just seem to lack it in
that moment and we made it as a straight

566
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:16,440
film and it's a lovely film. I'm
very proud of it. But um, yeah,

567
00:32:16,441 --> 00:32:18,870
it should have been a musical cause those
kids could have saying then you'd have

568
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:23,220
never questioned why they were singing
or you'd have loved them singing,

569
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:24,480
you know.
Anyway,

570
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,820
I mean there is this sort of
trend of like taking films,

571
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:30,510
adapting them for the stage and then
putting them back as a musical film,

572
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:36,180
maybe millions musical. Oh, I said, okay,

573
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,140
I'm going to take that as a no.

574
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,340
Are there any genres that
you like don't necessarily

575
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,950
have like an inherent
interest in directing,

576
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:46,640
like westerns or animated films or is
it everything just like the world's your

577
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:49,470
oyster? I tried to do
an animated film, uh,

578
00:32:49,471 --> 00:32:52,610
an adaptation of a Terry Pratchett
book called the Barometer Yard.

579
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,230
There's your first problem,
Terry Pratchett. It's so
hard to, yes, very difficult,

580
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,890
but God bless him. And
um, and we would, we,

581
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,030
me and the writer of the millions
scripts actually frank cultural voice,

582
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:07,580
we set it up at dreamworks and we were
warned all the time about how long it was

583
00:33:07,581 --> 00:33:09,110
going to take.
And uh,

584
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:14,090
and we backed out of it in the end cause
it really was you, it's all very well.

585
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:16,040
Somebody saying seven more years,

586
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:20,720
seven years like that to you and you just
kind of go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

587
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,780
And then you got closer and you
realize it is going to be seven years.

588
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,410
And so we backed off it as well. It's
a lovely scratch. There's a little bit,

589
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,680
I don't know whether it'll ever
see the light of day. So, um,

590
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,400
so I think my last question is,
uh,

591
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,880
what's just one thing you'd like
people to take away from this stuff?

592
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,790
You have to distill it down.
I think it's the, it's what,

593
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,220
so as we did the film does it kind of,
one of the weird,

594
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:47,120
one of the weird things about
getting older, the one of the,

595
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:52,070
the few compensations about
getting older is the um,

596
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,853
um,

597
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,150
I said Kingsley Amos said that the only
conversation we're getting older is that

598
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:01,010
at least you know what's
funny and what isn't.

599
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,330
I don't know whether that's true or not,

600
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,820
but one of the few conversations
phoned about age is that you,

601
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,970
you have this weird recognition
that time is not a straight line,

602
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,910
that there's a kind of
loop in it somewhere.

603
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,050
And there is a section of the film and
it's to do with spot at the end of the

604
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:21,830
film.
And he begins to recognize his voice,

605
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:26,010
which in the original movie and an India
original stories of what's in his whole

606
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:26,930
plus character,

607
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,250
utterly chaotic and hapless
and nothing ever goes for him.

608
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:35,000
He's the ultimate addicts in a way,
on and off and on and off and on.

609
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:38,470
It's somehow he's just to survive.
But he finds his voice really.

610
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,530
And I think that something that I
believe in personally very deeply,

611
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:43,790
and it's a new Irving's work,

612
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,860
is that no matter how impossible it seems
for that person to have an important

613
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:50,960
voice,
every voice is important.

614
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:56,000
And that seems impossible
thing to impossibly platitude
in his thing to say in

615
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:59,810
the modern world where life
is so complicated. But if
you lose sight of that,

616
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,240
you're lost. I think, you know,

617
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:07,070
because you have to believe that all those
[inaudible] and it's just how they'll

618
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:09,160
find the value in their
voice that's all in.

619
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,870
And he finds the value in his voice
and it leads to a loop where you,

620
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,170
you start sort of experiencing
the first film again, um, in,

621
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:21,290
in the second film, and they loop back
on each other. And, uh, I love that.

622
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:23,060
I don't know whether people
will get that from the movie,

623
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:26,540
but they'll probably just have a good
time watching you and Greg and make a fool

624
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,480
of himself or, you know,
stuff like that. But, um,

625
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,940
that's very important to me
in the film. Yeah. Cool. Well,

626
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,280
thank you so much for joining
us today. Cool. Thank you.

627
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,700
That's fine. It was a good, good time.
