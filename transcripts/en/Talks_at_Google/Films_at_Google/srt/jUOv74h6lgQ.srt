1
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,860
And I have the pleasure of welcoming
Alex [inaudible] who is the director of

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,160
lipstick under my burger.
I'm very excited.

3
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:19,630
I've read a ton of articles about it.
I'm looking forward to seeing the movie.

4
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:21,130
She's promising to send me a link.

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,050
So I'm definitely looking forward
to seeing the movie. I'm just,

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,830
we're just going to have a dialogue
honestly and Alan Crita is gonna, uh,

7
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:31,690
answer just a few questions and
talk a little bit about the movie,

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,490
but we will give an opportunity at the
end for you guys to ask any questions as

9
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:40,670
well. Perfect. So hello,
welcome to Google. Hello.

10
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:43,370
I'm be happy to be here. Is this
your first time here? It is.

11
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,910
Zen.
It's such an amazing gamblers.

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,670
Yes,

13
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,850
you'll have to get coffee and free snacks
and all of those good things before

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,190
you do that. So first of all, I,

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,910
I definitely,
we were just chatting.

16
00:00:56,911 --> 00:01:01,410
I want to extend definitely thoughts
and prayers to your family and your

17
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:05,850
community in Mumbai, India, they're
dealing with floods justice in Houston.

18
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:09,000
So definitely wanted to extend our
thoughts and prayers to your community.

19
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,620
Absolutely.

20
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,890
So I have been reading a ton of articles
and there's been so much Christ around,

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,820
uh, this awesome movie. But I would
love to just hear in your words,

22
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,240
what is this movie about?

23
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,830
White Lipstick Gunderman
burqas essentially film
about for a small down women

24
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:34,741
who lead these secrets do alliance and
they sort of searching for freedom.

25
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:39,210
So it's set in one sort of
ramshackle building, uh,

26
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,670
in this moment on all four
of them of different ages
and they're sort of, um, uh,

27
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,050
living there and they're
trying to rebel in.

28
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,040
I'm very small sort of visa and
the tried to fulfill their dreams.

29
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,630
So that's what it's about.

30
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,430
That's awesome. So I'm very intrigued
by the title lipstick under my Barca.

31
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,040
Talk about that a little bit.
Where was that inspiration from?

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,790
Lipstick on mine will come actually
the, um, uh, the title and, um,

33
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,610
the idea of the firm that
emerged at the same time.

34
00:02:09,611 --> 00:02:14,380
So it wasn't like I am part of the data
leader and for me it's a metaphoric

35
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:17,470
title because it really
means that, uh, um, you know,

36
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:22,471
women have this while seating
desire to be free and begin sort of,

37
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:26,440
um, I mean sometimes
even if we feel that, um,

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,600
society is sort of bound
them into southern drawl,

39
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:31,600
let me think that they're not
dreaming of anything more.

40
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:32,550
The truth is that they are,

41
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,610
so they have like hidden desires and
wheel dreams and uh, yeah. So it's,

42
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,290
it's just that you can't stop women or
no matter what, you don't know what,

43
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,380
how many restrictions there are.

44
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:44,260
They always going to want
to like spread their wings.

45
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,420
Awesome.

46
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,420
So we were talking a little bit about the
letter you received when the movie was

47
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,700
practically not released or band in India.

48
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,590
Can you talk to us about just kind of
the verbiage and what was the meaning

49
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,980
around the banning

50
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,560
of this movie? So I know in
Indiana as a system of, um,

51
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,650
certification.

52
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,370
So if you have to have your film shown
in theaters and then you have to go to

53
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:12,250
this government body,

54
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,940
which is a definite with a sense of what
though it's not technically called that.

55
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,190
So at the end of December,

56
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:21,010
last year after the film had
started traveling to festivals,

57
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:25,640
we thought we should try to figure out
the India theatrical release and, um,

58
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,060
we'd ride for the census
certificate and, uh, the, uh,

59
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,040
the board. And what they did was they
decided to, um, not certify the film.

60
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,900
So we had two screenings and both times,
you know,

61
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,950
and it took many months and they refuse
to certify the film on the grounds that,

62
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,004
um,

63
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,840
and the fitness lady oriented and
fantasy above life and all of that.

64
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:54,350
So basically the whole idea was that
they wanted to stifle the filmmakers aids

65
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,160
made true mom may strongly
female point of view.

66
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,640
And it tells the stories of women and
then wanting to have agency over their own

67
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:06,910
lives and their bodies

68
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,340
in a way that I think they felt was a
threat to the patriarchal sort of order.

69
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,510
And I do feel that, um, that
sense of order of India, uh,

70
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,690
you know,
bypassing is kind of a decision.

71
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:22,870
They were functioning in a way that
they really wanted to sort of perpetuate

72
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,200
patriarchy because the popular
culture in India is completely molded,

73
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,110
uh, you know, by the
male gaze. And, um, uh,

74
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,240
the typical like Bollywood sort of trope
is to have item songs and women who,

75
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,110
uh, you know, very peripheral parts
for women. And even if you see women,

76
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:45,400
they like virginal and PR
or they're like Vampish,

77
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,680
um,
or they're like mottos,

78
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,490
but very little space for
real and ordinary women or
they're just like objects

79
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,110
of desire for mail fulfillment.

80
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:58,120
So it's just a very convenient sort of
way in which women have been portrayed

81
00:04:58,121 --> 00:04:58,954
over the decades.

82
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,020
And of course that has to do with the
fact that storytelling is completely been

83
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:05,860
controlled by men forever. So, uh,

84
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,920
and I think like us Indian societies
also completely conditioned to consume

85
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:12,790
popular culture through the eyes of men.

86
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,720
So everybody celebrates the
objectification of women
without even thinking twice

87
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,600
about we know what is it that they're
watching and they're loving and they're

88
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:22,840
dancing to, um, which is fine as long as,

89
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,630
as it leased space for an
alternative point of view.

90
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,170
But I think what the censor board was
trying to do was to stifle any kind of

91
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:33,770
alternative point of view. So
in effect, they were saying
that, uh, you know, for a,

92
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,260
this Indian citizens, the only kind
of culture they should consume,

93
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,070
um, should be a culture that
perpetuates male domination.

94
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,540
And I think that is really,
really low wrong. And I
thought it was very important,

95
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,240
uh, for us to call them out on
this decision that the mean, uh,

96
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,260
which is why I decided that, you
know, whatever happens, you know,

97
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:59,350
we must release the film
and the producer of the Fed,

98
00:05:59,351 --> 00:06:02,870
Mr Brick Isiah and the production company
are very, very clear that, you know,

99
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,380
whatever we have to do, we're going to do
when we couldn't get the film out. And,

100
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:09,940
um, so finally then we, uh,
when all this happened, um,

101
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,470
it was like we went through a process,

102
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:17,471
we actually went to a judicial body and
it took quite a few weeks and you know,

103
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,960
having hearings and
lawyers and this and that.

104
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:25,960
And finally the decision was reversed.
And after long, yeah. Battle.

105
00:06:25,961 --> 00:06:30,170
So we applied for the certification at
the end of December. I got it in June,

106
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,730
uh, this year. And, uh, the
film released in India in July.

107
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,020
And just to put it in context,

108
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,860
normally this procedure takes about
three to four days. Wow. And it took me,

109
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:42,710
so how long does it normally take?

110
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,700
So what has been the response in India
since the release of the movie? Uh,

111
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,970
it's been very, very interesting.
It's been, um, uh, and actually the,

112
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:56,150
the thing is that because of the
most traveling to various countries,

113
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:56,871
because of like,

114
00:06:56,871 --> 00:07:00,920
it was participating in various film
festivals since October last year and then

115
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,240
this bad thing happened.

116
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,280
So I think there was a lot of
conversation in the media about, um,

117
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,710
and on social media about
the fact that, uh, you know,

118
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,150
audiences and other countries are able
to access the foam but not Indians

119
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:16,850
themselves.
So there was a lot of buildup in fact,

120
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:21,630
when the release actually happened. And
I think people had all kinds of, uh, uh,

121
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,770
ideas and expectations from the film.
So we've,

122
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,400
I was quite anxious about the release,
but it's been really,

123
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:32,180
really interesting that the people
are really, uh, uh, embrace the film.

124
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:35,300
The film did really well, but I, I mean,
it's not just in terms of numbers with,

125
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,090
I think what the numbers represent is
the fact that they've actually so many

126
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,960
people who made the effort to go for a
film like this, which is a independent,

127
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,660
which is an independent film about women.

128
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:48,440
They actually went to the theater to see
it and lots and lots of men also went

129
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,251
to watch the film.

130
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:54,251
And I think a while the reactions of
most women were the reactions I got from

131
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:55,760
many,
many women who is very,

132
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:59,450
very new thing in terms of how they felt
like their stories have been told. And,

133
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:00,531
uh,
you know,

134
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:03,770
there's the stories of their mothers and
their sisters and their daughters and

135
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:07,010
their friends.
It felt very represented in that sense.

136
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,260
But I think for the men, it was like
some men really felt I was a sort of,

137
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,090
for the first time they've thought about
women like that and they've never, uh,

138
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,090
uh, uh, I mean there's just
haven't given it a second thought.

139
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:23,360
And they were way more
interesting experiences that
people report it. Like, uh,

140
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:23,601
you know,

141
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:26,570
some young men who went to watch the
film thinking it's just going to be a sex

142
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:30,140
fest. And then, uh, you know,

143
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,540
start to feel a little
irritated to begin with.

144
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,960
And then started understanding the
film and then got drawn into the film.

145
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,930
And then like this boy,
one of the boys wrote to me and was like,

146
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,120
he was the first person in the head over
up to start clapping when the Filbert

147
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,260
over, which was a very like, common
reaction that happened with a film.

148
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,830
Like the film would get over and
people would just get up and like start

149
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:51,890
clapping and all of that.
So I think very interesting.

150
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:53,100
And some men who went to see the film,

151
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:54,650
somebody asks him what
for them to go and see.

152
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:58,350
And they would not name lipstick and
America. They would be like, uh, you know,

153
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:00,670
we want to see like something done called,
it would be like,

154
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,010
where's he's a motherfucker. So it,
it's been very, very, um, interesting.

155
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:09,990
But I do think that, uh, um, you
know, from the standpoint of, um,

156
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,180
um, women's, um, uh, I mean the
rights for women do like of,

157
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,780
of women to be able to express themselves
in a country like India where there is

158
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:23,781
so much violence against women and so
much discrimination against women and we

159
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:29,360
have a popular culture that keeps
perpetuating this vicious cycle. Um,

160
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,520
I think the fact that lipstick and my
bill can actually reason theaters as a

161
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:35,970
huge victory because I
really did feel that, uh,

162
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,210
if he had not been able to release it,
it would be like,

163
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:43,020
we are seeing that it's okay, uh, for,

164
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,380
uh,
you know,

165
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,440
the sense of what to actually
muscle like 50% of the population.

166
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,610
You're saying that we should
get the voices of women.
So I did feel that there's,

167
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,600
Denise was not just about
a film releasing, but the
idea that well, you know,

168
00:09:57,601 --> 00:10:01,560
if, uh, India is a country
where, uh, you know,

169
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:04,140
we are promised equality of gender,

170
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:09,530
then definitely women should be as free
to be able to tell their stories and

171
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:10,540
share their experiences.

172
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,130
Particularly in the context of a
country like India where there is, I've,

173
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,960
I mean there is such a huge disparity
between rights and opportunities between

174
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,333
men and women.

175
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,300
So when I, when I be reflecting on
the things that I've been reading,

176
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:26,760
it's really been like
stories of liberation, right?

177
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,440
And all women can really relate to that
front, whether black, white, Indian,

178
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:33,510
any racial or ethnic background.

179
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,380
What gave you the courage
to sort of tell this story,

180
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:41,730
which is really in conflict of
what the normal story quote,

181
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:45,780
normal story would be?
A in traditional Indian cinema?

182
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,130
No, it's been interesting that you
ask this question because uh, uh,

183
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,040
the sun does come from very a personal
space. I think being a woman who's,

184
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,590
I'm an Indian woman,
but I've been,

185
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:02,140
I feel I've been brought up with a fair
degree of privilege in terms of, uh, uh,

186
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,770
you know, education and no one ever
telling me that you can do this.

187
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:09,800
You can't do this, you can
go here, you can't go here.

188
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,520
But I still feel that, uh, you know,

189
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:16,430
there are those things that make you
feel like you're not completely free.

190
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,910
And I was quite preoccupied with this
idea of not feeling fully free and um,

191
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,300
and I thought it's so strange that
externally I don't feel like there's any

192
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:30,910
obstacle to man, you know, me
feeling completely like, uh, uh,

193
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,030
having like, you know,
like a, a completely free
sort of mind space in life.

194
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,020
So I wanted to explore this feeling
and then, then I thought the drought,

195
00:11:39,021 --> 00:11:43,670
the next lower through world, um,
which is very similar to mine,

196
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,050
why don't explore it through mill you.
Um,

197
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,450
whether also external, um, uh,

198
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,940
obstacles to a women's freedom and where
society has like a strong hold on the

199
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:56,350
rules that women have to play.

200
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,700
And also where everything is not as
simple because you don't have so much

201
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:03,380
economic privilege. And I
thought, why don't I, you know,

202
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,920
set this in this world
and that kind of world.

203
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,060
And I think it was very interesting is
that it is culturally a very specific

204
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:14,530
story because it's about one neighborhood
in one small, small town in India. Uh,

205
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:16,030
but I think what's been amazing is like,
you know,

206
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:20,710
the film is going to like more than 45,
uh, film festivals and said Premiere and,

207
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:24,460
um, uh, to begin with, most
of the festivals that the
film showed at were, you know,

208
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:28,050
they will, not South Asian festivals or
anything. And it was very interesting, um,

209
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,290
to see that so many people from so many
different cultures and nationalities

210
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:35,540
were really connecting with a film.
Uh,

211
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,970
having no idea about what life is like
in South Asia. I mean, just, you know,

212
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:42,970
having a vague notion but not
having like any active engagement.

213
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,620
And I think that was really an eyeopener
for me, even as a filmmaker, as a writer,

214
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:50,770
and a director that, um, uh,
you know, sometimes we limit,

215
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,890
we think that if we are
culturally specific, uh,

216
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,120
we're going to alienate,
um, other cultures.

217
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,950
But I thought that because
it was rooted locally,

218
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,780
um, I think somehow, um, about
the stories are universal and in,

219
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:10,600
in that sense.
So I felt like I was quite a surprise.

220
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:12,970
There may happily surprised by,
uh,

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,680
the sort of way in which the film was a
film has been embraced by people like,

222
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:19,870
from so many different,
you know, countries,

223
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:23,350
whether it's Egypt project plan
or Sweden or, uh, you know,

224
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:27,370
it's showed in many festivals in, in
the u s as well. So I think for me,

225
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:27,941
that was very,

226
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:32,650
very interesting to see how people were
feeling a sense of even people like in

227
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:37,180
France and all where, you know, you
feel like women, um, have like, I mean,

228
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,710
things are not as, uh, as an input,
but like everywhere, that sense of, uh,

229
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,880
of ownership with the, and feeling a sense
of identification with the characters.

230
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,600
So I think that was
very interesting to me.

231
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:50,020
And I think that reminded me of a very,

232
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:54,400
very important thing that I think a
women across the world share bond and it

233
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:59,290
really cuts through like
every other divisions with
thing. There are so many, uh,

234
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,950
you know, sometimes the world
seems less a divisive place. Uh,

235
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:07,690
but I really think that there's something
though there are many specifics,

236
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:12,691
but I think there is a deeply like shared
common sort of bond across a women.

237
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:15,030
And I think, uh, yeah,

238
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,610
I think that's something
that really realized while
seeing people from different

239
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:19,570
countries.
What was the film?

240
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,480
I think it was the Hollywood insider
describe the movie as a quote,

241
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,780
feminist drama.

242
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,700
And we could probably talk about
the concept of feminism all day. Um,

243
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,540
but it's not something you agree with
that description being feminist drama.

244
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,810
Uh, I am very happy that, I think
it was the Hollywood reporter,

245
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:39,680
but like after that,

246
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:42,530
I think that was one of the first reviews
that had come out or nothing off that

247
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:46,500
many other people have described the
film as a feminist drama. And, uh,

248
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,970
um, I think, uh, I'm very,

249
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:53,600
I'm a very proud and I do feel the reason
you want to us sitting here and having

250
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,990
this conversation because
of the feminist movement.

251
00:14:56,991 --> 00:15:01,130
And I feel it's because of generations of,
um,

252
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,810
uh,
you know,

253
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,520
women who fought for the right of women
to work the right to water, right,

254
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:12,320
to sort of own your own life. Um,
I don't think we can ever, um,

255
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,150
we can ever like forget that debt.

256
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,070
So I do feel that it's very important
for everybody actually to own,

257
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,450
uh, own the idea of feminism because
feminism for me really means,

258
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,230
or Oh, situation where,
uh, you know, there is,

259
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,110
there are equal rights and equal
opportunities for men and women.

260
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,430
And sometimes I do get a little, I
mean, I feel it's very important.

261
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:37,790
Like I keep feeling it's very important.
Explain to people who are like, oh,

262
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,410
you know, but, uh, I don't know.

263
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:42,620
I just feel it's such a strong word
and I don't believe in feminism.

264
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:47,621
I really want to like explain to them
that if you see you are not feminist or

265
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:49,220
you see,
you don't believe in feminism,

266
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,120
then what you're seeing as
you feel patriarchy rocks
and you feel like, you know,

267
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:57,380
patriarchy should rule the
world. It should just be
like mentioned be paid more,

268
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,431
you know,
they should,

269
00:15:58,431 --> 00:16:01,790
women should die because of dowery
debts and women should be more or less

270
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,230
everything that you're seeing then is
what you're saying then is that you want

271
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,050
the words to be ruled by men. If you're
saying you don't believe in feminism.

272
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,190
So I think it's very, very, or I mean just
beyond the idea of a film or whatever.

273
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,240
I just feel it's very important
for men and women, um,

274
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,440
to really own the idea of
feminism because I feel, um, uh,

275
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,620
until there is a equal of the
genders, I feel, you know, like many,

276
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:29,510
many big things in the world are not going
to really change. And I feel it's, um,

277
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:35,170
I mean I feel like it's the biggest
problem in the one this inequality between

278
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,620
men and women because it just really
does got through like any kind of

279
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,800
countries,
any situation.

280
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:45,200
So I just feel that it's very
important to coming back to the film.

281
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,480
I'm very happy and very proud of
people. Uh, call it a feminist drama.

282
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:52,460
I feel, uh, um,

283
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,880
it's nice when one's own viewpoint or
as a person comes through in one's work.

284
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,760
Um, so I don't feel like I set out
to be like I have to make a feminist,

285
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,710
but I wasn't doubting it be a
feminist because of lamb. Hmm.

286
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,023
That's awesome.

287
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:11,330
So the word censorship came up in a lot
of my reading in preparation for our

288
00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:16,710
chat and of course for me,
since censorship just means
stifling someone's voice.

289
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,600
So what advice would you give to
women mean it folks in the room,

290
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:26,601
folks listening to utilize and leverage
their voice even when it's times when

291
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:29,370
they're afraid or a times when
it's not going to be accepted.

292
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:30,360
What advice would you give?

293
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,070
What I would just say that it's very
important to not be discouraged because I

294
00:17:35,071 --> 00:17:39,840
feel every force outside of you that's
[inaudible] voice is banking on your

295
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:44,610
feel. And they feel that because
of feel your back though.

296
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:50,360
And I feel if you can battle
that Phil, I mean, Oh,

297
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,770
I'm continue fighting.
I think that's the only way forward.

298
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,500
And sometimes even been in,
sometimes we may not. Uh,

299
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,660
but I think the most crucial
thing is to continue fighting.

300
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:02,280
And I really think they always banking
on field because you, every time I feel,

301
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,800
uh, whether it's, um, you know, it,

302
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:08,400
it's just that they feel that they
can threaten him and you know,

303
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,170
whatever in some way or the other,

304
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:13,240
they try to leverage something or the
other against you. And this some, not one,

305
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,280
not just in terms of censorship refilm
but censorship of books and ideas and

306
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:20,820
thoughts. So I feel that
it's very important to, uh,

307
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,290
to continue speaking and to continue
standing up for what one believes in two

308
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,310
country, voicing our thoughts. And it's,

309
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,640
I don't think it goes in Wayne and I feel
like every drop like makes the ocean.

310
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,880
Sometimes I might think that my
little fight in my, I don't know,

311
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,060
maybe in my classroom or in my
little workplace is not important.

312
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,310
But I do feel that every battle smaller,

313
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,960
big actually comes in the
larger scheme of things.

314
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:48,780
So I might think that it's
very small and you know,

315
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:51,930
it may affect only me and 10 other people,
but I think there's a ripple effect.

316
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,830
And I feel when people see
one person have that courage,

317
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,890
it empowers 10 others to have courage.

318
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,500
And when those 10 others I empowered then,
you know,

319
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:02,880
it's sort of like a ripple effect.

320
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,880
And I feel it also like creates
a sense of network and you know,

321
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:13,101
being able to have solidarity with other
people who might be facing such similar

322
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:17,160
issues and all of that. So I think that,
uh, it's really, really important. Also,

323
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:17,994
I feel like,

324
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,300
I think the one thing that I realized
when this entire thing happened is that I

325
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:25,550
was very secure in the area that I live
in a free and democratic country. And, uh,

326
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,640
you know, like India, so, you
know, healthy, bustling democracy.

327
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,740
And when, uh, the film
was, uh, uh, you know,

328
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,180
it was refused certification.

329
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,030
I think the thing the thought that
really hit me is that I didn't realize or

330
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:45,000
notice as free, you know, and I think, um,

331
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,900
and then I also started thinking
that, uh, so this is like,

332
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,140
it's been 70 years since an air became
independent. And I started thinking that,

333
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:56,550
uh, you know, this freedom
that was fought for,

334
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,400
uh, by many, many people in many
sacrifices with me to, you know,

335
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,920
get it off the British and become
free and all of that. I was like,

336
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:08,400
we have to reimagine that freedom. Like
it's not like what can we became free.

337
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:12,120
We got ourselves a great constitution
and it's all good. Like people go vote.

338
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,360
I just feel for every
generation you have to sort of,

339
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,720
we had your own battles
and reclaim that freedom.

340
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:22,590
And I realize nobody's coming and gifting
me my gender equality and my freedom

341
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:26,040
of expression in like a little bag with
a pink bow and I'll open it up. I'm like,

342
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,770
oh wow.
I realized that I was like,

343
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,900
thing is freedom is guaranteed to us by
the constitution and gender qualities or

344
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:37,740
I mean the equality between men and
women is, is guarantee to us with,

345
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:42,120
until we claim it and make it real. And
it's, and that has to be an active thing.

346
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:47,800
It's not like it's a static thing.
So I just felt that, you know,

347
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:50,980
like I can't be like India is
like this or whatever, like,

348
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:53,860
and this has happened to me over here.
If I'm an Indian citizen,

349
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:58,861
then I should try to utilize my rights
to speak up and utilize the system to get

350
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:04,810
me the freedom that I feel I'm on
because I am a citizen of this country.

351
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,420
So I just feel it becomes,
uh,

352
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,200
it needs to be a more active process
and I feel we need to keep doing this I

353
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:15,280
guess after every few years because we
otherwise we just sort of becomes like a

354
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:16,780
dead sort of a space,

355
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:20,320
which I think with cinema in India in
the sense of even living with censorship

356
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:24,190
forever and I think with Tony now
than the last like year or two years,

357
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:27,400
it's really been blowing up in everybody's
face because you realize that you

358
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:29,880
don't have to, I never given
independent and we have this, uh,

359
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,200
censorship system and nobody was really
like questioning it in such a big way.

360
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,910
But no,
I think it's just like,

361
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:39,850
it's just moving up in everyone's face
and lived in like, we do read on one date,

362
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,950
but I think it's up to us to
actually change the system.

363
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,970
What does this movie mean for girls,
young girls?

364
00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:52,410
I know it's late oriented,

365
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,780
has sexual language and all
of those types of things.

366
00:21:56,781 --> 00:21:59,750
But what do you think for our girls
who are trying to find their courage,

367
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,810
find their voice, all of these
things that we've been talking about,

368
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:04,280
what could this movie mean for them?

369
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,910
Um, I guess I would want every girl to
interpret it in her own way, but if I do,

370
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,010
um,
and you know,

371
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,100
I don't know up to her what she
sort of wants to take back from it.

372
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,850
But I guess if I had to sort of, um, uh,

373
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,500
think about it in terms of thematically,
um,

374
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,840
I think it's very important for
women to put themselves first.

375
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,200
I think as women we are constantly being
conditioned to put ourselves second,

376
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:34,651
you know,

377
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:39,651
it's always like duty forest and like
what have to do with my family falls.

378
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,930
What makes, I don't know.
Like, so I think that, um,

379
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:49,010
in a sense the film is also about what
happens when these four women try to put

380
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:54,120
their own desires and their own dreams
before anything else. So I feel as women,

381
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:58,200
you know, sometimes we, we don't
even realize how conditioned we are,

382
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,270
do not put ourselves first and never
give us, give us gift ourselves.

383
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:06,030
Was that freedom that I think
we all sort of dissolve.

384
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,930
And I also feel like a sister would like,

385
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,930
not that the film is overtly
at all about sisterhood,

386
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,760
but I feel like if we're
watching the film you feel like,

387
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:23,400
um, there may be so many women and I don't
know what their stories are and let me

388
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,880
have like the heart to embrace
them because I do feel,

389
00:23:26,881 --> 00:23:28,990
I feel really want things to change.
Um,

390
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,720
I think women really have to sort of get
together and really support each other

391
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:36,300
for any real change to happen.
And we don't even realize it.

392
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:38,360
And something like the glass ceiling,
um,

393
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:43,680
I feel it's like boys gloves and this
whole locker room thing and the golf

394
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:48,590
course for everybody. I mean
there are ways that, um,
and the fact that, you know,

395
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:52,130
we keep saying that all
women are threatened by
other women in the workplace,

396
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:55,700
for instance. It's because women
have had such few opportunities.

397
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:56,960
And that may not even be the case,

398
00:23:56,961 --> 00:24:01,450
but I feel it's also patriarchal construct
that is fed into, I had said, you know,

399
00:24:01,451 --> 00:24:02,870
no woman will ever look out for you.

400
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,180
No one is going to give you a
helping hand because you know,

401
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:06,140
women are supposed to,

402
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,680
so I feel like we ourselves need to
break through like all of these myths.

403
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,920
And I do feel that it's
important for us to have that.

404
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,960
And I feel like sometimes
just share, you know, being,

405
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,080
being able to listen to another person's
story and giving them that kind of time

406
00:24:24,691 --> 00:24:29,100
and having that sense of empathy, um,
leads to a lot of change. So I think, uh,

407
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:33,620
for me, I would feel like if you
know, for those two as well, actually,

408
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:35,360
whether it's men or women,
whoever watches a film,

409
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,860
I'm just feel like they can see the four
women with all their hopes and their

410
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:45,920
dreams, their laughter, their
heartbreak, the ambition, their passion.

411
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:49,060
And at the end of the two was
just feel like they do, you know,

412
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,200
they're friends with those people
and they actually know them.

413
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,950
I think my job is a flamingo
would be done after,

414
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,280
well you set the bar pretty
high lipstick under my burqa.

415
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,810
So my question is what's next for you?
And I must see that.

416
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,060
I wish I was like, I was so clear
it was like one next thing. But uh,

417
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:07,831
yeah,

418
00:25:07,831 --> 00:25:11,430
I think I'm like in a state of confusion
because there are like two or three

419
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:13,740
things in my head,

420
00:25:13,741 --> 00:25:18,600
but I must see them actually were
preoccupied by the idea of a women finding

421
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,520
themselves and women finding strength.

422
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:24,780
So all the stories that I'm
dabbling within my head are about,

423
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,170
um, you know, needs a women,

424
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,900
but I don't know which one
I'm going to really do for us,

425
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:34,440
but they are definitely, I
feel like I'm very, very, uh,

426
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,110
passionate about telling stories,

427
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,960
telling stories about women
from a female point of view.

428
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:43,410
And that that's what actually drives me
to make films on the way that would not

429
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:47,280
do that. So, yeah. So it's going to
be, I mean, it will be about that,

430
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:49,740
but I don't know which one I'm going
to. Well, let's see what works out.

431
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,500
Okay, well I definitely
want to open it up for sure.

432
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,190
So I'll ask you for a little
bit of a social commentary
if that's okay. Uh, so we,

433
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:04,410
I think we all know about Yarra,
a trouble with the CDFC and, uh,

434
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,990
we are sorry about that because
we all enjoy good cinema. Um,

435
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,860
so I do agree and we all know
that India does have its problems,

436
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:17,050
like with its female infanticide,

437
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:21,400
whether it's harassment
with her glass ceilings. Uh,

438
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,970
but do you feel India has,
you know,

439
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,720
made good progress for the last 70 years?

440
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,110
The reason why I'm asking
is now we do see, you know,

441
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:37,490
films like yours or Bar Star mom
coming out of Bali board. Uh,

442
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:42,240
the top three CEOS in India or women who
are the CEO's of nationalized banks or

443
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:47,160
banks. Um, and you know, we've had
very powerful woman, chief ministers,

444
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:50,050
prime ministers, precedent, you
know, which hasn't been achieved,

445
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,750
even advanced nations. Uh, so
I'm wondering if, uh, you know,

446
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:59,370
do you see that we are the
same old patriarchy are,

447
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,510
are we are making progress or are
there really to India is like the urban

448
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:06,660
educated India and the rural
somewhat backward India.

449
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,100
Um, that's a very way have a very
good question. And I must say,

450
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:15,740
I don't damn fully equipped to answer it,
but from my own,

451
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,750
I mean I can only express my own opinion.

452
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,050
Definitely things have
changed I think go once.

453
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:25,670
I mean the many more women are being
educated and many more women are um,

454
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,070
you know, for instance
in banking jobs, um,

455
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:34,540
and many more women in
the workforce overall. So,

456
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:38,540
and of course we've had, um,
many more female politicians.

457
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:40,790
I mean South Asia has that trend.
Um,

458
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:44,930
and earlier at an earlier time you've
had many female politicians across South

459
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,050
Asia compared to the Western world.
Um,

460
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,660
but I feel that,
um,

461
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:57,440
I wouldn't gloat over that progress
because I feel we have such a long way to

462
00:27:57,441 --> 00:27:58,274
go.

463
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:02,480
And being a woman who
has grown up in India,

464
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,500
definitely I feel like there is
change and there is progress.

465
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,950
In a normal kind of way.
Um,

466
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,680
but have things really changed in
terms of our women still see if on the

467
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:18,740
streets,
if there's still a dowry,

468
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:22,550
is there still marital
rape is still illegal. Uh,

469
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,810
I mean it's not illegal in India,
so, oh, I feel we have a very, very,

470
00:28:26,811 --> 00:28:31,310
or long we'd go and I don't know,

471
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:35,150
I feel like while it's good to make a
note of various things that are changing,

472
00:28:35,151 --> 00:28:39,970
it's not, uh, the change. I don't
think, I mean I don't feel like posting,

473
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,630
I'd be really very satisfied with that
change because I feel they will be a long

474
00:28:44,631 --> 00:28:48,680
way to go. And, uh, and I feel
like that is still, for instance,

475
00:28:48,681 --> 00:28:51,710
even if you look at like the number
of women making films in India,

476
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:56,770
it is so minuscule compared to the number
of films that are made in the country.

477
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,380
And I do feel many of these
things are not specific to India.

478
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,090
Like the glass ceiling for instance,

479
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,960
is something that is a problem
across the world. Uh, you know,

480
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:08,360
sexual harassment at the
workplace and things like that.

481
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,660
Some things are more specific
to India, which is like, um,

482
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:18,160
you know, there's still that stigma
attached to being a widow. And, uh,

483
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,950
this kind of being very disheartened
when a girl child is born.

484
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,470
So not to say things are not changing.
They are,

485
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:28,850
but I feel not dynamically
enough, not fast enough. And in

486
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:34,550
many ways things are not changing
at all. So I do feel like, um,

487
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,780
um, but degree I feel like we used
to be just physical safety of,

488
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,960
you know, of, of women and
overall the sense of like,

489
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,960
even if you'll see the number of
women who actually go into any,

490
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,020
like the number of women who actually
enrolled in a course to study.

491
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:55,420
And then when you see like the number
of women actually pursuing that

492
00:29:55,421 --> 00:30:00,070
profession, both authorities,
there's like a huge sort of drop.

493
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,740
And I do feel even when women
are working, it's like, you know,

494
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:06,460
it's like the Labor is not shared
in terms of the home space.

495
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,980
So I just feel that we have
a very, very, or, um, uh,

496
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,620
we have a long way to go.
And I just feel that, uh, uh,

497
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:19,840
I think I would rather see all the anon
stuff because I feel like we can sit on

498
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:21,640
those laurels and they don't.
Uh,

499
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
because even having a had a female
prime minister and having had a female

500
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:28,474
president,

501
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,580
it didn't change the situation and
the grass root level in terms of uh,

502
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,870
you know, many things. Visa,
we dilute ed educational,

503
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:41,500
the lack of nutrition for a
goals and things like that.

504
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,610
So I just feel that we really
do have a, um, a long way to go.

505
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,750
I hope I've tried to answer. And as
about doing this, I think there are many,

506
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:53,860
many Indians and there's a
really interesting country
because there's so much

507
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:56,200
diversity and everybody's
reality is different.

508
00:30:56,201 --> 00:31:00,160
I do feel it's not that there
are not problematic things. Um,

509
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,370
[inaudible] uh,
upper middle class educated people,

510
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:06,760
I feel like even visa be gender issues,

511
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:09,660
I think that a lot of issues even
over there. So I think, yeah,

512
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,290
those do cut across classes as well.

513
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:16,110
You mentioned that like you have a few
projects that you're not trying to figure

514
00:31:16,111 --> 00:31:20,760
out what's next. So hose, like
how was this experience like,

515
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,590
how has it impacted your decisions?
Like how do you kind of keep it like a,

516
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:29,220
you know, I'm not going to learn these
and this experience impact my decisions?

517
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:33,670
Like will you be more like, hey, maybe
there's a controversial subject that's,

518
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,380
you know, your new next project and
[inaudible] given my experience, you know,

519
00:31:37,381 --> 00:31:39,210
I should just see away
from it for a while. Or,

520
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,590
I mean it's easier to say that it will
take for the open mind and like look at

521
00:31:43,591 --> 00:31:45,720
scripts in that way.

522
00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:50,280
But how is this experience like
how's it changed you in any way?

523
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,440
I think it's definitely or
changed me and it's grown me up.

524
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:56,870
It's been a very long and
difficult or journey to, um,

525
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,750
to make this film right from
the start. And, uh, yeah,

526
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,633
and I think that,

527
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,160
I think the main thing it's taught me
in life is that a do not give up because

528
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:09,400
it was really difficult even
getting the film, uh, you know,

529
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:12,960
out there in many other ways and all of
that, not just a censorship otherwise,

530
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:16,570
although it's been a very,
very long and difficult journey.

531
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,100
So I think, uh, uh,

532
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:23,290
it has taught me that you do not give
up because I think this feminism,

533
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,930
this is my second feature film.

534
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:28,990
I think my first feature film was
perhaps easier than this one. But, um,

535
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:34,020
I think the only thing that's clear to
me that I should try and focus on, make,

536
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:34,391
you know,

537
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:38,230
making the kinds of films and telling
stories that I really believe in because I

538
00:32:38,231 --> 00:32:40,250
feel if I didn't believe
100% on this film,

539
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,630
I would not have been able to sustain
this very long journey that it's taken me

540
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,330
to write to the time when
I thought of the film,

541
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:51,740
do like writing and
getting it into production,

542
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:55,760
finishing and getting, you know,
getting distribution, getting released,

543
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:56,870
the wholesome shit thing.

544
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,550
So I think it's just reinforced the idea
that it's very important for me to have

545
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:05,060
like complete conviction in what I'm
doing because you don't know what like how

546
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:08,870
long you have to keep fighting
for, uh, for what you've created.

547
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:14,330
So it's, uh, I mean the fact that I had
100% faith and conviction in, in, in,

548
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,900
in the story, in the film, I
think that was a really important,

549
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:20,790
and I think that is something I
think I'm just nervous about that,

550
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:21,561
that whatever I do,

551
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:24,740
I should feel that a hundred percent
conviction because you really don't know.

552
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:27,800
And I am an independent for, so
I feel, I don't feel, I mean,

553
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:30,290
I'm sure I will have
other issues and runnings.

554
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,930
I'm not expecting some bed
roses after this. So, um,

555
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,950
I just feel that whatever it
is, it should be like, you know,

556
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:39,680
something that I really believe in
100% and I can stake my life on it.

557
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,540
I'm sorry I missed the first 20 minutes.
I'm not sure if you answered it then.

558
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:48,380
It doesn't matter. We'll answer again.
Yeah. I mean, especially in India,

559
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:53,150
it's always been the movies that have
been like a major player in perpetuating

560
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:58,151
stereotypes and stigma or they mostly
just objectify women and the people,

561
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,970
I mean, the general public is also
interested in just commercial movies,

562
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:03,860
which like how like,
you know,

563
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:07,490
like two or three songs and they just
want to have a fun time and that's where

564
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:09,550
all the market is and that's
where all the money is.

565
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:13,190
So if the film industry is going to
keep doing that, like objectify women,

566
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:16,250
perpetuate stereotypes,
uh, I mean that, I mean,

567
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:20,180
for me that looks like the single most
important player in doing all those stuff.

568
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:23,840
If that's not going to change, do you
think, uh, you know, how, how do you,

569
00:34:23,841 --> 00:34:28,190
how do you see the Bollywood
or like industry moving
towards like, you know, uh,

570
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,310
more, uh, focusing towards
feminism and stuff like that?

571
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:36,570
I think you're absolutely right.
And I completely agree that,

572
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,340
um, uh, you know,

573
00:34:38,341 --> 00:34:42,810
a lot of the 10 big Bollywood
tentpole kind of films, uh,

574
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,690
they really, uh, I think
mindlessly they keep,

575
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,850
I don't even think that plan is
to necessarily perpetuate, uh,

576
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,100
the objectification of women. I think
they do or don't even think about it. And,

577
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:56,130
um, uh, I do think that
it's very important,

578
00:34:56,131 --> 00:35:00,320
particularly if look for a country like
India because I feel the way we portray

579
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:04,800
love, for instance, talking is
portrayed as love. And I feel like, um,

580
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,950
you know, cinema and other kinds
of popular culture and society,

581
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:11,850
they just keep feeding off each other
and that's just how it is on the streets.

582
00:35:11,851 --> 00:35:15,930
And that's just like, so you're constantly
reinforcing the idea that, you know,

583
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:19,620
a guy will go and grab this
woman's arm and he'll be like,

584
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,650
she doesn't even know me. He's like,
I love you. And five scenes later,

585
00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:25,920
rather than calling him out
on his stockish tie behavior,
she's going to be like,

586
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,813
I love you too.

587
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:31,970
So therefore the idea that is being
propagated is that that's how you,

588
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,730
you know, go out. Uh,

589
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,880
so I do feel that all of it are and
way like the fact that we still have

590
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:39,181
something,

591
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:43,590
all the item song of the usage of the
word item for the woman I think is awful.

592
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,600
And the fact that the camera goes up and
down a woman's body when she's randomly

593
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:52,860
dancing to some strange like double
meaning lyrics like your chicken,

594
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:57,040
etc. And uh, you know, like it's, uh, and,

595
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,890
and the cameras is going up and down her
body though it has no connection with

596
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:03,090
the story or anything.

597
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,790
And the fact that people are watching
it and not thinking about it. I,

598
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:10,230
I feel it's very, very problematic and
it bothers me a lot. I don't, I mean,

599
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:15,150
I think the only thing we can do is to
continue to ensure that there are more

600
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:20,151
alternative films out there and hope
that people like come and watch them.

601
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,930
So I think the very encouraging thing
about the release of lipstick and my

602
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:27,060
worker in, uh, in India was that it
actually did really well commercially.

603
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,570
And people actually came to the
theater to see it and nobody was really

604
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:34,080
expecting that. So I think,
uh, um, I don't know,

605
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:37,110
it is a sign of some
sort of, uh, you know,

606
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:41,220
at least interest in something else.
But I think you're right. It's a very,

607
00:36:41,221 --> 00:36:43,690
very entrenched system. But I guess, uh,

608
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,710
the audience is also like largely
responsible because I feel that, um,

609
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,230
until people don't start
rejecting these films, um,

610
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,000
money's always going to be put into them.

611
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,390
So I think between the audience and the
studios who don't have that much courage

612
00:36:57,391 --> 00:36:59,160
and therefore they keep,
you know,

613
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:02,730
they feel it's very safe and it's some
money spinner and all of that and they're

614
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:04,440
not even thinking about
what is being made.

615
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,950
So I feel like actually everybody
has to take like a step forward,

616
00:37:07,951 --> 00:37:11,880
whether it is a writers were right
to continuing to ride these films or

617
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:16,740
directors are continuing to direct
these films without any kind of like a

618
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,580
critical thought about what it is that
they're sort of doing a, you know,

619
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,610
so I feel the entire system,
whether it's a good geographers,

620
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:26,910
it's like the literacies everyone.
So I think like it has to,

621
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,710
everyone has to take a step forward.

622
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:31,800
But I think the biggest steps will
be taken by a need to be taken by the

623
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:35,010
audience because these films exist
because the audience is watching,

624
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:38,100
watching them. And I think the
second thing is other studios,

625
00:37:38,101 --> 00:37:41,640
the studios really have to take a call
that these are not the kind of films you

626
00:37:41,641 --> 00:37:44,550
want to, uh, promote. Yeah.

627
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,610
But we have to keep fighting because
otherwise like there's no future.

628
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,490
So how practical do you think,
um,

629
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,090
it is for women to put
herself first write down?

630
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:01,530
Do you think the society and the family
will understand that she's doing this

631
00:38:01,911 --> 00:38:05,060
for a reason? Or does she have
to win the battle eventually?

632
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:06,910
Yeah,

633
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,810
I mean, I guess it's different depending
on who the woman is and in what case.

634
00:38:10,811 --> 00:38:11,561
And it's not,
I mean,

635
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:14,890
I guess it's very difficult to
all that I'm put yourself first.

636
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,920
But I do think it's time that
women thought of themselves,

637
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:24,100
not as just the hubs of,
you know,

638
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:28,770
or just standing behind somebody, but
really about what they want. And that in,

639
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:33,120
in every aspect of their lives
because I do feel that, uh,

640
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:38,550
the fulfillment of women as lost on
priority in any kind of a scenario,

641
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,380
you know, it's always,
um, so I don't feel it's,

642
00:38:43,381 --> 00:38:46,420
it's important and I think
we must think about it, uh,

643
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:50,800
about like the world that we want to
leave behind because I feel if we don't

644
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:51,760
make that effort,

645
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:57,810
we are so then like the
generation after us will like,

646
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:01,270
so I think we are very odd because people
before us Fortive they're taught that

647
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:04,690
we should not even make the effort
that women are equally integrated into

648
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:07,000
political life. Like even whether
they have the right to vote.

649
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:11,910
So then we will be still fighting
for the right to vote, you know,

650
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,930
or the right to like study or whatever.

651
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:18,670
So I just feel like every generation
needs to take it upon itself to go a step

652
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:22,660
further so that at least what you look
kind of world that you leave behind for

653
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:26,680
the next generation there is,
I mean it's a little better.

654
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:31,270
It can't be that the world I inhabited.
I wouldn't just leave it in the same way.

655
00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:34,360
Like I just feel our
purpose as human beings is,

656
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,290
has got to be more than just existing.
And I do feel,

657
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,150
and that's where I really
feel that. Um, so if you know,

658
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:45,700
if it's like if I have a niece or nephew
or a younger cousin or a younger sister

659
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:48,940
because I'm not a mom, but if I
bought a mother and I had a child,

660
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:51,160
I mean I had a daughter,
surely I would,

661
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,340
it's like the old world learn
by example and even the boys.

662
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,350
So if I create a more equal,

663
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,460
I made that effort of like knowing
what women want is also important.

664
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,260
Then those are the things people,

665
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,370
especially the younger people around us
are going to imbibe and then that's what

666
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:10,090
they want to live out. So I just feel
like we all have to, I mean, I don't know.

667
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:14,020
That's how I feel that we all have to
take that one one step because otherwise

668
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:16,900
there'll be no change and we'll
just be, you know, running,

669
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:19,010
I mean just standing in the same place.
Okay.

670
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,130
Just wanted to ask a question about
their experiences in the film industry.

671
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:25,420
You've worked with like a lot of,

672
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,530
a lot of really illustrious people.

673
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,530
I'm just wondering,
uh,

674
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:36,610
Hsa [inaudible] cognizant
chairman for Catia g.

675
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
So like some interesting experiences or
anecdotes you might have to share with

676
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:47,611
all of us or if any inspiration you've
drawn from them or just anything,

677
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:52,240
uh, some of your experiences
in the nurse tree. Yeah.

678
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,363
Uh,

679
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,750
so I want to say that I'm a very non
through me kind of person who's looking in

680
00:40:58,751 --> 00:40:59,610
the film industry,

681
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:05,040
but I do feel it's important to look at
people as people and not look at them in

682
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:07,890
terms of the major persona
they might come with.

683
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,000
I feel I've learned a lot from Mr Java
cause I've been working with him since I

684
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:14,250
finished, um, college.

685
00:41:14,251 --> 00:41:18,900
But apart from like the technical skills
at one picks up by working on a set,

686
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:24,120
I think, um, I think from him, I've
known some major life lessons. Uh,

687
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,190
I think as a filmmaker,

688
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:29,130
the first thing I think that he really
taught me that it's very important to

689
00:41:29,131 --> 00:41:34,131
have your own voice and whether somebody
gets it or they get it or like it's

690
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:36,410
harder for you.

691
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,690
You have to figure out who you are and
what you want to see through in the sense

692
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:43,850
that not that you often has to
have a message, but you have to,

693
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,430
you have to make a film
that is honest to you.

694
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,550
And I think that is something that has
really stayed with me and told me that

695
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:53,910
before I was making my first film. And
I think that is something that, um,

696
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:54,980
I really feel it's very,

697
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:59,150
very important that it's not because
I feel like everyone has different

698
00:41:59,151 --> 00:42:03,710
strengths and every storyteller,
every filmmaker need not the other person.

699
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,760
It's very important to listen to oneself
and figure out what is it that I want

700
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:12,080
to see and then see it even though knowing
so with me is that I know that I have

701
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:13,220
chosen a more difficult path,

702
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:16,580
but I've done in New England because I
know this is what I want to do is what I

703
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:18,230
feel passionately about.

704
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,200
So think that was one very important
thing that I learned to when the second

705
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:25,760
thing was of course to have the courage
to see things till the end no matter

706
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:26,594
what.

707
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:31,160
And I think that lesson
has also really been,

708
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:31,721
uh,

709
00:42:31,721 --> 00:42:36,050
a guiding sort of light in my life because
I feel many times I haven't been in a

710
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:39,520
situation where I think without that,
um,

711
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,750
sense of perseverance I may have given up.

712
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:45,500
But I think it's also something
I learned very early on, um,

713
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:48,860
through a lot of my interactions
with him about not, you know, what,

714
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:52,100
seeing things like senior Phil,
no matter what happens to it,

715
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,730
I'm seeing it through right until the end,
no matter what it takes.

716
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,390
So think those are the two leg really
important things I learned from him.

717
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:04,670
And I think, um, from Kankana
and a wrap, no, I feel like, uh,

718
00:43:04,671 --> 00:43:05,960
with me,
if I worked with an actor,

719
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:09,020
I feel once the actor has decided
they're going to work on my film,

720
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:12,950
it doesn't matter how what
they've done before. Uh,

721
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:16,220
of course I respect the fact that the
accomplished actors where I feel we're

722
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:20,110
starting afresh. And I
think what I love about, um,

723
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:22,650
a flatland gone going number with is that,
uh,

724
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:27,530
they never came with any kind of baggage
about how great their past has been or

725
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:31,940
anything. And I think,
uh, um, Yan, they, them,

726
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:35,570
I didn't have to, like, we did a lot
of preparatory work for the film,

727
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:39,520
like lots of rehearsals,
workshops, readings, and uh,

728
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,790
wrap nine Concannon did exactly the same
amount of work as the two other girls

729
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:47,650
in the film were actually new actors.
There was no difference. And, uh,

730
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:51,370
and I think that is what makes, um, uh,

731
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,130
artists great when they don't have a
sense of arrogance about, you know,

732
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:58,670
feeling like, oh, I already know it
all. I don't need to put in the effort.

733
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,721
I think it was very,

734
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:03,890
very clear and everyone puts in a lot
of effort and there was no sense of uh,

735
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,220
um, you know, I'm already on
national award winning actor.

736
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:11,540
I don't need to do rehearsals for one
month for like shooting for 20 days,

737
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:14,900
but they all did it. So
I feel like, uh, uh, I,

738
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:17,660
I think there was that
instinctive sort of, you know,

739
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,720
bonding over that this is how we see the
filament is how we're going to sort of,

740
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,280
uh,
sort of work.

741
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,640
So I feel like for me in the good
learning in that was that, um,

742
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:30,430
I think for all of us, we
should never become, uh, um,

743
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,340
arrogant our craft

744
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,160
in terms of like nothing
or whiskey booking do.

745
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:39,770
How can I hone my craft more and how can
I deepen my art more and how can I, um,

746
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,090
yeah, become better and better
at what I do. Thank you.

747
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:45,220
That's awesome.
Thank you so much for your questions.

748
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:50,320
So we have like one minute to go.
I do want to ask a final closing question.

749
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:54,460
What do you want your audience
to take away from this movie?

750
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,770
Hmm.
I think a month's,

751
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:01,280
a little like what I said about what
the goods like should feel. But yeah,

752
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,960
I just feel like,
um,

753
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:06,380
I don't believe in this
idea of messaging so much.

754
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:10,400
So I feel it's a story about for
ordinary women of different ages.

755
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:15,240
So I actually want people to
just experience their lives, um,

756
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:20,290
for those two hours and laugh and cry and
smile with them and feel with them and

757
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,240
go back home thinking about them.

758
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:28,430
Let's think Alan creative for her time.
This has been amazing. Thank you so much.
