1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,790
That's all.
I guess I'll sit down.

2
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:10,140
I would just say it's going to be
a short introduction to the film.

3
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:15,141
I'm Julie Anderson and this is Bridgette
and Josh and the were with the plastic

4
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:22,110
oceans foundation and one of our first
missions of plastic oceans was to how do

5
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:25,470
we get the world to recognize
the problem of plastics,

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,520
the new understanding of plastic if
and its impact on the oceans and our

7
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:34,320
environment. And that first step was
let's create a film that is impactful,

8
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:38,550
educational and meaningful and can
be delivered on a global level.

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,170
And that's, it took seven years
to create this film. The film,

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,770
the full documentary as a hundred minutes,
you can watch it on Netflix.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,280
And this way we've created different
shorts for purposes like this.

12
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:53,730
That's 20 minutes,
eight minutes.

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,800
And the idea is to engage people in
conversation, teach what informed people,

14
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:01,770
raise the awareness of this global crisis,

15
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,190
but also engage people on in a
conversation on what we do next.

16
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:08,640
Not just repeat the
problem as much as it is,

17
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:11,910
we now need to do something and
encourage people to do those solutions.

18
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,650
And it's not a one solution
problem, one solution fix, but it's,

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,920
it's going to take a
global community effort.

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,670
Okay.

21
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,320
Yeah. Um, you know, I would just to
piggyback off what Julie said is, um,

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,380
we not only on the global side of things,

23
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,560
we actually have reached to
communities around the world. Um,

24
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,090
we have the film now in 15 different
languages and we've screened it in over 70

25
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:41,350
countries and it's really amazing the
outpour of people that reached out to us

26
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,150
on a daily basis just
saying, you know, we,

27
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,360
we agree and what can we do to help?

28
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:50,170
So I think there's a lot of interest
out there and I'm also curious after we

29
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:54,740
screen it to get your thoughts on, you
know, how you see this as well. Um,

30
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,830
and I think that there's a willingness,

31
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,610
it's also making it more
accessible to people. So,

32
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,840
um, thanks y'all for coming out. Um,

33
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,770
I'll be curious after you see the film,

34
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:13,850
to hear your thoughts about where plastic
lives in your lives here on the Google

35
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:15,830
campus in Los Angeles and Venice.

36
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,850
I'm a ways that you can
help shift the mindset here.

37
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,930
And maybe with your families or on Pasta.

38
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,223
Bring this film to the,

39
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,320
again this is the film itself is supposed
to be form you onto the get us all

40
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:35,130
onto the same level of understanding
and then we discuss afterwards.

41
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:38,280
So I hope you enjoyed the film and
we'll discuss afterwards. Thank you.

42
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,450
And the,

43
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:46,010
it's how the foundation now what we
work on and terms of putting this out.

44
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,370
Our goal is to get people to rethink
plastic co the problem exists obviously we

45
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:54,950
all see it when we go to the, to the
beaches, we see it when we go hiking.

46
00:02:54,951 --> 00:02:59,951
You see plastic almost everywhere at this
point and we know the problem exists.

47
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,690
It's how do we now start to rethink this?
How do we now take knowledge,

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,960
new knowledge that
plastic does not go away.

49
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:11,830
It doesn't degrade back
into the earth any longer.

50
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,010
It simply remains and the very first
plastic that was ever created still exists

51
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:20,470
in some form or another.
And so it's taking that knowledge,

52
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,500
new knowledge and getting our generation
to really comprehend that and start

53
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,990
reexamining how we use plastic.

54
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:33,991
Now teaching the young kids that this
is not a product that they can grow up

55
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:36,820
with any longer. It's a new,
it's a new understanding.

56
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,250
And that's what we mean
by rethinking plastic.

57
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:44,251
And we go with this film and with other
different types of film and media shorts

58
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,480
we go to,

59
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,480
we educate children on what plastic is
to get them to recognize plastic is not,

60
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,780
it doesn't go away and it's a
new norm to live without it. Um,

61
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,840
especially single use plastics. We also
go these films to take it to industries,

62
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:06,841
different industries and in spa encourage
each industry to examine what they're

63
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:12,700
doing and how they're using
plastic and how they can modify,

64
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,510
modify their use of plastic
and become industry leaders.

65
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,520
And the other,

66
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,790
and the final third component
initiative that we push is working with

67
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:28,330
governments and getting communities to
start to work with their governments to

68
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:32,570
start pushing these policy changes.
And it really comes in.

69
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:37,480
And with those three,
three components from education,

70
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,530
industry and policy,
that's globally,

71
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:46,531
it's is the way that we think that we
have to move forward to get that site

72
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,830
psychological shift that we
need for social change. Um,

73
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,540
I think

74
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,280
that's exactly right. And
just kind of adding onto that,
I'm, I'm more involved on,

75
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,200
I'm the director of partnerships,

76
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:03,940
so I work a lot with industries that are,
you know,

77
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,470
companies that are,
I mean,

78
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:09,190
you can think about any industry and
it's going to have plastic, you know,

79
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:12,130
you've got, um, beauty products,

80
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,060
I mean in tons of packaging
and plastic. Um, even clothing,

81
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:19,090
a lot of people aren't aware,
but most of our clothes nowadays,

82
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:23,560
especially the disposable fast
fashion clothes are made of, um,

83
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,370
there are oil based or they
have plastics in them. Um,

84
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,230
and I just don't think we realize how,
how much plastic is in our,

85
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:36,340
in our lives really. And I think
it's going to take, um, you know,

86
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:37,630
at least a generation.

87
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:41,680
And that's ultimately our goal is
to try and be a part of it, um,

88
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,010
through those ways that Julie
has mentioned. Um, but in,

89
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,010
in the work that I'm trying to push is,

90
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:53,011
is working with into those industries
that I've mentioned and try to get them to

91
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:58,220
be a part of it as well because you
can't just approach it from one angle.

92
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:01,250
It has to be like multiple levels.
Um,

93
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:06,251
but the idea is also to be able
to empower consumers or you know,

94
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,930
do you want to call it? Some people would
call it reducers. Um, meaning you know,

95
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:14,400
you, you're not a consumer.
You want to, if you,

96
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:19,130
ironically you want to buy something
that will help reduce the amount of,

97
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,120
for example,
plastic,

98
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:24,890
it's going to be out there taking a single
use plastic like a water bottle that

99
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:26,750
has an average life of,
you know,

100
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:31,400
12 minutes and turning it into something
that could be nine, 10, 12 years. I mean,

101
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,340
there are things like suitcases out there,
their um,

102
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,200
car seats made out of
these plastic bottles. Um,

103
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,850
you know, that, that that's an something
that maybe if consumers aren't aware of,

104
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:44,540
right.

105
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,540
It actually costs more money to buy a
product that's been recycled or repurposed

106
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,700
from that perspective.
Like call it a suitcase for example.

107
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,820
So it's sort of informing consumers that,
you know,

108
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:58,270
you guys have an option as well to help,
you know,

109
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,990
cause if you're looking at two suitcases,

110
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:02,570
they look exactly the same and
one's a little bit more expensive,

111
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,380
you're going to wonder what
am I, you know, why am I
going to invest in that? Um,

112
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:10,110
so it's, it's also kind of building that
awareness so that there's a shift, um,

113
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,460
in behavioral habits and
consuming habits to cause.

114
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:18,170
The reality is there is a lot of plastic
on the planet right now, especially in,

115
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,350
I mean there's just so many layers to
it. If you go to, in places like Asia,

116
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:25,460
there's definitely, you know, there's an
issue of portability of the water, right?

117
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:29,070
So that, that's why, you know, plastic
water bottles, some in some places are,

118
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:32,030
are you still need to be used.
But for example,

119
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:36,350
here in the u s why are we still
using plastic water bottles? I mean,

120
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:40,130
it's not only that they've done a study
recently and they've shown that the

121
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:44,870
water in those bottles have a much
higher level of, of chemical activity.

122
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:49,610
Because it's plastic versus
like tap water. So anyways,

123
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:53,420
I could go on for a long time but I'm
going to stop myself there. Uh, yeah,

124
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,140
you can't,
it again,

125
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,410
as she touches on you can go on and
on and it does become overwhelming.

126
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,050
But at the bottom line and brief,

127
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:07,160
we do have the power to change and
to create that change individually.

128
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,470
Uh,
reflecting on what you do,

129
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:14,150
your personal use of single use plastics
and if you wanted to go beyond that,

130
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:19,151
even getting your families of your friend
groups to start changing each of those

131
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:24,170
changes make a huge difference
once you work collectively.

132
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:27,530
And then that's what we're as
groups like plastic oceans,

133
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,480
we are collectively giving that voice
to each individual action and which does

134
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:36,770
create that bigger social change
that we're looking for. And you know,

135
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:40,340
every but people we get often,
what difference does it make?

136
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:44,790
If I say no to one straw, one
straw, it's insignificant.

137
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,320
One thing I say is it's
white. One Penny. He may not,

138
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,070
1 cent may be insignificant to one person,

139
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,710
but if you collected 1 cent from
everybody in the United States,

140
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,410
that's a three little over $3 million,

141
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:03,411
all of a sudden that those individual
changes that change become something

142
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:07,630
significant. And now you add that
to on a global scale. You're,

143
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,910
we're talking about a movement that
actually does create a new work,

144
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,670
new future for us and a
better positive future.

145
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,193
Okay.

146
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,720
Um, I don't know how much that I have.
Uh, y'all are covering it wonderfully.

147
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:21,843
Um,

148
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,640
what excites me is the power
of this film and the films,

149
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,710
the shorter versions that
we've circulated to, um,

150
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,910
get folks to communicate with one
another about what they can do.

151
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,000
Cause like we can come up with
a bunch of ideas. But, uh,

152
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,900
our power is getting this out to folks
like yourselves who are connected to

153
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:46,070
different industries and get you
all thinking about what you can do,

154
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:48,110
how you can collaborate with your,
uh,

155
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:53,140
with your colleagues or with other people
who you know about making some kind of

156
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:57,410
change. And even if that's just raising
awareness so that you can continue that

157
00:09:57,411 --> 00:10:00,560
brainstorming together for
that collaboration for change.

158
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:02,590
Okay.

159
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,130
It's on that note.
We'll do questions.

160
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,200
One thing I wanted to add is that, uh,
June is going to be go Google serve.

161
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,830
Uh,

162
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,220
we already have a couple of projects set
up that are very much in line with the

163
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:18,230
kind of work that you do.
One is with chrome alliance,

164
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:19,490
I was trying to remember the name.

165
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,660
They actually changed their name
but they're still on our uh,

166
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:28,661
website registered as both sea change
foundation and Karma Alliance and we also

167
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,830
have the Biota creek cleanup projects.

168
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,290
So if you're feeling very motivated,
um,

169
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,320
I'm sure you are after that.
Um, then uh, definitely sign up.

170
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,480
We just had an email come out today,
um,

171
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,650
about Google serve and I know we'll have
some internal communication coming from

172
00:10:45,651 --> 00:10:48,950
our own lax leads. Um, and the,

173
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:53,570
the website is go Google serve dash lax
for you to go look at the projects and

174
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:54,980
sign up for some of these projects.

175
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,000
And I hope at least next year we
can also set something up with your

176
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:02,420
organization as well. We were a little
bit late on the timing this year,

177
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,960
but next year we'll do that. Um,
if anyone has any questions, I'm,

178
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,280
I can throw things at you.

179
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,880
Yes. All right. Um, so I wanted to,

180
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,780
one thing including at this
office that we're getting, um,

181
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,050
presented as an alternative is
kind of the plant based plastics.

182
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,410
And I was curious what the story
is about the breakdown of those.

183
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,210
I'm assuming they're not 100%,

184
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:31,600
which means that that whatever
part is not plant based,

185
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,610
then it's not going to break down.
Is that roughly correct or, and, and,

186
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,880
and also I have this impression that it
requires some sort of industrial process

187
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:43,000
to actually recycle it or break it,
make it biodegrade,

188
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,660
which means that that makes it that much
more likely that it's just going to end

189
00:11:46,661 --> 00:11:50,090
up in the same place.
So I just wanted to do

190
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,240
just on that.
So there's a couple folks

191
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,990
with plant based plastic.

192
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,000
There are the two types I think you're
also referring to. There's the bio,

193
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,200
the ones that are
considered biodegradable,

194
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,160
which do require a special facility,

195
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:10,790
a special processing to help it degrade.
Um,

196
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,900
the reason there is a lot of cons to the,

197
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:17,710
this product is simply because it
gets mixed with the current plastic.

198
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:22,090
There is no way to separate it and it
actually then makes it even more difficult

199
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:25,690
to recycle the plastic that the
processing that is in place.

200
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,020
And there are very few
cities that actually have the
biodegradable facilities in

201
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:33,520
place and it costs more.

202
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,550
So that's one of the cons in terms of
other plant based plastics that um,

203
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,240
the problem with those
is that as you mentioned,

204
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:45,580
they do break and they break
down in the same way in,

205
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:50,500
it can take decades and there is no way
and ultimately it does end up in our

206
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:52,540
landfills and ends up in water systems.

207
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,130
And you then have the same problem with
animals eating it where it then ends up

208
00:12:57,131 --> 00:13:01,000
in their stomach where they can
potentially starve to death because of it

209
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:05,740
blocking their systems. So does
it at as much chemicals? No,

210
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,520
but you,
you still have all of the,

211
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:13,521
the microplastic problems and
the put the visual waste to the,

212
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,020
that ends up to surfacing on our coasts.

213
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,710
So that's why we go back
to single use plastics.

214
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:25,330
Do we really need to,
to create as much waste to begin with?

215
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Can we just have a regular cup or a
reusable bottle instead of finding a new

216
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:34,270
way, a new material to create
the same amount of waste?

217
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,060
We're just creating far too much
wastes that we can't handle.

218
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:42,061
I mean this for focus on plastic because
it is such a ubiquitous substance

219
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:43,900
that's used,
but it is,

220
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,700
we use a lot of all types of materials
that we need to figure out how to handle.

221
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,303
Um,

222
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,620
thanks for asking that question Tom,
because that was one of my questions too.

223
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:56,500
But uh,
I,

224
00:13:56,501 --> 00:14:01,460
I just kinda wanted to ask about the
actual effectiveness of recycling, right?

225
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:02,241
Cause like,
you know,

226
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:07,241
in La we have our blue recycling bins
that we can throw all our plastic and

227
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:11,810
metals and paper into. But it's just
this sort of magic been that, you know,

228
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:15,160
I don't know exactly what happens
on the other side. And you know,

229
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,840
I'm often left wondering with
some little bit of plastic,

230
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:19,550
like if I put this in the Bin,

231
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:23,300
is it actually going to end up in some
new product or is it just going to end up

232
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:24,420
in the landfill?
Right

233
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,310
here in Los Angeles,

234
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:32,311
we have the best recycling in the sense
that all there are seven grades of

235
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:37,981
plastic for recycling and there
is aluminum and paper and glass.

236
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,410
So, and it's rare that cities
have all forms of recycling.

237
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:49,411
So La is good in terms of having all
of these forms of recycling processes,

238
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:54,691
but only approximately 10% is actually
recycled of all of our waste and recycled

239
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:01,280
waste, the other 90% does
end up in landfill. Um,

240
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,540
the problem, it's really,
it comes down to economics.

241
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,860
It becomes cheaper to
make brand new material,

242
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:13,760
brand new plastic materials
than it is to recycle it.

243
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,140
Find a use for it and repurpose
that recycled plastic.

244
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,440
So it becomes economics. The second
reason is that there is a short,

245
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,780
there's a shelf life on recyclability,

246
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,160
so your plastic bags
or the cheaper plastic,

247
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,510
the thinner plastic water bottles,

248
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,660
you can only recycle them so many times
before they degrade to an unusable

249
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,253
material,

250
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:41,060
whereas you don't have that as much with
pure substances like glass and aluminum.

251
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,713
Thanks.

252
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,200
Sort of piggybacking on that question.

253
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,400
So you mentioned that you
work with governments, uh,

254
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,340
without opening a gigantic can of worms.
Um,

255
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,610
um, I'm not gonna, I don't know if
you want to comment on the current,

256
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,150
um, EPA, any of that stuff.

257
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,120
But my question is in California,

258
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:12,930
since we've been kind of at the vanguard
of a lot of environmental policy,

259
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,330
and you mentioned La has a
strong recycling program,

260
00:16:15,331 --> 00:16:19,440
even though I didn't realize it was 90%,
that is actually not re recycled,

261
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:23,250
which is pretty depressing.
Um, what can we do?

262
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,120
What can we do as Californians?
What do we do?

263
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,710
Do we keep pressure on our leaders?

264
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,750
Is Does your organization have
any efforts to impact legislation?

265
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,370
Uh,
coming up that we should know about?

266
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:43,000
Um, maybe I'm not phrasing this correctly,
but I think you get what I'm saying.

267
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,680
Yeah,
absolutely.

268
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,690
I'll touch on it a little bit.
We don't focus a lot on policy.

269
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:53,690
There are definitely or more organizations
that focus on policy because there is

270
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,940
a lot of,
it becomes laborious,

271
00:16:55,941 --> 00:17:00,941
but policy is much easier to create
change when more people are on board.

272
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:05,690
When more people start to demand it,
demand the change or ask,

273
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:10,190
start asking for the change at
the policies will change. Um,

274
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,240
and here in La we have the new big policy
changes in Malibu that is implementing

275
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,770
plastic free restaurants.
So I think,

276
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,360
I can't remember exactly now the number,

277
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,740
but it's over 50 restaurants that
it will no longer serve you tent,

278
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:28,551
plastic utensils,

279
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:33,110
plastic straws and
other plastic materials,

280
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,370
which is amazing.
The second thing where we have to,

281
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,210
where we're going to see where we're
going to have to push is the enforcement.

282
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,990
And what does one do if a
restaurant is serving plastic?

283
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,860
Are we going to call nine one one and have
them arrested? Right. Probably not. But,

284
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:51,720
so it really comes down to
the consumer to really say,

285
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:54,630
why are you have the straw,
why do you have the straw?

286
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,990
And it does make one feel like an eco
warrior going into a place and saying,

287
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,980
why do you have the straw? I demand
something else. And that would be,

288
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:10,190
we're always encouraging people to be
that ECO warrior and stand up to do it.

289
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,981
If not,

290
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:15,210
this is where organizations like us go
in and we put the pressure on them to

291
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:18,000
follow up and to use media,

292
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:22,500
social media to put that pressure on
them to continue in that direction.

293
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,460
And that does tend to follow, you
know, trends like that. Follow.

294
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,880
Great. Thanks. Um, can I
ask one more thing, um,

295
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,680
on the partnerships
front? Um, one thing that,

296
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:39,930
well like I feel like the tourism industry
and amusement parks and all, yeah,

297
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,270
you're all nodding.
That's every time I see that.

298
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:46,350
I'm just astounded by the amount of waste
in the lack of recycling bins around

299
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:48,450
and that kind of thing and
all the single use plastic.

300
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,380
So I wonder if there's any,
if you work with them at all.

301
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,100
And also with companies like Amazon
who are doing same day shipping.

302
00:18:56,101 --> 00:19:00,060
And you know,
there's tons of waste around that,

303
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,360
but people seem to be using it more
and more all the time. So that's all.

304
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:07,580
I'll stop now. Sorry. Um, so no,

305
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,630
that's a great point.
And you know,

306
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:13,140
we're sort of slowly tackling
it one industry at a time. So,

307
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,950
but that is something that's on
our radar as far as, you know,

308
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,870
just if think about it means when parks
or venue spaces in general concerts, um,

309
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,080
you know, instead, that's
a ton of, of, of things.

310
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:29,430
I know of some venues that have throughout
the country that are saying they're

311
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:33,720
taking baby steps and
they're saying, okay, no more
plastic straws, you know, um,

312
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,140
but you know, there's, there's a
lot more that can be done and, uh,

313
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,400
that's a really valid point and it's
definitely on my shortlist, so, yeah.

314
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,703
Yeah.

315
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,840
Are there lots of, there is change. I
mean, there are people doing things.

316
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,390
You can look at events, music
events, big music events.

317
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,460
You'll go and you'll see more and more
often you'll see refill stations and you

318
00:19:57,461 --> 00:19:58,960
go to airports,
you're starting to see them.

319
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,390
So these are the changes
that when you start,

320
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:02,950
when people are starting to use them,

321
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:07,660
they're starting to put more of them
in there and it may be the problem is

322
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:11,260
overwhelming if you look at all
of the different levels of um,

323
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,800
problems that there are,
but on the, on that change,

324
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:19,720
don't underestimate the power that each
of you have in order to create that

325
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:24,400
change. Putting on refill stations in
each office makes a huge difference.

326
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:25,234
If they stopped selling,

327
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,340
if every office in La would stop
buying individual water bottles,

328
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:32,770
plastic water bottles,
it makes a huge difference.

329
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,130
Getting rid of the plastic bags
and starting to be reasonable.

330
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,270
These make big difference.

331
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:42,271
And companies start to recognize
these trends and they create the,

332
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,780
the new materials, the new products.
And that's where the change comes about.

333
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,190
And it,
the consumer has a,

334
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,160
a huge amount of power when it comes to
how you spend your dollar and they will

335
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:58,600
make it so they will start delivering
what you want. Um, because of the,

336
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,580
well they want your money. So I mean don't
underestimate each individual problem.

337
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,783
And,

338
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,490
and this is where we as what we do in
terms of finding these partners who are

339
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:13,120
the industry leaders? Where are these
individuals, these small community groups,

340
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,050
what are they doing?

341
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:19,050
There are people that are in small towns
in Chile and Columbia and India that

342
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:20,620
are taking,

343
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,730
they're making change within their
communities and then that voice becomes a

344
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:26,950
powerful voice within the
community next to them.

345
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,260
And this is how change comes about.

346
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,670
I use the example of smoking.
I'll often,

347
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:38,140
I don't know if anybody remembers, it
wasn't that long ago, 2030 years ago,

348
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:41,240
you could smoke on airplanes,
you could smoke in hospice.

349
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,720
Some hospitals in the u s
still like 20 years ago,

350
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:46,870
you could still smoke in almost
every restaurant and bar in New York.

351
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:52,210
You today I have a seven year old son
who finds it weird when he sees somebody

352
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:56,140
smoke a, it is a new norm. It is
not a norm any longer for him.

353
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,260
And that was within one
generation of creating that.

354
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:01,870
And it was one by one pushing the science,

355
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,120
getting people to understand the science
of second hand smoke and firsthand

356
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,200
smoke and smoking and little
by little policy changes.

357
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,860
People demanding,
I don't want us,

358
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,690
I don't want to eat in a
restaurant that smokes.

359
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:17,020
I don't want to go to a bar that smokes.
And those changes came about.

360
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:21,760
Policy changes came with that. And the
same thing can happen with plastic.

361
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,800
Um,
I think for myself,

362
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:28,010
one of the most exciting things about
this work is communicating with folks who

363
00:22:28,011 --> 00:22:31,460
are in waste management,
who are in product design,

364
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,330
folks who are doing packaging,
um, and even folks who hit,

365
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:40,340
who are running programs at schools so
that the students can watch the film and

366
00:22:40,341 --> 00:22:41,960
then have a brainstorming session,

367
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,810
ideation session where they get
to talk with the administration.

368
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,640
They get to talk with the folks who've
managed the facilities and considered all

369
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:52,520
the plastics that are a
part of daily life. Um,

370
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:57,350
and then cut out some of it.
Make that a big conversation.

371
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,770
The Diet.
There's a group of folks in Metro Manila,

372
00:23:00,771 --> 00:23:05,480
Philippines who have been hosting a few
events for folks who are in the industry

373
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:09,230
of waste management of
material production there.

374
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,790
So that the folks who are at the top who
have that knowledge can get together in

375
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:18,410
a room and actually discuss
what's happening so that
everyone can be abreast of

376
00:23:18,411 --> 00:23:22,400
it and then know that there's something
that they could affect later that they

377
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,060
could call up on another, send
out an email, speak to my someone.

378
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,800
We don't need that plastic anymore.

379
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:31,700
We can make or recycle this plastic in
a more efficient way he's use for some

380
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,420
kind of other product.
Um,

381
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,000
what's amazing is that I don't have
to know how any of this works. Um,

382
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,540
I could just help people connect
one another. Um, and magic happens.

383
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:44,720
I don't know what y'all
do here at Google. Um, but

384
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,570
you can make the magic happen as well.

385
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,970
I have a question, um, about,
uh, burning trash. So, um,

386
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,930
over the years, uh, there's been
articles about how, how much, uh,

387
00:23:57,931 --> 00:24:01,910
Sweden Burns of their trash, like the
burn almost entirely all their trash.

388
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:06,911
And my impression of that was always that
that would lead to some pretty toxic,

389
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,430
um, off gases. Um, but
it's still touted as,

390
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,740
as environmentally sound as an approach.
Uh,

391
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,700
do you have any thoughts
about trash burning?

392
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:22,701
I mean I know reducing overall the amount
of trash in general is the first step,

393
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,780
but it's another step to deal
with maybe burning it, I dunno.

394
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,980
Is that a possibility?

395
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,240
So we refer,

396
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,880
the first solution that we
push is to simply refuse,

397
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,980
reduce your plastic use,

398
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,250
reduce your trash consumption and

399
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,660
producing tress producing there.

400
00:24:44,661 --> 00:24:49,040
Then the second one we then called there
is all this trash that is in existence.

401
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:51,920
All the plastic that is currently
in existence. What do we do with it?

402
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:52,970
We don't know what we'd do with it.

403
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:58,120
So things like waste to energy
burning and burning the PLA,

404
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,510
burning waste, burning plastic. We
can we call these bridge solutions.

405
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:07,400
How do we get from what all this mess
that we've created until we can figure out

406
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,940
the perfect solution of I'm sure.

407
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:13,750
And people are working on technologies
to how do we re, you know,

408
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,700
keep the chemicals away
from getting into the air.

409
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:21,701
How do we burn it so that it's
efficient and it's not perfect,

410
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:27,830
but it does take care of the mass amount
of plastic that is in the environment

411
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,110
that is not going away,
that is degrading.

412
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,650
How do we control that before it
gets out of even more out of hand?

413
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,640
Right. Yeah. I just want
to jump on that. Um,

414
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,030
I think that it's easy to see when there
is something toxic around burning trash.

415
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:43,490
It's not very sightly often.
Um,

416
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,660
but when one considers the alternative
of putting it into a landfill site,

417
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,920
which then leeches,

418
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:53,330
because often landfill sites aren't very
well insulated from their surroundings

419
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,710
or end up in the oceans.
It's really not a bad alternative.

420
00:25:57,711 --> 00:26:00,380
And that's not to say that there's like
a good one that like if we have a bunch

421
00:26:00,381 --> 00:26:04,460
of garbage, we have like a solution that's
going to work well for everyone. Um,

422
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,960
but I think it's a pretty
viable alternative if it
creates energy and heat for

423
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:13,430
places that can reduce the need for other
fuels and keep stuff from getting into

424
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:17,210
the ocean, getting into food for not just
ourselves, but all the other animals.

425
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,580
Yeah. Don't we just send it to
space? Isn't that the latest thing?

426
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,260
Yeah. And then it can go
through our satellite dishes.

427
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,970
Anyone else have a question?

428
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,320
That's an impressive,

429
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:37,590
do you have any success
stories with businesses or
industries where you like you

430
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:38,860
okay.

431
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,050
Like an example of a big change?

432
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,190
Yeah. Um, actually we

433
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,930
worked with the UN a hotel
association in Thailand. Um,

434
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,590
it was last year. Uh, they reached
out to us and they said, listen,

435
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:55,530
we want to work with you guys
and we want to basically,

436
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:59,370
it's an island in Thailand
called Paquette. And um,

437
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,960
islands are always tricky because it's
hard to manage all the waste, you know,

438
00:27:03,961 --> 00:27:06,420
in terms of logistics and transportation.

439
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,930
So they came to us and we worked with
them and we help them create like a,

440
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:14,700
a workshop that they used, um, with,

441
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,240
I think they're up to about 74
different hotels that are members of the

442
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:19,074
association.

443
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:24,150
So they took the workshop and the 20
minute film that you just saw, um,

444
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,510
we, they helped us in getting
into a, the subtitles tie,

445
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:30,300
subtitles and those two things.

446
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:35,301
They went around and gave a workshop
to the different members of the hotels.

447
00:27:35,311 --> 00:27:38,040
Then asking them to,
you know, first of all,

448
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:42,420
think about all the plastic that they
have in the hotels and how they can go

449
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:43,470
about reducing that.

450
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,270
And that does sort of led to a whole
movement where basically they also,

451
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:51,280
we advised them to do a cleanup,
um,

452
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,240
which every year there's
international coastal cleanup day,

453
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:58,350
which is on September, I think
this year. It's the 15th. Um,

454
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,430
and the,
they got so much interest in it.

455
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,070
Basically they had that,
the local government,

456
00:28:05,071 --> 00:28:08,110
the tourism board at the u s embassy,
um,

457
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,870
and others that all got on board and
came out for this huge beach cleanup.

458
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,780
And as a result of all of that activity,

459
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:20,610
they actually now have an upcycling
program, uh, with a Spanish company. Um,

460
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,690
they're called ECO health.

461
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,720
And so I would say that was probably
the first real big in terms of numbers,

462
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:31,860
in terms of just awareness and really
getting entrenched in an industry that

463
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,371
really,

464
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:37,230
really a tourism and travel is
probably one of the biggest offenders.

465
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:42,060
Right. So I would say that that was our
first big home run for me at least. Yeah.

466
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:46,280
And it started off small again,
we went in there to educate internally.

467
00:28:46,281 --> 00:28:50,460
Some often within the industry they don't
understand how much waste there can to

468
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:52,430
me.
But by educating internally,

469
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:57,290
starting off with a couple of hotels
that did expand to the 75 which they are

470
00:28:57,291 --> 00:29:00,200
now all part of the UN clean seas program,

471
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:04,940
which is now taking that same education
program and bringing it to other hotels

472
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:09,470
and other countries that are part of the
UNC Clean Seas Program, which this is,

473
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:14,330
that's that trickle down effect of
starting in one small island and Thailand.

474
00:29:14,331 --> 00:29:19,220
And now it's being brought globally to
where other hotels are starting to listen

475
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:20,054
and how are they,

476
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,840
and it makes them question how are
they managing their waste internally?

477
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,100
How much waste can they
really can they know reduced.

478
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:33,350
And a lot of times that it becomes a cost
savings to them by just re looking at

479
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:36,020
the,
the plastic products that they offer.

480
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,783
Yeah.

481
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,350
We have time for one more question.
Um,

482
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:49,250
otherwise we'll just wrap up if
everyone is satisfactorily depressed.

483
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,790
Um,
one what,

484
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:56,570
one thing I wanted to say about the
beauty products and how that ties into the

485
00:29:56,571 --> 00:29:58,210
hotel industry is,
um,

486
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:03,670
I stopped using any of the little
freebie containers at hotels.

487
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:05,931
I bring my own,

488
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:10,931
I have my own reusable three ounce
containers for hand cream and shampoo and

489
00:30:11,961 --> 00:30:14,660
conditioner and I bring those with me.
I bring my own soap with me.

490
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,780
These are some steps that you can
take in your own personal life.

491
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,770
Sending a message that says, I'm
not using that. I'm not touching it.

492
00:30:21,771 --> 00:30:22,960
I'm not taking it home.
I'm,

493
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,120
I'm going to leave it there because
I don't need that. Like, I can,

494
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,710
I can take care of myself and I don't
need, it's nice if you forget your stuff,

495
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:33,970
but, um, it's just something
to keep in mind. And then here,

496
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,630
like in our micro kitchens,

497
00:30:35,631 --> 00:30:39,260
we have all these drinks that
are in plastic containers. Um,

498
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:44,120
it'd be nice if they were all like
Snapple in glass bottles with metal lids,

499
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,290
but they're not.

500
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,240
So just remember the impact you're
having when you take one of those.

501
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,210
And thanks very much to our guest
today was a real pleasure. Yeah.

502
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,410
And just one thing, I too, as
we obviously as a collective,

503
00:30:57,411 --> 00:31:01,430
we grow.
So if you could share plastic oceans,

504
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,310
follow us on any of
our social media sites,

505
00:31:04,311 --> 00:31:08,120
go to plastic oceans.org and you can find
more information of things that we're

506
00:31:08,121 --> 00:31:11,840
doing around the world
and tell your friends,

507
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,880
share with people about plastic oceans.
Because the bigger we become and the,

508
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:19,040
the further our reach,
the more impactful we are collectively.

509
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,160
Thank you.
Thank you.
