1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,570
Wow.
So good to be here.

2
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,223
I,
uh,

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,880
I grew up in Palo alto
long before Google existed.

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,530
And then, uh, I, uh,

5
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:24,460
in Ed Palo Alto High,
I was in class,

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,620
it was the same year as a lease
and Brendan Jobs, Steve Jobs,

7
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:30,050
his daughter and we were
on the newspaper together,

8
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:33,830
the camping Neely and my teacher,
uh,

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,830
Esther would jet ski.
We called her watch,

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,510
then became the
mother-in-law of Sergei Brin.

11
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:46,400
So like my teacher is like
the mother-in-law volatile.

12
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,280
Yeah.
Or the ex mother x a mother.

13
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,690
But I hear from the New York Times
article that they're, they're all good,

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,100
that they, they go to the met ball
together. It's still and all that.

15
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,830
So well,
welcome James Franco to Google.

16
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,110
Okay.

17
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,140
Move off a toxic Google and
we'll get right into it. So
thanks for being here. Uh,

18
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:13,960
so your new film, the disaster artist,
which is based on, uh, tell me why Zos uh,

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,720
weird film the room. Yes.
It's the making. Yes.

20
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,650
The room is a cultural,
we'll just classic cult hit.

21
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,960
It's really weird. When, when
did you first see the room?

22
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,080
I was really late to the room.
Um,

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,760
it's been out for a 14
and a half years now. Uh,

24
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,590
he, the story is, he made it,

25
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,960
came out in 2003,
uh,

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,250
he intended it to be
this great drama. Um, uh,

27
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,720
he wrote on the poster Tennessee
Williams level drama, uh,

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,020
which kind of shows what he's aiming for.
Uh,

29
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,610
it cost $6 million of his own money.
Where he got is a,

30
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:04,470
is a big mystery and uh, it's
so weird. Oh, marina. Yeah,

31
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:06,900
my phone.
We are,

32
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,160
Lorena and I were jogging this
morning just when we arrived here.

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,500
We didn't go, we just like
went one direction, uh,

34
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,480
just aimless, sort of started at the, at
the Ritz and jog all the way down to um,

35
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,940
beat street. And he would always,
Tommy would always say, well,

36
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:30,510
I made my $6 million from
a selling Levi's jeans.

37
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,100
And he actually got into
the screen actors guild, um,

38
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:40,130
by financing his own commercial for
his denim jeans outlet called street

39
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:44,400
fashions. And I know it cause we read,
we recreated and the disaster is,

40
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,930
but we ended up not using it, but
he, um, you can find it online. Uh,

41
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,030
just Google it. Uh, he uh,

42
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,190
is wearing like a renaissance hat and
he's quoting amylase is too big or not to

43
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:59,410
be, that is the question. Come to street
fashions can get Levi's jeans, five, five,

44
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:00,244
five beat street

45
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,100
and Lorena and I jogged and all of us,
we just went into straight line.

46
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,770
All of a sudden I look
up and there's this,

47
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,270
this is just like three hours ago I look
up and there's this poster of him in

48
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:17,560
the room. I'm like, oh look what a great
sign. And then I realized, oh my gosh,

49
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,720
it was like five, five, five beach street.

50
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,820
But we couldn't find the
thing all we could find his,

51
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:28,600
his poster and this big
Levi's jeans thing. Anyway,

52
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,020
he, yeah, he so I'm sorry you
asked me to a whole other question.

53
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,550
It's freshman, you got to
find out. I just ramble.

54
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,370
It's cost $6 million. It
made $1,800. Its first run.

55
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,240
People from the premiere on,
we're laughing at it. Um,

56
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,450
and unlike other,
you know,

57
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,520
directors that have these movies that
have become colt hit because they're so

58
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:01,400
bad or because people like to
laugh at them, like troll to, um,

59
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,710
Tommy had the wherewithal to kind of
capitalize on that and rewrite history.

60
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:08,020
So where he was completely

61
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,410
oblivious to how he was
coming off to other people.

62
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,300
As soon as people started
laughing at the movie,

63
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,340
he just became a maestro.

64
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:24,910
Like is as much as he lacked
self awareness before.

65
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:29,911
He then was like a car dashing with like
the way he can capitalize on publicity.

66
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,420
And, um, and he put it
in one theater in La, uh,

67
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,010
the sense of five and to
plate it midnights and it
just sorta caught on with USC

68
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,680
film students and then built it,
built from there.

69
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,950
He paid another bit of Tommy
and sanity's he paid for,

70
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:51,570
or maybe genius he'd paid for
this billboard on Highland. Um,

71
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,390
what was his face?
And it was that same image was like,

72
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:59,260
what the lazy eyelid and it said the room.
And then there was a phone number.

73
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,490
And, uh, I must have drove, you
know, he kept it up for five years.

74
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:07,120
That's hundreds of dollars, thousands of
dollars right there, you know, and, uh,

75
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:11,320
I must've driven past that hundreds of
times and just thought it's a colt or,

76
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,160
you know, I, I ran into a friend the
other day, he's like, oh yeah, that thing.

77
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:18,990
I thought it was a wanted
poster or something. And, uh,

78
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,770
so that's all I knew of the room for
years and years. And then four years ago,

79
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:26,650
the book came out that was written by,
um,

80
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,230
one of the other actors,
Greg says,

81
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:33,040
Terah who my brother plays in the movie
and this really great journalists,

82
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:37,510
Tom Bissell. And I was just blown
away. It was just, you know,

83
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:41,890
it was, um, I love Hollywood stories
and this was unlike any other,

84
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,880
and I'm just, cause it was so
bizarre row on the surface,

85
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,860
but at the same time it was, you know,
it was the story of anyone, you know,

86
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:55,420
uh, with a dream, you know, the story
of, I'm sure the, the, you know,

87
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,080
surrogates story. I mean the
passion behind it, I'm sure
you know, they, they were,

88
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,460
you know, at one point there are
people who were like, why Google?

89
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:06,170
What is that thing? You
know what I mean? Like,

90
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,250
and here he was like
anyone with a dream and uh,

91
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,440
he made it out.
I'll be it like very ironically,

92
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,710
but it still had sort of the underpinnings
of a kind of Hollywood success story.

93
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,990
It was interesting watching the movie
and then coming out of it and thinking

94
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:24,230
about it.

95
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,770
It's like he came into it thinking this
is going to be the best movie ever made,

96
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,300
but it was the worst movie. Yeah.
Which made it the best movie.

97
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,800
And then you're making a movie. It's a
phenomenal film about a terrible film.

98
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:37,670
That's a really good film.

99
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,670
Like it's very confusing how it kind
of all come and together I'm like,

100
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:43,430
it kind of blows your mind.
Sets would say James Franco

101
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,690
and I'm the only one that like came to
the room through the book. That's awesome.

102
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,730
Very James Franco. But uh, yes, it,

103
00:06:55,731 --> 00:07:00,290
it was bizarre. We w we were talking
about it over the past month.

104
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,890
We couldn't come up with a of another
example of a movie where the director of

105
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:08,330
the movie was acting in it,

106
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:13,190
playing a director who's acting in his
own movie and then sort of stayed in

107
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,830
character while he was directing.
That was my next question.

108
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,230
So you did stay in character
while you're directing. Yes,

109
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:23,231
but like there's this great documentary
out now I'm on Netflix called a Jiminny

110
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:28,700
Indiana. It's Andy Kaufman
or it's Jim Carrey when he's
playing Andy Kaufman. And,

111
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,220
um, it's an interview, you know,

112
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,120
recently was from recently with,
with Jim,

113
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,770
but it's also footage from 20 years ago
when he was doing the movie and he goes

114
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,090
so far in the Andy
Kaufman and his alter ego,

115
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:48,350
a Tony Clifton that Jim disappears
and like Milos foreman, you know,

116
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:52,910
one of the greatest directors ever who
did cookies nest. Nama Daz is like cow,

117
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,360
you know, by like there's Tony Clifton
character, he's like, you know,

118
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:59,840
really gruff kind of lounge
singer type and, and,

119
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,180
and it's like, you can't talk to Jim.
Like you see people like, Hey Jim,

120
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:07,850
that was great today. And he's like,
no, no, no. I'm Andy, I'm Andy.

121
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,350
You know Andy going so far that like,

122
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,620
you know, uh, uh, ambulance
was called and, and you know,

123
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:23,270
just like it's all this stuff going on
behind the scenes that doesn't even make

124
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:24,590
it into a man on the moon.

125
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,910
It says if he was like doing all this
stuff for this documentary 20 years later,

126
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,190
like I didn't do that. You
know what I mean? I didn't go,

127
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,330
I directed is James is just
filtered through the, you know,

128
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:39,950
funny voice and all across sites.
But like Tommy's direction

129
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,070
was absurd. Like we read
it, you know, you know,

130
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,660
Greg would tell us like when he was
auditioning people, he'd be like,

131
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,080
okay, uh, your sister
lesbian and she just die, go

132
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,250
Yay or no.
Or

133
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,300
that's literally what he said. So like I
wasn't doing that. You know what I mean?

134
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:08,550
I didn't go that far.
It was just sort of the voice.

135
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,650
Can you describe your first
meeting with Tommy? Like,

136
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:15,270
cause he's very good traction. They'll
be the first meeting with time. It,

137
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:17,820
what was that like? Or when did you
first meet him? So you got this,

138
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,190
you saw the book, right? You read the
book if you're interested in the room.

139
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:25,020
So then you w what's the Tom? And, um, I,

140
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:28,830
uh, here's the deal.
I've played, you know,

141
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,270
I think about eight or nine characters
that are based on real people.

142
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,400
They all have their own
requirements. You know, um, uh,

143
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,290
I played James Dean, who was a, you
know, one of Tommy's heroes. Um, I,

144
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,140
I played Aron Ralston who in one 27 hours
he got trapped by the Rock and cut his

145
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:53,670
arm off. And those have different
requirements. James Dean, you know,

146
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:55,740
because he was a, you know, an actor,

147
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,600
people can go to see his movies and
see what he looked like and moved,

148
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:04,560
how he moved and how he sounded
the same with Tommy. Right? So,

149
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,310
but with Aron Ralston, that's not
the case. Nobody, you know, yeah.

150
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:10,970
You can go online and look
them up, but his care, the,

151
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,210
the priority with that character
was capturing, you know,

152
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:17,040
with Aron Ralston is capturing like,
you know,

153
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,440
then tick experience to take the
audience on a ride of, you know,

154
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,830
really going through that.
Um,

155
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,470
with James Dean and Tommy, you
know, half of the, you know,

156
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,120
preparation is getting down, like all
the, the physical behavior and all that.

157
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,550
And then, and then trying to sort of, uh,

158
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,620
dig up what he was,
what's going on underneath.

159
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:45,621
Now Tommy is a particular kind of
mystery where he holds on to this facade.

160
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,130
It's a very thinly veiled facade
where he, you know, he say he,

161
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,030
he saw like this and you know,

162
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,310
he say from New Orleans and
like nobody believes him. I,

163
00:10:56,311 --> 00:11:00,480
last night I was on Jimmy Kimmel
with Tommy, which was, you know,

164
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,140
the university has just exploded
right there. Like, you know,

165
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:08,730
the fact that he was on there,
but he strangely for the first time,

166
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:13,320
maybe in his entire life emitted and he
just tried to like slip it in. I was,

167
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:16,950
my brain was exploding and he was
like, you know, Jimmy was like,

168
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:19,320
where are you from Tommy?
He's like, well, you know,

169
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:22,380
I come from Europe and then I go to
New Orleans. I was like, wait, what?

170
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,380
You're admitting it and,
and you never heard that before.

171
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:28,470
That he never would say that,
you know, I'm, you know,

172
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:32,730
he had written reviews, you know,
not only did he say, you know,

173
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:36,780
when the movie came out, like a
Tennessee Williams level drama, he,

174
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,540
he wrote these fake reviews
like from like nine oh two went,

175
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:45,250
oh Beverly hills film review or
whatever. Like Tommy was, oh, the,

176
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:50,251
the raging Cajun delivers powerful,

177
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,790
like thriller is. Uh, and, uh, so no,

178
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:58,480
he had never said anything like
that before. Anyway, I had to,

179
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:03,481
I had to kind of get underneath
and figure out some of,

180
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,450
you know, what, maybe I could,
I could understand, okay,

181
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:11,080
he's from eastern Europe and you know,
I can, you know, get some of that stuff.

182
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,520
I didn't need that from Tommy,

183
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,630
but I couldn't go to
Tommy now and ask him,

184
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,080
you know, what was motivating
you when you're making the room?

185
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:22,750
Because he is the master
rewriter of history.

186
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,490
And now he claims that he
intended the room to be a comedy.

187
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,350
So, you know, when, in
fact she was not true,

188
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,220
incredibly sincere when he made it. Right.
So, you know, he says about the room now,

189
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,230
um, the room is safe place.
You can laugh, you can cry,

190
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,610
do whatever you like, just don't
hurt yourself, you know. Um,

191
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,640
so in that way he can still,

192
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,090
he can like take credit for being a
comedy but also that he's still greatest

193
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:56,410
director or you know, around. Um,
so I couldn't go to him as a source,

194
00:12:56,411 --> 00:13:00,040
but what I had was, um, he would,

195
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:05,110
he would drive around in his car and I
know he was in his car cause I have the

196
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:08,340
recordings, I going to hear him like
doing the turn signal and everything like,

197
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,100
and he would talk to himself.
This is the nineties,

198
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,420
so it was like a mini tape recorder
who's talked to himself about all this

199
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,050
feelings about,
you know,

200
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,730
acting classes and being mistreated
by acting teacher. And then,

201
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,190
and it was amazing. It was like the
Guy's journal audio book version,

202
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:27,911
you know what I mean?

203
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:32,911
And like I could see how he would
pump himself up for the room.

204
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:39,010
Like there was like one nugget in
particular. Like you'd be like, wow,

205
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:41,200
this ochin teach or he'd done,
Ha,

206
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,400
he took treat me like different than all
the other students and whatever he want

207
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:49,430
me to do, he told me to seen in
French. Why he, why he say that? Like,

208
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,990
and then one time he says,
he says on there and Tommy
knows I have to take tapes,

209
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,660
he calls him the secret tapes. James,
I know y'all have secret taste and uh,

210
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,340
yeah. And I say to myself, PR.

211
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,120
And he called himself Pierre and then on
the tape as if somebody else was going

212
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:10,660
to listen to them someday.
This is like 20 years ago,

213
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:15,610
five years before we made the room. So I
say to myself, Pr and then he goes, yeah,

214
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:17,740
we'll have her.
Sometimes I call myself pro

215
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,480
because teacher truly
different. But you know, ah,

216
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:30,481
I think he just sends my power
and he intimidated as we do that.

217
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,750
Whenever I show him,

218
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:36,310
maybe I'll do my own movie or maybe I
start a rock band and I become, you know,

219
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,230
I make rock album or something. Yeah,
exactly. And you can tell from the dry,

220
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,930
you know, the way he dresses,
like pirate vampire, you know,

221
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,810
um, Alice Cooper roadie
or something. But, um,

222
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,000
but they're right there.
It was like,

223
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,750
that is the story of the room in a
nutshell where it was like people say,

224
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,950
telling him he's not going
to make it. People telling
him, you know, he's no good.

225
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,310
And then turning around,
pumping himself up and saying,

226
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:12,370
I will show them and he sorta
did like capitalize on it.

227
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,720
But what's so bizarre is, I mean, I
shouldn't talk about him cause he's,

228
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,040
there are a lot of weird people
that came out of the room. Um,

229
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,890
but other people have come.

230
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:28,670
And like when the room became
a cult hit for being so bad,

231
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,990
other people came out of the woodwork and
tried to take credit for it. And like,

232
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,470
no, I'm the director of the room.
No, I've [inaudible] it's like,

233
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,550
this isn't the Godfather. You
know what I mean? Like, yeah,

234
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,990
exactly. So when you are, so you
have these tapes, you have the book,

235
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:48,890
you have access, obviously him and Greg,
when you're talking to them and you're,

236
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,130
you're starting to develop the film and
you're starting to write it and produce

237
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:55,460
it and come up with how much of it isn't
like embellishment and how much of it

238
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:57,560
was like when you were
trying to craft a story,

239
00:15:57,561 --> 00:16:02,250
you obviously have to make it
into a horror film. We, um,

240
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,340
we,
we always knew from the beginning,

241
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,030
I didn't tell him meaning Tommy,
but that's, that's how you,

242
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:10,910
that story in a second.

243
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,050
But basically I didn't
go to him until later.

244
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,160
I'll get to your question, but he
did have a scene in the film and you,

245
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,520
if you wait till the end of the credits,
it's in there. That was in his contract.

246
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:26,990
That was like the Beer Bartol I'll tell
you. It was bad. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Um,

247
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,270
but the book had this amazing tone where,
um,

248
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,230
what could have been a series of just
anecdotes about how ridiculous to making

249
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:41,750
of that movie was turned out to be
a very moving story about dreamers.

250
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:46,730
As I was saying. And so that was
always our approach. And so we,

251
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,170
um, we didn't hire a Kummete
comedy writers. We hired,
um, Scott and you said it,

252
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:54,340
and Mike Weber, who had done
500 days of summer and, um,

253
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,030
the fault in our stars and just
basically we're so good at capturing

254
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:04,010
relationships and also adapting books.
They were really good at that. And, um,

255
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:09,070
we were lucky to get them like fault
of our stars had just like beat the Tom

256
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,370
Cruise movie at the box office that
weekend and they were like hot as hell.

257
00:17:13,371 --> 00:17:18,290
And uh, but they really liked the stories
we, so that's sort of where it started.

258
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:22,400
And that was our, that was always our
approach. And we always, always, you know,

259
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:24,740
from all of the script readings
and rewrites and everything,

260
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:28,930
we always hammered home like,
this needs to be, you know,

261
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,550
we need to create sympathetic characters.

262
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,230
This needs to be about the relationship.

263
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:36,620
This needs to be a universal story.

264
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:41,550
Even though Tommy is unlike any
other human that's ever existed,

265
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,420
you know. Well, you guys, you guys
bounced. So other people who saw the film,

266
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:46,370
you'll see like,
and I think there's a,

267
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:49,590
there's Mel Brooks had said something
when he was making young Frankenstein.

268
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,220
It was, I just washed out on the
plane here. So phenomenal. I love her.

269
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,260
That's one of my favorite
films and I love Mel Brooks.

270
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,990
And one of the things he'd said, he goes,
if you're going to pair it something,

271
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,740
are you going to make something
kind of a behind the scenes, right?

272
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,570
You really have to,
this is a direct quote,

273
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:05,490
but this is kind of the essence of why
you were saying was you really have to be

274
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:08,820
passionate about the subject and you have
to be pet. You want to make fun of it.

275
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,150
You just want to really keep,
find the story.

276
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:13,580
And because he didn't
make fun of young frankly,

277
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,080
he didn't make fun of Frankenstein
story. He was pretty good, but he really,

278
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:16,980
really cared about it.
Right.

279
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:19,920
And he was able to make and find the
heart there and stuff and it gets kind of

280
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:24,030
what you did in a way. I mean, yeah,
we can talk to young Frankenstein.

281
00:18:24,031 --> 00:18:26,310
Gene Wilder is so amazing.
I think.

282
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,460
I think what I think also gene is a
huge part of that because he's got this

283
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,870
weird uncanniness about him
where just want to laugh,

284
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:41,380
but he's also taking it so seriously.
Even so he's a little scary too. And that,

285
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,140
that kind of thing. And
um, yeah, with Tommy, like

286
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,810
we didn't embellish, you know, we um,

287
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:58,170
we even considered like pudding footage
of the real Tommy at the beginning of

288
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:04,141
the film because anybody that hadn't
seen the room might see me come on screen

289
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:08,890
and be like, yeah, Franco,
wow. Big swing there bro.

290
00:19:08,891 --> 00:19:13,450
Like a little over the top and tell me
how you open the phone cause are you open

291
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:15,580
for them with that? That was a really,
really smart for people who have,

292
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,630
we've been talking heads.
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Um,

293
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,880
like Jj Abrams and a whole bunch of,
yeah.

294
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,860
Keegan Michael Key and down the break
bride and got a lot of their experience

295
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:28,710
with real actors talking about,
um,

296
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:33,130
their experience of walk
watching the room. And, um,

297
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,800
that was, uh, yeah, it was a way
to sort of say, hey, this is real,

298
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,900
real people like us. And like, yeah,
it's funny having Jj Abrams in there.

299
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:44,650
It was like the,

300
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,830
cause there's a lot of comedians that
actually are huge fans of the room.

301
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,540
But then having Jj,
everyone's in there.

302
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:53,530
We always know like when he gets that
moment, like if the audiences with us,

303
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:58,410
cause they're like, oh my God, Jj Abrams
is talking about this thing. You know. Um,

304
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,530
and it's,

305
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:04,530
it's amazing the people that love like
Lin Manuel Miranda started emailing me

306
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:09,520
like, oh bro, I can't wait for
your movie that I love the room.

307
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:12,310
Like we were getting,
have him at the beginning,

308
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,730
but he was shooting Mary Poppins or
something. Alignments. London. You

309
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,770
as a director,

310
00:20:17,771 --> 00:20:20,730
what did you learn from previous directing
experiences and from this that you'll,

311
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,401
that you learned,

312
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:23,890
that you took to this film that you
learned on this film that you'll take to

313
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:28,880
your next film? Right. Good. Good.

314
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:33,850
Sorry. Got It. I got it. What I did,
and I did learn a lot on this film. Um,

315
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,960
this has been these past two years
working on this and on that, the HBO show,

316
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:41,810
the Deuce have been incredible
learning experiences for me.

317
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:46,610
And I'll say it's a very simple
thing and can be applied to,

318
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:51,140
um, I think any, any profession and um,

319
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,170
especially creative professions.

320
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:57,250
But I basically had producers on
both of those films that were,

321
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,260
um, better than I was or smarter
than I, I was very, you know,

322
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,320
more experience in a certain kind of
filmmaking or television producing than I

323
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:10,240
was. And you know, and David Simon, I had,

324
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,330
I guess you could say a certifiable genus.

325
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,070
He's a MacArthur award
winner. And, uh, um,

326
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,520
and you know, having his writing
but also guidance and, and,

327
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:26,140
and his team and everybody on that,
you know,

328
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,630
just made me incredibly responsible.
I did have to have, I think, you know,

329
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:33,340
I,
I've directed a lot and I,

330
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:37,270
and a lot of indie little weird things
and some more successful than others,

331
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:41,980
but I think that was my,
in a way, apprenticeship.

332
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,250
I don't think I would've been able to
direct for Hbo if I didn't kind of put

333
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:50,020
that grind in. But then melding
that experience with, you know,

334
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,800
a very smart and talented producer,
um,

335
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:59,410
on both films really helped. And that
was the, that was basically the big,

336
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,940
big lesson for me, like work with people
that are better than I am. Um, yeah.

337
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,830
And uh, I don't continue
to do that. And um, and I,

338
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:12,700
and I, and I try to, I try to do that
kind of pay it forward thing too. I mean,

339
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:14,930
it was one of the reasons
I, you know, talk, you know,

340
00:22:14,931 --> 00:22:19,140
it was to sort of give
opportunities back to that idea.

341
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,550
Yep.
Great.

342
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,700
Wanda, where the art is defined by
the artist or the audience. Yeah.

343
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,300
I'd love to know your thoughts
as an artist if, for example,

344
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:33,280
your movie or anything that you created,

345
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:35,680
what to be interpreted
differently by the audience.

346
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:42,400
Yeah. If something I write, write was
interpreted differently than I intended.

347
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,650
Yeah, exactly. I mean that was the,

348
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,670
there were two main aspects of this
bizarre story or history of the room that

349
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:52,930
really interested us.

350
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:58,110
A what I talked about where it was a
strangely in spur inspirational story of

351
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:01,660
dreamers following their dream.

352
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:06,661
But the second half is sort of what
you're talking about where the room was,

353
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,800
is not good by any conventional standards.
You know, the acting is not good.

354
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:12,520
The writings,

355
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,520
it's like as if a alien from another
planet came down and tried to depict human

356
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:24,390
life. It's like there, but like
everything's all off, you know.

357
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,950
And on the other hand,

358
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,260
it's still playing 14 and a half
years later to sold out audiences.

359
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,290
Um, and almost every major city.
I mean, I was just in London,

360
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:39,310
like people love it in London. They
plays in Paris and Tokyo and it's like,

361
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,840
so there's undeniably something that
people are getting from this movie.

362
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:48,200
They keep going back to it.
And it's not just, I don't,

363
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:52,840
I believe that it's not just the bizarre,
you know,

364
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:56,440
creative decisions at every turn.
That there's something underneath it.

365
00:23:56,441 --> 00:23:59,980
And I think it's partly, you know, Tommy's
passion. I think that, you know, the,

366
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:05,330
the magic sauce is that Tommy
put his heart and soul into it.

367
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,330
Um,
now whether it's that

368
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,740
it makes us feel a little
superior that, you know, you know,

369
00:24:13,741 --> 00:24:18,330
somebody tried so hard and fell
on his face and sort of that,

370
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,520
you know,
concept of comedy of like,

371
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:23,520
why do we laugh it somebody that
slips on a banana peel. Well,

372
00:24:23,521 --> 00:24:26,280
because it's not us.
On the other hand,

373
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,490
when I go to the room screenings
and especially when Tommy's there,

374
00:24:29,491 --> 00:24:32,610
it's not a cruel atmosphere,
you know,

375
00:24:32,611 --> 00:24:36,150
it's a communal atmosphere and
Tommy sort of a part of that.

376
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:41,151
He's the weird with Jewish in that kind
of gives permission for the laughter by

377
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,410
putting on this very affable arrogance,
you know,

378
00:24:46,411 --> 00:24:47,790
so that we can kind of laugh.

379
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:49,800
I don't know whether he's aware
of what he's doing or not,

380
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:54,030
but I think that's one of
the keys to it. And, um,

381
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,690
anyway,
you,

382
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,040
I think it does, you know,
the room does sort of, um,

383
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:08,070
challenge conventional criteria of
success and artistic success and that,

384
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:15,340
that in a way, Tommy is a
outsider artist, I guess. And, um,

385
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,520
and I've watched the room as much or
more than any other movie, you know, uh,

386
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:25,030
in, in my life. And, uh, so there's
value there. There's, you know,

387
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:29,090
there's something there. And,
um, and if art is, you know,

388
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:33,880
a way to reflect on ourselves and
show us ourselves and all that,

389
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:36,760
I think,
I think the room really does do that.

390
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:41,680
I'll be at in a upside down cracked
mirror. That's why, you know,

391
00:25:41,681 --> 00:25:46,300
like a fun house mirror. But,
um, but it still does that. Yeah.

392
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,360
Thank you. And we can only
do two more. Sorry guys.

393
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,240
So what was it like acting
in a movie with your brother?

394
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:57,010
And do you have any favorite moments
from this movie? My brother is,

395
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:01,720
uh, the best. Dave Franco. Um,
he's seven years younger than I am.

396
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:05,290
We grew up in, on together.
I went out to Hollywood to,

397
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,610
to be an actor first and then he
came out and um, when he got there,

398
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,790
we lived together for a while.
He went to USC and then, um,

399
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:17,920
he's like three credits
short of graduating. Uh, um,

400
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,310
and, uh, he lived with me and, uh,

401
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:25,540
then seduce my two cats
and stolen away. Uh, uh,

402
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,160
anyway, he for a while, um,

403
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:37,300
for about seven years needed,
wanted to get out from my shadow.

404
00:26:37,301 --> 00:26:39,150
And I guess a lot of people
asked him like, you know,

405
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,230
what's it like being James
Franco's brawler and you know,

406
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:44,820
that's what he'd constantly here. And
so he wouldn't act with me a lot. Um,

407
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:46,680
we did some funny or die videos,

408
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,130
in fact in that apartment
that we lived in together, um,

409
00:26:50,131 --> 00:26:54,390
where I played a ridiculous acting
coach and he played my student.

410
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:58,230
And that was actually
when I read the book.

411
00:26:58,231 --> 00:27:03,231
That was kind of the seed for the
relationship in the disaster artist.

412
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:05,040
And I knew just from,

413
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:09,030
from making those videos that we have
the right dynamic in addition to having

414
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,440
our, you know, brotherly connection that
would be right for the Greg and Tommy.

415
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,260
We also had done this,
those videos,

416
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:20,660
and I thought that that's basically
Tommy and Greg in a way. Um,

417
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,310
anyway, I've asked him to do
other movies and he said no,

418
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,120
partly sometimes because he, you
know, again, didn't want to, you know,

419
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,960
be considered James Franco's little
brother, but other times I guess,

420
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:38,760
cause my movies were too
bizarre. And, uh, so finally,

421
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:44,070
uh, I had the, I read that book
and I was like, this is the one,

422
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:46,950
he cannot say no to this. Sorry. And, um,

423
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,370
and he was smart enough to say yes and,
and it was great.

424
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,450
I mean it was incredible. I on
the other hand, he and I have,

425
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:59,570
we have not had a fight in,
um, probably 20 years. Um,

426
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,600
so we get along really well and he's
younger than I am, but I, but he's,

427
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:08,760
he's pretty wise and um, I defer
to him a lot. So it works out.

428
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,810
We should say a quick follow up to that.
You could recreate it like 26 minutes,

429
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,130
right?
Yes.

430
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,240
We recreated scenes in our movie and
that kind of will connect to the Tommy

431
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:22,140
scene.
Um,

432
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,580
cause we have it premiere scene in our
film and we needed footage to go up on

433
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:32,400
the screen while our
characters are watching. Right.

434
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,640
And so we always knew we had to
recreate some scenes from the room.

435
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,010
We threw ourselves into that. That was
one of the most fun parts of it. Um,

436
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,420
and, uh, we like, you know, everybody,

437
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:47,550
all the departments heads
threw themselves into it.

438
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,460
The cinematographer Brandon
Trust, like, you know,

439
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:55,230
spent more time like recreating the
bad lighting than he did doing his good

440
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:58,120
lighting. And, you know, the
costume designer Brendan Aben,

441
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:03,190
like found all the perfect
materials for the costumes and, uh,

442
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,910
Chris Spelman, production
designer, you know,

443
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,900
studied the room and the behind the
scenes of the room and got their sets

444
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:14,750
exactly. And all that. And then the actors
would watch it, like shot by shot, uh,

445
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,600
and like mimic every movement
and, and Seth Rogan and I
actually had practice, um,

446
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,550
unintentionally. You know, we, um,

447
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:29,160
we had done a recreation of Kanye
west bound to video like yours before.

448
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,450
And, and we realized on that, oh,
you know, we just thought like, oh,

449
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:37,170
we'll just do like a minute of
it. And then we're like, oh wait,

450
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:40,050
we can do this whole thing. Like it's
just a motorcycle and a green screen.

451
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:43,990
We can do this whole.
And then started really getting into it.

452
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:48,850
So we kind of had practice and so it
was sort of our dessert. Like we would,

453
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:53,170
we would shoot our regular scenes
in the main part of the day.

454
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:55,960
And then we got done early. It was
like, oh, we can do more of the room.

455
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,250
Recreation's like,
oh,

456
00:29:57,251 --> 00:30:01,030
which ones do we want to do now all you're
tearing me apart, Lisa, or whatever.

457
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,550
And so,
um,

458
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,140
yeah,

459
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,110
so we did a ton of them
and, and, and then we read,

460
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,740
we were so proud of how close
we, we got it. We're like, oh,

461
00:30:10,741 --> 00:30:14,040
we should do a side by side at the,
in the credit. That's phenomenal.

462
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,420
That wasn't in the original
plan. And so we had it, um,

463
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,740
negotiated for Tommy's room footage,
the actual room footage.

464
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:28,290
And so we had shot the scene with Tommy,
you know,

465
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,880
because it was in his contract.

466
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,190
He kept insisting that it
be opposite me and I kept,

467
00:30:35,191 --> 00:30:38,520
I tried to explain Tommy, it's not going
to make sense. You know, I'm playing you.

468
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:42,510
What I couldn't say to him was like,
Tommy,

469
00:30:42,511 --> 00:30:45,240
I know you can't play
anything other than yourself.

470
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,510
Like he might be drawn on.
Um,

471
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,860
he sent me this photograph before,
three days before he shot and he was like,

472
00:30:52,861 --> 00:30:56,410
glasses. He was in Lens crafters. I
saw the glasses behind. He's like, why?

473
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,960
Why do you think of glasses for, you know,
character? I'm like, they're great man.

474
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:04,660
They're nobody will know it's
you. And then he, and then he, uh,

475
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,410
had drawn on a mustache in big pan.
Right?

476
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,750
And so what you, if you like mustache,
I grow it on, I draw it on battery.

477
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:20,400
When we shoot, I'm like, I'll
give you a fake mustache.

478
00:31:20,401 --> 00:31:24,760
So he showed up, we did that scene
and then we're like, all right,

479
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:29,720
get that out of there. But then when we
were negotiating for the room footage,

480
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:34,110
he's like, well how am I seeing? And
somebody told him it's not in there.

481
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,560
And he's like,
well you won't fudge.

482
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:39,980
Then you'd have to pull my scene in the
movie. And we're like, no. And then,

483
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,570
and then we were like, oh, it will be
perfect at the end of the credits. Yeah.

484
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,070
Cause it won't be part of the main thing.

485
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:51,960
It will be this weird David Lynch thing.
And he still says to me like we,

486
00:31:51,961 --> 00:31:55,440
you know, he saw for the first time at
south by southwest and then Toronto in it.

487
00:31:55,441 --> 00:31:58,950
Every time it'd be like, y'all, I say
my scene, she'll be a little earlier.

488
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,970
Like it's good as good.
Leaving the perfect real quick.

489
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:06,530
I'm sorry,

490
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,363
that was

491
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,180
in 2013 you wrote this really great
book review of it. Does that, yes, yes,

492
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,350
yes. Uh, it, it,

493
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,360
you described Tommy is being sort of part
dreamer part Edward and Park West van

494
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,910
Pyre.
Um,

495
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,320
but you also talked about
how you resonated with his
story of like struggling to

496
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:30,500
have this creative vision and make it,
you know, come through to fruition.

497
00:32:30,501 --> 00:32:34,450
Can you talk a little bit more about
similarities between you and Tommy's

498
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,293
journey?

499
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,150
Okay,

500
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:41,270
totally. And at the end of the
article I, Tommy Wise Oh, same wall.

501
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,000
And um, what, um,

502
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,160
in the article I said, and I wrote it
before I even had the rights to the book,

503
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:51,590
I just loved the book so much and I said,

504
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:57,010
I totally respect Tommy because you
know how many thousands or millions of

505
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:01,230
people have come to Hollywood
to make it in and they don't.

506
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:04,400
And it's a really hard business,
you know? Um, and Tommy God,

507
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:07,070
his movie made against all the odds and I,

508
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,270
and I respect him so much for that.
On the other hand,

509
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:16,540
he went to work in what I consider a
collaborative medium and he did not know

510
00:33:17,511 --> 00:33:22,190
how to collaborate. Now look,
I totally understand it.

511
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:26,690
Like that guy was told no his whole life.
I mean,

512
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:30,810
not even like probably even before the
movie business. Like, I'm sure these just,

513
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,660
you know, just rejected his
whole life. And so, I mean,

514
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:39,960
especially if he looks like a pirate mixed
with a vampire and he says, well, I'm,

515
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:44,900
I'm the nuts of James Dean.
Like, you know, most people
are going to be like, uh,

516
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,840
no you ain't. And uh, and,

517
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,900
and so he just learned
through the experience of
rejection that the only person

518
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:57,440
he could ever depend on with
himself and maybe his friend Greg.

519
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,860
And so when he got on set, he didn't know
how to shut that off. That's self will.

520
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,410
And um,

521
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,910
and so he did make a disaster of a movie
or it didn't make the movie that he

522
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:12,440
intended. On the other
hand, you know, as we know,

523
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:14,350
then the little second,
you know,

524
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:19,310
chapter of his saga is that it became
this ironic success. And so in fact,

525
00:34:19,311 --> 00:34:22,250
he could never,
he like never hit a wall.

526
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:27,200
Like he's just in some
weird trajectory into Tommy.

527
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,840
He talks about Tommy's planet,

528
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:33,770
like he is on Tommy's planet
because he never hit a wall. He now,

529
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:37,310
you know,
a normal artist would make something.

530
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:42,670
And if he made all the wrong decisions
at like wouldn't be what he intended.

531
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:47,660
And then he'd like be like, Oh
man, I didn't make what I wanted.

532
00:34:47,661 --> 00:34:49,340
I guess I should do it
differently next time.

533
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:53,570
Tommy never got that because it
became this weird success. Anyway.

534
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,200
I always, you know, when I wrote
the review I thought, okay,

535
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:01,370
I can relate to Tommy's drive and you
know, wanting to get something done.

536
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:05,420
But I like to consider myself a, a
collaborative person than I am, you know,

537
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:09,590
I was even up until these past
couple of years to a certain extent,

538
00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:14,591
but in other ways I too was very self
willed and blind to how I was proceeding.

539
00:35:16,321 --> 00:35:21,260
And it's funny, like there are a lot
I can go, I can Google, you know,

540
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:24,350
a lot my, my name if I
want to do, I, I had to,

541
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:28,150
I had to stop googling my name
years ago, about five years ago. Uh,

542
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,610
that's a thing by the way.
Uh, yeah, don't Google it.

543
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,110
You're addicted to Google
and yourself. I, I,

544
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:38,080
I've been off at about five
years now. And, um, um,

545
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,880
but I could go do it and
get a lot of headlines like,

546
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,350
what's James Franco doing now? What's he
doing now? And like, I should have heard,

547
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:50,580
you know,
some sort of message a while ago.

548
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,360
I did hear it finally and, and
it was like, all right dude,

549
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:57,210
just slow down,
you know,

550
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:00,600
listened to the people
around you that are,

551
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,370
that are smart and know how to do this
thing, you know, in a different way. And,

552
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:09,710
um, and so I guess what I learned
later when I said Tommy wise though,

553
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,870
same why he was same,
won a lot more ways than I,

554
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:17,640
than I had liked to look at or
admit. Great. Thank you. Uh,

555
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:20,400
so we need to wrap up, but uh,
in 10 seconds, what would Tommy,

556
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,160
how time explained Google.
Okay.

557
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,320
Yeah.
Google,

558
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:38,710
you know what he's saying? He say,
I'm in the room. He's like, you know,

559
00:36:38,711 --> 00:36:42,220
the, um, the computer business,
it's very competitive.

560
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,920
If you didn't know or something
like that. Yeah. If you didn't know,

561
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,550
