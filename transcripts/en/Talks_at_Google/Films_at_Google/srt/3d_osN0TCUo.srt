1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,873
Yeah.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,500
Hello and welcome the toxic Google.
I'm Kevin Dog.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,730
I'm Rebecca Prozan and we're here today
to talk about the new movie free held

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,280
and we have Ellen page and Julianne Moore.

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,770
So, uh, you know this, this story is,

6
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:29,360
it's a beautiful love story that tells
the story of a true story of a Lowell

7
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:34,010
Hester, uh, who is a very
decorated, well known,

8
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,810
respected a police
officer, a detective, uh,

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,850
in New Jersey and develops lung cancer
and it's stage four and wants to pass her

10
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:50,300
benefits onto Stacy, uh, her partner
Stacy, and is not allowed to.

11
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:52,160
So it's about that
struggle and that fight,

12
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,160
trying to get that approval
from the freeholders, this
governing council. So, um,

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,620
very, very powerful story. And I
kind of want to talk about, um,

14
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,050
just what led you both to this project.

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,350
Sure. Um, okay. Well, when
I was a, a freehold, uh,

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,180
there's a documentary with the
same name made by Cynthia Wade,

17
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:12,500
which is incredible,

18
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:17,480
and you should check it out and won an
Oscar in 2008 for best short subject.

19
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,220
So shortly after that,

20
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:22,520
Michael Shamberg and Stacey share
producers on the project sent me the

21
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:26,390
documentary and asked if I would
like to attach myself to play Stacy.

22
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,540
And I watched it and I was weeping.

23
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:34,130
I was so moved and I said
yes immediately. Um, and,

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,420
and then they were very gracious and
generous and involve me in the development

25
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:39,021
process.

26
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:43,340
And so we found why not run a nice one
or about the screenplay and then Pete

27
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:43,970
solid.

28
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,160
And then Julie.
Yeah,

29
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,270
we're involved for seven years.
You're a producer on the film as well.

30
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:54,870
So I'm the casting of just Juliane.
So what stage was that then?

31
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,070
That was a, I mean, that was when

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,080
we were shooting the film a year ago.
And you said yes in February.

33
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:07,160
Yeah. So this time last year we were
actually shooting, um, in, in New York,

34
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:07,431
but yeah,

35
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:12,431
it was February when I first met
with Pete and talk to Ellen and yeah,

36
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,360
so it wasn't that long ago. Really?
Year and a half or so. Yeah,

37
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,050
I guess there are thousands of same
sex couples that have had similar,

38
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:23,020
unfortunately some with
situations to this with,

39
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:26,930
there's something about the story itself
for the documentary when you saw it

40
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:29,600
that like you just said, like the
light bulb went off in, you're like,

41
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:33,440
I have to do this. Wow. Well, the
documentary is, is pretty extraordinary.

42
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:34,880
I think the degree of,

43
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,680
of intimacy with which you
experience it is, is unusual.

44
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:44,681
The fact that they allowed a documentarian
in their home every single day that

45
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,320
during the last year of
Laurel's life is, is, uh, it's,

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,260
it's very unusual. So I think
you, I think you get a, uh,

47
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,650
a palpable sense of who they are and
what they were up against and what,

48
00:02:57,651 --> 00:03:01,480
and how and what screw Urbanation
really means. You know, what, what,

49
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,150
what are the costs of, of, uh,

50
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,690
of something that seems innately political
when you realize that they're talking

51
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:08,800
about listing their house

52
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,890
and specifically as it relates to
the detective, your character. Um,

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,330
she seems like, because
I saw it on Monday, yeah.

54
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,280
That she would be sort of a
difficult character to get to know.

55
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:26,200
And to learn about, um, she's complex.
Yes. She's a little distant. Um,

56
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,520
she's a cop and not someone who was
necessarily forthcoming about who she is.

57
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,540
How did you wrap your head around that as
an actress? Well, interestingly enough,

58
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,310
the cop part was the hardest part for me.

59
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,830
The relationship part was
easy. I mean, you know, that,

60
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:44,160
that I understand that's something I think
we're all familiar with, you know, who,

61
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,020
how you fall in love with somebody and
build a life with them. But for me,

62
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:50,440
being a police officer was
really, really different. And,

63
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,550
and of course I had the Laurel
and the doc, you know, um, and I,

64
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:58,230
so I had the Laurel who was not well,
but I did not know the Laurel who,

65
00:03:58,231 --> 00:04:02,980
who was healthy. And that was really
provided to me by Stacy Andre herself,

66
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:06,430
who opened her home to us and showed
us all these newspaper clippings and

67
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:10,240
photographs and um,
and shared her memories.

68
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:15,100
And also Dane Wells who was, uh, Laurel's
partner, police partner and boils,

69
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,500
brother and sister.
And so with all of that information,

70
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:21,600
I was able to kind of figure out
who the, who that Laurel was. And,

71
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,040
and what was interesting
is that, that the, I think,

72
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,100
I think because she was such a,
she was such a police officer,

73
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,300
really believed in justice system,
really believed in doing the right thing,

74
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,720
that kind of moral fiber
or the her ethics. We're,

75
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:38,320
we're truly what drove her to do the
right thing for the woman that she loves.

76
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,640
And, you know, is there, obviously
this is, you know, based on true story,

77
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:45,880
these are real characters.
Is there a sense of fear or you know,

78
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:50,590
real responsibility because
you are adapting and you
are actually acting as real

79
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,500
people who really existed
and do still exist? For sure.

80
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,990
I think we all felt a sense
of responsibility and, um,

81
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:03,380
you know, wanted, you know,
Stacy and Dane to feel, um,

82
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,600
safe essentially to,
to,

83
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,520
to have them know that our goal is to
make something as truthful and as honest

84
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:13,690
and as authentic as possible.
Um, and so we always just,

85
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,400
we would text Stacy or,
you know, communicate with
her while we were shooting,

86
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:22,410
and then she came to sat for a day she's
in, you can see her in the film at, uh,

87
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,900
at the end, at a certain
point. And Yeah. So, um,

88
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,880
I think you feel a sense of responsibility
and that's probably what we put most

89
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,230
of our thought into,
I would say.

90
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,020
Yeah. Yeah. I think you've
touched on this a little bit,

91
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:39,850
but how involved was she in
the development of the film?
Was she, you know, onset?

92
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,990
Were you asking her for advice?
Like how did that work? She was,

93
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,940
she was really involved. I mean, she a
run nice one or spent a lot of time, uh,

94
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:56,050
the screen screenwriter with Stacy and
with Dane and with Stephen Goldstein has

95
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,570
Steve Carell plays and, um, and then she,

96
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,070
we both spent a lot of time with
her and she was just so, um,

97
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,570
kind to us. And as you
can imagine, a lot of, uh,

98
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,300
the conversations are
difficult and emotional.

99
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:14,900
You know the ones about the good times
and the ones about the difficult times

100
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:19,640
and it's all, um, you know, her having
to bring that back up to the surface.

101
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,990
It's sorta interesting cause she's also
seems unwilling to participate through

102
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:27,950
the movie. So it's almost sweet that
she, maybe that's not the right word,

103
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:31,160
but that and compelling that
she was so participatory.

104
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,460
Well I think it truly is a reflection of
her love and dedication towards Laurel

105
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,020
and Cindy Wade when she's making the
documentary. Did ask Laurel, you know,

106
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,710
how would you feel if people
would want to fictionalize this?

107
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:49,070
Like is that something that you'd be
willing to give the the rights to?

108
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:53,060
And she was like, as if someone would want
to do that, of course was her response.

109
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,370
But um,
she was absolutely,

110
00:06:55,371 --> 00:07:00,110
I would want as many people as possible
and know about our story and what you

111
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:01,370
know,
and the community goes through

112
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,000
doing your research, you know, on Laurel
and Stacy and their story and Dane and,

113
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,200
and everything. You know what's
really, you're watching a film,

114
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:13,540
but you have to keep in the back of
mind that this actually happened.

115
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:17,530
This is a real story. And what's, what's
really gut wrenching to think too,

116
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:22,510
is that not only were they fighting cancer
and they were fighting, um, you know,

117
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,580
not just marriage,
gay marriage,

118
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,500
it was marriage equality and they allowed
a documentary film and directly to

119
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:33,500
come into their lives. So can you
talk about just meeting, you know,

120
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,090
Stacy and talking with them about what
brought that decision and was like, yeah,

121
00:07:37,091 --> 00:07:40,420
we're okay with this, that the last
year of my life, our lives together,

122
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,433
we're going to do this.

123
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,460
It was Dane who really spearheaded it.
I mean,

124
00:07:44,461 --> 00:07:49,160
that's what's interesting is that Dane,
um, I think came into their lives and,

125
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,010
and wanted to have a sense of outrage
about how they were being treated and

126
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:55,110
wanted to, to make a
difference. And so he had,

127
00:07:55,111 --> 00:07:59,580
he began to organize the press
coverage of, of their fight.

128
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,970
And he was the one that fielded the
calls from film makers and, and he,

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,810
he brought Cynthia Wade to them because
he liked the way Cynthia sounded on the,

130
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,680
on her, on his answering
machine. So I think that,

131
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:14,460
I think probably the least acquiescent
partner was Stacy because she was just

132
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,890
trying to take care of Laurel. Um, but,

133
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,750
but I think that they began to feel
compelled to do the right thing simply

134
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,240
because of what was happening.
But, but I think without Dane,

135
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:26,100
I don't know that this
all would have happened.

136
00:08:26,101 --> 00:08:30,120
He really was quite heroic and really,
really protective of them.

137
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,640
Their story.
You talked about this earlier to join,

138
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:36,440
but for both of you,
um,

139
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,760
this movie is about Justice
and Equality and, um,

140
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,810
and really same sex marriage or same
set and rights for same sex couples.

141
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,970
Um, did you think it was interesting
that Laurel said time and time again?

142
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:52,610
I'm not fighting for marriage.
I'm funding for quality.

143
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,240
I love that about her. I mean, I love
that she to be political about something.

144
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:00,990
She was like, she was not there to
do what Steven Goldstein wanted,

145
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:02,550
which they needed.
They both needed each other.

146
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:06,030
Clearly I'm Laurel and Stacy needed
Stephen Goldstein to bring attention to

147
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:09,810
their cause and Stephen Goldstein
wanted them to, to, to, uh,

148
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,720
move his agenda forward. And they
knew that. And I think there was that,

149
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:17,490
there was not, um, it, it was an
uneasy alliance. Would they both,

150
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:22,110
they both wanted different things. And,
and as I said, the, I think it was,

151
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,190
I think it was Laurel's ethics that
made her say, no, this is, I'm not,

152
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,420
I'm not fighting for a political movement.
I'm fighting for what is fair.

153
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,250
You know, Edie Windsor, sad, you know,

154
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:36,600
Laurel Hester is a hero for asking to
be treated exactly like everybody else.

155
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,280
So I think that those, I think those
degrees were, were important to her, that,

156
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:46,260
that distinction that what they,
that legally they should have had this,

157
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:50,130
it was only a loophole in
the law that allowed the,

158
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:54,000
the benefits to be decided by the county
core zine just had kind of not close

159
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:54,834
that loophole.

160
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,080
Yeah. And so, and you know,
it's such a beautiful,

161
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,120
beautiful movie and a great movie where
you're asking people who have these

162
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:06,010
certain beliefs,
these free holders essentially,

163
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:08,440
and there's millions of them
like them where it's, it's,

164
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,040
we're not asking you to
even just believe in this.

165
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,410
We're actually asking you
just for your support. Right.

166
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,060
And so it's like we're not
trying to change your beliefs.

167
00:10:16,061 --> 00:10:17,200
If you believe one thing,
that's fine.

168
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,680
So how were they able to succeed in that
with the freeholders where it was like,

169
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,330
you have to accept this?
You know,

170
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,520
I think it was just all the
pressures, pressure every, you know,

171
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,570
when it was happening to
every county around, um,

172
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,790
ocean county. Yeah. You fixed
the loophole. And so that,

173
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,470
and they were just surrounded and the
pressure was strong and they, of course,

174
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:44,400
I called them and say like,
you know, this is enough.

175
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,290
It's embarrassing. You know? So,
yeah, but it was political. Yeah.

176
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,420
And it's true in the, if you've seen
the film for those who've seen the film,

177
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:52,610
like for example,
when the,

178
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,120
the certain freeholder like doesn't
show up to the meeting. That was true.

179
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:59,760
And he was like on vacation,
but he wasn't. And you know,

180
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,260
so it's all very accurate
to what happened.

181
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,880
Um, Ellen, this movie,

182
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,350
it's a powerful statement about changing
hearts and minds and during the seven

183
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:15,330
years sort of the country changed
with the production of the movie. Um,

184
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,540
polls consistently show more
support for civil rights. Right.

185
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,730
Did that change,

186
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,750
did that see change sort of
change how you marketed the movie?

187
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,400
Thought about who should be in the movie?

188
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:30,990
Anything about like how it was produced
or anything about, I don't know.

189
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,100
So at all actually. Yeah,
I know. I mean, we were,

190
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,040
we were always trying to make
the movie we're trying to make,

191
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,680
which was an honest, you
know, reflection of their,

192
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,580
their experience and what
has been actually interesting
and watching it even at

193
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:46,670
the premiere recently,
sort of after, you know,

194
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,470
a lot of the backlash post,
the recent awesome supreme court decision,

195
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,130
there was like all of these sort of new,
there's

196
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,810
definitely new things that I,

197
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,920
I was noticing sort of after a lot of
the dialogue that's been happening.

198
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,540
Um,
but no,

199
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:06,340
I don't think anything was necessarily
adjusted or changed in any way.

200
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,910
What were some of your favorite scenes
to shoot together and some of the most

201
00:12:10,911 --> 00:12:12,740
toughest ones to, cause
I, you know, there's this,

202
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,280
I love this thing at the
beginning, just the, you know,
hey, can I have your number?

203
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:19,490
And you know, yeah. Have the writing
on the arm. It's so cute. It's like,

204
00:12:19,491 --> 00:12:23,810
you're like, oh, okay. You know, when you
go there and it's absolutely adorable,

205
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:26,890
you know, and it's in the tray.
It's, it's great. So what was the,

206
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,260
I mean that's mine, but like what
were your favorite scenes to shoot?

207
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,163
It's about Megan

208
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,370
really.
So what were some of the elements,

209
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,600
but also what were the most complicated?
One's the toughest one. The shoot.

210
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:43,010
We loved it all. We did. I mean,
honestly, it was such a delight to,

211
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:46,910
to go to work every day and to have Ellen
there as my partner onscreen and off.

212
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:51,260
And I think just being
together, um, I never felt,

213
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,330
um, we just, when we were just a team,
you know, so everything felt like a,

214
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,160
something that we were maneuvering.
And we were discovering. Yeah. Yeah.

215
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,600
You really were. But I
mean, that being said,

216
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:06,740
I always liked the happy stuff better than
the set stuff. Yeah. You know, I love,

217
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:08,510
my favorite thing was the date,
you know,

218
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:10,550
where she brings me with a soda
and I have to say, you know,

219
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:13,880
I'm older than you when she was like, Oh
yeah, whatever. And then we dance and,

220
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,520
and it was just a really fun,
fun, beautiful night. Um,

221
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,680
and we'd gotten to know each other very
well that we shot that near the end of

222
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:24,890
the shoot. And it was great to shoot
a scene where you're falling in love,

223
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,160
you know, but also not that I'm
trying to run away the conversation,

224
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,760
but also even in the really
emotional stuff to have,

225
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,760
have Ellen there as, as a partner in
that same way, just allowed us to,

226
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,880
to, I don't know, it allow,

227
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,310
we'd had a wonderful shared experience
with it and you when it was tough. Well,

228
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:46,550
I can tell you they're going to be a lot
of jokes about spike drama for years to

229
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:49,250
come. Spiked, Huh? Oh yeah.
Yeah. What's funny is I,

230
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,190
I gave that tee shirt to my friends.
But yeah.

231
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,890
How has this movie changed you?
Both of you.

232
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,820
I have a new friend

233
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,060
every meeting. No, I can't, I can't, you
can't say that about every movie. I mean,

234
00:14:08,061 --> 00:14:09,440
I can,
I go to movies and I have,

235
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,630
I can have great relationships
with the people that I work with.

236
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:15,200
I don't necessarily come away with like
a new friend and I genuinely did on this

237
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:20,180
one. But I also feel, and this was
something that I was surprised by myself,

238
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,140
that I don't think I have really
a full understanding of what it,

239
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,200
how painful it was to be closeted and
then have to deal with a public to come

240
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:33,350
out publicly on a, on a, on
a big platform to, you know,

241
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:35,090
I don't think somebody said to me,
are you kidding?

242
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:37,460
You must've known lots of people
have come out. And I'm like, yeah,

243
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,440
but a long time ago, I'm old, you know,

244
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,760
everyone's kind of been in
their lives and it's been,

245
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,650
it's been a while since I've
experienced somebody doing it sort of.

246
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:52,160
So recently in with and,
and, and publicly and

247
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,750
it, and it certainly raised my
awareness and deepen my compassion.

248
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,450
Yeah,

249
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,600
no. When you're on the project
for seven years too, so did, was,

250
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,910
was there a lot of change
with you with that and just,

251
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,950
just your perspective on everything?

252
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,243
Yup.

253
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,370
Yeah. So I mean, when I was attached
to the movie, when I was 21,

254
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:13,980
I was in very closet. I was
very closeted person, you know,

255
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:18,450
and be embarrassed to say how
closeted I was. And, um, it is,

256
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,390
I will say it was when I reflect back,

257
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:23,550
it really does blow my mind.

258
00:15:23,551 --> 00:15:27,750
Like how much my personal story did
correlate in parallel with the development

259
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:30,420
of this. And that being said,
it would have to, you know,

260
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:35,160
it feel wildly inappropriate to be
a closeted actor playing this role.

261
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,670
Um, and, um, you know,
more than that, it is,

262
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,970
it's people like Laurlynn Stacy that
inspire you to do the right thing for

263
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:48,570
yourself,
for your emotional wellbeing and life,

264
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,680
and to be a visible person
for the community. You know,

265
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:57,710
they dealt with the really horrific
situation and really stood up.

266
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,460
And, uh, what makes,

267
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,160
allows me the privileges that I now have
in my life that shouldn't be taken for

268
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:06,150
granted.
So.

269
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,190
Yup. And we'll start taking
audience questions if you
guys wanna start lining up.

270
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,010
Um, but you know, another
interesting thing,

271
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:14,530
I was watching the movie too and then
you have the documentary as well,

272
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:17,290
but in the development of
it or the writing of it, um,

273
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,190
was there anything that you
want to include it in the
movie but couldn't because

274
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:24,400
of time constraints or it didn't really
match with the film and it was like,

275
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,930
this is a really,
really important,

276
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:27,940
or this is a really interesting
part but just doesn't fit.

277
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,030
There was some,
I don't know any,

278
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,100
there were at certain point I
feel like the script is, you know,

279
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:37,710
it was longer and then you
are limited by your budget.

280
00:16:37,711 --> 00:16:39,900
You're limited by the days
you'll have to shoot, et cetera.

281
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:42,600
Like I can remember
where you did go to the,

282
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,150
there was a scene where maybe you
haven't even read this telling me

283
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,330
gay audience.
It's just somebody.

284
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,080
Um, so the, the sure there's
things that, you know, you, you get

285
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,990
limited by your resources when you should
have loaded budget movie and only have

286
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:03,520
what, 26 days to shoot. Yeah.

287
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:07,420
We'll even like the guys who played the
freeholders I think shot everything in a

288
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,740
day and a half. Yeah. We're thinking, man,
that's horrible. This poor guys, you know,

289
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:13,770
so they barely had a chance to, to, to,

290
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,630
to really get going on something we
didn't have any time. You just use,

291
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,120
wish you had more time. Yeah. Yeah.

292
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,593
Yeah.

293
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:26,450
[inaudible] not at, won't ask you a
question about the movie, but Ellen, um,

294
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,810
there are still deeply entrenched,
uh,

295
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,920
beliefs about same sex marriage
and equality and LGBT rights.

296
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,460
What did you learn in your interaction
with Ted Cruz now that you've had a

297
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:38,660
chance to reflect on it?

298
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,310
What did I learn?

299
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,430
What did you learn in terms of the
perspective of someone that you know,

300
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:46,550
that a lot of us in this
room probably disagree with
pretty deeply? Like, did you,

301
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,070
did you learn anything about that
perspective or is just you just disagree

302
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,520
with them? Oh No. You know,

303
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,090
I've been making sure with vice that
will come out early next year where I've

304
00:17:55,091 --> 00:17:55,490
been,

305
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,800
I'm traveling around the world and going
to different countries and exploring

306
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:04,801
the LGBT community in which the country
we've been in different countries.

307
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,740
Um, so I've had a year of
these kinds of conversations.

308
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:13,830
Typically they're more sit
down conversations with
people on a really extreme,

309
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,860
uh, most of it of course, is focused on
the community and people in the community.

310
00:18:20,861 --> 00:18:21,281
But yes,

311
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:25,900
we do address those and have conversations
with people who are think drastically

312
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:30,340
different. And I mean, very,
very extreme to, um, you know,

313
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:34,870
less extreme. And, um, so it's, it's,

314
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,650
you know, it's hard. It's hard.
I think sometimes too, when I'm,

315
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,690
when it's a politician,
because you don't,

316
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,220
you're not gonna you struggle. They get
to have a real conversation. You know,

317
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:53,170
how awesome is it that we
live in a country where I
can walk up at a state fair

318
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:56,030
and have a conversation with a
senator, would totally, you know,

319
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:00,640
speaks to me and gives me the, gives me
the time. But you know, I think it's,

320
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:06,520
it's what happened with Ted Cruz is,
um, the outcome was what I expected.

321
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:06,761
You know,

322
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:11,410
I've seen Ted Cruz be asked questions
regarding the community before and it's a

323
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:15,630
similar sort of a, it tends
to be like, you know, uh,

324
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,410
evasive flower rhetoric
and distance from one,

325
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,250
you know, answering a direct
question, shall we say. So it's,

326
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:30,040
it's hard to, it's hard
to, I don't know. And it's,

327
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:34,660
it's always a similar rhetoric no
matter where I've been. It's the same,

328
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,520
the same things are said to you no
matter what, where you are in the world.

329
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,820
So, um, hey guys,

330
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:45,540
so I guess I actually watched the movie
a few days ago and there were definitely

331
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,360
some scenes that were
super like cringeworthy,

332
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,380
especially the ones that involved the
freeholders on in a room, you know,

333
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,770
like saying that they wanted a unanimous
vote and like you heard the entire

334
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:58,800
audience gas when these things
happen because they were so terrible.

335
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,480
And it really got me wondering how
difficult it was to cast roles as such.

336
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:08,460
Or like find people who believed in like
the, the message of the film so much,

337
00:20:08,461 --> 00:20:10,230
but had to play these terrible,

338
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:15,231
terrible roles of like being these people
who are so negative against Laurel and

339
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,820
Stacy. So if you have insight
on that, that'd be really cool.

340
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,010
I think. Not Hard at all. I mean,

341
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:25,910
and we were fortunate because we were
shooting in New York and so that you have

342
00:20:25,911 --> 00:20:29,690
access to all these incredible New
York actors who live there and who are

343
00:20:29,691 --> 00:20:33,500
interested in doing, you
know, important movies.

344
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,000
And so everybody, all of those guys
that, they all have amazing resumes,

345
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:40,880
they've all done a lot of theater and
I think they were interested in the

346
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:43,640
project itself.
So I don't know that it was,

347
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:46,730
it was difficult for them
to play somebody who, um,

348
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,570
it was espousing of view that
was different from their own.

349
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,230
I don't think that it was, I think
that they were, I think they were

350
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,420
intrigued to be part of a,
of a bigger story, you know?

351
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:01,300
And I think that's what we've found with,
with our entire cast.

352
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:04,570
And they were there because they really
believed in the film. Cool. All right.

353
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:05,404
Thank you.

354
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,730
Hi, I'm so, I also saw the movie on
Monday and was just incredibly moved.

355
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:12,130
So thank you so much for,
you know,

356
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,150
bringing this important story to the big
screen. It means the world. Um, Julianne,

357
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,110
I wanted to ask,

358
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,430
this is I think your fifth time
portraying a queer woman in a movie

359
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,933
and you've even,

360
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,200
and I think that's super
awesome and interesting.

361
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:39,201
And I just wanted to ask you how your
identity as an ally has kind of evolved,

362
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,600
you know, through the process
of portraying queer women.

363
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,790
Well, um, you know

364
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,653
what

365
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,900
I always say is that it's
interesting that that the, my Rez,

366
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:57,160
I've made like 60 something
movies, right? And so, um, and,

367
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,230
and of all the characters I've played,
so I played maybe if, you know,

368
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:03,530
five gay characters or whatever,
but that's not even the,

369
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,860
the percentage of the
population that is gay.

370
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,430
So it's always interesting to me or so
we know, we don't even really know. Um,

371
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,960
that's according to a report that
was given from the 50s. So, um,

372
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,430
so it's interesting,
probably accurate.

373
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,930
That's, yeah. No, but I
think is not accurate.

374
00:22:20,931 --> 00:22:23,660
I think there's probably more of
this what I'm saying under, Oh yeah.

375
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,083
But anyway,
I

376
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,980
interesting to me that so many people
in media will point that out to me all,

377
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:36,560
I played so many characters and I'm like,
I don't even think, yeah, I just don't,

378
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:40,790
I'm just, I don't, I don't even find
that notable because for, for me,

379
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,500
every time I've been
attracted to a character,

380
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:46,790
it's just because of who they are
and their sexuality has been, um,

381
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,390
beside the point.
But that being said,

382
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:53,810
it is interesting that every time
I am talking about something,

383
00:22:53,811 --> 00:22:57,360
I ended up kind of in the,
in the middle of LGBT, um,

384
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,020
discussions and politics and,

385
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:03,320
and you can't help but evolve
when you are exposed to, um,

386
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,050
to so many discussions and so many
personalizations to people saying what,

387
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,230
you know,
what kind of skirmishes they've,

388
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,100
they've experienced and their
difficulties and what it's like to be, um,

389
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,500
to be out or to be closeted or whatever.
So I do.

390
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,590
I do think it has grown my
awareness and hopefully, um,

391
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:24,450
my compassion and made me a better
ally. Awesome. Thank you. Um,

392
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,440
thank you guys so much for being here.
We appreciate it,

393
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,673
Huh?
The end.

394
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
[inaudible]

395
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,850
right now. So thank you guys so much
and go see it. Thank you. Thank you. Hi.
