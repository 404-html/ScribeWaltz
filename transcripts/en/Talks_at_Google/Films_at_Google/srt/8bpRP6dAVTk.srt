38
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,043
Ooh,

39
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,350
excellent.
So thank you all so much for being here.

40
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:31,380
I think it would be great if you could
each quickly just introduce your role on

41
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:35,970
the film and why this project
was so personally important
to you. To be a part of

42
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,370
hi. Oh, hey. Um, I'm Aleisha. Um,

43
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,250
so I have,

44
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:50,251
I guess I have a story by credit because
Sarah and I developed the treatment and

45
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:54,920
then hired the amazing
Amy Fox to write it. Um,

46
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,070
and Sarah and I produced it.

47
00:02:57,071 --> 00:03:01,150
And then I'm also in the film
and I just need to say like,

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,520
I just heard that intro and it's the
first time we've all been together and I

49
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:11,521
want to cry because I'm just so grateful
to be like part of this amazing group

50
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:15,820
of women who like have
these incredible resumes.

51
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,300
And you know,

52
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,350
I guess my interest in the film was how
do we make the world better for women?

53
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:26,420
Like that's really my truth.
Um,

54
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,890
and how do we tell stories that sometimes
other people are afraid to tell about

55
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,310
the stuff that's not okay.
Um,

56
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,230
and in this case,

57
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,920
how women are treated sometimes
on Wall Street is that story.

58
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,401
Hi,

59
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:48,840
I'm Sarah and I think Alicia did a great
intro and on our involvement in the

60
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:52,550
film, um, my character in the film is,

61
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:55,380
is a woman named Aaron
Manning. And, um, um,

62
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,290
she particularly has a place in my heart
because she's a woman trying to have it

63
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:58,891
all and,

64
00:03:58,891 --> 00:04:03,891
and someone who enters the corporate
world thinking she can't have it all and

65
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:04,471
she's,

66
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:09,420
I'm pregnant and hiding it and dealing
with a home life and a work life and

67
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:14,010
realizing that maybe she won't get to
where she thinks she can in her career.

68
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,960
And I think personally, um,
I can really relate to, uh,

69
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,100
maybe not being in your career where you
think you will be at a certain age or a

70
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:25,680
certain time point like when
you choose to start a family.

71
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,890
So I hope that she's a character that
kind of resonates with a lot of young

72
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:32,670
women out there who are thinking about
being powerful women and also starting a

73
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:33,504
family.

74
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,080
Okay.

75
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,370
Um,
I'm Anna Gunn.

76
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:41,371
I play Naomi Bishop and I was
just in love with the film.

77
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:42,810
As soon as I read it.
I,

78
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,900
I thought that the story of three
women who are leading the way in,

79
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:53,710
in terms of the storytelling
and the nuance, the detail,

80
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,070
um,
the layers to each of the characters.

81
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:59,050
And especially I was
looking for a character,

82
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,310
very much like this one who is
not a reactor towards a man,

83
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:08,311
but it's really in the forefront and is
the one moving the action forward as as

84
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:13,300
are my lovely co stars
and producers. And, um,

85
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,590
I really was intrigued by the
fact that she's devoted her life.

86
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,140
And just as,
as you said about Aaron,

87
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,230
there is that question of
the sacrifices you make,

88
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:28,231
the things that you take on or give up
in order to get what you want and to,

89
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,590
to succeed.

90
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,630
And I was fascinated with a woman
as confident and strong as she is,

91
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,600
who's been on a winning streak.
And then when we meet her though,

92
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:42,601
she suddenly had her first real loss and
she's struggling then for the rest of

93
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:46,240
the film to get back up.
And,

94
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,160
and it gives her a different perspective
completely on the life that she's led

95
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:51,994
so far.

96
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,340
I, um, yeah, I had actually worked
with Sarah Alicia previously

97
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,360
in theater as a playwright. And
so when they approached me, um,

98
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,920
and they had founded the company and had
this concept of a Wall Street film with

99
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:09,530
these three women
characters, um, I was, I was,

100
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,940
it appealed to me immediately and I
don't have any background in finance. Um,

101
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,680
the original Wall Street movie
was one of my favorite movies,

102
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:19,070
which is an odd fact that people
wouldn't necessarily expect that from me.

103
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:23,150
But it's true that a, I just always
loved the right, it took you out.

104
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:27,200
I loved the ethical questions and that
maybe the questions of family loyalty and

105
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,700
kind of how greed,

106
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:32,840
the interfaces at that end to the idea
of taking that genre and then putting

107
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,610
this new perspective on it and also
telling the truths of the women. I mean,

108
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:42,230
we interviewed so many women who was
experienced as you'll see in the film and

109
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,450
the idea that these, these women have
been working on Wall Street for 30 years,

110
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:50,960
20 years, 10 years, and we haven't
seen their stories anywhere.

111
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:55,961
And that the big part of my goal as a
storyteller is to uncover stories and tell

112
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:59,210
stories that we should, we should have
seen these women before, but we haven't.

113
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:03,800
So here they are. Um,
and I directed the film.

114
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,920
I, I mean, I just wanted to do it
from the moment I read the script,

115
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,150
thought Amy's writing had this like kind
of sophistication and elegance and kind

116
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,040
of provoked us, uh, kind of, uh,

117
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:17,600
kind of precise approach to filmmaking
that I was really inspired by. And a,

118
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:21,020
and I was really inspired by this, the
main character as Amy wrote her. I mean,

119
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:23,900
Naomi was someone I kind
of had never kind of,

120
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:28,901
I think seen on screen before and I knew
a dialogue with this character with the

121
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:33,860
right kind of mind and body behind it
would be a conversation I could grow from

122
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,130
as well

123
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,540
as a woman myself.
Yeah.

124
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,880
That's excellent.
So quickly from the audience.

125
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:40,860
I'd love to get a show of hands form,
um,

126
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,940
the folks in the room and for the
men specifically, I'm curious,

127
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,500
how many times in your career have you
felt like either personal or professional

128
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,710
relationship has suffered because
you've been too career focused?

129
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,430
Okay.
How about for the women?

130
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:00,840
Okay.

131
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,260
We got some shy folks out here
come if feel wavering hands.

132
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:08,210
We're not sure if that's why it fell.
Yeah, I'll raise my hand. Hi. Um,

133
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:12,670
it's clear that this character is
so strong and driven and ambitious.

134
00:08:12,671 --> 00:08:15,550
Can you talk a little bit about what
it was like preparing for that role and

135
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:18,340
either personal or other interviews
that you did to pull from?

136
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,320
Well, I first talked with Mira for, um,

137
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,640
a couple of hours I think.

138
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:29,641
And we were really on the same page from
the get go in terms of the warrior that

139
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:34,180
this woman is and the
sacrifices that she has made.

140
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:39,030
She has chosen to, and it's very
clearly spelled out there. Um,

141
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,050
she does what she does. She, she took
it on out of need in the beginning.

142
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,700
And then I think the, the, the winning,
the art of the deal and the win,

143
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,690
um, is something that is insane. It's an,

144
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,650
it's incredibly addictive.
And I talked to then Alicia and Sarah,

145
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:02,400
they gave me so much information about
the women that they had interviewed,

146
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:06,030
the women who were the inspiration
for these roles and also investors.

147
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,150
And then I was on the
phone with Barbara Byrne,

148
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,460
who is a Wall Street luminary and she
was wonderful and I took reams of notes

149
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:19,350
and she really let me understand her
journey difficulties, the struggles,

150
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,830
sacrifices, and also the
victories and what really put,

151
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:26,790
she has such a joy in terms in
such a passion for what she does.

152
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,160
So, um, we then had a day in New York
before we started shooting in Philly.

153
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,150
Um, and we, we went through a mock
IPO so I could, I felt like we,

154
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,750
I could really wrap my head around it then
and then going out to dinner with, um,

155
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,800
a variety of women and just watching the
interaction and the razor sharp wit and,

156
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,203
um,

157
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:53,010
incredible intellect and fun
and laughter and strength.

158
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:57,060
And so I took pieces from,
from all of that. And um,

159
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,830
I also felt like, you know,
with good writing, the, the,

160
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,180
the hints are there, the, the,
the meat is there. So there were,

161
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:08,340
and I liked the fact that,
you know,

162
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:12,270
that she doesn't see her family very
often and it's not leaned on too much.

163
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:17,160
It's not, you know, heavily, but it's,
but it's there and she really has,

164
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,050
she has her fish and she has her mentor,
John and I think even her boyfriend,

165
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,530
she is wanting to have a close
and intimate relationship,

166
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:30,120
but there's always a sense of perhaps
there's a trust issue there. So,

167
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,983
um,

168
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,100
well that sounds together. Yeah. And we'll
say a little bit of that later as well.

169
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:39,290
Just kind of the importance of building
a network that you can trust on and yeah,

170
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,990
kind of at what costs. Right.
Um, excellent. Um, Amy, you know,

171
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:45,850
I think at,
you know,

172
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:50,851
at Google we talk a lot about being
kinder to ourselves and kind of quieting

173
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:52,480
what we call this inner saboteurs.

174
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:55,120
So you have this little person
talking in the back of your head.

175
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,560
I want to work at Google. What's that?
It just happened to talk about it here.

176
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,540
Um, in the film, the characters briefly
discuss, I'm not giving anything away,

177
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:08,140
but they did briefly discuss the
differences in how men and women digest

178
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:12,250
feedback. Why was it important to you to
include that conversation in the film?

179
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,360
Um,
I think for

180
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,950
me personally, it was an aspect of the
story that I really, really related to.

181
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:23,890
I think, um, I, so as I was
interviewing people, um,

182
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,100
this theme kept coming up again and
again where women would say that if

183
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:31,730
something went wrong, if
the, if a deal went wrong, if
something didn't go through,

184
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:33,950
they,
they would be very hard on themselves.

185
00:11:33,951 --> 00:11:37,460
They would sort of stay up nights
questioning why did that happen?

186
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,150
And men and women told me that men
are less likely to do that. Not,

187
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,190
not that they never do that,

188
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:45,800
but that men are more likely
to get pissed off and say, oh,

189
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:48,860
that didn't work out because of this
happened or that and blaming something

190
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:52,610
outside of themselves where women
will turn it inwards. And that's,

191
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:57,280
I guess I just personally have been very
aware of in my own life and I've taught

192
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,780
writing for 10 years.

193
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:01,720
I see a big difference in my male and
female students with that voice you're

194
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,650
talking about. I see it in my daughter
already. Um, I don't know why that is.

195
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:09,160
I don't know why that, that Sabbath
to her seems to be stronger and women,

196
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,670
but it's something I'm very passionate
about dispelling whenever I can.

197
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,620
So that seems really important to me.

198
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,240
Yeah,
I think it's interesting because it does,

199
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,240
the inner saboteurs can also
be such a strength, right?

200
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:22,400
To Gut check yourself and
keep yourself in line.

201
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:26,990
And I think we're starting to see a turn
of weighing a bit more on some of the Q

202
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,000
values versus Iq and making
sure that we find that line. Um,

203
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,490
we actually have another clip
and we see Aaron in the scene.

204
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,380
Basically mustering all the courage and
guts that she can to blurt out that one

205
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:40,540
sentence.
Um,

206
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,880
and I know how tough that is because I've
actually done it that they're the same

207
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:48,310
thing. Um, and get
completely shut down. Um,

208
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,780
can you talk to us a little bit about
what you think you've seen in the

209
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:56,781
workplace where women can help other
women and pick them up from these places?

210
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,090
Yeah, I mean, I think in general,

211
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:04,980
women don't go in there and do what
Erin does in that scene. Enough ask,

212
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:08,850
ask for that job promotion even,
even if you do get to know. Um,

213
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,140
and one of the things we really wanted
to explore in that scene between me and

214
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:18,141
Anna and both our characters is how
difficult it is to be women of different

215
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,560
generations and how Ana's character isn't
really, and I'll let you speak to that,

216
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:24,700
but from,
from my standpoint as Erin,

217
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,800
I don't see that she's overwhelmed with
her work at this time and she feels like

218
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,790
there's not enough, um, spots at the top.

219
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,720
I'm only seeing it as my bosses
shutting me down. So we were also in,

220
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:41,820
I'll let you talk a little a bit to this,

221
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:46,560
but interested in the dynamic between
the two women when you want a promotion.

222
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,300
Yeah. We talked that scene
was a really intricate and,

223
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,130
and very difficult seeing really because,
um,

224
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,550
because I think that we establish a
backstory that Naomi was actually very

225
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:05,180
supportive and, and brought Aaron in
and nurtured her and moved her along.

226
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:09,770
And actually one of the things that
the women, um, emphasized a lot,

227
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:14,300
the women that I spoke to, um,
was that it was very important.

228
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:18,740
The mentor mentee relationship is
extremely important. And the, the,

229
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,370
the having somebody bring you in and
bring you along and help you along.

230
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,670
And then in turn when it's, when
it's, when you get to a certain point,

231
00:14:25,671 --> 00:14:28,700
it's your turn then to
mentor somebody else.

232
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,280
And they also said that it was
extremely important to know that,

233
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,840
that you had somebody, one person at
least who had your back and vice versa,

234
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,640
that you could count on in a crunch.

235
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,650
And I think that Naomi really feels
that way about Erin, but she's got,

236
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,830
right now she's just,
you know,

237
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,840
experienced this failure and it's just
been splashed all over the television.

238
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:53,060
She's just dealing,
um,

239
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,940
I don't know if she's actually dealt
with their boss at that point yet,

240
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:57,650
but she's,
she's looking,

241
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:02,651
she's so intent and she's so intense
about looking for the next deal and the

242
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:06,530
next win and making sure
that she doesn't slip away.

243
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,740
And so when she says it's not the time,

244
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:14,510
she's not trying to be mean,
and she's not trying to be dismissive,

245
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,640
she's just saying this is the reality.

246
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:20,060
And she's a person who
just speaks her mind very,

247
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,020
very honestly,
and she doesn't mince words.

248
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:27,260
And so it's not meant to be a get
out of here. It's meant to be,

249
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,260
look at this place as a mass. We're
all, you know, it's a, it's a,

250
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,240
we're all in some sort of jeopardy. And
when the time is right, she, she means it.

251
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:39,800
She really means it. So that you know,
she does say what she really gives Naomi,

252
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:43,050
gives her boss later tells her,
tells him that um,

253
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,090
Aaron did wonderful work and so
she is looking to help her along.

254
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:51,800
But there's there is that
misinterpretation, the kind of things.

255
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:56,480
Yeah and the misinterpreting of certain
things that are said and wondering does

256
00:15:56,481 --> 00:16:00,530
somebody really have my back because this
is such a competitive environment and

257
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:04,190
I just want to add one thing cause it
was a relative to what we were just

258
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:08,690
talking about. Women internalize it
more. So Aaron's the know from Naomi,

259
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:12,710
Erin's internalizing is I'm a failure
as opposed to the timing's bad.

260
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,530
And that goes back to what we're saying.
Like if a man gets a no,

261
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:19,790
they might bounce back more quickly
and go ask for it again a little later.

262
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,170
And interestingly enough,

263
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:24,950
in reference to film
making in the edit room,

264
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,980
we played a lot with what order to put
the scenes and do we put Naomi asking for

265
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:36,701
her promotion first or Aaron asking
first and they told different stories

266
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,200
because in fact they're both
trying for the same thing.

267
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,570
And there is that fear.

268
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,900
And that competition because there is
that feeling because there are so many,

269
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:55,570
so few women in this world
of there's not enough space.

270
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,500
Um, and that's, you know, part of
the story we were trying to tell.

271
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:01,723
That's okay.

272
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,810
It's, it's definitely, um,
something that we, you know,

273
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,490
you're competing for the same types of
projects in this time type of recognition.

274
00:17:09,491 --> 00:17:13,760
And uh, our CFO, Ruth Porat who
actually came from Wall Street,

275
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,840
um,

276
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,610
she has shared with us in multiple
different formats that the communication

277
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:21,440
styles between men and
women are different.

278
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,180
That men will go in and
I want this promotion.

279
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:26,960
And not all men just for the sake of,
I'm generalizing here,

280
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:31,400
but um, where women, when
they say something like that,

281
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:35,420
you have to assume either as a male or
a female boss at they are shouting it

282
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,450
from the mountain top.
Even that one sentence,

283
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:43,310
is this the right time for a promotion?
She is screaming that she's ready. Um,

284
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:44,750
so I think, you know, for,

285
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:48,170
for all everyone in this room
who can help people get there,

286
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:51,210
it's important to know that those
communication styles really matter.

287
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,600
Okay. I just want to jump in. I'm
only just, I think about 10 days ago,

288
00:17:55,601 --> 00:18:00,601
there was an article in the New York
Times about advice for women asking for a

289
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:02,800
raise or promotion.
Um,

290
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,900
and I actually thought it was an
onion article when I saw it because it

291
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:12,190
literally was instructing women on how
to do a dance so they wouldn't appear

292
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,020
threatening and asking
for what they deserve.

293
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:17,470
And there was no acknowledgement that
maybe they need to be heard differently,

294
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,820
that the person doing the, with the power
it needs, it was literally like, well,

295
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:24,100
you don't want your boss
to think you're demanding.

296
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,260
And this was in the New
York Times about a week ago.

297
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:29,740
So I just feel like there's so much
progress to be made on this issue.

298
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,710
And actually, I mean, when it comes
to, when it comes to this scene, um,

299
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,490
the other detail that I find interesting
is that outfit that Sarah is wearing is

300
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:42,420
a, is a kind of a type of kind of, um,

301
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,450
an outfit that she kind of had scouted
out during this mock IPO that they

302
00:18:46,451 --> 00:18:48,580
actually experienced.
And it was very specific.

303
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:52,150
There's kind of a schoolgirl quality to
that outfit that doesn't really kind of

304
00:18:52,151 --> 00:18:54,790
progress past the point of kind
of seeing her in this moment.

305
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,570
But it really informed kind of how she
set up in that moment when she's asking

306
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,960
for that promotion and kind of the optics
of what you choose to wear in a work

307
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:05,020
environment was something we discussed
across the board with all of these

308
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:05,830
characters.

309
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,530
But that was very specific that that was
the outfit that she was going to wear

310
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:10,150
on that day that she was going
to ask for that promotion.

311
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,200
Can I add one tiny thing that brings
it back to Google in a way, which is,

312
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,310
I dunno if you guys know this,

313
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:21,311
but at the United States of women they
did a hackathon about creating apps to

314
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:26,990
help women ask for more
pay and they're like,

315
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,090
there was an article,
I think it was,

316
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,270
I'm trying to remember in the Wall
Street Journal a couple of weeks ago and

317
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:37,271
there are these like seven new apps
all about how do we hack the pay gap?

318
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,290
Um, and I just find that it really
interesting that there are all these new

319
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,770
technological tools for people
to make change this way.

320
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,853
Yeah.
Yeah.

321
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,550
It's, you know, when not
touching a ton on the pay gap,

322
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:56,640
but it's something that,
um,

323
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,410
Laszlo Bock who was one of our
executives just released a op Ed, um,

324
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:06,610
publicly that there is no pay gap
across genders at Google, which I mean,

325
00:20:06,611 --> 00:20:07,780
in my 12 years I go,
well,

326
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:12,400
that was my proudest moment and I was
almost in tears reading it just to give me

327
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:15,310
the peace of mine that we've
looked at this, come back to work,

328
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,860
don't think about it.
Just move that off your plate.

329
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,520
And it's one of those things where I hope
Google is leading the way to get some

330
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:25,690
of those data points out there and make
a real difference. So, um, excellent.

331
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,300
So we have one more clip for you.
Let's go ahead and cue it up.

332
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,660
I think we can tag line. This
one is, it's lonely at the top,

333
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:37,600
setting up for a drink with a
girlfriend to catch up. Um, you know,

334
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:40,600
I think it's tough. We, there's the,

335
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:44,830
the underlying here where you kind of
are seeing your character who's very

336
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:48,280
strong and powerful and ambitious and,
uh,

337
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,940
letting her guard down for the first
time and just looking for, you know,

338
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:54,670
some human connection and
having some time with somebody.

339
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:59,280
And then she very quickly realizes that
she's being taken advantage of. Um,

340
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,980
and I,
you know,

341
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,830
I think this scene is also interesting
because we see two women who were both

342
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:10,510
driven and both ambitious and going
after their same goals. And, um,

343
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,880
I'm curious for any of the,

344
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:16,890
kind of the point of how we balance this
line of being successful and driven and

345
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:20,200
ambitious and firm and decisive,

346
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,560
but also vulnerable enough and maybe
showcasing qualities that we're not proud

347
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:30,490
of or that we may not aspire to or we
don't want to admit we're capable of.

348
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:32,600
And how do we balance that?
Um,

349
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,970
so tell me maybe as a director or
writer or any of the actresses kind of,

350
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,220
do you guys have answers
that I am all ears

351
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,820
and it's more of a
statement than a question.

352
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,000
Yeah. Any thoughts on, you know,

353
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:52,280
it's funny when I watched that scene
high, watch it as the carrot, you know,

354
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:57,281
I'm still very connected to
that human and that human.

355
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,130
I like I had to play the scene
as I'm protecting my friend.

356
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,720
Like that's how I found my way mentally.

357
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,920
And HeartWise is like I want to take,

358
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,400
I want to like take care of her
and if she's with a shitty guy,

359
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,950
I want to help her out of
that. And that's, uh, I,

360
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,580
that's not how the scene is experienced
and I fully understand that,

361
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,100
but that's sort of it.

362
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,200
It's interesting to me personally that
it's like we have these rationalizations

363
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:38,140
that we believe so deeply in that
sometimes we do hurt someone thinking that

364
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:41,960
we're trying to protect them.
Um,

365
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,630
that's life.
And that's to me,

366
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:49,460
one of the things from the beginning
when Sarah and I were first talking about

367
00:22:49,461 --> 00:22:52,460
this movie,
about like these gray lines and,

368
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:57,790
and what is moral and what is
right and how do you show that?

369
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,450
Um,

370
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:04,450
and I think Amy did a
spectacular job aided by MIRA in,

371
00:23:07,881 --> 00:23:12,830
in really sort of presenting these things.

372
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,130
And then letting audiences,

373
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:19,760
experiencing them and have
bothered to talk about,

374
00:23:19,761 --> 00:23:24,710
but I don't, I guess to sum up,
yeah, I don't have an answer.

375
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,230
I really don't. Um, I think it,

376
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,670
we wanted to present it as a,
as a point of discussion.

377
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,920
I don't want to, it's rather maybe,
maybe Anna will. All right here we are.

378
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:37,030
But I think again,

379
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:41,080
and again as we were talking about this
movie and interviewing wall streeters,

380
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,330
what came up was it the women in business,

381
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:46,040
whether it's Wall Street entertainment,
you name it,

382
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,330
are either too nice or too tough.

383
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,360
They rub people the wrong way or whether
the nice girl that can get walked all

384
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:52,320
over and it doesn't get paid.
Um,

385
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,460
and I think that's actually
sadly still true to life.

386
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:59,900
I find myself sometimes being too tough
on people and then I go the reverse and

387
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:03,350
try and be too nice. And it's like,
and I'm constantly as a producer,

388
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:08,330
actress thinking about it and I
shouldn't have to. Um, but I am. Um,

389
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,780
and then, and I think women, you know,
men when they're in a tough situation,

390
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,910
they're going to tell you like it is,

391
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,870
they're going to tell you like it is
like this and you're going to listen to

392
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,390
them and blah blah blah. But if I talk
to you like that as a woman, it's like,

393
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,120
oh well maybe I should smile a little.
And so I think it's something I'm like,

394
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,260
I don't think, I don't know
how to solve it. It's sad.

395
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:29,610
Yeah. I think that's, that was something
that hit home so hard for me was the,

396
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,490
was the fact that they did that,
that,

397
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,610
that there is that walking the tight
rope of being too tough or too soft and

398
00:24:35,611 --> 00:24:40,040
either one is going to get you, you know,
in trouble in some ways. And so it's,

399
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:43,140
it's almost like being on a
tight rope, you know, how to you,

400
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,480
and I remember Barbara Burns saying
that reading people and understanding

401
00:24:48,811 --> 00:24:51,480
people, psychology and
understanding what the client needs,

402
00:24:51,481 --> 00:24:53,730
understanding what your boss needs,
understanding.

403
00:24:53,731 --> 00:24:57,960
But it's something that women I think
have to think about much more in terms of,

404
00:24:57,961 --> 00:25:00,900
like you say, how you present
yourself, how you cope.

405
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:02,340
Go in and ask for a promotion,

406
00:25:02,341 --> 00:25:06,390
how you have a discussion with your
client about pricing something when he

407
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:09,390
thinks it should be higher. And you
think in reality it should be lower.

408
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,160
But you gotta you gotta be careful,

409
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:14,880
especially when you've been told that
your ruffling feathers and rubbing people

410
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:19,470
the wrong way. And when doubt starts
to creep in, that's, you know,

411
00:25:19,471 --> 00:25:23,610
that starts to erode the
person who, you know, Naomi,

412
00:25:23,611 --> 00:25:24,540
who has been,

413
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:29,550
I think just like a shark sometimes
moving forward in these waters and really,

414
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,610
um, just really not afraid, frankly.

415
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:37,020
I think she's just pushed a lot of stuff
down and when the doubt starts to creep

416
00:25:37,021 --> 00:25:40,740
in, that's when things
started to crumble. And again,

417
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,350
I think she really is, it's, it's a,

418
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:48,360
it's a moment when the bottom kind of
drops out when she thinks that she is,

419
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:50,490
you know,
I don't think she really has,

420
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,260
she doesn't have time
to have many friends,

421
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:57,261
which just is a very solitary person
because she's so focused and she is a

422
00:25:57,421 --> 00:25:59,070
person who I think has,
has,

423
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,720
has closed a part of herself off and
closer part of herself down. So that,

424
00:26:03,721 --> 00:26:07,980
you know, in this conversation it's,
it starts to be, it starts to feel,

425
00:26:07,981 --> 00:26:12,150
I think like things are just falling
apart around her and she's really looking

426
00:26:12,151 --> 00:26:15,420
for somebody or something
to hold on to. Yeah. So

427
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,070
as I think about it in here, like
just, just talk about it more. It,

428
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:23,290
it is strange that it has to be something
that a woman is held liable for it

429
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,990
because it feels like a super power
that you are capable of both of getting

430
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:29,090
things done and being
someone's best friend.

431
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:32,900
That kind of capacity for empathetic
leadership feels particularly like a

432
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:37,160
particularly female capability
that should be rewarded. Yeah.

433
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,260
And Yeah.
Yeah.

434
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,060
Well,

435
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,893
I'm actually

436
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,750
[inaudible] this point, you know, I,

437
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:51,490
when I was doing the research and
getting prepared for today, um, I,

438
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,120
I couldn't believe it and I tried to
fact check it like 18 different times,

439
00:26:55,121 --> 00:27:00,121
but that Kathryn Bigelow is the first
and only woman to win an academy award as

440
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:04,900
best director in 88 academy awards.

441
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,760
Um,
can you talk a little bit,

442
00:27:06,761 --> 00:27:10,240
we talked earlier about mentors and
trying to find people to help you navigate

443
00:27:10,241 --> 00:27:13,420
your career or build yourself up and
those times when it feels like it's

444
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:17,110
crumbling around you, how have you
navigated your career in that way?

445
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,531
Well,

446
00:27:18,531 --> 00:27:22,370
it's kind of laterally because I see
more and more women kind of like kind of

447
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:25,400
younger generations, uh, taking, you know,

448
00:27:25,401 --> 00:27:29,620
kind of creating situations for themselves
to direct when not when, you know,

449
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,780
in face of,
you know,

450
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,670
the lack of permission or kind of the
gatekeeper is allowing them to occupy

451
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:37,220
those positions. So I
find there's a, you know,

452
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:40,670
a number of women that kind of have made
their name in independent film making

453
00:27:40,671 --> 00:27:43,190
as directors that I turned
to that are kind of,

454
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,670
we're kind of trying to come up together
and then we kind of try and form this

455
00:27:46,671 --> 00:27:48,890
kind of peer to peer
mentorship with one another.

456
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,190
In terms of mentors that I had
kind of through kind of, you know,

457
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:54,740
the process of just learning
to become a filmmaker. Yeah.

458
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,060
More often than not they were men.

459
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:59,630
They were male directors that I had as
faculty and my film school program or

460
00:27:59,631 --> 00:28:01,760
just people that I shadowed with or yeah,

461
00:28:01,761 --> 00:28:05,060
more often than not because there are
so foot few women in that position they

462
00:28:05,061 --> 00:28:06,140
would be men.

463
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:10,940
But I do find there to be some kind
of optimism and when I look sideways,

464
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:14,310
yeah. Yes. Well I think, you know, a big,

465
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,430
a big theme for me in the film
and then sort of looking at, um,

466
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:22,110
women in the creative world as well
as the idea of, of scarcity, right.

467
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:23,820
And the idea that it,

468
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,120
it requires someone to feel secure
and powerful in order to be generous.

469
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,760
So I think that is why so many mentors
in Wall Street and in the arts as well

470
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:39,810
have been men because you have to not
feel that your own position is in jeopardy

471
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:41,370
in order to reach down
and help someone else.

472
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,220
And just in doing press for the film,
um,

473
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,350
I had a memory that I hadn't
thought of in a long time.

474
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:49,320
And when I first moved to New York about
20 years ago when I started out as a

475
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:52,410
playwright and Tina Howe who was
a pilates or prize winning writer,

476
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:55,980
came and spoke at a conference
I was at for women playwrights.

477
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,180
And she actually got up and she said,
kind of the counter what you're saying.

478
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:04,110
And it didn't sound very inspiring
and all she said, um, yeah,

479
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:08,750
don't look at us up here to help you
because we barely have jobs are so, um,

480
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,680
and she said,
look to each other.

481
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,190
And it's funny thinking back on
it because in a way she was right.

482
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:16,840
And those are the people that have
helped me the most. Like, you know,

483
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,590
you've been with the three of us all
started out around the same time. Um,

484
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,050
but there's also something
very sad about that.

485
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:25,290
Very sad that a woman who had won
the Pulitzer prize basically said,

486
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:29,250
don't ask me for anything. My
own stature here is so shaky. Um,

487
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,500
and just for me doing the film,

488
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:34,730
looking at the difference between the
business world and the arts world,

489
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,290
it's also been interesting
because in the business world,

490
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:40,860
even though someone at the top may
not feel secure in their position,

491
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:42,040
they at least have resources at

492
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,150
their disposal in the arts.

493
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:47,560
I find there's such a scarcity
of resources that people
are even more likely to

494
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:50,320
look out for themselves and not reach
out to help someone else. So it's,

495
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,154
it's been very interest.

496
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,140
Um,
I want to make sure we have some time.

497
00:29:56,141 --> 00:30:00,280
If anybody in the audience has questions.
We have Mike set up on either side.

498
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,893
MMM.

499
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:03,871
In the meantime,

500
00:30:03,871 --> 00:30:06,480
I'll throw out another question while
people are getting up and thinking of

501
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:08,200
their questions. But, um,

502
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,560
I don't know if you guys had read and
I've been talking a lot about New York

503
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:11,850
Times articles up here.
Um,

504
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,120
but there was one about one about equity
that was in the RST. Exactly. Okay.

505
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,150
Um, there was one about brotalk on
Wall Street a couple of weeks ago. Um,

506
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,350
and it was for those of you
that haven't read it, it's, um,

507
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,390
basically was saying that,
you know,

508
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:30,660
in it behind closed doors or just
when you're not in mixed company,

509
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:33,960
that there's a lot of brotalk that
happens on Wall Street where there's,

510
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:38,460
you know, they're objectifying women and
how does this impact women's careers?

511
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:42,240
And, um, I don't think it's specific
to Wall Street. Right. Again,

512
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,310
that's a resonating theme
throughout this movie.

513
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:46,260
This is not just one particular industry.

514
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:50,820
It's a story in a perspective we haven't
seen before. Um, but I'm curious,

515
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,713
you know,

516
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:55,950
for the men in this room and
men in business or Hollywood,

517
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,810
they will be responsible for helping
to sponsor us to get us there because

518
00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:03,150
they're in the positions of power.
Um,

519
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:07,860
so what are your thoughts on ways that
men can help to sponsor women if it's not

520
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:10,740
a direct mentorship or it's not
women that they're looking to?

521
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,970
Any examples of men that have really
helped you guys around your careers are

522
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:15,960
helpful with the film?

523
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,870
I mean, I will say that with my first
film, the investors were 90% men. Uh,

524
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:26,420
and I had no track record and
um, they didn't need the, um,

525
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,730
I find that sometimes fee, and this is
not good or bad, it's just different.

526
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:32,130
Sometimes female investors have a
little more of the herd mentality,

527
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:34,020
so they're more interested if
their friends have invested,

528
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,260
they're more interested in how
much they're friends who invested.

529
00:31:37,261 --> 00:31:41,460
Where I find personally that the male
investors decide to believe in you and

530
00:31:41,461 --> 00:31:42,061
they believe in you.

531
00:31:42,061 --> 00:31:44,040
They write a check for whatever
they want to write a check for.

532
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,630
But I think it's just important that
we're 50% of the population and that

533
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,420
whether it's a man or a
woman in a position of power,

534
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:55,470
that we realize that big changes have to
be made in terms of bringing women up,

535
00:31:55,471 --> 00:31:58,870
supporting women who want to have families
and want to go away for a year or two.

536
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,540
That doesn't mean they're not valuable.

537
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:05,220
They still have 30 or 40 years left of
working. Um, but making it a mission,

538
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,350
you know, much like we need
to make diversity a mission.

539
00:32:07,351 --> 00:32:09,480
Like making it a mandate
that every company

540
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:12,900
and holding people accountable.

541
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:17,130
So that's another thing that Ruth brought
a over to us in terms of hiring and

542
00:32:17,131 --> 00:32:19,710
promotion and just making sure that,
you know,

543
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,010
if there's not enough women on the dock
are not enough women being talked about

544
00:32:23,011 --> 00:32:23,821
in talent reviews,

545
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:27,210
that we are asking pointed questions and
making sure that we're holding people

546
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:31,260
accountable to those conversations.
Um, go ahead and move a question. Okay.

547
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,330
Hi Guys. Thank you again so much
for coming. This is such a treat.

548
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,670
I was curious if you
could tell from the clips.

549
00:32:37,671 --> 00:32:42,650
There are a lot of really powerful in
the film. And I was wondering, uh, if,

550
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:47,420
if you guys would like to talk about any
moments that were really fun to film or

551
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:48,860
to write or to direct,

552
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:53,090
that will kind of stick with you as
you move forward to other projects.

553
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:53,871
Um,

554
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:57,980
and if any of them really resonated for
you personally or just like a really fun

555
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,870
part of the film to work on.

556
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,400
Yeah. Like I feel like I loved every
single scene and just, I, I just,

557
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,980
it was everything.

558
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:14,580
The thing was just so meaty and juicy
and there was so much to sink my teeth

559
00:33:14,581 --> 00:33:18,150
into. And, um, I, I, the,

560
00:33:18,151 --> 00:33:22,920
the money speech I thought was
incredibly written. And also,

561
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:23,461
you know,

562
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:28,200
we talked a lot about finding
a balance in there because she,

563
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:31,890
Naomi, as much as she makes that
statement, she's not making it. It's not,

564
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:36,090
she's not the Gordon Gekko, she's not,
you know, she's not talking about grief,

565
00:33:36,091 --> 00:33:41,091
but she is saying this is important and
we deserve to have this and to own it

566
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:47,130
and to stand up as much as men do.
And not to be afraid of it. Um,

567
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,060
and I just am sort of jumping
back to in terms of, you know,

568
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,240
what men can do to bring
women up or you know,

569
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:59,030
how it is that we can support each other.
I guess I was really lucky. I had to, um,

570
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,370
mentors myself who were,
um,

571
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,310
Kim Stanley and Vivian Mason
who were from the actors studio.

572
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:10,730
And they really gave me the sense that
I could do anything if I put my mind to

573
00:34:12,061 --> 00:34:16,650
it. It might be hard, it might be years to
get there, but it was, you know, it was,

574
00:34:16,651 --> 00:34:17,371
if you love it,

575
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:21,870
you just keep going and you keep doing
it and you work in a 99 seat theater in

576
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:24,480
La if that's what you need to do.
And you just keep,

577
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,610
keep feeding it and keep honing it.

578
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,380
And so that really did that.

579
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:35,130
Their support and their belief kept me
going through the lean times at the times

580
00:34:35,131 --> 00:34:39,000
when I thought maybe this isn't gonna
work out. And I think that, again,

581
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,510
that's something that is explored
in this film and I think it's very,

582
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:46,800
very important for us to, to look at
it and to keep shining light on it.

583
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:52,090
Because I want my daughters to be,
to feel like they can do that,

584
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,700
that they,

585
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:57,150
that they feel like they have every
opportunity that a man has and they should

586
00:34:57,151 --> 00:35:01,260
feel that they can go in and not be
afraid to ask for the promotion to ask for

587
00:35:01,261 --> 00:35:03,510
what they want and to,
and to speak their mind.

588
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,583
Hm.

589
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:07,830
I mean,

590
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:12,630
I'd say any scene I got to see James
Purefoy and Anna just act off each other

591
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,800
who just like delightful chemistry and
like you guys are like a kind of classic

592
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,820
old Hollywood like Clark Gable,
like Lumbar,

593
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:24,390
like you guys just had that sharpness
with each other and James isn't too bad to

594
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:29,010
look at. It's not too bad to look
at it. For me, there's this magic,

595
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:30,630
I'm actually a very,
um,

596
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,600
concerned about the wrong personality
type for a writer because I'm very social

597
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:38,500
person and writing requires for you to
be alone in your house for Jensen time.

598
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,770
Do I have always starting
out in the theater.

599
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:45,440
My favorite moments are always when the
thing that you've created alone and you

600
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,340
know, you get in your head
and you're thinking, I mean,

601
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:49,170
I don't know if it's like coding,
but you're thinking like,

602
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,300
does anyone care about this thing I'm
writing? And then it becomes a reality.

603
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:57,930
So for me, when I first, the first
time I was able to come on set and, uh,

604
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,890
they were shooting some scenes and ana
department and there was this fish and I

605
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:06,150
just remembered sitting at my computer
one day and going like, you know, she,

606
00:36:06,151 --> 00:36:08,040
we had talked about it, but
I just remember like, oh,

607
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:11,190
she should have a fish and the fish
is swimming. And you think like,

608
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:14,870
I'm spending my whole morning thinking
about this imaginary fish. Like,

609
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:19,320
but then you go on set and there's a
real fish and they really feel it's quite

610
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:20,154
powerful.

611
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,820
Remember you like taking
pictures of the fish for like an

612
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,870
excited about the,
here

613
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,170
we have another question.

614
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:38,620
Yes. Hello. Um, so you've talked a lot
about this, a mission behind this movie,

615
00:36:38,621 --> 00:36:40,300
not just entertainment.
Um,

616
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:44,980
do you think it being a movie versus a
book or an article or some other men's,

617
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,560
is it going to reach more people are
going to have a different impact?

618
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,060
Do you think it'd being
a movie specifically?

619
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,860
Well that depends on people like you
buying your moving ticket on Friday,

620
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:57,220
Saturday or Sunday of this week
preferably and going, she's not getting,

621
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:02,110
we're not kidding.
I think movie,

622
00:37:02,111 --> 00:37:05,710
I mean personally I think movies
have a wonderful and television. Um,

623
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,260
Ha has a wonderful way to uh,

624
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,260
create conversations about change because
I think a lot of people see them and

625
00:37:11,261 --> 00:37:12,260
they see them for fun.
And,

626
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:16,990
and our goal as a team and making this
movie was to make something that is just

627
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:18,880
in and of itself an
entertaining Wall Street movie.

628
00:37:18,881 --> 00:37:21,430
We really just want you to go to
the movies and enjoy the movie.

629
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,900
But then isn't it nice when you leave
a piece of theater or a movie or a TV

630
00:37:25,901 --> 00:37:29,980
series and you have real issues
to talk about afterwards? Um,

631
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,380
our goal is that you just watch it
and you don't really notice that it's

632
00:37:32,381 --> 00:37:35,560
starting three women directed by a woman
produced by women written by a woman.

633
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,430
You know,

634
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,520
you just watched the movie and enjoy it
and then afterwards you're like, Hey,

635
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,550
women can do that.
And it's a really great movie.

636
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,900
I think that's a really
interesting undercurrent when
watching the film is that

637
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:51,220
there's not a lot of discussion
about being a woman. Right?

638
00:37:51,221 --> 00:37:56,020
It's just something that I knew of going
into watching the film. But um, it is,

639
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:01,840
there is so much there to unpack that
is covered through the some text or

640
00:38:01,841 --> 00:38:06,580
through the interactions that might
not always be something that, you know,

641
00:38:06,581 --> 00:38:08,950
men would pick up on in regular terms,

642
00:38:08,951 --> 00:38:12,460
but because you're seeing it play out on
the big screen and it was one of those

643
00:38:12,461 --> 00:38:12,671
movies,

644
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:16,180
I definitely will say it's uncomfortable
to watch because it hit really close to

645
00:38:16,181 --> 00:38:17,250
home.
Um,

646
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:21,610
and it was one of those moments that
I get so frustrated and I could feel

647
00:38:21,611 --> 00:38:24,970
everything that Anna was going through.
And um,

648
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,820
and it is really powerful
message to put out there.

649
00:38:27,821 --> 00:38:31,090
And I think to digest in this platform
yet another reason why it's important to

650
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:35,920
see on the big screen, not the small
screen gone name. I just want to say

651
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,080
on that note of, you know, yes,

652
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:41,170
there's a here we've been asked here
today to talk about some of the themes and

653
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:44,380
the issues. But um, when I
started out as a playwright,

654
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:49,090
my brother who works in finance
actually, uh, would constantly kind of,

655
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,680
he would basically say to me,

656
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:53,470
he thought I was too caught up in
social issues and he thought it was,

657
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,050
I was prioritizing too
much in my projects,

658
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,780
the themes and the subject
matters that mattered to me.

659
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,270
And he would constantly say,
just tell a good story.

660
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:04,550
People just want to forget
whether it's environmental or the,

661
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,540
it's just tell it gets right. So, uh,

662
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,730
my brother actually came on as an investor
in this film and when he came to see

663
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:12,610
it at Sundance, he had never read the
script. He just took a leap of faith.

664
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:13,450
And when he came to see it,

665
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:17,320
I was really nervous because I
needed it to be a good story for him.

666
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:21,860
And he really, he loves the story. So
that's a vote of confidence for you.

667
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:29,930
Go ahead. Hello Amy. Now, for
some reason I want to fish.

668
00:39:29,931 --> 00:39:34,310
I don't know why.
So a question for you,

669
00:39:34,311 --> 00:39:37,610
Alicia and Anna. I'm so in the past, uh,

670
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
it kind of what struck me is that
you both played really strong and um,

671
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,890
if not polemic, a female characters
on TV, especially you, Alicia.

672
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:52,280
Holy Moly. Amazing. Um,

673
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,480
but I was just curious like
if those, either of those
characters that you played,

674
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:00,440
um, I'm talking about breaking bad and
orange is the new black obviously, um,

675
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:05,240
helped inform your performance or kind
of made you think about, you know,

676
00:40:05,241 --> 00:40:07,070
riding the line, you know,
between like, you know,

677
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,520
soft and hard and strong enough to strong,
uh,

678
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,680
just curious if no,
then then nobody.

679
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,400
Well, I, I sir, I had a very, uh,

680
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:23,650
strange and interesting journey with
Skylar in terms of the sort of Skyler hate

681
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,693
on the Internet.

682
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:30,850
And it was a very difficult
thing to understand when
it first started happening.

683
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,220
Um,

684
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:36,220
I wasn't really into looking at anything
on online and I was informed about it.

685
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:41,460
And then I, as I wrote
an op Ed piece, um, uh,

686
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,400
towards the end of the show,
I opened Pandora's box and looked at,

687
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,120
you know, looked at some of it because I
wanted to understand as a, as an actor,

688
00:40:50,121 --> 00:40:54,860
you want to understand if what you're
doing is not working or is rubbing people

689
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:58,270
the wrong way for some reason. And
then I started getting, I mean,

690
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:03,200
it really did parallel Naomi's journey
in so many ways because I started to

691
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:06,410
doubt myself and I started to
think, okay, what's, you know,

692
00:41:06,411 --> 00:41:10,050
what should I improve or what should
I do differently? Um, and then I,

693
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:14,690
I really went through a process of
shutting it down and not looking at it

694
00:41:14,691 --> 00:41:17,690
anymore. And I think there were
several reasons that it happened,

695
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,850
but I think we're still dealing with the,

696
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:25,280
the expectations of what a woman
should be, what her gender, you know,

697
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:30,290
gender roles, what a wife should be, what
we expect a woman to look like, to, uh,

698
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:34,850
to, to speak. Like if she's too
confident, if too, all those things.

699
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,620
So,
um,

700
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,310
I felt like I really understood
because I'd been through that.

701
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:44,780
It really informed how I played
Naomi because I'd been through that.

702
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:49,550
And I think that's why she's such a tough
person on the outside because she has

703
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:50,080
to be.

704
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,310
Hmm. Um, and for me,

705
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:59,140
uh,
similar journey,

706
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:02,530
you play a character like that
that's incredibly recognizable.

707
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:04,930
And I always say like,
my daughter would be on the seven.

708
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,960
My daughter learn the word bad ass really
early because I'd be with her and like

709
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:17,120
multiple times a day people come up to
me and they're like, Europe, bad ass.

710
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:22,100
And she's like, what's
up? You know? Um, and uh,

711
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:26,660
and similar to when we
were talking earlier,

712
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,490
I never saw her as a bad ass.
Like when you're in it,

713
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,150
you're just trying to do the best you can.

714
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,180
Like fig really thinks she's doing
the best she can for these women.

715
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:45,590
Like she really does in her twisted way.

716
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:50,450
Um, and let's be honest,
what happened when she left?

717
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:54,650
Not great stuff,
like she was working the system,

718
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,460
but she was running that place
better than he did. You know?

719
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,270
So just say it,

720
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,290
just say the woman knew
what she was doing.

721
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,630
So,
um,

722
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,880
with this I think in reference
to this piece of art,

723
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:20,110
I just want to say I was
so deeply inspired by Genji
and all the writers and all

724
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:23,540
the,
all the female directors and,

725
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:28,040
and the diversity of that
cast and that also, um,

726
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,620
I got to work in Shonda land after that.

727
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:35,621
It was funny because I wrote like when
we wrote our characters before we came to

728
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:40,280
Amy and, um, when I was creating
this character in my head,

729
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,770
I had never played, I hadn't played
a lawyer since like, you know,

730
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:46,520
five law and order as ago.
Um, which we did together.

731
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:51,080
We didn't know we were in the same
episode, didn't know each other.

732
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,750
Uh,
and um,

733
00:43:55,230 --> 00:44:00,230
so I w I was interested in playing sort
of the opposite of fig and when we wrote

734
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:02,940
her,
like,

735
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,100
and I knew that I wanted to be married
to a woman and an African American woman

736
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:10,760
because I wanted to create as many roles
for women and women of Color in this

737
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:14,640
movie.
And we didn't have an answer about what,

738
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,530
when we first had the ideas of these
characters, we didn't know how,

739
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:19,950
how the movie would end.

740
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,210
So we didn't know like would she
catch the bad guy in the, I'm like,

741
00:44:24,211 --> 00:44:26,310
she was the one in the white hat.

742
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:30,900
We didn't really have a sense of
where we were going with it. Um,

743
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,470
that's Amy's brilliance. And, um, and I,

744
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:39,300
I back to sort of full circle how fig
thinks she's doing that. You know,

745
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:42,930
Samantha things still thinks
she's going to catch the bad guys.

746
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:44,940
She's going to go and
do it a different way,

747
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:49,020
but she really still wants
to wear the white hat. Um,

748
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,140
so I don't know if that
answers your question at all.

749
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,700
Um, so we, we are running short on time,

750
00:44:56,701 --> 00:45:01,110
but I just want to make sure if you guys
could summarize quickly one sentiment

751
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:05,970
from this talk that you want to make
sure that the audience has walk away from

752
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:10,770
when they see the film on the big
screen this weekend. What would it be?

753
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,830
Fair.
It is for women.

754
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,060
Your dollar.
Don't let money be a dirty word.

755
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:24,130
So the film opens up this Friday in
New York City and La, please, please,

756
00:45:24,131 --> 00:45:28,060
please go see this film. It's a very
important statement and it's a great,

757
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:29,480
great story.
Um,

758
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:33,310
I'd love to thank all the Googlers for
joining the events team for kicking off a

759
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,470
flawless event.

760

Thank you so much.
Thank you.
