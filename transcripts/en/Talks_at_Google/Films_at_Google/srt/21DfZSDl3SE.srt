1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,310
Hello everyone. Welcome to the
toxic Google. I'm Kevin Volcan.

2
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:08,550
Today we had the creative team behind
the documentary back kid begins.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,290
And so we'd like to welcome Mike Do
Tan who played the penguin in the film.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,990
Patricia Wilson,
CEO of the Greater Bay area.

5
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:22,410
Make a wish and Dana knock men who uh,

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,590
directed the documentary film.
So thank you guys so much for being here,

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,440
having us. So Patricia,
we'll start with you.

8
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:33,060
Just can you tell us how you turn San
Francisco into Gotham for miles? No.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,020
Okay.
It's going to be talking over Great Mike.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,300
It's like,
so,

11
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,100
so, um, initially when I
began the wish, um, uh,

12
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:49,940
if you haven't seen the documentary
you'll, you'll discover in the film,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,230
his wish was to be the real Batman and
he was five at the time and battling

14
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:58,400
leukemia. So game on, right? What
does that mean to be the Real Batman?

15
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,280
And so when we have a
wish type that's creative,

16
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,310
you get yourself creatively in the eyes
of the child and try to find out who was

17
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:08,140
Batman to him,
what's that look like?

18
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:10,880
And we did a series of interviews with
his volunteer wish granters and his

19
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:13,070
parents. And we, I offered,

20
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:17,130
I like to offer choices because then I
know if I offer this and that that maybe

21
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,400
they can get, you know,
and I offered to, you know,

22
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:23,180
maybe we could do a caper to school and
we could kidnap his principal or you

23
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:25,100
know, or maybe he's the bad
guy. You ended up ending.

24
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:27,130
Now he feels about the
principal or you know,

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,180
I offered we could do something at six
flags and rescue someone on a roller

26
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:33,800
coaster. Or I offered, you know,
I was driving home one night, um,

27
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,220
I live and work in the city and the fog
was rolling in and I thought, you know,

28
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,940
it was pretty cool.
This could be Gotham city.

29
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:43,130
It's kind of more Gotham
than New York in many ways.

30
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:45,620
And so I offered a very bold statement.

31
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:49,040
I could turn San Francisco into Gotham
city. And that was the one that resonated.

32
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,350
And I began doing it on a five year
old scale thinking, you know, why can,

33
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:56,540
you know, a cable car,
it'll be a little corner.

34
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,470
But it just got bigger and bigger based
on the number of people who wanted to be

35
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:04,750
involved in it ended up being
on a scale for grownups and uh,

36
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,140
he was oblivious to that.

37
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:09,110
So it was one of my favorite things is
that he's still got his five year old

38
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:13,530
version that we were very protective
of him. Um, but beyond that, um,

39
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,660
there were a whole lot of people, 25,000,
over 25,000 showed up personally and,

40
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:20,230
or for 2 billion impressions worldwide.
Right.

41
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,460
And so what do you think attributed
to that? Cause that it was just,

42
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:25,260
it was such a huge global event.
I know Mike has started with your

43
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,290
tweet that went out that was just like,
you,

44
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:30,050
here's what's going on and all of
a sudden it just exploded. So yeah,

45
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:32,690
I knew spending this much time on
the Internet would finally pay off.

46
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,650
It's a little plug for
you guys. Yeah, it's,

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,460
you know, it, it just was, I
do some volunteer things and,

48
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:46,970
and make a wish was something that
I chosen to do this year. And, um,

49
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,370
Eja the guy who played Batman,

50
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:52,250
it had pulled me into this magic
and it was very small at the time,

51
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:55,400
but it was starting to get bigger and
bigger. And I thought, oh, this is great.

52
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:57,710
And I write a blog and I, I, you know,

53
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:02,040
I'm on Facebook and Twitter everything
too much and Google plus, sorry. Um,

54
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,370
and yeah, all of the things.
And uh, and I thought, well,

55
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:08,850
I'll post some photos of just
what's happening and, um,

56
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,440
people that are interested,
we'll get to see it and,

57
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,730
and maybe that will help inspire other
folks to do some more volunteering.

58
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:19,520
Cause you know, I'm taking the day off
work and running around the ballpark, um,

59
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,720
dressed up as a bad guy. It's pretty fun.
And that was like one of the rehearsals.

60
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:27,490
And from there, that's where I'm
apparently so says the, um, research,

61
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:32,230
I guess on this, that from that post it
started to then just snowball like crazy.

62
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:34,540
And people really liked
the idea of it and,

63
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,850
and just were kind of racing
to be involved themselves.

64
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,840
And you know, it was interesting.
We were sort of, um, uh,

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,800
a psychologist from Philadelphia who,
whom Dana interviewed, who flew out to,

66
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,090
to study why so many people were drawn
like a magnet to this event. And I,

67
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,250
she and I have spoken since a couple
of times and I do think that right now,

68
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:57,820
and this digital age,
I think there's a level of fatigue.

69
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,080
People are tired of the
sensational and bad news and,

70
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:02,650
and feeling a little overwhelmed.

71
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:06,780
And it was right after the sequester was
right after. So I think, I think they're,

72
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,200
they're tired of covering people who are
famous for being famous and, and, um,

73
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:15,310
so I think it was ripe for a good story
and it was exciting to think that social

74
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:18,880
media became social good. Um, so
that part is really interesting too,

75
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:22,120
that people who spoke,
I mean a couple of the,

76
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:25,550
under the two most important
themes that happen, um,

77
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,760
in the tweets that were measured,
first of all,

78
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:31,970
I had a 97% positive rate and
tweets, which is unheard of, right?

79
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,140
It's never happened before.
Um, and all of that,

80
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,720
some of that was sparring with a penguin
because of the penguin, how to handle

81
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,880
oh yeah. And My tweets were evil, right?

82
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,940
The two messages were,
yeah.

83
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,750
Um,
it renewed people's faith in humankind.

84
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,680
And the other message was that people
felt it was the best thing that ever

85
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:51,820
happened to San Francisco.

86
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:56,440
And that can make me cry to the state
because if you had told me that I'd be

87
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:58,990
involved in a project that
could reach that magnitude,

88
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:02,950
I would have never believed you.
Um, but it was that kind of day.

89
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:06,820
It's the kind of day I saw a news
report. Someone reviewed, um,

90
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,280
the documentary and said,
you know,

91
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:12,610
it was the kind of news event that
people remember where they were that day.

92
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:15,580
And they'll tell me, oh, I was an
la following the story I remember.

93
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,260
And that's just insane to think that we
were part of something that made people

94
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:21,790
so happy.
So it's delightful.

95
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,170
It's one of the only one in the very
few documentaries that I could actually

96
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:28,800
name that is actually a positive
message because usually they're just so

97
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:33,150
depressing ad. So, you know, like it
just, it's, this is just a really,

98
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:36,120
really feel good. So, Dana, can I want to
get into that where it's just, you know,

99
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,400
well, but it was great because it was
definitely a breath of fresh air. But,

100
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,790
so what, so what brought you to the
product because you came in after the day,

101
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,060
but did you know what was going
on during the day and what was,

102
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,320
that's always my most embarrassing
question. I missed the entire thing.

103
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,440
Like I feel like I was not one of
the 2 billion people who followed.

104
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,250
It's just so embarrassing. I
think I, I was editing that day,

105
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,810
another project. I was really
immersed in that. And yeah, I was, um,

106
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:07,760
I guess just kind of zoned in that
day. But, um, I had done three very,

107
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:12,080
very harsh down trodden,
um,

108
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,590
difficult but important
documentaries before. That's
when I was finishing up one.

109
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,670
I'm on toxic chemicals and all of our
products and the lack of regulation.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,110
I watched them. No, and it's true and
that's it. But it's why I wanted to,

111
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:27,980
I was looking for something more positive.
Or you watched him. Oh, good, good. Um,

112
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,660
and so I was,

113
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,440
so I was looking for something lighter.
Um,

114
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,210
I was looking for something more
childlike. I have three little kids.

115
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:40,930
I was looking for something that
I can engage with them on. Um,

116
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,460
so I was looking for something
just right when this happened.

117
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:46,440
And so I learned about it
the day after, um, when, uh,

118
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,260
a bunch of people I was
on a conference call with,

119
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:50,630
we're talking about it and they were all
men and they were all kind of in their

120
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:51,464
forties,

121
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,640
and they were all talking to this little
boy in this Cape and running around San

122
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,270
Francisco. And I googled it and I was
like, oh my gosh, what an amazing thing.

123
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:00,890
This is perfect. Too Bad. I missed it.

124
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:04,690
The lucky person who is doing
that documentary, um, you
know, God bless them. And,

125
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:09,280
and then, um, we, my producer Lisa
and I got a call with make-a-wish, um,

126
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:10,790
and they're like, Oh yeah,
come in tomorrow morning.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,980
And turned out people had
had reached out to them,

128
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:16,190
but they were so inundated with this
thing blowing up and going viral that they

129
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:18,080
couldn't deal with a
documentary team at the time.

130
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,050
But we had the good fortune of finding
out we were going to do it regardless of

131
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:21,471
what it took,

132
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:24,980
whether we had to crowd source all
the video or whatever we had to do.

133
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,920
But at the end of this two and a half
hour meeting where we first met and became

134
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:30,890
great friends and launch this project,
I said, you didn't have to shoot it,

135
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:34,220
did you? She's like, Oh yeah, we wanted
to have a fundraising video for our gala.

136
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,900
So we shot it with five cameras.

137
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,070
And so that really made it a heck
of a lot easier for my editor, for,

138
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:42,740
for all of us. And then we kind
of filled in the blanks with, um,

139
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,680
with the interviews and finding
all the different people,

140
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:49,370
like the woman Susan from Philadelphia
and others who had flown in for this and

141
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,470
just a myriad of other
people who made it happen.

142
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,320
Was that a difficult
process though of taking,

143
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,910
getting all that footage and trying to
make a cohesive story out of it? No,

144
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,980
it was such a funny thing.
I mean maybe Kurt,

145
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,440
my awesome friend and editor
and co-writer would disagree,

146
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:07,460
but I mean we had the layout
for the movie right away.

147
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:11,300
I mean I applied for a grant very early
on and the nuts and bolts of the film

148
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:12,680
stayed the same from the beginning.
So there,

149
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,010
I think this was easier in a way
because the story was so laid out.

150
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:16,910
I mean it was a chronology.

151
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:20,750
I mean we knew we wanted
to have his backstory in
animation, so it was less sad,

152
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:24,620
more kid like get it over with the sad
part in the first 10 minutes of the movie.

153
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,060
And then from there have the rest of the
first act of meeting all the people, um,

154
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,590
and then call the beginning of
the second act would be when,

155
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:33,200
when Mike's blog went viral.

156
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,990
So that kind of launches the whole
viral nature of the whole thing.

157
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:38,600
And they're kind of like now, oh no, this
is that. We thought it was one thing.

158
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,780
Now it's another thing that was a second
act and then the third act was the day

159
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:45,020
of. And so that kind of came to me
very quickly and the structure of it.

160
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,190
So really it was just filling in all
the pieces and all the cameras that day

161
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:51,140
really followed. So we
knew the capers, you know,

162
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:54,110
we had all the papers laid out and so
it was actually pretty seamless. I mean,

163
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,510
the hardest thing it was that I promised
Patricia we would have a cut on the one

164
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:00,000
year anniversary of it and
I had never made a film.

165
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,620
I'm in less than three to four years and
so this was going to be about 10 months.

166
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:09,570
So it was like, oh shit. I didn't know how
long it took. You know, and when anybody,

167
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,970
anybody applies for a job, they say, oh,
the person wants. And they're like, oh,

168
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,780
she wants it. And nine months, yeah,
I can do that. How many hours was it?

169
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:21,810
The curt wanted to watch all the footage.
Okay. Yeah, he, that was the one thing.

170
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,231
So curt,

171
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:25,770
I had two editors fall through on and
that was a source of a lot of stress for

172
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:28,040
me just because I had it all written.
Um,

173
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,570
and got it in a place that I could give
it to an editor and I didn't have an

174
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:30,961
editor.

175
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:34,140
And so then a really talented friend of
mine who's a director in his own right,

176
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:34,651
he,

177
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:38,880
I didn't know he would take on somebody
else's project and he needed work at the

178
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:42,750
very moment that I needed an editor.
So he took it on and I had it laid out.

179
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,890
And so I was like,

180
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,900
hoping that he would just start editing
right away and he's like, no, no, no.

181
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,070
I have to watch every frame of it. And
I was like, every frame of it. I mean,

182
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:54,030
it was something like Tor
terabytes. I mean Mike was just, uh,

183
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,620
it just goes on and on and on.
I was watching, I was like,

184
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:03,570
why won't I stop talking?
Stop. No, and so I'm, so,

185
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:06,660
he insisted on watching every moment
of it, but it was such the right move.

186
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:10,290
Cause he, he found things that I
hadn't had time yet to even find,

187
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:15,120
which were little nuggets between miles
and Ega, the bad kid or the Batman.

188
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:18,240
And it was a really the right move. But
he, I mean, I think he spent a month,

189
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:21,480
it was about, I think at that point
about three terabytes worth of footage.

190
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,850
And it wasn't four K so it was, it was,
um, a lot of footage. That's crazy. So,

191
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:30,850
and so Patricia, so from the initial time
when the wish came in from, you know,

192
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,600
November 15th, there was, and so when, um,

193
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,480
like how long was that between
when the initial wish game?

194
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,340
So I got the wish, uh, end of January,

195
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:44,360
early February in my program director
walked in and we'd worked together many

196
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:48,270
years and she said, I have your Christmas
present. I have a superhero wishing.

197
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:50,570
And I'd always wanted,
thought it would be fun.

198
00:10:50,571 --> 00:10:52,160
And I thought it would be that our,

199
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,190
our network of volunteers and fun and
wild and crazy people would really get

200
00:10:57,441 --> 00:11:00,620
behind it. And we could do a really
cool creative wish like that.

201
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:04,010
So that was always, I'd see other
chapters to it and think, Oh man,

202
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,630
San Francisco wouldn't we love
costumes? Right. So I think we could,

203
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,550
we could do a good job.
So I had the benefit of time to planet it.

204
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:17,120
Partly the family didn't want to do it
any sooner than November because he had

205
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:20,300
his surgery to have his port removed,
which is how we got as chemotherapy.

206
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:22,240
So they wanted it to be
after his chemotherapy,

207
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:27,180
so he'd have energy to be a superhero.
And it was after farming season, um,

208
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,400
his dad's a farmer and I'm also a
volunteer fireman and mom's a nurse.

209
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,850
And so they're just kind of this
quintessential live on a farm. Adorable.

210
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:37,760
Tiny little too late. Oh, beautiful.

211
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:42,590
And so this is in the film, it's
just, it's gorgeous. Yeah. Yup. Yup.

212
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:45,170
And so, um, I began, you know,

213
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,730
initially doing the work to understand
the creativity part and who Batman was.

214
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,440
Um, and then early on,
because they, he was shy.

215
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:55,100
We weren't sure how that
was going to work. I,

216
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,500
I suggested to the family that he'd be a
mini me and I have a full sized Batman.

217
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:03,940
And Eja was my first choice because
I'd worked with him 10 years prior on a

218
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:08,500
project in which he created a video
game that fights cancer cells. Um, yeah,

219
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:12,280
Ben's game. Uh, and so
I knew he'd be amazing,

220
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,600
partly because he's a former stunt double
and he's a, an acrobat. And I needed,

221
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,080
they said, you know, there were more
interested in gadgets, not the villain,

222
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:22,930
so we didn't want really scary villains.
Um,

223
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:25,060
so we began putting it
all together around that.

224
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:28,420
And the first thing that came to mind
was a cable car rescue on Nob Hill. Like,

225
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:29,254
why not?
Right.

226
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,480
And then the rest kind of fell into place
because miles was a huge giants fan.

227
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:37,440
So we wanted to involve something
with a ballpark. And um,

228
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,410
it's still kind of crazy to think,
you know,

229
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,430
you and I've talked a fair amount since
then. Then we both had true confessions.

230
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,380
Wine might've been involved, I
don't know, but true confession

231
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,930
and Scott, both of us literally Google
post traumatic stress disorder. Yeah.

232
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,540
Yeah. Because of this experience.
And you know, it's so pleasant,

233
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,480
it's wonderful. But it's
also really scary. Yeah.

234
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,680
To be the center of a story that was one
of the biggest news stories of the year.

235
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,380
And I'll tell you it just desperate to
do a good job. A very personal story.

236
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:15,240
So I was online dating during
that time. Yeah. And uh,

237
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,980
I didn't think to take my profile
down. Hmm. And so when I log,

238
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,060
wow. Wow, that was delete,
delete, block block.

239
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:29,320
And then it was funny be busy
till November 15th. Well it was,

240
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,610
it wasn't until I,
you Ari,

241
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:34,510
I logged back on it and there where I
want to be your superhero going. Oh Wow.

242
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:39,030
Right. I to marriage or utility bill
for you. What was that? Oh my God,

243
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,440
it was blocked. Delete. And you know,

244
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:45,550
when people take my image and put it in
Google images and figure out who I was,

245
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:50,530
right. So I began immediately saying, oh,

246
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,310
a children's charity executive.
I started not,

247
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:56,770
and it was like I was in the witness
protection burger when I sit next to

248
00:13:56,771 --> 00:14:00,850
someone on a plane. Now, I
won't tell them. Look, I do.

249
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:03,820
So we're in to film them.
Yeah.

250
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,350
They're involved with Jude. So, and
like, so you got burned by [inaudible].

251
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,020
So can you talk about just,
she'd mentioned, you know,

252
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:10,300
with not carrying these scary characters,
so you were,

253
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,210
penguin was the very iconic
one from like the 60 series.

254
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:16,420
Can you talk about that kind
of development and we're
working with miles or EGID

255
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:19,320
kind of make sure that it wasn't
scary and sure, sure, sure.

256
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,130
Yeah. So not being an active at
all. Like I'm a software engineer,

257
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:26,640
like everybody else here, everybody, um,

258
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,760
to some extent anyway, I'm
sure. Um, so, you know,

259
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,360
this is by far not what I do for a living.
Um,

260
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,620
I'm obviously one of the, like, I'm
sure Google has the exact percentages,

261
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:43,340
but I'm one of the say 4% extroverted
computer scientists in the world. Um,

262
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:46,640
so we're a rare breed, but still
nonetheless not an actor by any means.

263
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,650
And so I just really wanted to make
sure that it did a good job. And,

264
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,980
um, you know, my girlfriend
really? Ooh, now fiance,

265
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:02,360
um, she's going to love that
part. Um, uh, my fiance,

266
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:05,450
so my girlfriend at the
time, uh, she said, you know,

267
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,080
she really kept me grounded with
the whole thing and said, you know,

268
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:12,170
this isn't like as it started getting
bigger and bigger and bigger, I was like,

269
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:15,530
oh my God. Like all these people are
coming, they have all these expectations,

270
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,230
they want to have fun,
they want to see this like fun,

271
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:20,360
silly caper thing and you know,

272
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:22,940
how am I going to make sure
that they enjoy themselves?

273
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,120
How am I going to make sure that I as
a first time volunteer for make-a-wish,

274
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,030
it's a hell of a one to start with.
Um,

275
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,270
how am I going to make sure
that I represent make-a-wish
and the best way that I

276
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:38,990
can in the way that they want me to
represent them to this globe. Now,

277
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:43,310
global audience, unexpectedly
global audience. So you know, I,

278
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:46,790
and everybody else involved in the project
also were very concerned about doing

279
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,250
that and doing the best
possible job we could.

280
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:53,330
So I kind of reverted back
to my sort of engineering,

281
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,060
my sort of, you might
say meticulous, I guess,

282
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:01,090
obsessive engineering background and
just kind of researching as much as I

283
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:04,700
could. I was like, okay. So I watched
all the old Batman's when I was a kid,

284
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,910
so I'll rewatch them. I was like,
oh, thank God it's on Netflix.

285
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,590
And so it was maybe two weeks out and
I started having a panic attack that,

286
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,850
that I, you know, I didn't
know the character and I
wasn't going to do a good job.

287
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,400
I don't even know what his walk
is like. And so I watched, um,

288
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,400
as many as I could find quickly. And, uh,

289
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,340
the 1967 movie, I believe it is a 68, um,

290
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,560
I watched that like five times just over
and over and rewind just the penguin

291
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:33,280
parts and be like, okay,
so that's why you kind of,

292
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:37,100
you've gotten this sorta like kinda
leans into it and he's squinting his eyes

293
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:39,470
all the time and he kind of,
there's like a few,

294
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:44,210
like really silly kind of things like,
uh, like puns that he'd throw in there.

295
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,510
And it was all hilarious and ridiculous.
Um,

296
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,540
and of course we decided to base it off
the old characters because that's what

297
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:54,650
miles liked. And also, um, as much
as I love the Danny Devito Penguin,

298
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,440
yeah, that's not going to work for
a five year old. Um, it's, you know,

299
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:05,360
it's still gives me
nightmares. So, so, uh, yeah,

300
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:09,880
so I just, I just watched a lot of it, a
lot, a lot and practice the walk. And, um,

301
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:14,000
once we got the costumes from the, that
was like a week out, we got the costumes.

302
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,120
So I hadn't even seen what it was gonna
look like yet. You know, I tried that on,

303
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:20,960
I wore the Monaco all the weekend before.
I just kind of wore it the whole time.

304
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,100
I was like, oh, okay,

305
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:26,750
the penguin is doing the sneer cause
you have to to keep the monocle in.

306
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,710
It's like part of the costume.
I had no idea. Um, so yeah,

307
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:33,500
I practiced a lot with them on the
club's doing this for awhile because it's

308
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:36,890
kind of hard to keep those things
in. Um, but uh, yeah, it was great.

309
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:41,360
So just kind of a lot of just sort
of effort and energy into trying to

310
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,840
understand what I was doing and see
examples of very excellent people are just

311
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:51,390
Meredith in this case, doing
that thing in the past. Um,

312
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,310
and sort of getting my
own twist a little but,

313
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:57,900
but really kind of researching the best
way and then ultimately remembering what

314
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:01,950
my girlfriend said was,
remember an Ega said this,

315
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:06,210
which was everybody was on the same page.
This is all for miles in the end.

316
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,090
30,000 people are going
to come and watch this.

317
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,630
Every news agency in the world is going
to be there like burning through photos.

318
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,720
Google's likeyes is going to put
you in the video. Thanks for that.

319
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:17,520
That was awesome.
Um,

320
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:22,230
but ultimately this is about
miles achieving as well.

321
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,600
And those other 30,000 people might be
disappointed and that wasn't our job.

322
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,180
Yeah.

323
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,510
The job is to make sure miles has a
great time and that's all that counts.

324
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,150
So that kind of takes the pressure
off the fact that BBC is like,

325
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:33,640
so what do you think?
Yeah.

326
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:39,790
Remember when we were rehearsing?
Yeah. And you and, and Emj.

327
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,800
We're in the Ballpark,
right?

328
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,620
So we're doing rehearsal and it was
Mike's first time that he's hearing the

329
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:44,540
whole row we're on through.

330
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,770
So we're sitting there giving
you a run through going, okay,

331
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:50,660
so the fire boats are going to be over
here and it's like fireball, fireball?

332
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,181
And I said,
yeah.

333
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:55,890
And I know that they're trying to get
to have a plane pull with a Hashtag.

334
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,990
It's like there's going to play no,

335
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:00,820
actually their story and
it's all because of all,

336
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,450
and this is where the helicopters are
coming in. I was like, what is going on?

337
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,770
And and it was that day and we were
doing being goofy. And I thought,

338
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,420
wouldn't it be cool if I was able to
figure out to do a handle for penguin and

339
00:19:13,421 --> 00:19:18,421
have penguin tweeting that day and had
the idea and then quickly managed to say

340
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,940
this. That's insane, Patricia.
That'll never happen.

341
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:25,720
But then literally the next day Twitter
called me and said, do you want help?

342
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:28,420
And I said, Oh hell yes. Yes.

343
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:32,860
And I have this crazy idea and I've always
wanted to tweet a wish in real time.

344
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:36,760
And this was a public wished so it was
okay. And they said we're on board.

345
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:39,400
And initially they had four
people at the end of the day,

346
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:43,160
they had 12 people managing our Twitter
feed. Yeah, it was crazy. It was,

347
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,580
how are you showing the film? Just
the buildup to it. So, you know,

348
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,260
you have 10 months to plant where,
you know,

349
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:50,290
11 months to plan this thing and then
all of a sudden the final month this

350
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,990
explode. So can you talk about
that time of an exploding in the,

351
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,710
how did you manage that?
Your heart is beating faster,

352
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:58,300
I know where you didn't
feel the tension to be like,

353
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:02,880
so thanks to his Facebook posts
that he literally cut and paste, um,

354
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,300
the schedule for the day. Like this
looks great problem, tears all the time.

355
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:10,240
He goes, this is the coolest wish
ever. And then a blogger of silicon up.

356
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:14,200
So FFS February or November 8th or ninth,

357
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:18,820
I forget which day now. Um, posted it
and we saw how everybody, you know,

358
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:22,660
and I had people tagging Facebook and
private messaging me and going to tune you

359
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:27,580
know about this. Like yes, I do
hold on it since January. And,

360
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:29,770
and mind you,
we're doing 380 wishes this year,

361
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,880
so we're working on lots
of wishes. Right. Um,

362
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:37,180
and so that kind of happens on the weekend
comes and goes and I see it mentioned

363
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:42,181
a few times and then on Monday it gets
another blogger and then by Wednesday the

364
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:45,400
traditional press started coming,
which I find interesting.

365
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,450
That traditional press covers
whatever happens, social media. Um,

366
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,560
so we decided what it's going to
be news and then they cover it.

367
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,510
And so then it was kind of like,
and you know,

368
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:56,680
so first it was local news and then we
started getting national news and then

369
00:20:56,681 --> 00:21:00,280
we've got international news and then
we've got Al Jazeera and the good year

370
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:04,270
blimp called. And I think the joke
internally, I mean we were law,

371
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,330
I will see like who else is going to
call it, what are we going to have next?

372
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,860
The president.
And then he

373
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,610
tweeted out a a beautiful message.
Yeah,

374
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,080
it was incredible.
Incredible.

375
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:21,081
So can you guys talk about just that
one handling that sort of big event and

376
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:23,130
Dana and just Kinda your,
you know,

377
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,860
just the handling of the movie with
the family and miles, cause I'm,

378
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,750
I'm guessing like once it blows up,
it was like, oh this isn't right.

379
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:34,680
Exactly. Well and you can't control
that. Right? So it wasn't, um,

380
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,860
I gave the family again, choices and I
said, look, um, this thing has blown up.

381
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,900
We've never had this happen before. My
instincts are, I think it'll be good,

382
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,090
but it may not be what miles want,

383
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:50,860
so we can change the date and I can
go private and do something completely

384
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:52,360
different.
We can keep the date,

385
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,050
just change the locations where
we can stay steady in the course.

386
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:59,530
And they talked about it and they chose
to study the course because they had so

387
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:03,550
many family who were coming in and they
had scheduled this for so long and they

388
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:05,950
said, we think it'll be good. And
they weren't really big. You know,

389
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:10,690
the beauty was he's on Twitter, he's
five. So none of it was spoiled for him.

390
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,030
But, um, you know, I got,

391
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,250
so I think the first opportunity to see
the chief of police after that was a,

392
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,780
a couple of weeks later and both of
us were confessing to each other the

393
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:23,950
concerns we had. I mean him for
public safety and, and me to, to go,

394
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:27,820
would this make, make a
wish, look bad ball, make San
Francisco look bad. You know,

395
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:30,850
what could go wrong. Um, I do, I really,

396
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:34,240
really regret though that I didn't have
miles really rob a bank because I think

397
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:37,120
we would've gotten away with it and
I'd never need to fundraise for,

398
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:40,900
make a wish again. Banks could
have been competing know Rodney.

399
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,800
But, uh, it was, it was intense that day,

400
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:49,090
but it was when the day unfolded,
it was that beautiful.

401
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:52,990
I mean the chief Sir talks about,
um, how people would be asked,

402
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:54,330
like the little guys getting scared,

403
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,860
people were getting too close to
the car and it was spooking him out.

404
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,280
So we told the police that and
they asked people, you know, folks,

405
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:03,910
can you help us out here? And they were
like, oh sure, no problem. I'll step back.

406
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:07,010
And he said, yeah, we'll take that
any other day of the week. That was,

407
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,210
I think that the whole city just kind
of came together and were just like, oh,

408
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:13,570
we get it. Like there was no violence,
there was no fights, there was no like,

409
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:14,970
it didn't say, I don't think
there were any arrest either.

410
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,130
No. Was just, everyone was just
like, we're cool to clean up. I mean,

411
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,050
there's other folks who'd normally
clean up after the Superbowl parade or

412
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:23,620
wherever and said, we've never had
people pick up their stuff. He goes,

413
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,220
well it was,
it was pretty,

414
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:30,050
it wasn't like something that you
really think was not possible. Right.

415
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,040
It happened that day.

416
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,730
Yeah. And so Dana, when you were kind
of handling the film and working,

417
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,530
did you work with the family at all?
Cause you had to,

418
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:37,570
cause you had to shoot a lot of footage
of like the backstory and stuff.

419
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:39,450
So how is that handling with them and,

420
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,510
yeah, so at first we
treaded really lightly. Um,

421
00:23:42,511 --> 00:23:45,590
it's funny to think about now because I
consider them really good friends now.

422
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:45,990
And

423
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,620
miles is very good friends with
my son who's eight years old,

424
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:51,260
just a year older than miles
and they're really close.

425
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:56,150
They try to figure out how to video
message each other and stuff and they talk

426
00:23:56,151 --> 00:24:00,020
on the phone. And so now I consider them
friends. But back when we first started,

427
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,570
I'm, Patricia reached out to
them first and said, you know,

428
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:07,070
we're interested in doing this
documentary. Um, and really I think a lot,

429
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,260
like the day we didn't, you know, we,

430
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:11,570
our plan was to get the
movie to make the movie,

431
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,040
but we were so rushed in making it,

432
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,860
I wasn't really thinking that much about
what would happen after we, you know,

433
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:18,650
we would go to a film
festival, hope to sell it. Um,

434
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,050
but we were so busy making the movie,
we didn't think a lot about that.

435
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,920
And then Warner brothers decided
to buy it. Um, and so it just,

436
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:28,880
like the day of it really blew up
more than we thought it would and go

437
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:30,920
theatrical. So I think when we
first started talking to him,

438
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,241
yeah,

439
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:33,250
I thought it was going to
be in the conference room
and I'm going to be showing

440
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:34,720
it to my volunteers.
Yeah.

441
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,120
Yeah. I mean, I was hoping it would be a
bit more than that. Um, but I, you know,

442
00:24:40,121 --> 00:24:44,830
in my wildest dreams, I didn't think that,
um, what would happen, you know, happen.

443
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,900
Um, and so it was amazing. So
we, we, um, first reached it.

444
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:52,660
I met them at the opening day ceremony,

445
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,690
the miles throughout the first
pitch. Um, for the giants.

446
00:24:55,691 --> 00:24:59,800
And so we met them that day and we just
kind of got them used to us. And, um,

447
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:03,550
and then a couple months later we went
to their farm and we just really hit it

448
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:06,760
off at their farm. And my
son came with us and, um,

449
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,030
and so he played with miles the whole
weekend and we shot them playing and,

450
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,170
and they're just a lovely, lovely family.
Um, and you know, by knowing them,

451
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:17,710
I understood that their intention
for this, um, to the contrary,

452
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,350
they didn't want to become
famous. I mean, they were there,

453
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:23,680
they're just pretty cash people.
And so the fact that this happened,

454
00:25:23,681 --> 00:25:26,080
they couldn't have been a better family
for this to happen to, to have, uh,

455
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,290
have their wish go viral because they're
very, they're pretty chill. Um, but,

456
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,000
but also we had to realize that they,
they,

457
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,400
we weren't going to have them
do press for the documentary.

458
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,860
We weren't going to have them do
anything because they're not celebrities.

459
00:25:35,861 --> 00:25:38,710
He's not a child actor. I remember
early on somebody said, oh,

460
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:42,460
we want to profile miles as a child
actor. I'm like, he's not a child actor.

461
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:46,570
He's a amazing cancer survivor
who had this amazing day.

462
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:49,480
Then he doesn't even know what
Twitter was or anything else.

463
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,330
And he doesn't know what it became.
And we want to kind of keep it that way.

464
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,620
And so when the film was good, it was
done. Um, I actually talked to his mom,

465
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:57,940
Natalie. I said, do
you want him to see it?

466
00:25:57,941 --> 00:26:01,240
Because it really shows what the
day was. And she and I, you know,

467
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:03,910
I was kind of conflicted about that
because I wanted him to just think it

468
00:26:03,911 --> 00:26:05,950
happened. Um, but she said, no, no.

469
00:26:05,951 --> 00:26:08,620
She wanted him to see it and then he
wanted to see it the next day and the next

470
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,230
day and the next day, even though, you
know, because kids are great like that.

471
00:26:11,231 --> 00:26:13,810
They can suspend disbelief
as much as they want.

472
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:17,550
And so even though they know exactly
how it happened, he knows, um,

473
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:22,090
he still loves it and still believes that
he is that kid and that Uja is Batman

474
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:24,940
and it's still very present in his,
in his life.

475
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:30,040
He beat some bad guys in Patricia's
city by city. It's just a city.

476
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,330
We call it that too.

477
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:37,020
I mean he thinks that the j is
the real Batman. I mean he'll say,

478
00:26:37,021 --> 00:26:39,920
oh he had like he chased the real
Batman on Sunday after his wish.

479
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,030
The chronicle reprinted that
cover know back kid saves city.

480
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,960
It was on the front page of the Sunday
paper and he was walking downtown and saw

481
00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:51,210
it and one of the new standards.
And so, you know, mom,

482
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,100
I'm available to save more lives today
if they need me on me in his mind.

483
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,680
And that's a beautiful segue into kind
of EMJ cause it's one of the most just,

484
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,270
it gives me goosebumps and it
just sacked me right in the gut.

485
00:27:04,271 --> 00:27:07,230
One of the most beautiful moments
in the movie that I thought was, um,

486
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,060
when you guys did, when he, Jay
set up the whole acrobat thing,

487
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:13,870
the whole training thing and this kind
of like almost kind of like muscle memory

488
00:27:13,871 --> 00:27:17,370
for the, for miles when I was like,
Hey, I'm going to take cause EEG.

489
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,290
We can describe Bj. I mean,
he is a software engineer,

490
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:23,800
a game developer and an acrobat.
And He,

491
00:27:23,801 --> 00:27:27,370
so he used the showcase is all on the
field is Bruce Wayne, Bruce Wayne,

492
00:27:27,371 --> 00:27:31,030
because literally Bruce Wayne and
it's so cool are the only cool,

493
00:27:31,031 --> 00:27:34,570
he's like the most intimidating guy.
If he wasn't so darn nice, you know,

494
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,790
you're so scared of him. Then you talked
to him and he said, oh, he's nice.

495
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:41,500
He likes, this is what every human, yes.
Aspire to. That's all. Yeah, he's great.

496
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,840
But it was so genius at what he did was,

497
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:47,200
and what you guys did was you put miles
to this superhero training and everyone

498
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:51,460
got involved in this superhero gym
of with Dj and doing everything.

499
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:55,420
So everything that was done for the
day was also done the night before.

500
00:27:55,421 --> 00:27:59,050
So miles like, oh, I guess I did this, I
get, I can do that, I can do this flip,

501
00:27:59,051 --> 00:28:03,610
I can do this, crawl over.
But the, the part that got
me was the acrobat handshake.

502
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:06,910
And so it's this, this, and he did that.

503
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,910
And then the next day when he
went to the hotel, you know,

504
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:13,370
he's kind of scared by Batman, by
Emj. But then he does that. It's like,

505
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,470
and it's just like his eyes Yak. I'm
in like, I got this. Like I know,

506
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,910
I know this guy.
And he's like,

507
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:25,110
that footage is pretty amazing because I
did not allow any cameras when he first

508
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:27,780
met Batman Cause I thought
if he spooked wishes over,

509
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:30,990
we're going to do whatever miles wanted.
And everybody was mad at me and I said,

510
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:33,360
no, no cameras, this is
not. And they said, well,

511
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:37,200
weren't filming a documentary like that.
I never thought this was good.

512
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:40,170
I'm doing a wish and you're not going
to Mike him. And that's how it is.

513
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,190
So that just kind of put,
some people were pretty miffed at me,

514
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:48,690
but the wished family taped it
themselves on their iPhone or,

515
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,050
or would they be okay?

516
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:50,721
Yeah.

517
00:28:50,721 --> 00:28:54,690
Somebody on the way out of town said
they had never had a video camera their

518
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:58,470
whole life and somebody gave it to him
as a present the night before. And um,

519
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,340
I know, and so on. And so they
shot, I mean I agree with you.

520
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:04,040
I think the circus center video where
the night before with some of the best,

521
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,200
it's the best scene in
the film that I'm in,

522
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,410
something nobody ever saw because
the family was only ones who had the,

523
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,690
had the video. And um, when they,

524
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,690
the circus center supposedly
shot a little of it there,

525
00:29:14,691 --> 00:29:15,800
but they lost the footage.

526
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:18,770
And so the only footage that remained
was what the parents had shot.

527
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,720
And they did such a
heck of a job on it too.

528
00:29:20,721 --> 00:29:23,450
Like usually when you get home video
from people and it's not the best,

529
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,660
but they did the whole scene is from their
footage and there's some really great

530
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:27,590
shots,
um,

531
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:32,620
from the day of that that I'm nick miles
dad also shot and they did an amazing,

532
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,970
amazing job.
We got very lucky it,

533
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,023
I mean it,
it,

534
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,430
the circuit tenor was scary because we
got a call from them and some of the

535
00:29:39,431 --> 00:29:42,840
press had, we're starting
to follow the, and you know,

536
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,880
that's something I didn't even think
about it like when the Hyatt wanted to put

537
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:49,600
the bat man, the project, the
Batman logo on their building.

538
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:50,530
I thought that would be cool.

539
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:53,680
But that told everyone where they were
saying and then they had to have more

540
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:54,191
security.

541
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:58,300
I mean I never in my wildest dreams
thought we have to now protect this family

542
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:02,110
because now they're becoming celebrities.
And then the press was just,

543
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,000
some of them just playing vultures.
They,

544
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:08,650
I mean they had to find this family and
they were all trying to get some sort of

545
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:12,340
exclusive and they wanted the wanting
to see your costume the night before

546
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:13,174
they're trying to end up,

547
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:17,910
it's in my apartment. Well I pace
back and forth, try not to, you know,

548
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,100
pass out and

549
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,270
it's just, you know, something
you've never experienced.

550
00:30:22,271 --> 00:30:25,660
I mean to have a news crew in our lobby
saying they didn't want to leave until

551
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,120
you go down there going,
it was just never happen.

552
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,660
So we were ill equipped
to know how to handle, um,

553
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:37,450
and obviously a really small team.
We only have 27 staff and 550 volunteers.

554
00:30:37,451 --> 00:30:40,330
And so it's, you know, it
was just our little group.

555
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:43,540
And so fortunately a lot of people came
forward and started volunteering and I

556
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:47,320
would say, yes, we need your
help. Whatever you can do.

557
00:30:47,321 --> 00:30:48,310
And so can we talk a little bit,

558
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,120
he just is like,

559
00:30:51,121 --> 00:30:53,700
cause you brought him in obviously cause
you'd known him since he worked with

560
00:30:53,701 --> 00:30:54,820
make a wish for a while ago.
Yup.

561
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,120
And so just his development
of it and bringing you in and

562
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,940
just kind of the who we had
a series of conferences, um,

563
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,440
when we were planning the wish and
saying, what about this, what about that?

564
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:09,700
Or sometimes I would see the costume is
a piece that we all worked on together

565
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,880
and was problematic for
us. Um, and, uh, you know,

566
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:15,130
and I knew that that was the
most important thing to mile.

567
00:31:15,131 --> 00:31:16,870
So there was a lot of pressure going,
oh man,

568
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:20,200
if he gets his costume and cries when he
sees it because he was so excited about

569
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:24,580
the new costume. So it was just a
collaborative, um, amazing process.

570
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:27,250
And that I have to say, um, my,

571
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,640
the only gift I have is selecting
the right people, cause Eja. I mean,

572
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:34,780
these folks are brilliant and they're fun
and collaborative and they're way more

573
00:31:34,781 --> 00:31:37,040
creative. And so they took
it to a level, you know,

574
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,470
so all that rehearsal and the dynamics
and the specifics are where the volunteer

575
00:31:41,471 --> 00:31:42,850
team that were on the west.

576
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,790
Wow. And so how do you know Egypt? Uh, so
we worked together for a long time at, um,

577
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,050
at Lucasfilm, at a industrial,
had magic in, in San Francisco.

578
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,810
And so he was at Lucas Arts for a very,
very long time,

579
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:58,160
about 19 years or something. Um, and then
transition to Ilm for a few years now.

580
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:02,960
Now I'm a, now he runs his own
software company. Uh, but, uh, yes.

581
00:32:02,961 --> 00:32:05,360
So we worked together for quite a long
time and I always just thought, man,

582
00:32:05,361 --> 00:32:08,390
that guy is interesting. He was like
the most interesting person I ever,

583
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,820
it really is. You know,
the, that, um, that, uh,

584
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:15,500
the bearded guy that the dos Equis guy,
right. Most interesting man in the world

585
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,570
wife who is the Damsel in distress,
which is almost as funny.

586
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:24,180
All right. Because we just call her the
damsel because she's never in distress,

587
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,310
the most successful,

588
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:30,240
amazing woman of all time
gaming duo as a couple.

589
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,100
So a, yeah, they're just amazing
people and um, uh, you know,

590
00:32:35,101 --> 00:32:39,560
I just kind of admired ejs skill at
work. He's so good at the, he does,

591
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:42,770
he like writes, you know,
machine code and stuff.

592
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,500
Just cause he wants to optimize
things as fast as possible.

593
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,510
Does that it was like, I'm going
to write it in python. Like,

594
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,930
cause that's not impossible. You
can do whatever. Yeah. So, um,

595
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:57,650
yeah, so he's, you know, he's
just a very, very interesting guy.

596
00:32:57,651 --> 00:33:02,630
But one of the things I really liked
about him, um, at work was he, like,

597
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,760
some of my other closest friends are
not just a software engineer or just an

598
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:10,430
accountant or just a lawyer,
whatever it might be.

599
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,350
They have this kind of crazy life
outside of work where they do all these

600
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:20,330
unusual things like, you know, like
flying trapeze and ejs case. I'm or,

601
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:24,370
well eja does like 50 odd things,
but you know,

602
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,640
I have friends who have do this really,

603
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:29,270
really interesting volunteer thing
or like find Africa once a year and,

604
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,460
and doing this kind of like amazing,

605
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:35,570
like a local volunteer work that's
really needed there. And it's just,

606
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:40,340
you sort of collect this group of friends
where they're doing much more than

607
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:42,980
just their job and their,
their life,

608
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:46,460
their everyday life because that's
stressful enough as we all know. Um,

609
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,750
so I think that really sort of
grabbed me about Ega he was, he was a,

610
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:55,790
just such an interesting sort of global
citizen as well as being just a great

611
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,650
person as well and a good colleague.
So I'm, so I love that. And then they,

612
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:04,670
so they came over to a barbecue at my
place to just having this kind of random

613
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:08,960
summer barbecue. And, um,
and uh, on the way there,

614
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:12,590
I guess they were in the midst of trying
to figure out who the villains should

615
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:15,810
be and, uh, and it was Sue's idea suicide.

616
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,280
Mike should do it. Mike should
be, Mike should be the pain.

617
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,100
I'm not sure if I was the Riddler first.
And then I had,

618
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,670
I definitely wasn't the joker too scary,
but there they were like,

619
00:34:25,671 --> 00:34:27,530
Mike should be one of the bad guys.
And uh,

620
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:31,250
so that he pitched that to me on the day
of, what are you doing? November 15th?

621
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,780
Just say yes.
And so I like didn't even have my phone.

622
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:38,340
I'm looking through my Google account
in my Google calendar and a well,

623
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,780
and a, yeah, a little plug
there for you guys. Um,

624
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,790
so I'm looking through my
Google calendar and, uh, and uh,

625
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:50,270
and you know, I'm, I'm like, well, yeah,
it doesn't look like I have anything on.

626
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,110
Sure. Um, I didn't know what I was
agreeing to and of course, neither.

627
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,910
Neither did he.
You know,

628
00:34:55,911 --> 00:35:00,560
at that point it was 50 to 200 people
in a climbing gym or something.

629
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,020
And boy were we surprised

630
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:07,440
I have 30,000 people and 2 million
were alive. And it's crazy.

631
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:10,170
And what I loved about it too, he
brought in his, all this technology,

632
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:13,710
he brought him that his uh,
in gauntlet, he invented that,

633
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,410
which was insane arm projector projector,

634
00:35:16,411 --> 00:35:19,220
which if you guys haven't seen the
film where it wasn't a density,

635
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,340
it's basically as aren't projector where
he was capturing or shooting off video

636
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:27,270
messages. And everything that came
through was on that. So I'm in the film,

637
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:28,920
there's kind of this funny
thing how it's like, oh,

638
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:32,130
there were some technical difficulties
and like some funny stuff like that.

639
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:37,131
But that was such a great added touch
to the entire just film to have that in

640
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:38,030
there.
I mean,

641
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,780
who has that? Who Invents? Excellent.

642
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,870
Remember your first film
festival and you said,

643
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,800
tell him about sitting next to curt
and the audience reaction to the,

644
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,740
Oh, when they were laughing. So when
we first showed the film, you know,

645
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,310
it's so scary to first show a film because
you've seen it while you're editing

646
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:55,530
constantly and you don't know
are people gonna like it.

647
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:58,650
It's going to work for an audience and
we're sitting showing it and people are

648
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:02,370
just cackling laughing. And I turned
to Kurt, my editor, and I was like,

649
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,490
I know we made a comedy, you know?
And so that was really great.

650
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:07,440
But I think one of that,
just to get back to EEG for a second,

651
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,460
I think one of my favorite
parts of the movie is, um,

652
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,950
and the day is when Ega was making
this projector and he, you know,

653
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:15,840
he could have done anything.
He could have had it on an iPhone,

654
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,090
which was the original
idea. Um, but he's like, oh,

655
00:36:18,091 --> 00:36:22,140
then I'll be in an adult with an iPhone.
If I projected then I'm Batman.

656
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:24,540
And so the, so this was the,
what his goal was to do.

657
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,260
And a couple of nights before he was
pulling all nighters, making it work,

658
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,900
and he broke it. And he
thought, and this is like,

659
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,540
I think to me what the epitome of the
movie is and what of the event wise is

660
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,360
that, you know, he said, okay, well miles,

661
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,460
we'll never know that we were
going to do this cool thing.

662
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:41,220
We'll just do it on the IPAD
and it'll be fine. And he said,

663
00:36:41,221 --> 00:36:44,550
but my whole life I will have known. I
could have made it even that much better.

664
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,100
And to me that just gives me chills that,

665
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:49,200
that's like my favorite moment in the
whole movie because I think all of these

666
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:53,430
people, the movie isn't really about a
sick kid who triumphed and had cool wish.

667
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,750
Um,
it has that in it.

668
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,560
But I think the movie is about when
these people like Uj like these guys come

669
00:36:58,561 --> 00:37:02,010
together to make this amazing
thing happened just for one person.

670
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,610
And I think that's so,
it's just not something we see very often.

671
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,560
And I think that's why it
touched a nerve with people.

672
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:10,920
Even though until the movie people
didn't know really the behind the scenes,

673
00:37:10,921 --> 00:37:14,790
but they knew it was special because
something that big doesn't just happen.

674
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,000
And so I think that, you know, even
though that moment was only for miles,

675
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,550
which was the whole point of the
day and nobody really knew about it,

676
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:24,120
I think people sensed that
amazing. This. Um, and so I mean,

677
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:27,600
that to me is what the [inaudible]
about what my can Patricia about and

678
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:30,660
everybody who made it happen.
Yeah. Just amazing. Um,

679
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,760
and we'll take some audience
questions if anyone has questions.

680
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,930
Nope.
Sorry.

681
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,010
I've used to be getting
some out of miss these spit.

682
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,440
Were there any issues getting the
rights for the characters and using them

683
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:55,900
okay.

684
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,160
With a warning about those giants?

685
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,860
I wasn't going there.
Yeah.

686
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,200
No. So the beauty of it was,
is that when it did get big,

687
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:09,050
I began to worry about that too.
Um,

688
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,540
fortunately I had a couple
of things on my side, um,

689
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,160
a search that helped me understand
that I could name him that kid,

690
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:17,120
which was not trademarked.

691
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,303
Huh.

692
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:22,790
Um, so I thought we were avoiding
the Batman issues, but then, um,

693
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,090
as it turned out at Warner brothers and
every actor who played Batman tweeted,

694
00:38:26,091 --> 00:38:28,520
and then Warner brothers ended up buying
the film. And they loved it so much.

695
00:38:28,521 --> 00:38:33,050
So my efforts to be worried about it,
we're ill fitted I guess.

696
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,780
And for me, because I knew that Warner
brothers really didn't buy documentaries,

697
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:39,160
it was just,
it wasn't even on my radar.

698
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:42,550
I just really followed the letter
of the law in terms of, um,

699
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,760
we just documented what was there
that day. If we were making a graphic,

700
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:46,541
it wouldn't,
it,

701
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:51,541
we made sure that it didn't have the bat
man wings and we would make it our own.

702
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:56,200
And so we went to great lengths to do
that. Um, but then in the end, you know,

703
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:57,940
maybe it wouldn't have mattered
because Warner brothers bought it,

704
00:38:57,941 --> 00:39:01,210
but still it was the safer way to go. We
didn't use music that we didn't license.

705
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:06,010
You know, the, when we did the Batman
logo, it, it, it was tweaked enough.

706
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,670
And so in our animations and our graphics,
we made sure that it was different.

707
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,480
I remember the day we were sitting in
one of our followup meetings and I said,

708
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:16,600
yeah, you know, Han Zimmer composed
music for back. She's like,

709
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:21,460
what do you have his
contact info? I think so. So

710
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:25,210
yeah. So he made, we were shooting
with him, which was amazing. Yeah,

711
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:28,050
that's a great heart. He's so,
he was so gracious, you know,

712
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,830
all his people were like,
he only has 20 minutes.

713
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:33,070
And he was with us for like two
hours. He was so nice. And He, um,

714
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:36,310
so he did a lot of movies,
but he did the dark knight trilogy.

715
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,140
I'm composing and he, uh, he was playing
for us. Uh, what he played for miles.

716
00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:45,340
He made a song for miles, um, which was
similar to the, to the dark night theme.

717
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,870
And so I sat at the end of that,
you know,

718
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,110
what do you think we're going to have
trouble getting that, the rights for that?

719
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:52,750
He's like, Oh, you very well
might. Here's, let me just
make something else for you.

720
00:39:52,751 --> 00:39:55,060
And he just compose a song
right there on the fly.

721
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:56,630
Okay.

722
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,630
All right. I just did that.
Like, it was actually one of the,

723
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:02,680
like when you geek out, when you're a
filmmaker, a documentary for liquid,

724
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,220
that liquid wasn't in my top three of
kicking out moments. Yeah. Wow. And so,

725
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:10,580
and so one of the questions we got
from one of our viewers was, um,

726
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:15,050
so what exactly after this whole thing,
what did this do for?

727
00:40:15,051 --> 00:40:16,340
Just make a wish in general.

728
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,070
So, um, we have the bad kid bumps, so our
referrals from the number of children, um,

729
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:26,020
who, uh, request a wish you didn't
qualify for a wish went up 46%.

730
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:31,510
Um, donations went up 25% is
I remember working out for me,

731
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,730
but we're so far so good keeping up. Um,
they haven't been any other requests.

732
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,160
A lot of people ask in the,
so there's a couple of things I'll,

733
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:41,590
I'll share that it could
be questions that come up.

734
00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:46,030
Everybody asks how miles is in meiosis
great and miles is in remission and he

735
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:48,490
really thinks he saved San
Francisco that day and he'll,

736
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,820
he's going to second grade and he lost
his first tooth last year and he still

737
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:56,440
loves baseball and, and he's just back
on the farm. And I love that, right?

738
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,600
That he thinks fondly of the wishy had
the day he saved San Francisco Hollywood

739
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:02,524
ending.
Right.

740
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,240
That's tied up beautifully. And it's not
unsimilar to all the rest of us. Well,

741
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:13,060
Dana was working on this project.
We all went back to our lives.

742
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:15,980
We had more wishes to do. And um, so the,

743
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:20,230
the impact certainly has created
awareness, um, and a lot more people. Um,

744
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,220
I think what happened,

745
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:26,221
we had a wish about two months after
back kid and it was with the San Jose

746
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,440
Sharks and we had a child who
wanted to be a shark for the day.

747
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,980
The footage is on youtube. I
encourage you to see it. Um,

748
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,800
and they just nailed it in a way. I
mean, again, it wasn't me doing it.

749
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:39,860
All I did was make the connection and
they thought, well, what if we, so they,

750
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:42,830
before they even got to that game,

751
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,390
they told everybody who was coming to
the game that we have a special where,

752
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,580
you know, we're facilitating, we
have a VIP is, is having this wish.

753
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,570
And then at the arena they told him it
was the first time in the shirks history

754
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:57,050
that they allowed anyone other than one
of the players to sh to skate through

755
00:41:57,051 --> 00:41:58,010
the shark's mouth.

756
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:03,310
And he signed a one day contract and in
the child lost it in front of everyone

757
00:42:03,651 --> 00:42:05,270
in the arena,
fulfill that wish that night.

758
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:09,710
And the people who normally wait outside
for the players to get their autograph

759
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:13,040
weighted out for our child
wish child Sam tag lesson.

760
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,460
And there were so many people
that requested to buy his jersey,

761
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,220
the sharks now sell it in the store
and donate the proceeds to make a wish.

762
00:42:19,221 --> 00:42:20,510
So some of those things,

763
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:24,290
we've had a few things to go viral that
had over 2 million hits in a week. Um,

764
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,790
and people just became engrossed in that
and as beautiful and sweet and we've

765
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:32,780
had a number since then. Um, so I
think that creativity piece will,

766
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,060
we'll continue and I think
the engagement piece and,

767
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,880
and we're challenged to try
to figure out how to use that.

768
00:42:37,881 --> 00:42:42,350
So how do I engage people in a way that's
meaningful to a wish that is good for

769
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:46,190
the wish. Um, and then it doesn't create
a disaster for us to try to manage,

770
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:51,460
but that there are more people who want
to do good and it's nice to be able to

771
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:55,130
be a matchmaker and make those
two things happen. You can,

772
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,330
we'll go cause it on the line.

773
00:42:56,331 --> 00:43:01,010
But this is what was your favorite moment
from the day? And I guess Dana, for you,

774
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:05,060
what was your favorite moment? Just in
creating the film and finding that voice.

775
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,680
Okay. Okay. All right. Ooh,
favorite part of the day. Ooh,

776
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:14,340
that's always a tough one
because there's so many. There's,

777
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,670
I said my answer to that once,
which is a terrible answer,

778
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:22,440
was when Eja finally tackles me at the
end of the ballpark and my portion was

779
00:43:22,441 --> 00:43:25,380
done and I didn't because I was like,

780
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,700
I never wiped so much sweat off
my forehead in my life. But, um,

781
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:33,030
that's a terrible answer though.
So let me make up a new one.

782
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:37,980
Now that I've said that to
the entire universe, um, it
wouldn't be the first time,

783
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:42,690
I guess. Right. Um, you
know, I think for me it was,

784
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:48,050
I actually really was very excited at
the amount of people that were there. Um,

785
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:53,280
that is of course in opposition to
the goals, not just the original,

786
00:43:53,281 --> 00:43:58,020
but the ultimate goals of the
event were just miles is enjoyment.

787
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,270
But to me it became something bigger
and bigger and bigger. And, uh,

788
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:08,100
and it became such an interesting
opportunity to sort of, um,

789
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,960
for San Francisco really to kind of plant
this flag in the ground and be like,

790
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,860
this is what's possible. Because it
was insane. None of us expected this.

791
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,300
And you know,

792
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,690
I'm sure some people wouldn't have
gotten involved if they expected it to be

793
00:44:21,691 --> 00:44:25,980
this crazy and certainly not us,
we were done in any case. Um,

794
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,420
but,
you know,

795
00:44:27,421 --> 00:44:30,900
I think it became such a big thing and
to me that meant it was going to be

796
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,033
visible.

797
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,570
And I thought that just the sheer
size of it would encourage people,

798
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:41,280
the world around to do similar kinds of
things. Um, that was important to me,

799
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:46,000
sort of in a, in a kind of the world's
changing this of this event, um,

800
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:50,790
that it could carry it forwards in
a way. Um, Chris, uh, Chris Taylor,

801
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:53,280
a great a friend from Mashable,

802
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:58,310
he posted one of the first articles
to go viral about the event and he's

803
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:00,750
featured in the movie as well,
and he's really, really great.

804
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:04,010
But about a week after
the movie, he said, uh,

805
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:09,170
certain movie a week after a week after
the day he posted something on Mashable.

806
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:12,210
It's a bat could date back. Kid
was beautiful, let's keep it going.

807
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:17,130
And so that was a very interesting
kind of call to action I thought.

808
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:21,230
And to me was one of the larger
goals of being involved. I,

809
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:26,600
I think a week or so after that I kind
of compiled my crazy like stress addled

810
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:31,450
brain into a big long blog post,
which became my longest ever read or my,

811
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:35,880
my most ever read a post on
my, on my, um, on my blog,

812
00:45:35,881 --> 00:45:39,570
spot out my blogger
account. Thank you. Google.

813
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:45,540
No, seriously. Like, it's like,
it's like my entire life. Um, so,

814
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:48,390
you know, it became like the most
visible thing I've ever posted.

815
00:45:48,391 --> 00:45:50,760
And so that was another
way of I think playing up,

816
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:55,920
sort of paying it forwards and taking
the day that happened magically and kind

817
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:57,840
of turning it into a message.
And,

818
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:02,560
and that's another reason why
I just sort of jumped into, uh,

819
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,170
when I heard about the movie happening,
I was so excited about it. And, um,

820
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:11,430
Dan who was so passionate came with the
exact same spirit that we had of giving

821
00:46:11,431 --> 00:46:15,240
and of just really being
really keen to get the,

822
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:19,590
get the message right and, um, to
do the best possible job we could,

823
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:24,600
um, with such an important idea.
And so, so I think, anyway,

824
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:29,460
long story short, um, I think actually
the visibility turned out to be very,

825
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:30,990
very important,
I think,

826
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:35,991
and has led to this documentary and has
led to then Warner brothers buying it.

827
00:46:36,511 --> 00:46:40,980
It's crazy. Um, lots of people
seeing it and, and people,

828
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:46,080
the real practical realities of people
emailing me and saying really loved the

829
00:46:46,381 --> 00:46:50,250
movie, decided to do volunteering
and, um, my own state, my own country.

830
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:53,670
I had a friend from Germany say,
I couldn't believe you did that thing.

831
00:46:53,671 --> 00:46:55,890
That was crazy.
It looks like so much fun.

832
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,320
I've been meaning to volunteer
for a long time. I never did it.

833
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:02,160
And I signed up last week after
seeing the movie. It was like, Oh yes,

834
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,830
that's the goal. That's the goal. Yeah.

835
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,270
So for me, I'm a few, but I
think that the day of, um,

836
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:12,580
it was time we had a bus
that followed the, the, um,

837
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,110
the two Lamborghini's and,
um,

838
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:20,460
it was further wished family and a few
folks embedded for the Twitter account

839
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:22,890
and all the wish family.
And,

840
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,700
and so there were a few
moments when the bus, yeah,

841
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:29,920
we'd cheer and then there would be a hush
of silence where we were all so moved.

842
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:34,120
And you know, the first time that morning
happened when we took our website down,

843
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:37,200
um, a few minutes after the
wish started and I thought,

844
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:41,980
am I supposed to be excited? We took the
website. I guess that's a good thing. Wow.

845
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,810
And then, um, when the president tweeted
and then the White House and first lady,

846
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:49,180
and um, there were moments
where it was the cheering,

847
00:47:49,181 --> 00:47:51,970
but then you realize you
started to use the magnitude.

848
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:56,530
And in fact on the bus I sorted, you
know, Jimmy Kimmel or something, I dunno,

849
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,970
we started getting offers already and
I began thinking about that going,

850
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:06,160
this isn't, you know, when this
over. And um, but the moment,

851
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:08,660
the most poignant moment
was after the last caper,

852
00:48:08,661 --> 00:48:12,310
it was at the ballpark and seeing miles
so happened he ran the bases and it was

853
00:48:12,311 --> 00:48:15,700
like, yes, he was Batman for the day.

854
00:48:15,701 --> 00:48:19,540
We did that and everybody else happy.
And San Francisco amazing.

855
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:23,770
And so all of that was sinking
in as that had finished,

856
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:28,360
everybody was safe.
And I'm watching this,

857
00:48:28,361 --> 00:48:31,900
we're on the bus and we didn't tell anyone
what route we were taking between the

858
00:48:31,901 --> 00:48:35,620
ballpark in civic center. Right. We
didn't dictate that wasn't public.

859
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:39,670
I didn't tell them which route to take,
but it became an impromptu parade route.

860
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,830
And so sitting on a bus and just watching
construction workers come off of their

861
00:48:44,831 --> 00:48:48,370
site just to wave at us.
I couldn't believe it.

862
00:48:48,371 --> 00:48:53,371
And I began to lose it and just close
to openly sobbing and then remembered I

863
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,780
had to give a speech to 25.

864
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,020
It's a big center and not freak
out about that. Um, but the,

865
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:05,440
the energy from the crowd
was so loving and so joyful.

866
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:07,160
And Comcast sports net,

867
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,680
I have to give one shout
out to them because when I
asked them to do me a favor,

868
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:15,820
they follow their crew, followed
us around, taped each Kapor,

869
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:20,920
came back and edit it on the fly and
then played it that day in civic center.

870
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,360
Cause I said have something,
all of this was true.

871
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,090
They donated a $30,000
satellite truck that day,

872
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:32,840
so all the other stations could pull
that video without a watermark and donate

873
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:34,990
it. I mean they were
amazing and pulled that off.

874
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:38,050
And so I had no idea what we are going to
see when we got up to the civic center.

875
00:49:38,051 --> 00:49:40,600
Right. And so, but I had my outtakes
and we had coordinated and I'd say,

876
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:44,080
let's take a look. And they played
the footage. It was unbelievable.

877
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,520
So that's incredible.

878
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:50,320
A lot of goodness happened that day
in day was just a beautiful film.

879
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,760
So just kind of what, what was your
favorite moment that you discovered?

880
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:55,550
Um, and my favorite moment of
the film was, like I said before,

881
00:49:55,551 --> 00:49:59,810
when I'm broke his projector and that
was my favorite moment of the film.

882
00:49:59,811 --> 00:50:00,930
But I think,
um,

883
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,910
my favorite part in the whole making of
it was my goal was to let the spirit of

884
00:50:04,911 --> 00:50:08,870
the day live on cars for everybody like
me who missed, who missed the actual day.

885
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:12,080
And so I'm, I'm really, when
I hear stories like that,

886
00:50:12,081 --> 00:50:15,710
what Mike said about his friend,
or when I have people email me about that,

887
00:50:15,711 --> 00:50:19,220
it made them go out and want to volunteer
and be a part of a community and,

888
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:23,230
and get out of their shell for a while.
That makes me really happy and proud. Um,

889
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,860
and,
but I think for me,

890
00:50:24,861 --> 00:50:28,610
I'm meeting these and
everybody involved in the day,

891
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:32,630
and then the crew that I was so fortunate
to assemble for backup for the movie,

892
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,950
um, those, the cast and the crew
of this film are really dear.

893
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,460
And you feel like now you could take
that group along with you to the,

894
00:50:40,461 --> 00:50:45,440
to the rest of your life,
both professionally and
just as friends. And, um,

895
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,390
to me that's a real gift.
Um,

896
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:50,480
that and that actually somebody I
used to work with as it is here in the

897
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:52,070
audience. And I mean, that's a
good thing. We worked on our,

898
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:54,950
on my first film together.
And so I think it's that,

899
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:59,540
it's like you have the fortunate thing
as a documentary filmmaker to be able to

900
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,270
go out there and meet
amazing people whose nobody,

901
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,630
not just a humdrum person would be worthy
to be in a documentary. Right? Right.

902
00:51:05,631 --> 00:51:06,470
And so you have these,

903
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:09,200
these people that you come in contact
with and then you get to carry them with

904
00:51:09,201 --> 00:51:12,150
you, hopefully forever.
And so I think that's, um,

905
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,680
and this group was an amazing addition
to all, to all of those people.

906
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:19,200
Well, to give you your sentence, literally
everyone in the project is that lovely,

907
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:23,640
doesn't seek the limelight, was just doing
a great thing and Dana's no different.

908
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:24,421
She volunteered.

909
00:51:24,421 --> 00:51:27,150
None of the people who worked on the film
thought it was going to be a big film.

910
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:32,540
They all did it for next to nothing or
bare minimum just do it to cover expenses

911
00:51:32,941 --> 00:51:37,560
and, and Dana included and
you know, ironically she
likes to joke that, you know,

912
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:40,990
the first documentary that really reached
some level of commercial success and

913
00:51:40,991 --> 00:51:43,680
it was purchased by Warner Brothers is,
is a donation.

914
00:51:43,681 --> 00:51:45,720
So she's contributed at
all to the back kid fun,

915
00:51:45,721 --> 00:51:49,670
which benefits San Francisco charities,
including make-a-wish. So, um,

916
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,510
that's the level of,
you know,

917
00:51:51,511 --> 00:51:54,210
altruistic and generosity
of everyone on the project.

918
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,540
Well, I think that was an incredible thing
that no one was really in this for the

919
00:51:57,541 --> 00:52:00,300
money. No, it was all about
miles and it was all about just,

920
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:03,750
just capturing that day for him and stuff.
And even two years later,

921
00:52:03,751 --> 00:52:06,990
I mean this is, this is
really, it's incredible that
people are still caring and,

922
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:09,860
and wanting this, just that kind
of impact that it had on, you know,

923
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,270
social media and just in,
in culture.

924
00:52:12,271 --> 00:52:15,930
It's a cultural phenomenon and
people are studying this as like,

925
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:19,380
how did this happen? Why did this
and how did this work? And it just,

926
00:52:19,381 --> 00:52:22,710
it's one of those just perfect storm.
So, um, so just really quickly,

927
00:52:22,711 --> 00:52:25,560
can you talk about a little bit how people
can get involved with, make a wish or,

928
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,000
um, just kind of want,
make a wish is doing okay.

929
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:31,150
Locally, SF wish.org. Um, I
have a board of directors.

930
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:34,630
I have two young professional boards.
I have one here in Silicon Valley.

931
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:37,300
I have a youth board,
um, for kids, 12 to 18,

932
00:52:37,301 --> 00:52:41,010
about half of them are former wish
kids who get back. Um, so, uh,

933
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:45,970
there's obviously we have events. We
just did a, a walk here on cocoa campus.

934
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,970
Um, so there's lots of ways to
get involved in fundraising.

935
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,020
We're one of the few charities that
takes airline mile donations. Um,

936
00:52:52,021 --> 00:52:54,340
and we use those for the wishes itself.

937
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:58,310
So that's pretty cool and a great way
if you want to donate airline miles. Um,

938
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:01,600
and for everyone else, go to
[inaudible] dot org and, um,

939
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:04,390
and that will lead you to our
international affiliates as well,

940
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:09,391
and hopefully engage you in and hopefully
change your life forever and transform

941
00:53:09,431 --> 00:53:11,260
it in a way that you can't imagine.

942
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,610
Well, that's great. So thank you
guys so much for being here. Um,

943
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:19,380
back kid begins a is available
digitally, uh, September 25th and on DVD,

944
00:53:19,381 --> 00:53:21,890
October six. So thank you guys.
Thank you. Thank you. Yep.

945
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:34,480
Okay.
