1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,050
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:05,051 --> 00:00:09,100
My name is Qa to justice and
I'm an engineering program
manager for Google play.

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,750
And we're honored and excited to
welcome director of the movie bell,

4
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:16,610
Amma Asante. Um, everybody
give her a round of,

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,690
hi, welcome to Google. Um,

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,240
Anna,

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,290
thank you so much for your amazing work
and bringing this little known life to

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:31,030
the world. Thank you. Really
appreciate it. So, um, let's play,

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,260
let's play the trailer of the film.
Um,

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,300
a group of Google or Scott to see
it last night during a screening.

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,260
I really enjoy this film.
I'm glad you're here.

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,720
And for those that don't know,
I'm dido.

13
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:48,721
Elizabeth Bell was discovered from an
18th century painting that was done of her

14
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:52,000
and her cousin. So, um, um, uh,

15
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:56,110
how did you learn about this painting
and how did it shape your interest in

16
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,880
doing this project? Yeah, so it was
really interesting process for me. Um,

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,100
2009 I had come off of the back
of my first movie, a way of life,

18
00:01:06,101 --> 00:01:10,750
which I was lucky enough to win a British
Academy award where, and I had been,

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,360
um, working, developing,
writing other projects. Um,

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,320
one of them was a Jane Austen
adaptation. Other, uh, yeah, um, um,

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,460
adaptive piece called Lady Susan.
And, uh, so I was working with, uh,

22
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,410
with a do, uh, producer,
um, uh, who had, uh, um,

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,770
a small company,
which was part of new line cinema.

24
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,480
And I'm doing all my research because
I find that my research is really my

25
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:42,481
education as how I've become educated in
any kind of way in life and was really

26
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:47,950
increasingly becoming obsessed with the
woman's position in 18th century England

27
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:50,380
in particular.
And um,

28
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,980
so 2009 comes along and I am working
on three different projects and the,

29
00:01:56,941 --> 00:02:01,130
the, the, the, the next one is also a
project which is kind of looking at, um,

30
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,140
a mixed race girl living in
Berlin during the 1940s war,

31
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:10,390
Second World War. So really, again,

32
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:15,391
looking at the experience of a person
of color in Europe and the Bfi who,

33
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,230
um, are the British film institute. Um,

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,280
very much involved in my work and my
career and financing work that I've done

35
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:27,400
previously. Um, had received an idea,

36
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:31,990
a project from a producer, my
producer, it turns out Damion Jones,

37
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,830
who had been trying to get a project
about Dido's life off of the ground,

38
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,200
um,
for quite some time now for him.

39
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:44,890
It had started life with a writer at Hbo,
um,

40
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,810
here in America. And, uh,
they'd gone through development.
It hadn't quite worked.

41
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:52,300
The project had been dropped.
Damien had bought it to England.

42
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,380
They had continued with, with the
writer and for whatever reason, um,

43
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,230
you know, that said they moved
on. And so they came to me at,

44
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:06,850
you know, the Bfi said to Damian,
have you sent this postcard to Ama?

45
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:11,140
Because she is obsessed with the woman's
experience in 18th century England.

46
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,320
She's obsessed with people of color
in European history and she is an

47
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,090
irrepressible romantic and she's just
dying to tell a love story. So, you know,

48
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,770
have you sent this to her too, to see
what she would make of it? And so,

49
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,310
Damian eventually sent me this postcard.
Now,

50
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:30,960
I'd never seen the portrait
before. Um, but what,

51
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,520
what I was lucky enough
to have experienced, um,

52
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,100
was going to an exhibition in Holland,
which is where I live now,

53
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,880
which chartered the history of black
people in European art from the 14th

54
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:47,380
century onwards. And it was
the most fascinating, um,

55
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,610
exhibition I've ever been
to. And it really looked to
us from kind of background,

56
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:56,180
character rent until we came to front
and center and eventually became music

57
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,600
kind of closer to modern day.

58
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,280
But what it showed me was that in the
18th century, we were accessories.

59
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:05,380
When I say, well, you people
of color were accessories.

60
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,540
So we were there to express the status
of the main Caucasian protagonists in the

61
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,060
painting.
So we were always painted lower down.

62
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,410
We were never looking out or very
rarely looking out at the painter.

63
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,130
We were always looking are,

64
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,450
but the main protagonists without
arm reaching out towards them,

65
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:24,430
which would draw your eye towards them.

66
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,060
And so when this painting of which
is known as bell impact came to me,

67
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,080
it, um, it came in the context where
I could see it was so different.

68
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,600
There is Dido.
So beautiful.

69
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:40,900
And I'm happy with this
sparkle in her eye,

70
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,120
looking directly out at the painter.

71
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,050
She's actually painted slightly
higher in the painting and wow,

72
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:51,970
it's Elizabeth psalm that is reaching
out to her, drawing your eye to her.

73
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,410
And uh,

74
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:57,640
it was a revelation to me and what I
saw at that point was the opportunity,

75
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:01,240
if I got it right, to tell a
story that would combine politics,

76
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,510
art and history and race and
with the sub themes of love,

77
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:10,990
gender, the women's place,
identity, belonging, you know,

78
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:14,530
all of those, I knew it was
going to have to be a big story.

79
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,120
So that's where it really started for me.
Then it was a process of re research.

80
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,900
Um, and going back to, um, you know,

81
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:26,710
finding out exactly what kind
of story I would want to tell,

82
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,420
how much of that would have to be drawn,

83
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:32,860
affection and how much of it would
have to be w need, must be history.

84
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,510
What was it like premiering it at the
Toronto Film Festival after all of that?

85
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,060
It was incredible.
Um,

86
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,500
my first film had been screened
at Toronto Film Festival,

87
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:47,590
but we were very small
independent British movie.

88
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,620
And whilst bell had been
made as an independent movie,

89
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,870
it British independent movie.
Um, we were, we were, um,

90
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,930
brought by Fox searchlight right
before Toronto, which was great.

91
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:03,380
And we weren't brought just for,
um, the u s or just for the UK.

92
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:04,510
We were bought for the world.

93
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,760
We had their might behind us by
the time we came to, to Toronto.

94
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,500
And it was quite a different experience
having a big studio or a studio like Fox

95
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:20,501
searchlight behind you who was so in love
with the story and so much wanting to

96
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,570
be part of this story and
bringing this story to the world.

97
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:27,830
So it was an incredible experience of
something like three minute standing

98
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:30,230
ovation kind. Yeah. More or less.

99
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,560
And I'm just the first time that we
really felt love for the film from people

100
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:41,210
who had not been involved
with it. Yeah. That's awesome.

101
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,530
So there's an interesting dichotomy.
I'm represented with her name.

102
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,290
So there's Dido, which was what
her British family called her. Yes.

103
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,280
And then there's belt, which
was her mother's name. Yes.

104
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:56,930
So why did you choose to title the film
bell? Well, in the movie, you know,

105
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,340
um, we, we don't ever see her
mother. We only hear about,

106
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,340
um,
and we're seeing this girl in this world,

107
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,970
which is completely white
apart from Mable. Um,

108
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,620
the maid and I wanted to honor
her mother died, his mother,

109
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:15,260
I wanted to,
to honor her,

110
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:18,470
even though she could not be
physically present in the movie.

111
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,710
I wanted it to be spiritually
present within our memories.

112
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,720
And so as she was Maria
Bell, um, and as, uh,

113
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,980
she named her daughter after herself.

114
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,320
I wanted them to name the film after
both of them and, and pay tribute to,

115
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,220
to have mother. Ah, very nice. Very
nice. Yeah. And so how did, um,

116
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,050
how did you connect with Google in Bartow
raw as the lead actress for the film?

117
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,220
Actually it was, uh, it was,
it was a very easy process.

118
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,830
The movie that I had talked to you about
earlier that were set in Germany, um,

119
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,190
which I will shoot in
2015 where hands touch.

120
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,450
Um, Google had actually
originally come to audition for a,

121
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:01,970
so she'd come in for casting and uh,

122
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,480
this young woman stepped into
the room and her presence,

123
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:09,730
I was just completely blown away
at that time. So I knew if Gugu um,

124
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,400
quite some time passed and she came over
to America and she was involved in TV

125
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:15,500
series here and a couple of movies.

126
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:20,420
She was on Broadway with Jude law
playing or failure to Jude Law's hamlet.

127
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,920
And,
um,

128
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,300
so time passed and both my
producer Damien and I knew of her.

129
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,330
Um, and eventually it was
time to start coasting. We,

130
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,290
we met probably every biracial
actress of the right age in the UK.

131
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,800
And um, yoga was one of those. Um, but,

132
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,490
but Google is smart.
She's very, very smart.

133
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,330
She understood what I wanted
to do with this story.

134
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:47,030
The kind of journey that I
wanted to put this character on,

135
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:50,990
which on the surface is very simple.
But actually underneath this very complex,

136
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,140
she understood that I wanted to take
this character from girl to woman with a

137
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:56,700
political awakening in there,

138
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,890
that it needed to be a sweeping
love story as well as, um,

139
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,780
a story that made us feel the
emotion of the impact of slavery.

140
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,900
Even though we never actually see a slave.
Now, it was very much my wish that, um,

141
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,450
we didn't see slaves,
but we actually had to feel,

142
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,280
we were looking at the laws that supported
slavery and we had to fill the impact

143
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,720
of slavery from that point of view.

144
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:26,040
And that's because that was
a really important reason,

145
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:31,041
which was I wanted to prove that you could
put a woman of Color Front and center

146
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:36,201
of an Osti NASC piece of work at a
traditional British period drama.

147
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,250
And that it would work.

148
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,930
Now obviously in the script that Damien
had been working on previously, um,

149
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,090
you know, which was a very
different world. You know,

150
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,040
daddy was running around with shells
on her ankles and they jumped to Vinay,

151
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:54,750
has an affair with, with,
uh, with Elizabeth. And, um,

152
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,250
it's, it's, it's, it was good bell and
bad and it was a very different movie.

153
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,740
But for, and in that you
did, you did see slaves,

154
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:06,300
you did see slaves sort of interludes
with slaves kind of floating on the water.

155
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:11,301
And it was kind of a reminder that
this is what happened to those over 100

156
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:12,990
slaves during the Zong case.
But for me,

157
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:17,991
I wanted to work from a much
more psychological point
of view and really look

158
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,590
at,
well,

159
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,880
for me it was important that if I was
going to tell a movie that was Austin ass,

160
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,590
and that looked at tell society that I
also looked at the world that was there

161
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,443
and

162
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,960
funding that society and the
economy of that society, um, and,

163
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:38,850
and the trade that was sponsoring that
society and that was the slave trade. So,

164
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,680
um, yeah. So it was very important
for me to keep it Austin asked,

165
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:47,681
but also make sure that the impact of
slavery and was it important that the

166
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:50,820
actress be of mixed race that
played the roles. It was very,

167
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:53,760
very important that she'd be of mixed
race being that have we knew that her

168
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:57,090
father was white and her father and
her mother was black. It was very,

169
00:10:57,091 --> 00:11:01,120
very important that she
didn't look completely. Uh,

170
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,090
I see completely black.
We come in all different shades,

171
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,710
but it didn't look like both
her mother and father were, um,

172
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,430
100% black or 100% white.

173
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,240
It was important that we could see
that she was at the junction of race.

174
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,930
She is at the junction of status.

175
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:27,180
She is at the junction of all these
different themes in the story because the

176
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:31,800
story is really about a woman who comes
to a place where she has to combine all

177
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:35,250
of these parts of herself, the child of
a slave and the child of an Aristocrat,

178
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,090
the child of a black person and shelter
of a white person, a woman of color.

179
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,350
Growing up in an aristocratic society
and she has to find a way to love all

180
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:47,310
those parts of ourselves,
bring them together and be okay with it.

181
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:52,590
So it was very, very important that
she looked the mixture that she,

182
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,410
she absolutely is. Absolutely. Yeah. Okay.

183
00:11:56,411 --> 00:12:01,411
So there's a scene that I thought was
really powerful between Mabel the servant

184
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:04,840
in London and bill,
um,

185
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:08,420
when she's combing her hair and she's
struggling to comb her hair and bell

186
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:11,950
offers to show her how to comb her
hair from starting from the end.

187
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,760
May Bill offers to show bell, I'm sorry.
Yeah, maybe oppositional building.

188
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,260
And so I believe that there
was a significance there
that you wanted to convey

189
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:25,180
to the audience. Was there? Yeah, there
was, you know, I was thinking about,

190
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,320
um, growing up in a household
of people that love you,

191
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,910
but our learning trying to understand the
right way to love you the way you need

192
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:38,440
to be loved, but people who don't look
anything like you, what must that be like?

193
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,160
And it brought me to a place where I was
thinking about maternal legacy and the,

194
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,250
the things we take for granted,

195
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,210
the simple things that we take for
granted that our mother passes on to us.

196
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:54,400
And so I had been thinking
about cooking and you know,

197
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,750
oftentimes it's our mother that teaches
us how to cook the food that comes from

198
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,230
our community and from our
culture. And I thought, well,

199
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,130
Dido wouldn't cook for herself,
so that's really not going to work.

200
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,860
And then I thought, hey, you know,

201
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:12,040
what is something we do every single day
we have to deal with every single day.

202
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,360
That's like our thing,

203
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,220
a woman thing and very much a woman
of color thing. And it was hair.

204
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,480
And I suddenly thought, you know,
no products, uh, you know, no, no,

205
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,050
no shampoos, no tools, nothing.

206
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,050
Everything geared towards
except for the comb.

207
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,580
Exactly everything geared
towards a Caucasian woman.

208
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,290
And,
and,

209
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,470
and with nobody there to teach you
how to take care of their own health.

210
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,950
No one there that knows, no matter how
much they say, no one there that knows.

211
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,350
And I was thinking about this,
and again,

212
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:51,490
this was part of me honoring her
mother right the way through the story.

213
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:52,900
So you never see this black woman,

214
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:56,350
but she's there very much in the
story and we never forget her.

215
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,180
She talks about her right the way through.

216
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:03,630
And I thought the other thing was that
I desperately wanted to have another

217
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:08,020
person of color in the movie, which is
why I created me to be in the movie.

218
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,670
And I wanted to show,
you know,

219
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,680
in the way that I wanted to show that
Elizabeth and Dido Bell have a sisterhood

220
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,660
that comes under a lot of pressure,

221
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,380
but they remain ultimately
essentially connected.

222
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:28,390
I also wanted to show some connection
between bell and a person of color in the

223
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:33,010
movie. And, and so this moment comes
in, which, which I find, you know,

224
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,920
for myself, you know, when
I was putting it together,

225
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:39,070
I found it very hard and sad,

226
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,960
but also uplifting at the same
time. It was such affection. Yes.

227
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,090
With such affection and I,
and I wanted it to be that way.

228
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:47,770
Now this is part of three mirror scenes.

229
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:49,540
In actual fact with First
Mirror scene is one,

230
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,370
one in which data was actually
harming herself. You know,

231
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:56,080
she's very uncomfortable with itself.
The final one is one word.

232
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:59,600
Data is good with herself. She's
happy. You see a small smile.

233
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,390
She's coming to that place
where she's okay with herself.

234
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,880
And the middle scene is a transition.

235
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:09,050
It's reflecting the transition that data
is going through and this is off the

236
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:12,500
mirror when they reflect
off the mirror and, and uh,

237
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:17,060
Mabel is combing her hair
and you see day day relax.

238
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,380
And she's okay with this being
around this woman of color. She's,

239
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,970
she's relaxed in the kind of
sisterhood that this made offers her.

240
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:30,230
And of course this made says, my
mom taught me. You see? And, and,

241
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,390
and so this middle scene is representing
a transition that that data was going

242
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:40,391
through with being okay with a part of
herself that society has made her feel

243
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:44,000
like it's a burden.
That's awesome.

244
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,660
And in fact it was interesting
in the painting, they don't,

245
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,020
Elizabeth Bell is wearing a turban,

246
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,010
so it gives you sort of maybe a hint that
she didn't have anybody that knew how

247
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:55,070
to comb her hair. And that's how
they managed that in reality,

248
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,270
how they manage that. Yeah. Yeah,
absolutely. Great. So what was it like?

249
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,390
I'm recreating 18th century England
and where did most of the filming take

250
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:09,010
place? Yeah, it was a joy
because I knew that I'm a,

251
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:13,040
I was doing something really traditional
that all of you guys as an audience

252
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,680
would have a shorthand to,
we would all know this world.

253
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,920
You've all seen pride and prejudice and
sense and sensibility and faculty is

254
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:20,990
wonderful world.
But B,

255
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,660
I knew I was going to be doing something
really different with it by putting

256
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:28,160
this character in the center of it. So I
loved it. You know, I constantly thought,

257
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,023
you know,
I hadn't had,

258
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,610
I always have a color chart for
every movie that I work on, which,

259
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:36,140
because I think it creates a harmonious,
a static on the screen. But every,

260
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,820
everything I was working with was knowing
that I was going to have this woman

261
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:44,900
have a beautiful skin tone on the screen.
So for me,

262
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:49,820
I wanted to present to you a new
idea of an English rose. You know,

263
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:54,770
my idea of an English rose, so
you'll see in the picture here, um,

264
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,010
Belize always sort of,
um,

265
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,120
featured often around Rose's.
She's in Rosie colors, you know,

266
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:06,740
her color scheme is that of,
of, of, of beautiful flowers.

267
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,480
And you know, we, we bill out
the color scheme of the, um,

268
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,290
her entire world really from there.
So each,

269
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,260
each family really has its own color.

270
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,970
So for the Ashford family, they
have this kind of icy, cold,

271
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:26,570
blue go figure. And, uh,

272
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,110
for bail I wanted her to earn
and the Mansfield family,

273
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:35,111
I really wanted that sense of it being
regal and Regal and important and

274
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:40,220
wealthy. So they have goals, you
know, you'll see that, uh, you know,

275
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:44,840
in the world behind Dido here, it's,
it's gold. Their carriage is gold. Lord.

276
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:49,000
Mansfield's world is pretty
gold as well, quite often. Um,

277
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,830
so it was great. We filmed
mainly in, um, uh, we,

278
00:17:53,831 --> 00:17:57,960
we filmed the English heritage houses in
London, so we weren't able to film it,

279
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:59,850
the Real Ken Wood House
because it was under,

280
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,950
it was being refurbished at the time.

281
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,720
So we filmed in two or three houses
that we then had to put together.

282
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,150
I had to have a little
ground where I said,

283
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:12,260
this is where the staircase is B and this
is where the dining room remove their,

284
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,961
my wonderful,

285
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:17,910
wonderful production designer
was working with me to,

286
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,140
to, to do that and created
again the beautiful aesthetic
that you see on screen.

287
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,710
Um, we also, so we shut a lot in London.

288
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:28,950
We shot in central London
where we had to shut, you know,

289
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,000
whole streets and really only very
little of what you see as CGI.

290
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:36,390
It's real stuff. Yeah.
That you see that um,

291
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,370
we shot in the isle of Man to do
a lot of our exteriors, which, um,

292
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,330
is very green and lush and beautiful.
And we also show an Oxford,

293
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,840
which is actually where, um,
Gugu [inaudible] actress is from.

294
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,740
So it was exciting for her,

295
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,900
was like going home and her art teacher
actually walked by accidentally while we

296
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:59,670
were filming. It was like, it's that woman
in that outfit you go and barter raw.

297
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,170
Cause I used to teach her,

298
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:05,160
so I had to kind of take him through all
the barriers and getting through to her.

299
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:08,040
So yeah. Oh that's awesome
to her. Yeah. Okay.

300
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,070
So now I want to switch up a little bit
and talk about some of the historical

301
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:12,310
aspects of the film.
Yes.

302
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:17,140
So most of us in the s are very aware of
America's role in the slave trade. Yes.

303
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,930
But maybe not as familiar
with England and England. Um,

304
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,860
emancipated or I should say
abolish slavery. Yes. Um,

305
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,550
decades before the u s yes. Um, what,

306
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:33,750
can you tell us more about that
history of the slave trade and um,

307
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,000
and specifically the song massacre,

308
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:40,680
that's sort of the critical judgment
that happens and is the beginning of the

309
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:45,660
end of a British, yeah, I guess slave
trade in Persian empire. So, you know,

310
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:47,270
some of you may know this, but, um,

311
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,390
I know we even a lot of
English people don't know this.

312
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,510
British people don't know this,

313
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:56,511
which is that Britain was the middle
man when it came to the slave trade.

314
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,120
And whenever I'm speaking,
you know, I have to say we,

315
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:02,190
and then I have to define which we could,

316
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:04,320
we would be schizophrenia because
I'm black and I'm British.

317
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:07,620
So this moment I'm British
British. Okay. Got It.

318
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,970
So what we would do is we were,
we, we were the suppliers.

319
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,103
We,

320
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:17,820
we were very big in shipping at this
point and we had what you would call the

321
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:22,260
shipping triangle whereby
we would sell from,

322
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:22,950
uh,

323
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,950
England to Africa and then
to the Caribbean or the
Americas and then back again.

324
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,840
And no leg of that
journey should be empty.

325
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,790
We should always have goods, which
we could trade. And then, uh,

326
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,660
you know, drop the goods off, pick up
new goods and, and go somewhere else.

327
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:45,970
So here's how it worked. We
would take whatever, um, uh,

328
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:50,650
goods good Britain had to offer.
We would load them on the ship,

329
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,500
South Africa exchange.

330
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:58,210
Those goods with money as well for slaves,
load up the slaves,

331
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,920
then off to the Caribbean or the Americas,
unload the slaves,

332
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,750
pick up cotton, um, spices,
whatever we could get,

333
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:12,880
and then bring it back to front and sell
it in Britain. So that's what we did.

334
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:17,170
Now slavery was all a bit too
vulgar to have on British shores.

335
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:21,370
It was all a bit, it wasn't, you know,
it didn't work for the Genteel society.

336
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:22,204
So it was,

337
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:27,330
it was all you guys that had it over
this side of the Atlantic and how the so,

338
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,500
so when I say I wanted to look at the
economy that was holding up this genteel

339
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:38,050
society that you see on
pride in pride and prejudice,

340
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:40,990
and then this other period
dramas that come before,

341
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,680
because data was a little bit early
actually. Then Austen's time, this is the,

342
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,780
this is the trade,
this is the shipping trade.

343
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:49,930
And what I should also tell you is that
the world that you come into you with,

344
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:54,630
bowel is on the cusp of change.
So whereas the,

345
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,060
the marriage is that where the marriage
of the kind of marriages of the time

346
00:21:58,061 --> 00:22:02,960
were based on status, you're married so
that your family status could grow. Um,

347
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,970
what was happening now was the
love marriage was coming in slowly.

348
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:11,380
It was starting to Piss, um, society.
It was becoming not acceptable,

349
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:15,820
but it was on its way to becoming
acceptable and new money was coming in.

350
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,630
And this new money would
be a farmer for instance,

351
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:24,640
who might gain enough money to buy
Shek o and then he would start on this

352
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:27,310
triangle that we talk about.
So he would also become,

353
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:28,780
be involved in the slave trade.

354
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,720
And then suddenly he's making
a lot of money from this.

355
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,410
Suddenly his children are
the child of a wealthy man.

356
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,290
Suddenly they might be,
um,

357
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,990
of interest to someone exactly
who might want to marry them.

358
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:45,520
So there was a fear of this.

359
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,340
And Lord Mansfield is very representative
of that cusp of change that we're on.

360
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,360
He's got one foot in the now and the
kind of the status quo and rules must be

361
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:56,230
stuck too.

362
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,220
Let's not break up the chaos that let's
not encourage chaos or break up the

363
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:00,760
rules.

364
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,930
But then he is conflicted because he has
this other other foot very firmly. And,

365
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,770
um,
being a progressive man in tomorrow,

366
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,850
being a man ahead of his time in those
two areas are conflicting inside him.

367
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,330
That could be 10 movies made about this.
There's an incredible man who,

368
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,550
who chose to raise their,
the way that he did.

369
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,070
So you've got all of that coming in.
Now,

370
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,410
the Zong case comes into
the story because, um,

371
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,410
many people were trying to get into
the shipping trade at this time.

372
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,170
And the man who comes to be the captain,

373
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,320
the captain of the ship that sails on
this terrible journey is actually a doctor

374
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,180
and he has, this is his first
time actually captaining a ship.

375
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,750
Okay. And He, so he gets
on this ship and um,

376
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,620
it doesn't quite know what he's
doing and it's a protracted journey.

377
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:54,730
The journey is longer than it should be.
So they packed the slaves in,

378
00:23:54,731 --> 00:23:58,760
in the disgusting way. We know that they
would, you know, one on top of each other.

379
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,990
They said that you could
smell a slave ship,

380
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,800
a mile down wind of that because it
was so disgusting and full of disease.

381
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,640
And so you can imagine when this
journey becomes even longer because he's

382
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:12,650
missing all the points where he should,

383
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,070
he should be stopping
and getting off these,

384
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:18,920
these slaves are getting more
sick and more sick and more sick.

385
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,810
And what happens is he
decides at a certain point
that he is going to order his

386
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:27,900
crew to jettison the slaves from the ship.
Um,

387
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,690
because he realizes he will get more
money from the insurance than he will on

388
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:37,540
the open market for them.
Now you could do that. You,

389
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:41,720
you could jettison your
cargo, you could jettison, uh,

390
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,410
you know, whatever it was
you were carrying. If,

391
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,930
if you could prove that it was
endangering your ship, right.

392
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,730
So if you could prove that those slaves
was so sick that they were making the

393
00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:55,430
crew sec, if you could prove
there wasn't enough water,

394
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:59,150
if you could prove there wasn't enough
food, if you could prove that there was,

395
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,260
I don't know,

396
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,890
the ship was tipping and had too much
weight on it and you had to jettison so

397
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:08,090
that you had enough time to get to land,
whatever, what is clear, what we know.

398
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,620
And what I found out during my re my
side of the research was that they did in

399
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:15,710
fact pass these eight ports where
they could have stopped and got water.

400
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:20,270
So this ridiculous argument
that they didn't have enough
water was in fact a lie.

401
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,840
And so, um, there in was his own case.

402
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:27,590
Now Lord Mansfield was caught between
his peers who were the people who

403
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,920
financially benefited
from the slave trade.

404
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,460
And of course his own moral values.

405
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,210
And even more so his love for his child,

406
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,440
if he pronounced in a way that would,
um,

407
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,740
confirm value to his child.
He was actually,

408
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:51,550
he was actually sticking a knife into
the lifeblood of the economy of England.

409
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:57,890
And his and his peers.
But if he found for his peers,

410
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:02,840
what would he be saying about Dido and
who she is and what she means to him.

411
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,310
What we know about Lord Mansfield
previously is that he had ruled on a case

412
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:11,960
called the Somerset case in which an
American comes to England where the slave

413
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,730
and the slave at once on English
soil says, I know in England now,

414
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:20,960
I'm not a slave. You can't make
me a slave and hear the question.

415
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:25,640
Just as the question in, in the zone
kind of centered on marine insurance law.

416
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:31,150
The question here really centered
on when you're on English soil,

417
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:35,120
can American, uh, law prevail?

418
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,660
And Lord Mansfield says, no, it can't.

419
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,290
It can't prevail and therefore the
slave is free and he frees the slaves.

420
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,260
So he had all already kind of ruled
previously in a way that would,

421
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,250
which would direct us towards
the fact that he was, uh,

422
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,280
ahead of his time.
He was a man of great moral,

423
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,370
good moral judgment and value.
But of course,

424
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:04,200
we still could not know what he might
rule on, on the Zong case. Okay. Very,

425
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:09,080
very interesting. So, um, all right,
so now we want to take a look at, um,

426
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,210
an argument scene. Yeah.
Between the cousins.

427
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,880
When I saw that scene,
I kept thinking she was going to say,

428
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,370
you're black like they did in
the beginning of the movie,

429
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,050
but she not doesn't, she says
illegitimate, illegitimate.

430
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,980
And I'm wondering was that in the original
script or did you try out different

431
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:31,690
responses doing filming to find
what was authentic? Yeah, no, no.

432
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:36,870
I mean I always knew I was never going
to take you there because what I wanted

433
00:27:37,211 --> 00:27:39,310
to do was create a sister ship,
as I say,

434
00:27:39,311 --> 00:27:44,311
assistant head and however that's that
that sister ship was going to have to

435
00:27:44,771 --> 00:27:49,390
address the issues of race and
position and status. At some point.

436
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:52,780
It was always going to have to do that.
But I knew if I took you there,

437
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,110
you would never come back from it.
With Elizabeth, you would, you would,

438
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,600
you would never,
she should never be in your hearts again.

439
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,950
And also it would destroy everything
that I had done previously in showing you

440
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,200
that, that, that lip, look how to women
of different races can love each other.

441
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:11,650
So I was never going to take you there.
But what I also wanted to do,

442
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,960
which is something I had always,
there are many,

443
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,100
there are many parallels that I had
wanted to strike with this film.

444
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,050
One is the parallel of, um,
uh, of, uh, when gender,

445
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,360
the woman's place and,
um,

446
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,690
the woman being owned by her husband
versus the slave being owned.

447
00:28:28,691 --> 00:28:31,090
So the idea of ownership,
um,

448
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,790
and the other parallel
that I really wanted to,

449
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:39,210
to Tinder cap was this
idea that illegitimacy

450
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:40,660
yeah.

451
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,440
Could be in some circumstances as,

452
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:51,620
as, as, as, as much of a burden as
being a woman, a woman of color.

453
00:28:51,621 --> 00:28:55,820
It was, and that for people that
were the, exactly. And, and you know,

454
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,980
right up until the 60s, I mean, you know,

455
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,630
people have taught me about
being illegitimate or, and,

456
00:29:01,631 --> 00:29:05,490
and the burden that it kind
of put on them. And so I,

457
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,430
I wanted everybody to understand
this is complex. This is not simple.

458
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:15,680
There was no race issues without class
issues, without gender issues, without,

459
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,690
you know, all of this stuff
that was overlapping the
whole time. And for a woman,

460
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:24,260
again at the junction of where I've
placed her at the junction of all these

461
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:28,250
different paths, and as she
says, I find no, no place, I can,

462
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,280
I can find where I belong.
Um,

463
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:34,580
then I wanted to show you the
complexity of what they say is, I mean,

464
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:38,960
what I did have a ball doing is I'm
putting together the dialogue of two girls

465
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:41,060
arguing in the 18th century.

466
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,490
And what you don't see in that clip is
it what follows is what I call a south

467
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:49,440
London cast. Um, because um, you know,

468
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,480
bell does puts that right in
no certain terms and you know,

469
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:59,650
I could never put together that scene
without that south London part of me.

470
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,440
Um, so, and you know, in many
screenings that I've been to,

471
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:08,470
it gets a huge round of applause.
And when I'm sitting in the screening,

472
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,280
I'm there,

473
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,060
I'm clapping with her even though I
put those words in her mouth because,

474
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,750
because,

475
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:18,460
because I still feel it at that moment
when she's finding her own and saying, no,

476
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:22,480
you will not, you will not demean me.
I will not allow you to demean me.

477
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,490
So yes, I mean in so many ways, the
language of the film is so bold, you know,

478
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:31,300
you get the black, the black at the
beginning of directs very direct.

479
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,770
That's something that I experienced in
my life with my first husband will not

480
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:38,590
mind me saying that. Um, his
mother, when she first met me,

481
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:42,820
I was very young in my early
twenties, um, said, oh, she's,

482
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,770
she's quite pretty,
but she's very black,

483
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,500
you know, but she's, she's
black and 10 years old.

484
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,850
And it was still nice dress
on her, but she's, you know,

485
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,930
she's black and you know,
uh,

486
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,430
Miranda Richardson's characters very
much based on that experience and, and,

487
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,340
and that person. And so, yes.
So the language is very bold,

488
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:10,120
but I wanted to play with the boldness
of the language versus us versus,

489
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,950
and not get it because the whole
scene starts so gently with this,

490
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:16,990
with this piano playing and this,

491
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,760
this loving sister sisterly conversation
and then goes into this horrible,

492
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,740
ugly place. And I wanted
to draw you in, um,

493
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,740
to the dialogue I'd created there and
draw you into and make you think, oh,

494
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,340
now it's going to be
horrible and disgusting.

495
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:34,420
But she would never do that to her sister.
Even in this situation.

496
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,011
When she said it,

497
00:31:35,011 --> 00:31:38,140
it felt so much more authentic than
what I was expecting to hear. Yeah.

498
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,010
I was like, that wouldn't
work because they love each
other. They love each other.

499
00:31:41,011 --> 00:31:43,360
Yeah, exactly. Awesome. Okay.

500
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:47,440
So from what I read some of the history
about Deitel Bella is a bit on Wikipedia

501
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:49,760
and the BBC sites and um,

502
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:54,100
and so I learned that
bell's existence was, um,

503
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,100
was discovered by the papers or the wall,
the painting,

504
00:31:57,101 --> 00:32:00,100
and then they discovered more about
her life through the papers at the kin.

505
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:04,690
What house? And I was wondering,
were there any writings
in bill's hand that you,

506
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,080
that were found that could
speak to her voice? And my God,

507
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,990
I pray that there will be one day I
pray that there will be something.

508
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:17,010
There was a gentleman named
Hutchinson who came over from America,

509
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,040
um,

510
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:23,040
and he came over to talk to Lord Mansfield
about the Zong case and wanting to

511
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:27,550
really lobby Lord, Lord Mansfield
to find against the insurers,

512
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:31,550
find for the ship owners.
In other words, uh, uh,

513
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,730
to lobby Lord Mansfield to find that it
was okay for you to drown your slaves

514
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:38,700
because this was going to
have such an impact on savory.

515
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,410
And now he writes in his diary,
and I'm totally paraphrasing here,

516
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:46,540
but it's easy to find on online,
easy to find on Google, um,

517
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,120
that, uh, he,

518
00:32:48,121 --> 00:32:51,020
he comes to the house and he sits down
and he has a formal dinner with the

519
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:51,411
family.

520
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:56,411
And after dinner this negress
comes out as grants and um,

521
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,490
you know,
and,

522
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,630
but she has the entire family wrapped
around her little finger essentially,

523
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:06,200
and she's walking, oh, I'm at home
around the gardens. And you know, they,

524
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:10,640
they're treating her, you
know, like one of them and he,

525
00:33:10,641 --> 00:33:13,430
and he's horrified by this.
He's absolutely horrified by this.

526
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:15,620
And what he says is that I wasn't,

527
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,840
I did want to bring up the
zone with Lord Mansfield,

528
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:20,330
but I didn't think that that was
quite the right time. In other words,

529
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,750
he knew that they clearly loved
this girl and that, you know,

530
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:28,110
bringing up issues of, uh, black
people at that particular point and,

531
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:32,450
and encouraging the men to say that
it would be okay to massacre them.

532
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,400
It was probably not the right time.
So virtually it's elements like that.

533
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,560
It's papers that we can find.
For instance,

534
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:42,350
we know where she married John Davinia.
Um,

535
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:45,050
so she married him in Saint
George's church in Hanover Square.

536
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:48,860
We know that she christened all of
her children in the same church.

537
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,920
So that kind of people who are,
I was able to look at the,

538
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:56,750
the two wheels that Lord Mansfield
left dido bail money in. And,

539
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,780
um, and to discover also that
not even though, you know,

540
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,690
in the film we portray it, that he,
he isn't sure if he can, he does,

541
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:11,020
but also that his sister lady Mary
played by Penelope Wilton also leaves her

542
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:15,850
money. And what that expressed
to me would that did it,

543
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:21,280
it helped to cement for me
the idea that they loved,

544
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,070
they loved this girl and you know,

545
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:27,800
she had to teach them the right way
to love her as I've said before,

546
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:31,130
but they love this girl.
So it was really finding for me,

547
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:36,131
finding all of this information for
the story that I wanted to tell because

548
00:34:36,381 --> 00:34:39,260
look, there have been
pleased on dido bell before.

549
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,630
There have been short movies of Dido
Bell before you, you know, as I say,

550
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:48,020
there was this earlier version and it
was me about me as a director of finding

551
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:52,820
my vision of the story, the story I
wanted to tell. Um, and so it was,

552
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:57,850
I can only do that through
piecing together my own
history and deciding then how

553
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:03,050
it should all be sewn together. So,
but no diaries, but there's still time.

554
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,930
There's still never know.
You never know how life is.

555
00:35:06,931 --> 00:35:11,750
So I think we're going to stop now and
take some Q and a from the audience.

556
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,250
Does anybody have,

557
00:35:13,251 --> 00:35:18,050
and there's a mic I guess in the center
here and if I have any questions. Okay.

558
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:22,100
I'll ask more question while people
come to the mic. Yeah. Okay, great. Um,

559
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,430
I actually saw the next one is a scene
and we'd like to queue this scene, um,

560
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,470
where she's actually having
conversation with John and Divinia Ah,

561
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:35,510
about her status in life. I love
her. Look the way she looks at him.

562
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:40,120
Yeah, absolutely. It's a complex
scene. That one. Yeah. I,

563
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,380
that's what I wanted to ask you about.
Could you elaborate on sort of, you know,

564
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:46,500
her thoughts at that time cause
she's recognizing, you know,

565
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:47,970
this interesting position,

566
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:51,420
she's in society where she doesn't have
to marry for money and position well

567
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:53,160
this is all part of her awakening,
weakening,

568
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:57,120
really all part of a political awakening
or part of her understanding of who she

569
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:01,050
is as a woman and where, and a woman
of color in where she fits. Like I say,

570
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:06,051
I always wanted to strike that parallel
of ownership between the person of

571
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:11,070
color, um, being owned in the woman
being owned. And I was exploring this,

572
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,640
um,

573
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,410
in my own mind is I do one day as I did
as I do in one day and I was sitting at

574
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:18,380
my desk and you know,
look,

575
00:36:18,381 --> 00:36:23,220
we're putting to the gather the
story that I wanted to tell and I,

576
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:29,400
I wanted to express the pressure
of society at that time. The,

577
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,830
I mean it was so much
pressure came from society.

578
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:35,340
And as I say at the beginning of the
movie Via Lord Mansfield Society has a

579
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:39,030
habit of casting out even one of its own.
When it has the opportunity,

580
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:43,770
it was so easy to kind of be cast out
and kind of be blacklisted and be turned

581
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:47,940
out from society. And I, it was kind of
thinking about this fortunate position of,

582
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,650
of this character and how she's wealthy
and a woman of color at the same time.

583
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,860
And yet she's still desperate to belong.

584
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,610
She still desperate to be like
the other girls who have to marry.

585
00:36:59,611 --> 00:37:02,930
And she's still desperate
for society's endorsement,
which says she, she, she, she,

586
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:07,680
she only married but Marian equal or
higher, which is a man of consequence.

587
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,660
And so she's,
she's,

588
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,780
she's working out all these arguments
in her head that I wanted to,

589
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,860
to offer to you as an audience.
And on the one hand, she's,

590
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:19,660
she recognizes that she's in this
very strong position. You know,

591
00:37:19,661 --> 00:37:23,090
she is this woman who is both free,
um,

592
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,590
as a female and as a, as, as a slave,

593
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:29,260
a female because she has money in
a slave because she's been, um,

594
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:34,340
taken into a family that has allowed
her not to be a slave, um, and,

595
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:38,680
and decided to honor the, the, the
side of her, her bloodline that, um,

596
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:43,770
did not emanate from slavery. But then
on the other hand, wanting to belong.

597
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:45,330
She's talking about this pressure of,

598
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:50,331
but who will society think I am if
I don't marry a man of consequence?

599
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:54,990
And then she's realizing also the
ridiculousness of this pressure because it

600
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,380
would be like,
I'm a free man,

601
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:03,150
begging free negro begging to
be, to have a master, you know.

602
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,280
Exactly that. Exactly. And I, you know,

603
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,820
in the end when you're working
with characters speak to
you and they come to you

604
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:10,320
with their own story and you know,

605
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:14,610
there are times where I would come out
with stuff and I go, oh, that was clever.

606
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:20,610
Oh, I like that. Um, and that, that was
one of those moments where, you know,

607
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,720
so many of the of what comes out
in this story is, um, you know,

608
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:29,160
comes directly from my own family
and my own love connections in live.

609
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:33,480
Like, um, you know, uh, what is
right can never be impossible.

610
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,670
It was something my dad used to say
very regular knee or, you know, uh,

611
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,750
when her blood father says to her,
biological father says,

612
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,480
you will not understand this in this
moment, but know that you are loved.

613
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,330
You know, that was something my father
used to say to me when I was very,

614
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:49,930
very small when he was trying to
give me the steel to go out into the,

615
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:54,400
into the world. And even lady
Mary's line of, you know,

616
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,060
Elizabeth wait for no man was my aligned
from my big sister. She was sick,

617
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,270
is six years older than me and she
used to try to be the grownup woman.

618
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,120
And so she used to say to me, you know,
you should never wait for any man.

619
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:08,680
I'd be 10 years old. Um, but
the, these particular lines,

620
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,740
um, would, we're, we're really
lines that for me just, just,

621
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:15,670
just came from being in the shoes
of the character and uh, yeah,

622
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:20,370
these things in the story. Okay.
So I, we see a few people in mind.

623
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,920
I take a [inaudible], my
name is Lauren. Hi Lauren.

624
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:25,940
Thank you so much for coming today.
Um,

625
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,470
I had the chance to see the film
yesterday and it was beautiful. Thank you.

626
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,120
Thank you for making it. Thank, I
have a quick question for you. Um,

627
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,170
my question is what made you decide to
make the film more lighthearted and about

628
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:42,520
romance versus a darker film that
stresses the turmoil of slavery?

629
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,900
Yeah. Well, Lauren, I
think, I mean for me,

630
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:48,060
I definitely wanted to,

631
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:53,120
to create this Austin s drama that I
talked about earlier and challenge myself

632
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:58,000
to be able to make a film in that way,
show that a woman of color could do it,

633
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,130
could be behind the camera and do it,

634
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:04,180
but also that a woman of color could be
in front of the carrot at the camera and,

635
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:09,310
and, um, appeal to everybody
appeal universally. Now.

636
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:13,630
Um, as we know, Austin never,
she never talked about slavery.

637
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,320
And if I had gone that route of
making something much harder,

638
00:40:17,321 --> 00:40:21,760
I'd have been coming away from my
idea of creating an Austin s you know,

639
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:26,590
that working in that Austine
sub genre of movie making.

640
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,440
And so, uh, if for me,

641
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:33,250
I always knew that I was going to tell
this more gentle story where you wouldn't

642
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:35,680
actually see stays. But as I
explained earlier, you would,

643
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:40,630
you would feel the impact of the
horror of what was happening to them.

644
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,290
And I also think sometimes that it's you,

645
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,560
you can communicate to an audience
more easily when you're not,

646
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,890
when the horror is
emotional and psychological,

647
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:57,130
but is not kind of so
explicit on the screen.

648
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:00,820
And I like to think that I don't
come to movie making with a message,

649
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:06,030
but I come to ask questions and to try
and motivate you to as a society to,

650
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:10,570
to, to have those conversations
and ask those questions.

651
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,980
And I think what a costume
drama like this does is,

652
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,370
is inspired conversation and dialogue.
Um,

653
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,400
because not everybody reads wants to read
the newspaper or wants to wants do you

654
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:28,860
kind of be hit over the head with a
message or a political kind of stance in

655
00:41:31,451 --> 00:41:36,200
that way. But I think it comes to
you in this gentle form. You know,

656
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:40,790
you naturally respond to it as opposed
to feeling like you're being forced to,

657
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:41,571
to respond to it.

658
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:45,620
And so I wanted to challenge myself
and see if I could really tell what is

659
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:50,260
essentially still a tough story, but
within the context of a love story and um,

660
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,480
self awakening and a journey
towards self love, um,

661
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:57,320
and not be explicit with violence.
Thank you. Yeah. Congratulations.

662
00:41:57,321 --> 00:42:00,590
Or seeing your vision through.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
And thank you very much.

663
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:04,880
Thank you. Hi, I'm
[inaudible]. My name is Jana.

664
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,230
Hi Matt.
Like I said,

665
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:09,950
I actually saw this at tiff and got to
witness and be a part of the standing

666
00:42:09,951 --> 00:42:13,910
ovation. So thank you for coming to
Google. Thank you. Um, so my question,

667
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:17,440
I'm really interested in
black protagonists and I
read a lot of articles, um,

668
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,550
more recently about black
renaissance and film. Um,

669
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:25,670
bell is a part of the films
that are named, um, including
12 years of slave, uh,

670
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,720
the Butler Django. Even, um, you know,

671
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,440
some of the argument people are with this
is a black renaissance where as I read

672
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:36,860
other articles that kind of
discredit this and say, um,

673
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:41,210
all of these films are most of
them focus on blacks. But you know,

674
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:45,890
in a space of servitude or,
you know, not modern black, um,

675
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,580
you know, there's a, there's a disparity.
And so I want to know your thoughts.

676
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:53,750
Bell I think is different because she,
you know, she's, it's a historic piece,

677
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:57,900
but she's not in a position
of servitude necessarily. Um,

678
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,670
but I'd love to hear your thoughts on
the larger argument of a, this, you know,

679
00:43:01,671 --> 00:43:06,140
this presence of blacks on screen,
but also then being in the past.

680
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:11,750
Sure, sure. Well, you know, I'm, I do like
to think that bell kind of steps away, uh,

681
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,350
you know, outside of that argument
to a certain extent. So, um, I do,

682
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,570
I do agree with you there.
Um,

683
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:22,550
but I do think that as filmmakers, um, we,

684
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,301
we,

685
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:26,990
and particularly as filmmakers of color
or filmmakers that are putting stories

686
00:43:26,991 --> 00:43:28,550
about people of color on screen,

687
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,630
we kind of have to have the
freedom within a certain, um,

688
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:37,280
to a certain extent to, to
choose the stories that touch
us, that we want to tell.

689
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:41,780
Now, certainly I can say that as
a British filmmaker of color, um,

690
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:46,100
we've been starved of those opportunities
to really tell stories about things

691
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:46,850
that mattered to us.

692
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:50,330
So the first thing we're going to do
when we get those opportunities is, is,

693
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,100
is kind of go to the heart of stuff that
matters and you know who we are today.

694
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:59,480
Um, and, and, and, and
what, in what inspires us,

695
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:02,600
what motivates us to move forward today.
I mean,

696
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:04,640
I think has so much to
do with our history.

697
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,690
So why not as film makers be able to
look at that history? Now, you know,

698
00:44:08,691 --> 00:44:13,691
I know Steve McQueen has made other
movies aside from 12 years a slave.

699
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:19,160
Um, and I certainly have made
other movies aside from, um,

700
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:24,680
you know, this movie bow and I intend
to go on and make movies of all kinds.

701
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:26,780
In fact, the next movie I'm going
to make us for Warner brothers,

702
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:29,540
it's called unforgettable.
It's very much rooted in today.

703
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,790
It has a double female lead.
He's very much about, again,

704
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:35,010
the woman's experience looking
at many of the themes of bowel,

705
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:37,020
but it much more in a modern day context.

706
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,590
And I have no doubt that many of
the filmmakers whose films we've,

707
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:43,050
we've talked about, you
know, the Butler, I mean,

708
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,580
you know what was precious if it
wasn't, um, today and though, you know,

709
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:51,060
the lead character in that movie
had a very, very difficult time.

710
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:53,330
She wasn't in servitude.
Um,

711
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,570
but we have to be allowed
otherwise we restricting, you know,

712
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:02,810
US restricting ourselves as people of
color is no different to other people from

713
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:04,650
other races restricting us.
You know,

714
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:07,170
just because it comes
from us from the inside,

715
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,520
it doesn't make it any better or any
more, right. Or any more worthy. Um,

716
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:14,790
what we have to be allowed
to do is a teller stories.

717
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:18,510
They have to be more of us so that there
is a variety of those stories. Story.

718
00:45:18,511 --> 00:45:21,180
If you've only got five or six of us,
you're always going to be able to,

719
00:45:21,181 --> 00:45:26,160
so comparisons between our movies when
you have, when you have 50 about us,

720
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,730
then you're going to be able to, I
mean, what was spike Lee doing? I mean,

721
00:45:29,731 --> 00:45:31,350
what does spike Lee been
doing for all these years?

722
00:45:31,351 --> 00:45:36,090
He hasn't been telling stories and people
of Color in servitude, can we, you know,

723
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:37,060
we,
we don't have to,

724
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,750
we don't have to go that far
back to eliminate these stories.

725
00:45:39,751 --> 00:45:43,680
So the arguments for me are, are
unfair. I'm worried, unwarranted.

726
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,440
And I think they're restrictive
and they restrict creativity.

727
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,420
To be honest with you,
we have to be free.

728
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,150
I didn't tell bell without knowing
that I had a responsibility.

729
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,380
And I can tell you that I, I took that
responsibility very, very seriously.

730
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:58,500
And that is why, despite
the fact that I had, um,

731
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:03,350
a lot of worries and concerns that she was
too feisty and you know, and, and, and,

732
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:07,050
and had development was,
was kind of too upfront for me.

733
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:11,490
I was not going to come to a story. I was
not going to put a character on screen.

734
00:46:11,491 --> 00:46:13,170
And she was that because,
you know,

735
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:15,210
they were worried that she wouldn't
be likable. And I said, you know,

736
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:20,211
what's not going to be likable is a week
flower woman of color put on the screen

737
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:22,590
at this particular time.
Um,

738
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,520
and so I take that responsibility
seriously and is filmmakers of color.

739
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:30,510
We know how to do that, but we also have
to be allowed to be creative, I think.

740
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,900
Well, thank you for inspiring the
next generation of filmmakers.

741
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:38,280
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thank you. Oh, I have one more.

742
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,240
Hi, I'm uh, my name is Phineas. Hi.

743
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:49,330
And I just wanted to ask if you had any
pieces or scenes that you had to take

744
00:46:49,331 --> 00:46:53,080
out that you know, you to
want us to know, I guess, um,

745
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:55,010
it will be interesting to kind
of hear about those times.

746
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:00,590
Well, early on from the script,
um, I had written a scene,

747
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:04,400
uh, this is, this is not
a very serious thing,

748
00:47:04,401 --> 00:47:08,510
but it's just the scene.
I would have loved to have
shot where I had written, um,

749
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:13,070
one of the very typical ballroom scenes
that you get the quintessential ballroom

750
00:47:13,071 --> 00:47:17,990
scene in the period
drama. And um, you know,

751
00:47:17,991 --> 00:47:20,600
again, I'd never seen a woman
of color in that context,

752
00:47:20,601 --> 00:47:25,601
so I really wanted to shoot the typical
dance 18th century line dance scene that

753
00:47:26,241 --> 00:47:29,030
you get.
And it was a very big seed and you know,

754
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,140
was I was going to be shooting it from
the point of view of somebody watching

755
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:33,990
from above and uh,

756
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,920
it was just so big and expensive that we
had to, we had to take that scene out.

757
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,570
Um,
I do,

758
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,490
I did create a scene at the
very beginning of the movie,

759
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:49,630
um, where you see, you
see the painter, um,

760
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:54,400
putting together a sketch of the girls.

761
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:59,070
It's actually Elizabeth space. What you
see is the kind of quintessential, um,

762
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:04,380
English girl coming to the fore
kind of emerging in the painting.

763
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,733
Um,

764
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,030
but what you don't necessarily know is
actually the end of the painting is going

765
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:12,880
to be something very different,
far more powerful and strong.

766
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,300
We had to take that out
because it was no, uh, it was,

767
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:19,450
it was just sort of intercut,
kind of credit opening credits scene.

768
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,970
But integrating that with,
um,

769
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,630
Captain Sir John Lindsay arriving to
collect the little bow that was a little

770
00:48:25,631 --> 00:48:30,310
bit bit long winded. So we took that
out. Essentially I was able to keep,

771
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,740
keep the essence of the movie that I
wanted. So while we sliced out lines, um,

772
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:39,400
we didn't take out too many full scenes
that I thought were really important.

773
00:48:39,401 --> 00:48:40,960
Thankfully.
Um,

774
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,550
I'm a control freak and um,

775
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,420
I've been lucky enough in both movies
that I've made to be able to get what I

776
00:48:49,421 --> 00:48:52,840
want up there on screen. And you
know, it won't always be like that.

777
00:48:52,841 --> 00:48:56,650
I know that employers, I know
that. Um, but for now, um,

778
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,040
this is how it has been night that
you essentially, you know, I got the,

779
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,610
I got what I wanted up there on screen.
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.

780
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:08,310
Yeah. Well thank you so much.
It's been such a pleasure. Yes.

781
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,070
Thank you for sharing the film and your
perspective with us. This was great.

782
00:49:12,071 --> 00:49:14,980
And we want to congratulate you on
the success of your sophomore project.

783
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,120
Thank you. And we hope you come with,
with your next project. Thank you so much.

784
00:49:19,121 --> 00:49:19,954
Thank you.
Really good.

785
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:20,983
Nope.

786
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:30,400
Yeah.
