1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,770
Welcome to top that Google today.

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,210
It's my pleasure to welcome
Millennia Abramson for room.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,143
Okay.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,730
Thanks for joining us today. Pleasure. Uh,

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,280
so do you mind telling us
about the film? Well, um,

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,190
so it's a film based on a novel,
the same name by this, uh,

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,490
Irish Canadian writer called Emma Donahue.
And I like to start with, I don't,

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,740
I tend to start with a little bit about
it's more fundamental thematic shape

9
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:34,580
then it's then where it
takes place because otherwise
you, everybody goes, oh no.

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:35,330
Um,

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,020
so for me it's a film about parenting and
it's a feeling bad being a child about

12
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:43,220
growing up. Um, but it takes
place in a very unusual context,

13
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:47,240
which I think focuses those
questions in a very particular way.

14
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:52,220
So it takes place in a locked room
for at least half of the film where,

15
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:52,970
um,

16
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,870
we have a mother and child and mother was
kidnapped maybe seven years before the

17
00:00:56,871 --> 00:01:00,170
film starts and had a
child in that situation,

18
00:01:00,171 --> 00:01:02,330
which is the one positive
thing that's come out of it.

19
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,410
And it's about her relationship with
that child and how she protects them from

20
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:10,430
the kind of darker aspects of,
of their,

21
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,230
of their world.
And it's,

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,440
it's a story that's told from the point
of view of the child for whom this is a

23
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:18,680
normal place or the
location of his childhood.

24
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,900
And then it tracks these people,

25
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:25,460
these two people as they get out of the
situation and as they tried to integrate

26
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:29,030
themselves back into the world. So how
did you get involved in the project?

27
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,550
I read the novel and she dies and
then already 2011 and I have a,

28
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,730
um, I had, my little boy at
that point was for nearly four.

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,380
And so it just, it sort of slayed me.
The book. I mean, it's very beautiful.

30
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:46,820
It's very moving and it's very sensitive.
Um,

31
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,350
and I think something of my own
feelings from my kid where, you know,

32
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,360
overflowed onto the
character in the novel.

33
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,680
And I was just fascinated by what Emma
had done and how she was talking about

34
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:01,670
these really universal things in a
situation which would normally just be a

35
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:02,180
bleak,

36
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,350
true crime kind of story or at worst it
could be a pretty exploitative sort of

37
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:10,580
story. Um, and I thought
I had two thoughts,

38
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:14,650
which is they were, I want to make this
into a film and quickly followed by,

39
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,350
I will never have a chance to make this
into your film because the novel had

40
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:23,150
been, um, had, I was a big success,
particularly in, in states. Um,

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,010
and I think while we were debating it in
the office about how we might go about

42
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:29,810
trying to get the rights,
somebody said, Oh yeah,

43
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,710
Obama was pictured coming out of a
bookstore in Martha's vineyard on his

44
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:37,490
vacation with a copy of this under his
arm. We just thought, well, you know,

45
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,420
forget it. This is way too, you know,
for a production company in Dublin.

46
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,770
Um, and instead of UK,
Ireland, London based company.

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,930
Um,
and,

48
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,070
but I just wrote this letter to Emma
because I felt so strongly about the book

49
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:56,480
and about how I thought it might work
on film that, uh, I thought, well,

50
00:02:56,481 --> 00:02:57,860
at least I'm going to say what I think.

51
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:01,840
And then she can decide whether there's
anything in that. And I wrote this very,

52
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:04,400
very long ladder just sort
of talking about the novel.

53
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,790
I thought what the challenges were,
what I thought,

54
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,300
how it worked and how it
might be transposed into,
into this, to other medium.

55
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,160
And she replied,

56
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:15,040
and that was the beginning
of a conversation that
went on all the way through

57
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,570
the film.
You know,

58
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,550
we worked together very closely and
really lovely collaborative way, um,

59
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,090
um, as a kind of thing in the film
industry that you're not supposed to allow

60
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,110
authors to adapt their own novels because
they're going to be really precious

61
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:32,040
and they, you know, they sweated
blood over this. And so, yeah,

62
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,240
they're going to be awful.
It's going to be a nightmare.

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,070
And there are plenty of stories like that,

64
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:41,071
but we just kind of really got on and I
think I just trusted her and she trusted

65
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:45,050
me and that's how we worked.
He just tell they stole my next question.

66
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:47,820
And just because they do say, you know,
it's very tough to work with the screen.

67
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,440
Definitely. Yeah. It's
killing your darlings. Yes.

68
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,930
But it sounds like it
was wonderful process.

69
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,840
What were kind of some of
the discussion points of,

70
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:59,770
obviously you're having to tell this
story in a different media. Sure.

71
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,320
Some things maybe aren't gonna
translate as well as the screen.

72
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,110
One of the big things I thought was just,
you know,

73
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,730
Jack's voice is so strong and it's
so distinct in the pro style. Yeah.

74
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,970
Were you ever like, oh we can't tell this
from, you know, we can't do voice over,

75
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:15,910
we have to do this? Or was it
just like it has to be this? Well,

76
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:19,530
I think that there were like, I think
there were various temptations that,

77
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,600
and I know some pitches were made
to Emma where people said, okay,

78
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,140
we can use CG or we can create a kind of
like externalize the magic aspect of a

79
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:32,590
child's point of view
somehow or use a very,

80
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:35,980
very definite point of view camera.
You know, I'm not quite the Gopro,

81
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:40,270
but you know that idea that you
literally are in the boys had,

82
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,040
I just felt that all of
those things are wrong.

83
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,400
They're not native to cinema cinema
handles point of view in a very different

84
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:48,370
way. You know, it's about, and it's much
more fluid point of view in cinemas,

85
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,540
much more fluid. Like in a novel, there's
always a voice mediating the story.

86
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,030
You know, you're reading it, you're
reading it in the, the writer's voice,

87
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:57,730
whether that's first person,
third person, even if it changes,

88
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,120
you're always sort of with somebody.
It's a mediated thing.

89
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,520
Film at least in s in a sense as direct.
I mean you know,

90
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,540
and point of view can shift very subtly.

91
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:11,410
So you can be with a character and then
you can find yourself in even in the

92
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:15,100
same scene tuning into a different
car to just so you have that degree of

93
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:15,934
fluidity.

94
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,030
And my view was that with a v with some
small emphases and and inflections,

95
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,150
you could on a very small
use of voice over just a pin,

96
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:26,980
you to the boy at a couple of key points,

97
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,280
you would still be very much with him but
without having to make a huge song and

98
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:36,100
dance with it.
And also the advantage.

99
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,680
And then in the film in
a way over the novel,

100
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:41,530
they said it becomes more of a 200
because the mother and the novel,

101
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,720
she's only really seen through the eyes
of the boy. She's this idealized person.

102
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,790
And of course we can imagine
what she's really going through,

103
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,780
but it's a projection. Whereas we've
got a real breathing person in our,

104
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,980
in our story.

105
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:58,310
And so part of the thing
with the adaptation was to
be able to shift between his

106
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:02,420
point of view and then undercut that with
what you know she must be experiencing

107
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,440
in the same situation.

108
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,880
And part of why that's interesting is
that that actually is what happens,

109
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:12,110
I think with all parents and children
or be it in a less extreme way.

110
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,820
Like we turn our faces to Archie,
we turned in one face to our children,

111
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:19,490
which is this, hey, you know, good,
great to see. Everything is always,

112
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,630
you are telling your child with every
gesture and facial expression that

113
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:25,820
everything's great.
Sometimes you're not.

114
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:27,830
Sometimes you're shouting
at your child and you know,

115
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,610
in a supermarket and feeling like the
worst kind of parent in the entire

116
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:33,230
universe.
But in the in general,

117
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,340
you're trying to make them feel
safe and filter the world for them.

118
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,060
And that's sort of what room is a, is a
metaphor for it. But it comes to that.

119
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:46,220
Filtration is never fully successful.

120
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:50,840
I'm things do penetrate and aspects of
the household that you're in or if you're

121
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:54,410
kind of, if the stresses,
they will pick it up.

122
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,430
And moving from childhood to adulthood
is a process of the dismantling of that

123
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,540
membrane.
You know?

124
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:07,340
And I think in our film it just gets
dismantled in a very dramatic way.

125
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,060
And that just helps you think about
those things in a, in a more focused way.

126
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,371
Sure.

127
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:14,970
It's the stakes are kind of having to
explain to your kid maybe why the tooth

128
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:18,860
fair isn't real versus why the air entire
existence that they know is not right

129
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,260
on any dangerous. It's dangerous and that
they need to get out of there. Exactly.

130
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,280
So, I mean obviously two of the
most important factors in this film,

131
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:31,160
and it would all hinge on the actors you
have playing Jack and ma. So how did, um,

132
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,410
how did you guys find Brie Larson? How'd
you find Jacob Tremblay? He was so,

133
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,760
he's amazing.
Amazing.

134
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,920
Yeah. All right. He sort of still blows
my mind and I was there, you know,

135
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,130
and m I think with Bray,

136
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,560
it was one of those things
like if any film works,

137
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,920
there are always moments
that you look back on,

138
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:52,500
which are just pure luck because
it's such a bizarre medium.

139
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:55,700
It involves so much chaos
and uncertainty and,

140
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,960
and uh,
the several moments of luck for me,

141
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:02,780
one of them was that when we knew we
were really going to make the film,

142
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:05,060
we were starting to think
about casting work with a very,

143
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:08,660
very good casting director in London.
And we were thinking about it,

144
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:09,920
very short list of,

145
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,710
of women who we thought could
play the mother because once it,

146
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,400
or to be the right age, which is
mid twenties, early to mid twenties,

147
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:19,430
didn't want to be casting somebody older
and doing all the movie stuff that just

148
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:20,600
makes things feel a bit fake.

149
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,590
And we had maybe three names
and then somebody in the office,

150
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:27,650
actually somebody in Admin in it,
in Admin in the office said, Oh,

151
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:30,740
I saw this film called short term travel.
It's really good actor in that.

152
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,480
And I like e if you make films,
two things happen all the time.

153
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,960
One is that people come
up with scripts and um,

154
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,110
and the other is that people have casting
suggestions and you learn to smile and

155
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:48,500
nod politely at both and then
completely ignore them. Right. Um, and,

156
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,850
uh, I thought our, well great,
you know, thank you so much.

157
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,580
And then there happened to be a DVD lying
around the office and I took it home

158
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:58,830
and I just had a bit of time
that night and I watched it.

159
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,270
And She's absolutely staggering. Bria,
staggering in that film. And she's,

160
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,360
she's interesting because she's both
dramatically incredibly strong and you can

161
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:09,834
go very deep,

162
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,260
but she also has this lightness and she
inhabits her characters without any of

163
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,620
that showy,
you know,

164
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,320
tragic heroine intensity that would just
kill this film because you've got to

165
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:22,440
believe that she's a real person that
would have been on any street in any

166
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:26,820
American town. And I was just
unlucky. Um, so I went on,

167
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:30,930
I met her and I met a couple of the other
people that we were interested in and

168
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:32,880
she just, yeah, I started
a conversation where,

169
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:37,140
or not meeting that we just continued
through one audition and it just felt like

170
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:41,370
I didn't want that conversation to,
and you know, and then with Jake,

171
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,040
when you're casting a child,
you give yourself a time limit.

172
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,240
So if it's a small child, you
can't sort of say, well we'll,

173
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:53,880
we'll cast the child and then
when we know we've got the child,

174
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,040
because otherwise if we don't
have the drive and have a film,

175
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,160
we'll then start putting the film
together because we know we're okay.

176
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,000
Problem is that's going to take you a year
and then the child would have changed.

177
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,800
So it's this weird,

178
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:07,500
it's like cooking a dinner and trying to
get everything to be ready at the same

179
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:10,110
time you have to get on
with the film. Uh, you know,

180
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,290
setting it up and you get on
with looking for the kid. So I,

181
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,640
and I used to say to Emma and
would say, you know, well,

182
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,940
what if we don't find the
kid? And all right. And I'd
say, Oh, you know, you know,

183
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:25,290
there's top professionals
working on there. So, you
know, we do this all the time.

184
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,610
But actually of course there was this
terrible fear that we wouldn't find our

185
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:33,060
boy and then we would have to postpone
and all that. And then Jake put them,

186
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,370
he was put on tape by
his parents in Vancouver.

187
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,930
And I saw his tape and it was really good.
Maybe a little bit,

188
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,280
he'd done some commercials and stuff.

189
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:46,110
So there was a little bit of that sweet
kind of, you know, being kind of acting,

190
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:51,060
which it, which is fine if you're
selling toothpaste or a car insurance,

191
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:54,320
but if you put it in a real film, the kid
just looks like Kotick, you know, that,

192
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,760
that sort of way.
So when I went to meet him,

193
00:10:57,761 --> 00:11:02,030
met him in La and with a few other
little boys and it's weird auditioning to

194
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:05,280
little kids cause they're all gorgeous
and you don't want to sit there going,

195
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,990
yeah, you know, get rid of that one. But,
but it's just, it's who fits the thing.

196
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:14,100
You know. And Jake had that lovely, uh,

197
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,900
he's very natural kid. His parents are
not showbizzy at all. Um, he loves acting.

198
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,320
Uh, and uh, very quickly could see that,

199
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,580
that we could take that
layer of sweetness away.

200
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:31,440
And I just wanted to see, can I make him
comfortable? Not pretending, you know,

201
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,970
another was just sitting there.
And what is it,

202
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,530
what's it like if I ask them
just to sit there and you know,

203
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,390
holds a look and then look away and look
back. And that's when you see, does it,

204
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:44,040
does the, the little guy, when
you ask them to do something,

205
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,750
does he then do it with a natural
kind of comfort? You know,

206
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,890
and he does a course. He's still very
young and, and it involves, you know,

207
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,680
getting that performance out
of him involved on both sides.

208
00:11:56,681 --> 00:12:00,040
So much kind of effort. And I'm Brea as
well because Bree was so much part of,

209
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,000
in the scenes, he was really
helping him and she'd of, she'd say,

210
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:07,570
stop kicking your leg against the
table or, you know, move your hair,

211
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:10,900
or remember what Lenny said
about this or she was amazing.

212
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:13,450
And then she'd be able to go right
back into her, her performance.

213
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:16,450
But Jake has it.
And if he didn't have it,

214
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,790
we wouldn't do it just would be no film.

215
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,580
I'm curious in terms of
working with the two actors,

216
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:25,540
because Bree kind of has to be in this
very horrible, not horrible, but she,

217
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:25,751
you know,

218
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:29,530
she'll broken downstate versus Jake who
in the beginning needs to be kind of

219
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,460
just like, hey the world
is, the world is, yeah.

220
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,060
Did that affect your
production schedule at all?

221
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:37,180
Did you guys try and shoot
prep with ray first and then,

222
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,440
and then bring Jake in fresh or what? We
prep a Bri from the moment she was cast,

223
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:42,191
that was about eight months.

224
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:45,500
So we shot and I was in contact with
her a lot and was over and back to

225
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:50,490
California a lot. And um, so and,
and talking about the couch cause,

226
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,520
cause like I say, the character
isn't fully formed in the novel.

227
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,820
So there was loads of room and Bri was,

228
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:57,560
but she was getting on with our own prep
and we were talking and she was going

229
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,350
on with our own prep.
So she,

230
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:01,900
and she got herself really into the
right state of mind by the time we were

231
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:05,980
ready to shoot. But then Jake arrived
and it's just like in the film,

232
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:10,720
nothing will dampen his spirits. I
mean, so it doesn't matter how kind of,

233
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,410
what she's been going into in
preparation, he's going, hey,

234
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,360
what's your favorite star wars character?
And you know,

235
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,000
look if I held your nose and you'd
do my, you know, it's just like,

236
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,880
you can't stop him.
He's this little lovely little boy.

237
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:24,290
And that was actually really good
I think for her because it stopped.

238
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,470
It stopped her being able to sync.

239
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,340
She had to come back up and
come back up between takes.

240
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:33,400
And there's some lovely moments like, you
know, I don't know who's seen the film,

241
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:36,200
but there's a moment where
they're reunited at the,
after they'd been kidnapped.

242
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,580
It's very, very emotional after they've
escaped is incredibly emotional.

243
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,990
Brie is absolutely, you
know, it is one of the most,

244
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,380
it was amazing piece of work from
her. She's just, she's crying,

245
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:49,270
she's sobbing and it's real.
You know,

246
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:52,780
she's got herself into that state
and I'd call cut and j could go,

247
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,190
why you still crying? You know, Lenny
cold cut, what's wrong? You know,

248
00:13:57,191 --> 00:14:00,790
let's hang out. What do you want to
eat from the craft service table? So,

249
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,650
so it was just brilliant because it just,

250
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,340
it kept everybody from taking
themselves too seriously. Um,

251
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,600
what sort of research did you,
did you do, did you have Bree do,

252
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,110
did she kind of take this on our own?
Um,

253
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,460
I believe Emma had said when
she was writing the novel,

254
00:14:14,461 --> 00:14:17,320
at least she didn't get too bogged down
in it just because unfortunately there

255
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:20,230
are so many real life kind of examples
of this that you don't want it to become

256
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:24,780
too much of one story. And also you,
it's always imagine an [inaudible],

257
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,620
whatever the word is because the
research brings you a certain distance,

258
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:31,330
you know,
can give you a lot of the,

259
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,880
I was quite interested in small
things like you know, what,

260
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:36,700
how do the police operate afterwards?
What are the media do,

261
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,010
what are the kinds of,
what are the beats of all those things?

262
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:42,650
Just so that it feels real. And I
find those some footage of, you know,

263
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,100
arrivals home to houses really useful.

264
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,280
And I read interviews and watched
interviews. But the thing about,

265
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,590
the thing about it is people don't,
you know,

266
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:54,800
none of us speak unless you're,
unless that's your thing.

267
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:59,480
None of us speak with great insight about
ourselves. I don't think we do anyway.

268
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:04,430
You know, and people stories become
a bit calcified so that after that,

269
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,010
when you see a story, it's sometimes
already become a kind of bit of a uh,

270
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,850
a potter,
you know?

271
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,080
So in the end you've really got to
imagine what was it really like the moment

272
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,780
when they stopped at what,
you know,

273
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,600
you have no choice but to do the thing
that you always do if you're making a

274
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,740
running book or making a film and just
try your best to get inside it using your

275
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:29,630
own, you know, your own resources.
But I know, I know I did. I did.

276
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,430
Yeah, I did read some of the stuff and
watch some of the stuff from particular

277
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,440
interested in the media and how the
media exploit's those people and what it,

278
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,610
all those interviews feel like.

279
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:43,220
And because we were doing one
of those interviews in the film,

280
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:48,221
it was a brilliant thing to be able to
watch those simpering deeply concerned,

281
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,600
heavily quaffed people who,
whose make that, you know,

282
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,920
who have that dripping sense of deep
concern and you just know that it is.

283
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,360
There is a savage ratings getting
machine operating under that.

284
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:07,250
So that was it. Useful to watch.
That's one of the things I noticed, um,

285
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,440
that is also pretty prominent in the book.

286
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:13,250
Where do you think this film
kind of would've resonated
maybe 50 years ago where

287
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:17,270
we weren't in this 24 seven media cycle
where it's almost this like horrific

288
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:19,940
expectation of these people are victims.
That's right.

289
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,870
It will have to participate
in an interview and then
it's like if they don't,

290
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:25,490
people are like, well, what's
wrong with you? You know, my,

291
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,930
and I had to be private about it.

292
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:28,750
It's like all the people
cheering when they come home.

293
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:32,150
And what makes you think that that's what
these people who've just been through

294
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:33,680
this terrible trauma need?
I mean,

295
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,350
I'm not suggesting that people
cheering don't actually feel something,

296
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,900
but everything is a spectacle.

297
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,650
And I don't think 30,
40 years ago,

298
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,230
this would be an entirely different film.

299
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,470
And you would actually imagine
that largely people would keep,

300
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,960
this is also not necessarily a good thing,

301
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:55,330
but people would want to keep it quiet
because it'd be perceived shame and,

302
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,790
and all that around what had happened.
Now at least that's not there now.

303
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:03,440
Although we are, you know, it's
very interesting, you know,

304
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:07,410
that whole idea of how we, how shame
operates in, in the public's fair now and,

305
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:12,590
and how ticketing social media that
that kind of mob can form really,

306
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:17,180
really quickly. Um, and it's
the same I think in these cases.

307
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:21,890
People end with the parts over them, judge
the mother. Um, and when she comes out,

308
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,760
she is so concerned to show that
she's done a good job with the boy.

309
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,900
That's very, I think that's something
very sad about that. It is. And I think,

310
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,990
I think it's probably one
of the crucial things,

311
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:35,570
my understanding is you could say to
a parent is like judging them on their

312
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:39,170
parenting style and saying,
you know, well it shouldn't,

313
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:40,580
shouldn't you've done this.
It's like, well you don't know,

314
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:45,250
you weren't in my shoes. That's where
I didn't even have shoes. Yeah. Um,

315
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,660
so I'm curious about religion just because
it is a little more prominent in the

316
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:50,850
book, but I don't think it was
missing from the movie. But I'm,

317
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:55,170
I'm curious as to what the decision was
in terms of not making it this kind of

318
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,800
huge factor. I just didn't
want it to be, I mean,

319
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,860
in a way I didn't want it
to be appropriated by that
constituency has that kind

320
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:07,850
of story. I just an Emma what
Emma did and then all of that,

321
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,530
she does bring in a little bit
of it and then it's really just,

322
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,750
it's Mars attempt to use
whatever materials she's got
to make this work for the

323
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:19,560
boy and I, I felt what, I don't think
anybody needed this. I'm, I'm myself,

324
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:23,250
I'm not religious. I'm it. And I'm
pretty kind of emphatic about that.

325
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:27,450
So I suppose it's just a personal thing.
She just talk about heaven,

326
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,460
but that's a very generic idea.

327
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:33,750
But as soon as you talk about
God and Jesus and stuff, um,

328
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,890
I just,

329
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,950
for me it rang alarm bells and I just
didn't want the film being talked about as

330
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,381
a cause.

331
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:43,530
I think people should believe whatever
they want and be totally free to do that.

332
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,060
But in this story,

333
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:49,260
for me it is the actual love of a mother,

334
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,570
which all mothers, um, you know,

335
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,230
most people give to their children
regardless of whether they're religious or

336
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:57,840
not. And I thought, well, if
you could do it without that,

337
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,070
then let's do it without it.

338
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,080
I definitely kind of enjoyed that.

339
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,240
It made it more accessible to me is
also like a Christian or whatever. Yeah.

340
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,780
Where it's, it's, it's just
more her appropriating the
backstories and mythology.

341
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:13,500
She already knows that as
opposed to, uh, you know,

342
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,780
making it about a specific.
Exactly. Um, so when, uh,

343
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,180
one of the things I really enjoyed, and
this is just more of a film making thing,

344
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:25,140
was that the use of sound and music and
then the kind of lack thereof. Yeah. Um,

345
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:28,770
I don't think we even heard music at all
until we kind of went into Jack's first.

346
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,210
Yeah,
there's a little bit,

347
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:33,750
but really the first proper score
is Wimmer in his first voiceover.

348
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,300
Was that something that you knew from
the beginning that you just want it to be

349
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:40,350
this like cold? No, the music
thing is always organic with me.

350
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:42,870
I worked with the same composer.
He's what I've worked on every,

351
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:45,180
with everything that I've done.
He did frank as well,

352
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:48,190
but the songs on the soundtrack and I,

353
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,020
we've been friends since we were in
the Irish equivalent of third grade,

354
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:56,100
like we were nine, so that, right.
That's that then isn't it? And um,

355
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,080
we always just, it's always a thing
that he just starts coming in,

356
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,990
starts watching stuff,

357
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,560
starts to put pieces against
what we're doing and we see them,

358
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:06,630
we keep them where we, we, we lays them.

359
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:11,930
And I think I'm always pretty sparing
with music because I think it's when a

360
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:16,680
film can do a lot of it's work,
just easing those very simple tools.

361
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,130
That's a very strong thing.
And then when you do use music,

362
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:23,760
it has more effect because it isn't
just this wallpaper that's there all the

363
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:28,440
time. Um, sound, I think it's a
really good sound job on this film.

364
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:31,980
We spent a lot of time on it and just
that feeling of opening out when the door

365
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:32,680
opens and,

366
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,840
and you just get this and you realize
that you've been in this kind of vacuum

367
00:20:36,841 --> 00:20:38,250
space for,
for a while.

368
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,360
And then once they're outside and Jack
is having to deal with the kind of

369
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:46,320
buzzing confusion of the world.
There's quite a lot of very good,

370
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:50,650
very separate design that just emphasizes
different frequencies and just masses

371
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:55,390
a little bit with perspective in the same
way that the camera starts to be, um,

372
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,510
to deconstruct a little bit. Some
of those experiences, like when,

373
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,690
when he's with the police and they're
asking him questions in the way that a

374
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:05,370
child does, he's, his attention is just
as likely to be focused on the barges,

375
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,160
the face, you know, where the
heart is, the face and, and, um,

376
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,660
and those are the things we didn't really
do inside the room where everything is

377
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:17,040
familiar. So yeah, sound
design is, uh, you know,

378
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:22,090
it's a huge part of it and just personal
grievance is that so many theatres are

379
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:26,650
bodily set up and they also play that
film's really quietly because they don't

380
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:29,860
want, they use a huge big
blockbusters which leak into the sea,

381
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,120
send them into the theater,

382
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:34,300
right beside if it's a multiplex and
see half the time when you're watching a

383
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:35,134
subtle film,

384
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,730
you're losing massive amount of its
impact because it's not an immersive sound

385
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:43,160
experience, it's just that
it's just a bit too quiet. Um,

386
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,180
only heard it in properly and,
and good, but lack of sound.

387
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:52,150
That I think was the thing that was most,
we heard the least the most. Um, um,

388
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,910
so I think one of my
favorite scenes personally,

389
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:59,770
at least it was when they're out and my,
or joy or she's just like,

390
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,040
I want him to connect with
something. Yes. Um, you know,

391
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,520
and clearly he's actually capable
of, and she's not, but I'm,

392
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,960
I'm curious as to what you
want people to connect with.

393
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:09,940
Like what's one of the things you want
people to connect with most with this

394
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:12,070
film? Um, for me it's always,

395
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,740
it's a good way of asking it
because people usually say,

396
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:16,750
what do you want people to take away?

397
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,540
Or what ideas do you
want them to take away?

398
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,090
But I don't think in terms so much of,

399
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,510
of ideas and there are lots of ideas and
it's quite a fertile film for thinking

400
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:29,140
about things via, you know, but, um,

401
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:34,290
I think more about experiences
and a kind of film is such a,

402
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,710
it can be, especially in the theater,
is such a kind of completely,

403
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,970
I use that word again, immersive
experience that it, it, it,

404
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,910
it sometimes allows you
to open up a little bit,

405
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:49,900
just very simply about the relationships
in your own life. For Poor, for me,

406
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:54,901
it's to feel more a different kind of
empathy or a or a an awareness of other

407
00:22:56,561 --> 00:23:01,300
people. And I, for me, it's, it's, I hope
that you feel that you've had a very,

408
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:04,570
very intimate encounter with
people that you've cared about.

409
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,150
And I think through art,

410
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,300
those encounters are pure in a way that
they can never be in life because it's

411
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:17,401
almost impossible in life to distance
yourself from your own requirements or

412
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,430
impulses or once in a given situation
or there was, were, were actors in,

413
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,930
in our own lives and we can,

414
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,590
it's very hard to abstract that probably
with your own children is the only time

415
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:29,020
where you feel that,
you know,

416
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,550
that lack of yourself being
that important. But, but for me,

417
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:38,551
I think a good piece of film or humanistic
piece of film is one that sharpens

418
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:43,960
your sense of empathy and, and, and
does it in this crucible of a, of a,

419
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:46,010
of an experience in this,
in the theater.

420
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,280
But then maybe you
bring that back out and,

421
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,220
and it just opens you up a little bit.
Um,

422
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,750
so I think my last question is,

423
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:56,420
and we're going to be taking audience
questions if anyone wants to line up, um,

424
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,380
what was the most challenging thing about
making this film for you and what was

425
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:03,260
the most rewarding thing?
Probably the most challenging was,

426
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:05,750
was was how do you preserve the,

427
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,840
the tension in the film after
the escape because you have a,

428
00:24:10,841 --> 00:24:13,090
an escape sequence in the middle of
the film, which would normally be the,

429
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:13,661
you know,

430
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:18,230
the climax of a film and then you're
going to move on into this different sort

431
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:20,330
of question that you're
asking in the second half.

432
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,090
And I think in way we found just by,

433
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:28,730
but by making something of
the anticlimax of the escape,

434
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,840
make that the plot point that for an
ordinance goes, oh wait, this isn't,

435
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,200
this isn't going to be this sudden
realization that it's not going to be what

436
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:37,640
you were hoping for.
And also,

437
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:40,790
I suppose certain kind of very focused
storytelling in the second half,

438
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:44,660
which just creates this, I
don't know, just this, this,

439
00:24:44,661 --> 00:24:49,010
this tension around whether
the relationship can survive.
And probably the bit,

440
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:52,540
the most rewarding thing about it was,
um,

441
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,450
actually just feeling the audience's
reaction to you. What, I mean,

442
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,500
that's not so much about the
making, but I've made it, you know,

443
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:04,730
if this is my fifth feature and
they've all had, you know, they've,

444
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,300
I'm very lucky there will be well reviewed
and I've gone to very good festivals

445
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:13,301
and first two to three were very art
house films and you get an extremely

446
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:15,720
attached audience for those.
But,

447
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:18,560
but it's a small one and in a
big room for a lot of people.

448
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:20,740
It's just not what they want.
And,

449
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,530
and I didn't go out making this film
in order to, that wasn't the purpose.

450
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,500
I didn't want to go and say I'm going
to make abroad and clap crowd pleasing

451
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:30,440
film. I wanted to make the right
that the film that this should be.

452
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,320
But when it turns out
that that actually has a,

453
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,110
a much bigger audience and not, the
effect is so emotional, sort of amazing.

454
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:43,730
I mean in, in Toronto, I, Eh,
I didn't go to the screening,

455
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:44,360
but I came,

456
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,360
I came at the end and I heard the music
start on this absolutely huge response

457
00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:53,270
from the audience. And then I walked out
and there was a massive innovation and,

458
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,740
uh, that was sort of overwhelming. It
was, but it was, it was really lovely.

459
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,600
Yeah. Um, do we have any,

460
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,260
I feel like it's a shareholder's meeting.
Uh,

461
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,870
was there any part of the book that you
wanted to adapt for the film and we're

462
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:16,370
not able to, yes, there were some
parts of the book that I really loved.

463
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,330
I think again,

464
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,620
in the second half there's a trip to
the shopping mall that they go on.

465
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,690
My has a brother in the book. We, we,
she, he's not there in the film. Um,

466
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,080
and they go to the shopping mall and
Jack is dragged around and it doesn't

467
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:32,060
understand anything and
it's all overwhelming.

468
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:35,530
It's a really lovely commentary
on the way we live. Um,

469
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,130
but in the film,

470
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:42,310
it was only by really focusing the
film in this very laser like way in the

471
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:46,830
second part where you aren't entirely
tracking the relationship with the mother

472
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:49,080
and son. That's, so I shot,

473
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,140
I did shoot a shopping mall scene and
it's really interesting and on its own is

474
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:56,190
very interesting,
but,

475
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:00,450
and it also took them out of the house
at the end and I felt, no, let's,

476
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,030
you know,
let's keep this balance.

477
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:08,031
It's one interior to another
via this big expansive section.

478
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,550
And so I kept it up at
that. Thank you. Thank you.

479
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,440
Well, thank you so much for
joining us today. It's a pleasure.

480
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,610
Thank you so much for coming.

481
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,900
[inaudible].
