1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,471
I am really,

2
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:11,730
really excited to bring on stage Rochelle
Brisco who was an HR people partner

3
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:14,940
here at Youtube.
We've got Teraji coming on stage who,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,380
I don't think it needs an introduction.

5
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:20,070
We've got Robin Bissell who was the
writer and director of this very amazing

6
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:24,210
movie, the best of enemies. And then
we've also got Dominique telson coming on.

7
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:25,380
Who produced this moving please

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,463
from them.

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,370
Well, as you can tell from
that, very warm welcome.

10
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:42,590
We're so excited to have all of you here.
Um,

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,870
everyone has just seen an amazing
clip from the best of enemies.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,900
And this was four years ago when we
first heard that you signed on to Raj,

13
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,460
you to be part of the film.
Um,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,970
can you tell us a little bit about
the process, you know, when you see,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,740
when you saw this, what made you
decide that this was right for you?

16
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,570
Well, Danny Strong, um, co Creator,

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,720
one of the Co creators and producers
of Empire gave me this script when we

18
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:13,700
filmed the pilot for empire.
And then

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,740
the show became a big success and
it was hard for me to, you know,

20
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:23,310
schedule my schedule. I had so many
scheduling conflicts. And then, um,

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,840
it was after the 2016 election,

22
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:29,840
I noticed that the racial
climate change drastically.

23
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,370
So I called Danny and I was like,

24
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:33,680
we have to make this movie
and we got to make it now.

25
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,690
And at the time I was already slated
to do, I'm proud Mary on my hiatus.

26
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,160
And so he was like, you already have
a movie. And I was like, I don't care.

27
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,100
Make it happen. Make the dates work
and I'll give up my entire hiatus.

28
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,630
And that's what I did.

29
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,880
That's fantastic. And Robin, you'd
produce some amazing blockbusters,

30
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:55,870
sea biscuit,
the hunger games Pleasantville.

31
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,280
But this is your directorial
debut? Yeah. Like for you,

32
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,040
what made this your first,
how'd you choose [inaudible]?

33
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,620
What was the story I'd
first heard about in 2005.

34
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:11,180
And so I had been really anxious to
do something with it at the time.

35
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:11,661
You know,

36
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:15,260
as a producer you have to find a writer
and a director and do all that to have

37
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:18,830
something come to fruition.
But after the hunger games,

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,520
I had been thinking about wanting to,
because I started out as a singer,

39
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:26,240
song writer way back in the
90s. Um, and so, you know,

40
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:30,350
I fancied myself a creative, so
I'm, so after the hunger games,

41
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,370
that was my time.

42
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:35,810
I thought about directing and this is
the one thing I just been wanting to do,

43
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,170
just tell the story regardless
of how I was involved.

44
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,560
And so I sat down and I
called my friend Danny Strong,

45
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:45,320
said I'm going to start
writing this. And uh, I did.

46
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,390
Yeah. Yeah. And what about you Dominique?

47
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,800
Had you worked with Robin or Teraji
before? How'd you decide to produce? No,

48
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,280
I hadn't, I hadn't worked
with either one, but, um,

49
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,410
actually what another one of
Robin's friends, Matt Berenson,

50
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,740
I think they were tennis partners,
is what he told me. Said, yeah,

51
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,880
my friend Robert gave me the script. So
he read it and then he sent it to me. And,

52
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,710
uh, when I read it, I was like,
I want to make this movie. Um, I,

53
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,540
I just, I just fell in love with the
character of Ann Atwater. And of course,

54
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:20,110
like everyone else,
Google did that she really exists.

55
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:21,460
Is this really a real person?

56
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:26,350
And I'm just was fascinated
by what she was able to do,

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,090
um, in her community, um,
with, with, with this film.

58
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,920
And then it just in her, in her
life at, you know, as a woman,

59
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,520
uh, you know, in this, in this
town. And so I, I made it,

60
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:44,260
my goal is make thanks for doing it.
Not just did she exists,

61
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:48,520
but I understand some of you had a
chance to meet her before her passing and

62
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,600
2016

63
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,570
so when I, um, I'm sorry,
did I interrupt you?

64
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:58,180
Do you know of another second half of the
question? Um, yeah. So, uh, right after I,

65
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,890
I re optioned the book cause I had let
the option lapse in 2009 I reactions book

66
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:07,891
in 2013 and I beelined it for Durham and
I called Ann and she was very open and,

67
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,020
and she was in the hospital at
the time. She hurt her knee. Um,

68
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,860
and so we just started having lunch and
talking and I'd go back and then I kept

69
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:20,320
going back. And then bill
Riddick also who's still alive,

70
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,430
I just started spending time
with them and um, you know,

71
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,940
Anne was just sharp as a tack till the,

72
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,090
literally up until she passed in 2016.
It's a big regret.

73
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,660
We didn't get to get it done before
because she was so excited at first.

74
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:38,470
She was so excited that Taraji was
going to play her, I mean beyond,

75
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,660
um, and she was just so excited for the
movie to yeah, really a wonderful woman,

76
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,800
really wonderful and really gave
me a lot of perspective, uh,

77
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,170
as a filmmaker into not just herself,

78
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,760
but what it was like in the 50s,
sixties and seventies in,

79
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:59,680
in the south end. Great Perspective
on CP wasn't alive anymore. Uh,

80
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:03,940
and seeing it through her eyes allowed
me to three dimensionalize him more.

81
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,970
So yeah,

82
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,540
we got a few of them. I mean the families,
uh, came on set and, and were there,

83
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,800
Bill [inaudible] was there during the
Charette, you know, so, you know, he,

84
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,280
he helped a lot cause you, you know,
you watch this and you go like,

85
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:19,880
how did this happen? He goes, when I met
them, I couldn't stand either one of them.

86
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,590
They was both nasty. And so it was,
it was kind of great to see that,

87
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:28,610
that perspective. Cause it again,
three dimensionalize the story that,

88
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,200
that Robin had written in
his, in his screenplay. Um,

89
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,150
and then they all came
to this, the all the, um,

90
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,350
his children and grandchildren and her
children and grandchildren came to the

91
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,860
premier that we had. We had a screening
in Durham for them and they were really,

92
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:47,440
really supportive of the film, which
was, which was great. That's amazing. Um,

93
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,810
yeah, it, it definitely comes
alive. It's three dimensional,

94
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:52,160
you feel every bit of it.

95
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,520
And one of the areas that really struck
me was just how extreme there are

96
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,160
some of the scenes and it's this very
severe optimism matched shortly with

97
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,190
severe pessimism. And for
you to Raji and you, Robyn,

98
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,260
how,
how do you embody that in a character and,

99
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,580
and create that as a director? Uh, I mean,

100
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:24,581
well I couldn't really add too much
because Anne was a really a real person.

101
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,160
Um, I just listened to a lot of
the stuff people say about her, uh,

102
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,070
that she was a powerhouse.
Roughneck Annie,

103
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,600
a CP all would always say you
could hear her before you see her.

104
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,170
Um, she had a big mouth, you
know, so, you know, those,

105
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,740
those are real specific, uh,
descriptions of a person.

106
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,460
And that sounds like somebody that
doesn't take no for an answer.

107
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:57,320
That sounds like somebody that, um,
that gets things done, you know.

108
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:01,250
And the fact that she went up against
so many powerful white men and she was

109
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:04,700
unafraid, like she was fearless.
She would die for the cause.

110
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,360
That's how important it was for her to
leave this world in a much better place

111
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:12,800
than she found it for her children
and for generation after her. Um,

112
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,600
and she wasn't rich. She wasn't a
rich woman. She, she had no money,

113
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,040
but,
uh,

114
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,810
she had compassion in her heart and she
was a true Christian cause as Christians,

115
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:27,290
you supposed to love your enemy.
It's hard to do. But she did it,

116
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,380
you know, um, she just didn't
back down. I mean, Cook Gracious.

117
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:37,820
I couldn't imagine just when I,
when I,

118
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:41,270
um, had to get hurt when I
had the physical lies are,

119
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,590
I just imagined her when she gets,
she moved with a purpose, you know,

120
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,260
this is a woman who whenever she's moving,

121
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:51,770
she's moving with a purpose and
I just imagine a locomotive,

122
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,280
you know what I mean? And if you get in
her way, she's going to steam roll you.

123
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,860
So I just thought about things
like that. And, you know,

124
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:05,220
at the time it was so desperate, you
know, it was like her, the, you know,

125
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,000
poor people and black people in
particular in that community,

126
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:10,130
their backs were against the wall.
You know,

127
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:14,030
what happens when you back somebody up
into a corner, they come out swinging,

128
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,690
you know, and, and I just kept that
on board every time that, you know,

129
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,430
she wasn't just fighting for
herself and for her children,

130
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:26,240
she was fighting for the next
generation, you know. Um,

131
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,580
and that's a heavy weight to carry.

132
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,600
I, and she was just talking about their
backs are against the wall and what your

133
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:37,680
question was, which was the juxtaposition
of pessimism and optimism. And you know,

134
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:40,560
we live in such a pessimistic time now.
You know,

135
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:44,330
we talk about how we first heard the
story years ago and it was relevant then.

136
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:48,840
And, and I think that, that this,
you know, in these kinds of times,

137
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:49,561
and then,
you know,

138
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:54,561
the smallest bit of hope really can
save you even in an hour or a day,

139
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:57,540
you know, have the smallest bit of hope.
It's like, oh my God, it might be okay.

140
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:01,860
And that the embrace, they
embrace optimism, even when the,

141
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,030
it's a terrible, you know,
landscape. And you know,

142
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:09,570
these people were the same way I think.
And, and, you know, we talked about it,

143
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:13,230
we were charging and I, and Dominic were
talking about last night how, you know,

144
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,240
these weren't just,
you know,

145
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:19,410
they were poor and they were in a small
town derms of relatively small town,

146
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:21,840
but they were leaders within that town,
you know.

147
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,120
And so it's no accident that it's,

148
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,330
there was a trickle down effect from
some people who had change of heart.

149
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,280
You know, I mean, generational,

150
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:36,810
we've been meeting with CPS family and
his kids and grandkids is no hate in them.

151
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:40,110
I mean, they're wonderful people. And
that stopped because of an stopped him.

152
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,840
And so it's, it's, you
look at these people,

153
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:45,780
Bill Riddick was a leader and
Atwater was a leader who had,

154
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,880
people would follow her
to the ends of the earth,

155
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,490
but she had her own ideology as far
as shutting herself off to certain

156
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:56,820
conversation.
CP obviously on the wrong side,

157
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:58,560
but he had a lot of people
that would follow him.

158
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,440
So Bill Riddick was able to work on Ann
Atwater to have a resume and a little c,

159
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,720
little bit of some of the bigger picture
because she had made such a difference

160
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,970
in people's lives. And this will allow
her to tap into CP who was another leader.

161
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,180
And she knew if she could tap into him,
maybe that would trickle down. Right?

162
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,630
And it's because it's courage of
leadership is courage of moral courage.

163
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,970
And you know, that's what
we're missing today. I mean,

164
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:26,280
you know, do you know,
there's plenty of leaders,

165
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:29,640
we know plenty of our people in
Washington who know there's a gun problem,

166
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:33,060
who knows? There's a problem
with a in law enforcement, right?

167
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,670
We know there's a racial problem.
No, there's a climate problem.

168
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,900
They know they're not stupid,
right? But where's the courage?

169
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:44,040
Where's the courage to lead,
you know, the right way. So,

170
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,300
yeah, we have to dig into
that ourselves as people. Um,

171
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,510
I'm going to ask a little more
personally because you know,

172
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,340
I did spend 16 years in the beltway,

173
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:57,600
so I'm going to stay away from
that for this conversation. Um,

174
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,730
but in your own personal experience,

175
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:05,180
is there something that you drew from
or thought about when you're agreeing to

176
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,120
be in produce direct this story?

177
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,093
Okay.

178
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,020
I guess for me it was just,
um,

179
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,780
what made it so important for me
and why I gave up my entire hiatus.

180
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,060
She never lets me forget that.

181
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,730
Is it because, um, I mean, you know,

182
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:33,731
you see this world and as an artist I
feel like it is our duty to reflect the

183
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:37,130
times. That's, that's what we're
supposed to do with artists.

184
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:42,080
And I take that responsibility
very seriously. Um,

185
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,940
art has changed my life.

186
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:48,680
I have looked at a visual painting and
it has touched me to the core or shifted

187
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:51,560
my perspective or something,
you know, artists that powerful.

188
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,470
So whenever I pick roles, you
know, some may be for fun,

189
00:11:56,471 --> 00:12:00,220
but a lot of them, if you
pay close attention, uh,

190
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:05,250
it's examples of something to leave for
our kids or a message to change a group

191
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:10,030
of people's perception on another
group of people. You know,

192
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,130
the more stories that we tell,

193
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,910
the more we are aware that different
stories and different people exist.

194
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,750
And until we don't have to make stories
like this where we have to put a mirror

195
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:24,510
up to society and say, Hey, not looking so
good, clean it up, you know, and then we,

196
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:28,300
we, we will continue to make
these films. They're important.

197
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,260
This is how you push humanity forward.
So this is why I did the film.

198
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,730
I felt that it was like a great
responsibility of mine as an artist.

199
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,480
Hmm. And, uh, I guess as a, as a
producer, when I, when I read the script,

200
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,280
um,
I had,

201
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,330
I have three daughters and they're
coming up in this world and you know,

202
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:49,710
it can be, it can be tough. And S, um,

203
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,580
when I saw this example of an out water,

204
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:54,530
that's the message I wanted them to know,

205
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:59,350
to have that hope that look at
this woman and she was fierce and,

206
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,280
and just kept going and
had the courage to do what,

207
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,960
what really no one else,
what no one else did.

208
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:09,350
And I want them to have the hope that
if you, if you put yourself into it,

209
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:12,290
maybe there is hope, hope
for change. I mean, you know,

210
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:16,370
she was known as Rough House Annie,
but in order to reach CP,

211
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,270
she had to step back from being rough
house Annie and found a new way.

212
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,090
She had to find a way to, to,
he says this all the time,

213
00:13:23,091 --> 00:13:25,970
but to his heart and soul and
that's what she, what she did.

214
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,190
And actually that takes a lot more,

215
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:33,080
more courage than it sometimes is to
just kind of, you know, be rough house.

216
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,800
So, um, I, I love this film
because of that. I want,

217
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:40,310
I want them to see that and I want the
world to, you know, to, to see this film.

218
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,050
And by the way, last thing, as a producer,

219
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,900
I love having diversity in
front of and behind the camera.

220
00:13:44,901 --> 00:13:47,370
And we did that in Atlanta and uh,

221
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,750
we had a great crew and it
was a real family on set.

222
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,290
And I think part of the reason is
because of our diversity on set,

223
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,680
even though we were dealing with
a rough subject matter, you know,

224
00:13:57,681 --> 00:14:01,190
we could look around and say, you know
what, w w we can, we can do this together.

225
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,010
Yeah, I mean, for me,
uh, initially was, um,

226
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,720
how, you know, I kept thinking about how
we put labels on each other, you know,

227
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:16,010
and it's weak. We define each other and
like little catch phrases, you know?

228
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:19,340
And without even knowing each other,
I do it too. I watch TV or, you know,

229
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:21,080
I get angry just like everyone else.

230
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,710
And you put up these barriers
right away when you get angry.

231
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:30,020
And I learned to be a better listener.
I think through this process. Um, we,

232
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,920
you know,
as artists,

233
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:35,210
we don't always get to make films that
are entertaining and are relevant or,

234
00:14:35,211 --> 00:14:39,320
and have this kind of, you know,
power message. Sometimes we do.

235
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:43,160
It's okay not to, but
you know, and so, um,

236
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,300
for people, you know, be in
this two dimensional world,

237
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:48,830
we're not really listening to each other.

238
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,400
And we know that when you make a movie,

239
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,840
you know, you get to put, you know,

240
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,190
your people are in a dark room for two
hours just listening and not talking.

241
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,820
That's, uh, that's, you don't get
that opportunity very often. Right.

242
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:05,990
And so if we can do it right and have
people engage and become emotionally

243
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:09,230
invested in,
in the real lives of these characters,

244
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,890
and then we can say something that we
want to say and what they wanted to say,

245
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:17,270
that's a, that's a huge platform to be
able to have, you know, and that, that,

246
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,130
that's why, um, it, it, that's why I
love doing this. I mean, really. Yeah.

247
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:24,020
That's the hope that I felt.
I mean,

248
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:29,180
being fortunate enough to get a chance
to watch the movie and recognize that

249
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,130
maybe yeah,

250
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,820
maybe it's possible to have real severe
differences and somehow get past that.

251
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,600
It seems like from your answers,

252
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:46,280
you all really believe that it's still
possible for people to be diametrically

253
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:51,080
opposed and on very different sides of
the line. But to make a change today.

254
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,220
Absolutely. I mean, God is
very clever. You know, I'm,

255
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,390
I'm not going to preach
to anybody today, but, um,

256
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,990
I mean if you believe in a
higher power, God, I like to say,

257
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,920
um, if there was only supposed to
be one race, all God mighty God,

258
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:13,450
it would only be one race. God
is very clever. We all are here.

259
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:16,540
We look different.
We come from different backgrounds,

260
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,920
paying attention for a reason,
and it's for us to figure it out.

261
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,540
That's our job on life, in life,
to figure it out, to work it out.

262
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,430
And unfortunately we have
this thing called social
media and it has driven a big

263
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:34,150
divide between us because you would think,
yeah,

264
00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:37,970
I can have a great conversation
on Twitter, but it goes
sour each and every time.

265
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:40,090
I just see a bunch of
people dragging each other.

266
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,450
No one's really listening
for understanding. Um,

267
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,290
and it's a world of clickbait real quick.
Soon as you hear one thing,

268
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,070
everybody jumps on and they're
believing and it's like,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

269
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,800
wait, wait. Hey. Just from one phrase,

270
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:57,850
everybody believes this and it's just
like, it's like, it feels like it's chaos,

271
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,550
but it's up to us to get it together and,

272
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,030
and figure it out because
we're here for a reason.

273
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,340
We are, we are, we are. I say Amen to you.

274
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:14,750
Um, you know, I am tasked
today with, you know,

275
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,420
I had a girlfriend say, you guys
going to talk about this amazing film,

276
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:20,240
civil rights and mental health.
How are you going to do this?

277
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,460
This is Teraji this woman does
everything. Yeah, no, yeah,

278
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,630
we're gonna make this work. And
you know, I, I recognize this,

279
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,810
this period for you. You've done
things in this space, you know,

280
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:38,090
our civil rights era for African Americans
with hidden figures and now with the

281
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:42,920
best of enemies. And, and your father
grew up in the civil rights time.

282
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:46,340
Did, did he share his
background stories with you?

283
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:51,790
No, it was rough. I mean,
he's, he, um, one time he had,

284
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,710
I mean my dad who I was, she was
alive to tell his story, but you know,

285
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,920
Vietnam vet, um, uh, come,

286
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:00,990
coming back with mental issues.

287
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:04,770
So he had a couple run ins with
the law that landed him in jail,

288
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,970
in and out of, um, the
mental institution. You know,

289
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:12,450
anytime you go to war, you never
come back the same, you know,

290
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:16,370
but my father was an open book. He
didn't hide anything from me. Um,

291
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:21,170
and he was very open and honest
about his mental state, you know, um,

292
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,960
he was able to really work through it
and overcome it all. But, you know,

293
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:28,800
it was a huge adjustment after coming
back from Vietnam. It took a while,

294
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,560
you know, but, um, I like again, I mean,

295
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,850
you can't grow if you sweep
everything under the carpet.

296
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,630
And that's my pain for the
African American community.

297
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:45,480
We have generational trauma that we don't
deal with and we're walking around as

298
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:50,430
if everything is okay and it's
not, we're walking around of, of,

299
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:51,900
of generations of,
of,

300
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,130
of issues and trauma swept under the
carpet and we're standing on top of it as

301
00:18:56,131 --> 00:19:00,780
if everything's fine. Yeah, you're
right. And it's, it's generational.

302
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,490
It's impacted some things we don't
even know are in effect a affecting us

303
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:09,090
because it's so embedded in us, we
don't even know. Yeah. And I mean,

304
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,200
and outside of your artist's
career, I mean, last year
you opened up a foundation.

305
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,610
Yeah. And your father's name [inaudible].
Can you tell us about its mission?

306
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,920
The mission is to, to, um,

307
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:25,850
work with the recidivism and prison
systems. Um, because no, you know,

308
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,390
you know, the prison system is not
really a place for reform or to,

309
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,253
uh,

310
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,820
get your life together and be
implemented back out into society.

311
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,370
A changed person.
It's really nice to keep you there.

312
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,190
And it's unfortunate
because a lot of people,

313
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:45,780
they are having mental issues and they
shouldn't even be in cages. Um, and then,

314
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:47,070
you know,
we have to,

315
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,480
I said I was a substitute teacher
before I booked baby boy and became a,

316
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,670
a a an act, an actress, you know, that
was my gig and I mean for, I made it,

317
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,020
you know,
uh,

318
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:03,050
but I took it very seriously and I chose
to work with special education children

319
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,310
and in my mind, I thought
that meant a disabled children
in wheelchairs, you know,

320
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:10,320
that can't eat or dress themselves.

321
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:15,321
And I get sent to Crenshaw and I get him
in a classroom with all black boys who

322
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:21,030
are labeled special Ed. But nothing's
wrong with them. They can walk,

323
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:25,590
they can talk, you know, they smart
out the mouth and I tell them,

324
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:29,880
let's start our work and they do
this. I'm special Ed. I can't do that.

325
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,900
So just because they have this label,

326
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:39,300
they already have a low expectation of
themselves and they believe it and it

327
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:42,630
broke my heart. So then, you know,

328
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,380
that's stood. I carry that with me for
so many years and all of this success.

329
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:51,640
And so when I came to launch
this foundation and I was like,

330
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:56,350
we need counselors, not just
counselors, but professional therapist,

331
00:20:56,351 --> 00:21:00,820
psychiatrist that can go into these
schools and recognize that these children

332
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:05,560
are coming from traumatic experiences at
home and we're expecting them to learn.

333
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,110
Another thing that ha that I've
been carrying for years. Uh,

334
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,500
when I went to this acts, same school, um,

335
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,640
the children are taken me down a hall
and they're like, Ms. Henson, look,

336
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,750
it was a shoot out here last night
and they showed me the bullets and the

337
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:22,870
bullets and the wall. And I'm like,
and they're walking around like,

338
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:25,960
this is normal. So you
see what I mean? This is,

339
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,070
we're expecting these
children to come home from,

340
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:33,520
God knows these experiences they're
having at home trauma and they're

341
00:21:33,521 --> 00:21:35,920
traumatized trying to
come to school and learn.

342
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,530
And then when they don't focus in class,

343
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,200
we slap a label on them
and say they're special Ed.

344
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,540
But we don't try to understand why.

345
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,820
When I started talking to these
young boys, one was found,

346
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,810
um,
roaming around by the train tracks,

347
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,840
which is in the backyard of the school
by the way, which is another issue,

348
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,780
trying to keep them, you know, a focus.

349
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,930
Then they got a train running through
the backyard every day that you know,

350
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,760
a whole lot of issues.
But anyway,

351
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,570
he was roaming around the train tracks.

352
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:09,970
He got picked up for
shoplifting at the seven 11.

353
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,700
He was trying to get something to eat
because his mother was on drugs and his

354
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:15,730
father was in prison.
How does that make you special ed?

355
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,680
You can still learn.
You just have trauma at home.

356
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,200
So we need to implement a
psychiatrist and, and who are in,

357
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:29,380
in these schools who can recognize the
trauma and give these children the proper

358
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,240
care that they need as opposed to just
labeling them special ed and getting them

359
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:37,060
ready for the prison system.
So we're dealing with that.

360
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:41,290
And we're also giving away scholarships
to young African American children

361
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:44,080
because see, we don't talk about it
at home is taboo in our community.

362
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:48,420
So a lot of times our kids don't even
know that this is a field to study it.

363
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:51,310
This is something I can even go into
because we're not even talking about it at

364
00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:54,970
home.
So we need more African American and not,

365
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,830
it's not even about a color
because I see therapists, you know,

366
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,240
I need it and it's okay.

367
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,340
I'll be the first one to tell you
it's okay to not be okay. But, um,

368
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:11,560
it's not even about a color is
cultural competency. So if you,

369
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,440
I can, I can understand
another, uh, cultures, uh,

370
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,390
problems if I take the time to.
But see,

371
00:23:19,391 --> 00:23:23,380
a lot of times you have these therapists
who are coming from other countries or,

372
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,370
and they just want the car to
come here and practice. So again,

373
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:31,690
you have these people in these positions
that really don't even want to be there.

374
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,400
So it's a lot to, it's a lot to
cover, but at least we're talking now.

375
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,910
At least we're talking. Yeah. Thank
you for helping that conversation.

376
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,590
You're wondering why and that
we're, or you're not. Well,

377
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:45,990
you know what I wanted to Razi
to play her. Exactly. Call

378
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,540
me the cookie lady cookie
lady. Go and play me.

379
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,860
Yeah. This, this is, this is a
modern civil rights issue, you know,

380
00:23:56,861 --> 00:23:59,990
in communities now. Um, the,

381
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:04,690
the difference in a time of crisis
from an appropriate training, you know,

382
00:24:04,691 --> 00:24:05,740
deescalation,

383
00:24:05,741 --> 00:24:09,130
we have this now with officers to
recognize the difference in violence and

384
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:11,980
mental health. It's
something that, you know,

385
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,180
we say civil rights era but were
still living in this right now and,

386
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:18,880
and mental health isn't,
you know,

387
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:23,200
something that's just stigmatized in the
African American community, you know,

388
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:26,980
across countries, communities, classes,

389
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:32,080
there are stigmas associated with
talking about it, addressing it, um,

390
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,180
sharing that it's okay to
be okay. Um, for you all,

391
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,120
I mean, before or after this film,
have you ever had to confront these,

392
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:46,330
these stigmas around mental health,
around needing to get help,

393
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,320
encouraging someone to get help and have,
how do you all address it?

394
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,970
I, my sister went through
a terrible divorce and she,

395
00:24:53,971 --> 00:24:55,670
she actually went through
something for a while.

396
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:58,550
There was the first time in our family
that we had to deal with that and you

397
00:24:58,551 --> 00:25:01,490
know, my parents are from the old
school, you know, east coast. You know,

398
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:06,320
I grew up in suburbs kind of
sheltered and um, you know,

399
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:09,500
they didn't really want to talk
about it and I, you know, I was like,

400
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:12,530
what do you mean it's okay, we can talk,
but this wasn't that long ago, you know,

401
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:17,060
and everything's fine. But
it was, um, you know, uh,

402
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,910
there was a stigma, you know,
if for us it was, you know,

403
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,910
everything was okay.
Don't talk about,

404
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:25,460
well that's no good because
then we're not asking for help.

405
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,180
It's okay to ask for help. And I
think that's the, that's where the,

406
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,690
any kind of stigma hurts.
It's that you don't ask for help.

407
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,380
Asking for help was everything
we see. I mean, we've had what,

408
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,960
a couple of high profile suicides lately,
you know,

409
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,870
just the last couple of weeks it's been
horrible. And that's trauma and tries.

410
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:43,610
She's talking about trauma,
you know,

411
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:46,360
our brains are so fragile or
emotions are fragile. There's,

412
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,370
there's trauma we don't really know about.
It's not just coming home from war,

413
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:53,450
it's not, you know what I mean? And so I,
you know, I can't begin to understand it,

414
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,330
but I do know that when
you get rid of stigma,

415
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,550
people will ask for help, you know?
And, and as a father, I have two boys,

416
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:04,220
one's here at Berkeley, and I
tell him all the time, you know,

417
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,490
if it's okay to ask me if anything is
the matter, you know what I mean? Don't,

418
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,780
don't be too strong or don't try
to be, you know, so is is is,

419
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,630
I'm sorry this is something that
gets under my skin and, and, and,

420
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,640
and so many people need this help but
it just seems like it's set up and

421
00:26:22,131 --> 00:26:26,570
designed to make it as
difficult as possible for you
to get the hell I'm talking

422
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:29,630
even within the Sag insurance.
That's something I'm ready to tackle.

423
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:34,631
Like why is it that I can't use my
insurance to pay for my psychiatrist?

424
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,390
Yeah.
Wow.

425
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,880
Yeah. My psychiatrist broke that
down to me. She was like, you know,

426
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,340
you have this amazing insurance program,

427
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:57,330
Blue Cross Blue Shield
Blue Shield does cover me,

428
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:02,610
but for whatever reasons I'm outside
of network for Sag. Go figure.

429
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,530
Like what are we doing here?

430
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:11,410
We are fortunate and blessed to have you
all a few tackling these issues on the

431
00:27:11,691 --> 00:27:16,040
screen off of the screen. Thank
you for being here. This, you know,

432
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:20,930
we could talk about this for a while
obviously, but you know, for our audience,

433
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,880
for, for all of the audiences out there,
if I could ask each of you to, you know,

434
00:27:25,881 --> 00:27:27,930
as a final question,
uh,

435
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,140
what do you want people to take away
from this film? I want people to see you,

436
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:38,000
the film and you know, you know,
be inspired, you know, be inspired,

437
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,200
be inspired to look at your neighbor.
I think we were talking before about,

438
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:45,080
you know, Twitter wars and
whatever, but you know,

439
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:48,770
if you really have to look the other
person in the eye and really have a

440
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:52,880
conversation, you know, maybe there's
something we can do with that. Um,

441
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:55,880
and that's what I hope
people are inspired by,

442
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:00,300
by Ann and what she was able
to do. Um, and my s you know,

443
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,700
by the transformation that
CP made and have hope that,

444
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,440
that maybe we can,

445
00:28:06,441 --> 00:28:10,820
we can come out of this and
the next generation is left
a little better off then.

446
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,540
And then ours is right now. I mean,
honestly, I'm looking out at your,

447
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,600
at your audience here and
it's, it's wonderful to see. I,

448
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:22,620
when I started working corporate, it did
not look like this. No, we're youtube.

449
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:26,420
But you said you feel proud on the
stage to have the back, you know,

450
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:30,590
behind the scenes. This is us, this
is behind the scenes and we're proud.

451
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:33,860
A lot of people put in a lot of
work. Graduation is, I, I've,

452
00:28:33,861 --> 00:28:37,480
I've worked corporate jobs. This
doesn't look like this. And you know,

453
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,890
it's just so, so that's what I, that's,

454
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,790
I hope that this is possible because
of that. She doesn't even know this,

455
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:46,400
but when I came to the country,
I didn't speak English,

456
00:28:46,401 --> 00:28:49,850
so I got put in special ed and then they,
and then I was like,

457
00:28:49,851 --> 00:28:52,860
I just didn't speak the language.
Just didn't, then I had to get tests.

458
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,560
There's nothing wrong with me, you
know, just, just teach me English

459
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,260
is crazy.
They will,

460
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,960
you ready for the prison

461
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,330
bag that she's in the movie business?

462
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,420
For me it's the same thing. Like there's
so many things talk about this story,

463
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:19,250
right? We can talk about
it all day, like you said.

464
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:24,050
But really what worked
here was a charette, right?

465
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,880
And um, and so what Dominique
was saying, when you,

466
00:29:28,881 --> 00:29:31,880
when you sit in front of someone,
even if you start arguing,

467
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,240
you're not going to argue forever. You
really let down your defenses when you,

468
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:36,890
you're not as aggressive when you,
you know,

469
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,920
you see people in road rage videos now,

470
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:42,590
which I've watched a lot on youtube
cause it's really fun. Uh, but,

471
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,740
but I've gone through
these really me. So, uh,

472
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,540
you see what people say to each other
when they're behind that the glass,

473
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:51,850
you know what I mean?
But you stand up and you walk to someone,

474
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:54,340
you're not going to say those things. You
know what I mean? Some people I guess,

475
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:58,510
but you know, and so you sit down and
you start talking to people and oh,

476
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:00,670
you have children. Oh
you like this. And Oh,

477
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:02,320
you went to school here
and all you grew up here,

478
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,920
he started forgetting your differences.
And you might still have them,

479
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,770
but you can talk about it respectfully.
You can find common ground.

480
00:30:08,771 --> 00:30:12,640
It's not brain surgery. It might be
brain surgery to get us all together.

481
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:17,350
But once you're there, you let that
and you let down your veneer, you know,

482
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:20,770
and you just start seeing each other as
human beings. It's just what happens.

483
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,550
So when I was encouraged,
you know,

484
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:26,770
and we were just coming out on April
5th I think we will all be encouraged.

485
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:29,920
Thank you. Thank you for the movie.
Thank you for your foundation.

486
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,950
Thank you for this time today.
Thank you for having us,

487
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:33,870
Robin.

488
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:38,870
[inaudible].
