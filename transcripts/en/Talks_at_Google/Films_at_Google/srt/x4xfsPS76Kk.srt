00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,990
Hi everyone.
Welcome to talks at Google today.

2
00:00:04,991 --> 00:00:09,220
It is my pleasure to welcome a Jeremy's
Sonia and Anton Yelchin Burt Green Room.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,203
Let's give a round of applause.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,130
Great to be here.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,060
Could you give us a brief
overview of what the film's about?

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,023
Sure.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,090
It is a punk rock siege thriller is set
in the backstage green room of a concert

8
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:33,081
venue during a live concert and basically
an out of town band as a witness,

9
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:38,361
the aftermath of a backstage murder
and the club happens to be run by Nazi

10
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:43,260
skinheads and so they barricade
themselves in and tries to private night.

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,160
That's good summary. Uh,
so this is, I mean it's,

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,060
it's a very claustrophobic
siege, Phil. Um, you know,

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,480
it's very sort of limited
in the scope of where you,

14
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,820
was that always the intention
with it or did you ever,

15
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,880
were you tempted to go
outside the club with it?

16
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,330
Oh, I wanted to, I wanted to, but no,

17
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:07,331
I mean this scenario demanded that we
say in that pressure cooker scenario,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,750
um,

19
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,750
my first film murder party
actually takes place in a enclosed,

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,560
actually it's a Brooklyn
warehouse and it's a, it's an,

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,290
it's an McCobb art party gone wrong.

22
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,270
And it's similar in tone
as far as like an overnight

23
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,540
sort of blood fests,
but that's more of a Gonzo horror comedy.

24
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,510
The, the key there is when
you're an independent filmmaker,

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,040
you're told do something in a single
location that'd be cheaper. Um,

26
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,770
it's just people talking in
a room. And for me, you know,

27
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,300
my attraction towards cinema is,
is visual.

28
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,970
And so I found that very,
uh, suppress. I was just,

29
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,520
I was just like, this is terrible.
All I do is listen to people talk.

30
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:58,480
It's not my thing. Um,
so my next film I do,

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,440
I've got out in the open road and explored
highways and forests and got a lot of

32
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:05,880
production value to that. And
then for green room, it just,

33
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:09,200
the scenario demanded that I promised
I'd never go back into that sort of

34
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:13,040
scenario, but I did. But this time I
had, I knew what I was getting into.

35
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,400
So I think we achieved a
certain level of craft. Yeah.

36
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,340
Um, you said that you said you're tracking
film is visual and this is one of your

37
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,770
first movie that you aren't the
cinematographer on. Correct.

38
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,720
What was it like sort of taking,

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,540
not necessarily step back is obviously
you're going to be very involved in the

40
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:31,180
visual aesthetic of it, but what
was that experience like? Yeah,

41
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,090
that was a big thing is that knowing
going into this is an ensemble performance

42
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:41,091
piece and there's pit bulls and shotguns
and gunfights and mayhem all throughout

43
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,820
the film that my attention
had to be elsewhere.

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,240
But if I was looking through the eye
piece of the camera and how I get this

45
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:49,910
tunnel vision,
that was blue ruin,

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,770
it was very quiet and almost
wordless for most of the film.

47
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:58,200
Green Room is just nonstop like
throttling and the emotional charge of the

48
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:00,280
characters had to be really

49
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,270
accounted for. And, and I,
I leaned heavily on Anton
and the whole cast for that.

50
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,170
Um,

51
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,800
but I definitely had to oversee many
departments and having a sim or target for

52
00:03:09,801 --> 00:03:11,650
was actually a great
weight off my shoulders.

53
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,190
So Anton,
how did you get involved in the project?

54
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,980
Uh, in a pretty, pretty
standard way. I think I just, I,

55
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,570
I got the script and I read it
and I skyped with Jeremy and a,

56
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,620
I then ended up meeting
with him a little later,

57
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,950
actually a little bit later
actually. And then a, yeah, pretty,

58
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:32,310
pretty standard trajectory,
honestly. Uh, not,

59
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:35,250
nothing too exciting to relay here.
Okay.

60
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,040
I found the script in the street,
the street that I read through a mate,

61
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,420
that's all Jeremy was waiting on
the other side. What's it Michelle?

62
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,260
Michelle's going to say a
store man room to then drag it,

63
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,080
uh,

64
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,630
you up with you on that because experience
and like punk has been an influence

65
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:57,940
on your lives. Did that, did you know
that about Anton when you cast him or

66
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,943
us?
No,

67
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,440
I think that I have a
history and so to see,

68
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:08,390
and anytime I would love to tell
you about his band, Jeremy. Okay.

69
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:12,980
So my band name,
it was with my best buddies.

70
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:16,310
So like I love those guys.
So I've relayed to them over the years,

71
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:21,290
may times my dissatisfaction with
the name. But that being said,

72
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:25,040
I had this band and we had a great time
just being a really shitty punk band.

73
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,400
And we played a lot of gigs,
like the one in the,

74
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,720
in the film where, uh,
you played a six people.

75
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,400
Um,
uh,

76
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:37,910
and ironically I found out we're doing
our press day at the viper room tomorrow

77
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:42,890
in La and that's where we
would play Sundays at midnight.
So Sundays at midnight.

78
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,310
That's not like peak hour for a
show, you know. Uh, but we, we,

79
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,680
we had such a good time and I
think when I met Jeremy, um,

80
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,730
obviously it wasn't about like
I, yeah, I'd been in a bad mood.

81
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,400
It's about other things when you're
signing on for a film, I think.

82
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,390
But the feeling that you have
playing with your friends,

83
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:05,990
your best friends and sharing those times,

84
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:10,520
like if you're going on the road
to play or you're just playing,

85
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,180
just bonding over playing for six people.

86
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:19,181
And all of you feeling so low that
the six people having clap once,

87
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:24,500
um, is the best feeling in a way because
only you and your friends share that.

88
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:29,501
And that's kind of for me what was so
touching about this film is like pat and

89
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:31,730
his friends are all put in jeopardy,

90
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:36,320
but for pat he's seeing the fact that
his best friends are in jeopardy.

91
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,280
That to me was kind of the,
the heart and soul of the piece.

92
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:42,740
But like really what's touching that
you experience when you're playing with

93
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:43,700
your friends,
you know,

94
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,320
speaking of your friends,
there's also,

95
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,010
this is actually a character that we
meet that isn't a member of the band is,

96
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,310
is imaging boots character,
right? Cause this,

97
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,500
but you don't know who or what she is
and she emerges from the shadows and we

98
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,260
don't find out a lot about her even
through the course of the film. Um,

99
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,030
could you talk about her
sort of evolution is,

100
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,900
I feel like she's like
a hero at the end of it.

101
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,990
It was very important for me to have
a strong female character. And I like,

102
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,430
I like playing with the fact that she
starts as the girlfriend of the victim,

103
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,840
you know, and she's trapped in the
room with this band and then she,

104
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,820
we didn't even give her closeups
images of boots. Yeah. Whatever you're,

105
00:06:23,821 --> 00:06:26,050
that you're in the background.
We cut off her frame, you know,

106
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:29,710
she'd be out of half out of frame,
kind of disregard her as a character,

107
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,970
but she kind of earns her way in to the
inner circle and it's really fun to see

108
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:37,420
that dynamic happened where, you
know, not to give any spoilers away,

109
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:41,560
but she does emerge as a central character
and she pretty much takes over and

110
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:42,394
kicks ass.

111
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,100
And you've worked with her before on
fight night, right? Uh, yeah. Sorry.

112
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:50,420
I was just like trying to negotiate all
this while Jeremy was so many layers.

113
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,520
Um, yeah, I was

114
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,640
happy to be able to work with him again.

115
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:58,710
I have so much respect for her
and so inspired by her. Um,

116
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,670
and the great thing is,
is,

117
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,900
is our work in fright night that has
literally nothing to do with this film.

118
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,101
I mean,

119
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:09,920
it was just like totally
different characters in a
totally different film and I

120
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:13,970
was just happy to be on set
with her again. It's always
nice to see your friends.

121
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,290
Uh, outer work murdered, murdered.

122
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,460
That's the kind of guy I say.
That's why I was casting this film.

123
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,030
My blood lust called hearted
willingness to throw. Your friends

124
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,560
are going to see a film
for you or somebody doesn't
get murdered or stabbed or

125
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,340
you know, if you dig deep,
there's, I kind of found

126
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:39,190
my, my way doing these genre
films, but um, I have a short film,

127
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,900
2004 called crabwalk.
It's a melancholy comedy.

128
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,540
Who would have thought? Um,
and yes, I will eventually
explore a lower body count,

129
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,500
but I think I'm actually getting
these in before I get too soft.

130
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,170
I'm a father of three very,

131
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,280
very fulfilling life at
home surrounded by love.

132
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,690
But these are the films that I loved
growing up and I'm trying to maintain that

133
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:06,170
connection long enough to, to, to,

134
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,690
to do them myself before it become
one of those guys that makes,

135
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,210
I don't know,
animated films for my kids.

136
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,230
He's standing around with them.
I know there's,

137
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,550
there's a lot of sort of violence and
viscera, but it didn't feel gratuitous,

138
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,820
which I mean that as a compliment.
Like it was like, yeah,

139
00:08:23,821 --> 00:08:26,100
this is necessary because
this is the situation.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,030
How did you negotiate that
kind of fine line between like,

141
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:33,810
oh is a slasher girls horror horror film?
And like this is horrifying.

142
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,150
It's,

143
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:40,150
it's to ratchet up intensity and all the
violence has a very articulate purpose

144
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,450
within the movie.
Um,

145
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,530
and sometimes it is like full frontal
Gore and it's a rub your face in it.

146
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,780
There's a transition in the film,

147
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:55,290
one of the key characters where she
becomes a killer and she is reluctant.

148
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,960
It's not like, again, there's no blood
loss to it. It's just like a very,

149
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,750
this is a war movie.
There's, there's two sides,

150
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,080
one very singular goal on one side and
then just pure survival on the other.

151
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,860
But for the kids and the punk rock
band to sort of acclimate to their new

152
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:14,670
environment and a step up and
to mount some kind of revolt,

153
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,750
they have to become killers. And
that's brutal. It's not just high five,

154
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:22,080
let's kill the bad guys.
It's, it's, it's holy smokes,

155
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:25,240
we're in far too deep and this
is not gonna end well. Um,

156
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,610
and sometimes you get a little gratuitous
close up if it's a non fatal wound,

157
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,800
but there is one in particular is
coming to mind that I am thinking of.

158
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:37,470
We could give a high five if you had no,
no, it's brutal. But the key is that,

159
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,333
that it's um,

160
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,660
it's coupled with an emotional component
and there is reverence for all the

161
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:47,150
characters. That's what sets it apart,
I hope is that either even like the,

162
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:51,910
the quote unquote bad guys, like when
there is a life lost, you feel it and it,

163
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,270
it's, it's, the intensity is real and the,

164
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:57,470
and the loss is real and
it's not supposed to wear.

165
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,830
There's a couple of high five moments
in the movie had pepper those in just so

166
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,630
it's satisfying narratively.

167
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,130
Um, speaking of the bad guys,
your villain is it never,

168
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,140
he did Patrick Stewart Moore. Feminine
and a good way. He was so scary.

169
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:14,680
Um,

170
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,680
so what was sort of having him as your
villain like onset just do the whole

171
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:20,914
process?

172
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,640
Well, you know, I think when,

173
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:27,750
whenever someone that is
accomplished as much as,

174
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:31,700
as Patrick has a, Patrick Stewart
has, when Sir Patrick Stewart Matrix,

175
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,350
when when you're on set with
someone like that, you're,

176
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:36,150
you're really fortunate because

177
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,830
the way that that man conducts
himself with everyone is incredibly,

178
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:48,060
I guess honorable is a good way to put it,
is so much respect for everyone.

179
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,040
And it goes without saying
it, you know, his career on,

180
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,480
on stage and screen it is immense
and he's incredibly accomplished.

181
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:59,430
But it's very important to see how human
beings that have achieved a lot behave

182
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:03,140
with everyone on set.
And that's my biggest takeaway is,

183
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:07,860
is seeing someone that is so
respectful, so lovely. Um,

184
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,650
and so kind with everyone.
And beyond that, uh,

185
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,080
I didn't talk to him very much because
he was trying to kill me. Um, but, uh,

186
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,340
uh, yeah, it's, it's really,
it's inspiring. You just
want to go out and be like,

187
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:20,641
all right,

188
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:25,230
well if I ever come anywhere close to
or even half as close to what he's done,

189
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:29,040
I just as a human being, these are lessons
that we have to learn along the way.

190
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,700
We make movies all together.
You know, it doesn't matter.

191
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,850
All of us are together in this sort of
shit show trying to make a film and we

192
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:39,810
all have to be respectful to one another
and that's like the most important

193
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:41,970
human part of making films I think.

194
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,940
I mean even as an antagonist,

195
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:48,490
I feel like he's actually in the
beginning at least he's a very sort of

196
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,080
respectful and it's all,

197
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,160
it feels sort of transactional and like
let's all be calm about this even though

198
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:57,080
the stakes are terrifying.
Yeah,

199
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,440
we're on record is pet.

200
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,090
This is Patrick Stewart's most quiet
performance on stage or a screen and his

201
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:08,950
entire career decibel wise or they can
literally Zach quiet and we miked him

202
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:13,951
clothes and the key there was like he
has such presence and authority that the

203
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:19,540
onetime he does sort of lose his cool
and yell at one of his underlings played

204
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:23,440
by Megan Blair in my, my good buddy.
Um, he does a face palm, you know,

205
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:28,420
it's really violent and impulsive and
he takes a breath and he apologizes and

206
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:31,900
then it carries on. And if we, other
than that he doesn't raise his voice.

207
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:36,230
I think it's all like this implied power
and like when he steps on a on scene,

208
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,170
he does not have to have monologues or,

209
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,940
or do anything that's like
trying too hard to be profound.

210
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:46,510
He's just this quiet authority
figure and it's creepy as hell.

211
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,770
Maybe. I noticed this part
of the film in particular,

212
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:51,650
just because this is Google and
we work at David, but I was like,

213
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,260
he found the one group
that there's a legitimate,

214
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:57,680
like I believe you when there's a reason
for them not being on social media and

215
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,990
people not knowing where they are.
Like yeah,

216
00:12:59,991 --> 00:13:02,030
we don't post about who
we are and where we are.

217
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,160
And that kind of hurts
them in this scenario.

218
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,930
But was that just sort of an added
bonus, um, as apartment or, we did,

219
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:10,250
it was that sort of, part of it was
one of the things like, you know,

220
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,490
the Internet is cool, it's good, thanks.

221
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,010
You know,
how it affected music,

222
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:20,460
how it affected the
hardcore scene is terrible.

223
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,680
And it's because you no longer
have to show up to places.

224
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,100
You know, there's still vibrant
scenes in pockets throughout.

225
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,890
But like when I was in the
hardcore scene in the 1990s,

226
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,300
it was all about being there and
you couldn't click on anything.

227
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,470
You couldn't stream anything.
Um, it was very tactile and,

228
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:42,560
and that's what I was there for.

229
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,420
I was not like a guru with
a huge vinyl collection.

230
00:13:45,421 --> 00:13:48,060
I can't drop a thousand names,
but I remember just being there,

231
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:51,200
it just sort of defined my youth.
Um,

232
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,890
and the ain't rights are this band trying
to hold on to that dream and that sort

233
00:13:55,891 --> 00:14:00,010
of Pat's carry the character pad
men just said is to texture. Um,

234
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,510
so they refuse to go virtual,
um,

235
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,030
and talk about you have to show up,
you've got to be there.

236
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:08,460
And of course they pay the price,

237
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,570
but now the twist is because
greenery was coming out.

238
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,460
There's a lot of talk about hardcore
again and h one divorce put out this green

239
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:20,580
room radio, like all these gurus
talking about the old days.

240
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,880
That's kind of fun where the thesis
of my film might be proven wrong.

241
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,080
Maybe the Internet's awesome
because now we're talking about

242
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,070
these hardcore bands from the 809 is
that I grew up with and it's really fun.

243
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,690
[inaudible] going to Oregon.

244
00:14:34,691 --> 00:14:38,230
You can play the viper room
again if we're going to play.

245
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,600
We played the viper room at midnight. You
guys can catch us there. And he saw this

246
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,990
sort of speaking of the Internet,
its effect on your career. You,

247
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,100
you are someone who definitely sort of
hits you've built your career on your own,

248
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,220
was very, you know, I, I think when you
funded murder party on your own and,

249
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:00,440
and it's just sort of blue
ruin and blew own buddy,

250
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,460
what do you think of sort of
this phenomenon of like how,

251
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:06,220
how do you think it would
have been different if you
were, um, sort of becoming,

252
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:09,540
coming into your own as a filmmaker
now when it says the age of Youtube and

253
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,600
people are being discovered online or
people are sell funding crowdfunding?

254
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,530
I used that for blue ruin too.
I use everything.

255
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,660
Yeah, whatever I could
get. But I think, um,

256
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,810
I felt alone without access.

257
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:30,000
I tried to make movies mostly of my
high school friends and murder party,

258
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,530
got distribution,

259
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:36,160
which is a huge coup for an unknown film
with unknown filmmakers behind it. Um,

260
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,210
and then for blue ruin, you know,
I started to acclimate, you know,

261
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,680
digital cameras were getting way better.

262
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:47,610
I was using these small DSLR
type cameras to make that movie.

263
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,640
Um,
and it wasn't until promoting that Phil,

264
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:55,640
I mean we got you submitted
a old fashioned DVD copy
to directors' fortnight and

265
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:59,430
can, and, and that was where everything
shifted. We got into that festival,

266
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,620
played on the world stage, like the most
prestigious festival in the world. Um,

267
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:09,330
but when we marketed blue ruin,
I saw the power of social media.

268
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,120
I it caught fire on Twitter.
They broke, you know,

269
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:16,190
the top 10 on iTunes and overall and just,
uh,

270
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,160
I'm still on Twitter because
of that. So maybe, maybe I'll,

271
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:22,830
I'll retreat later,
but I'm loving it.

272
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:25,200
And just being part of
this tour right now,

273
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:29,430
like just seeing my film reflected
in the eyes of audience members,

274
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:30,660
it's like what I,
what I love.

275
00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:34,500
And you remember why you make films
because you get so close to it over the

276
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:38,790
course of the two years making it,
you kind of can't see it for what it is.

277
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:39,624
And then when people,

278
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,460
you just ask them for 94 minutes to
come and survive this insane punk rock

279
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,030
thriller.

280
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,900
And then they do and you high five and
then you remember why you make them in

281
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:49,734
the first place.

282
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,210
Which of the characters do you think
each of you or it's not as like in this

283
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:58,740
film, I'm like Reese
obviously. Um, so aggro

284
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,360
could you take it down and really try?

285
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,590
I might just flip this table over here.

286
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,020
I'm a split between it actually.

287
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,120
Reece and pat pretty much was
actually a real tiger is a real Sam.

288
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,780
It was a real tad based on people.
But,

289
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:22,781
but I think I definitely
pad is the expendable basis.

290
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,710
That's how I felt in the
hardcore scene. Ouch. No,

291
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,250
this has been hammered home
quite a bit over the course.

292
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:32,670
Well,

293
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,190
in a while ago I was about
15 pounds heavier with,

294
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,720
with muscle and worked out and
I was actually amongst my crew,

295
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,100
the Reese type character. I'm
not anymore, but I felt like pat.

296
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,000
Um, but yeah, it is.

297
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:51,400
A lot of this is based on my experiences
and mostly that of my friends. Like I,

298
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,050
we had hardcore bands in Virginia.
We'd go to DC for shows,

299
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:59,520
but my buddies were the
talented musicians. I just
yelled into the microphone.

300
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,210
Um,
and some of their songs actually his,

301
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:04,980
the fictional band and greener in place,

302
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:08,470
the songs that I heard in high school
written by my buddies. So it's,

303
00:18:08,471 --> 00:18:10,350
it's really coming full circle.
And this is a way,

304
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,690
this whole film was an
archive of my youth,

305
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:17,691
like making crazy genre films and being
in punk rock bands and hardcore shows

306
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,653
and just like,

307
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,450
it's a way to archive that cause
I'm looks so soft and lame.

308
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,590
I want to just a little bit of street
cred and green room I hope gives me a

309
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:29,424
little bit.

310
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,750
Okay. Absolutely. Um, what's, what's,

311
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,450
I think my last question is
what's something you hope
people take away from this

312
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:36,284
film?

313
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:42,090
The elation of surviving a purely
like physical experience that that's,

314
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,510
you know, it's, it's fiction and
it's two dimensional on a screen,

315
00:18:46,511 --> 00:18:51,070
but I want the experience to be real
and so far so good. It's really,

316
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,620
um, there's, if you watched
it a second or third time,

317
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:58,330
there's all kinds of layers of political
commentary and he can go on about the

318
00:18:58,331 --> 00:19:01,900
intellectual nature of this movie.
But I want that visceral experience.

319
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:03,820
And I think it's what's lacking in cinema.

320
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,930
Even when we get to big spectacle
and we can explode worlds,

321
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:10,600
and I don't really feel much.

322
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,780
And Green Room is this hyperintense
intimate action movie that is grounded not

323
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:21,330
only by authenticity and it has its
fair share of violence and mayhem,

324
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,750
but it's the actors.

325
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:27,670
It's the performances that makes it
drives home the reality and that that

326
00:19:27,671 --> 00:19:32,290
terrifying intensity that you feel like
you are with the band and the rug has

327
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,600
been pulled out from under you and you
have no idea where it's going to go.

328
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,550
I mean, I, I feel like that's the
director's statement right there.

329
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:41,340
So I don't really know what
I can add to that. Well,

330
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,180
what do you want them to take away?
Just how sick I am playing bass. Yeah,

331
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,960
there you go. But don't forget that
you're expendable. Okay. Thanks Ben.

332
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,520
Thank you both so much for joining
us today. Cause the green room,

333
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:54,820
you.
