1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,420
Please round of applause.

2
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:08,610
Welcome to the stage director
and star of a quiet place.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,700
John Krasinski.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,080
I'll use all the stairs.
Thank you. Hey everybody.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,130
Hello.
What's up?

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,440
These are huge thing.

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:28,040
I know the time now I'm blinded,
but I know the time.

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,810
The last thing I ever saw was the time.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,980
So, so many ways that that could tie
into what we're going to talk about.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,100
It's the best way to tie it all in. Yeah,
no, it's hopefully, thanks so much guys.

11
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:40,360
That was great.
Appreciate it.

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,940
So this is really new ground,
uh,

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,570
Standard John Rhe creature feature,
pretty different.

14
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:54,190
Take on things that you've done in the
past. What do you mean talking about it?

15
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:56,080
That's the funniest movie of the year,
guys.

16
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:57,610
I don't know if you're going to love it,

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,530
but then also taking on the directorial
role, uh, cowriting creditors,

18
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:06,400
co-writer, but more really rewriting the
screenplay to get it to take place. Uh,

19
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,970
how was it for you to broach
this genre? It was, um,

20
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,400
it was really scary, but it was really,
uh, exciting too. I mean, for me, um,

21
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,930
it's, it's the weirdest thing. I actually,
nothing will ever top the office. Right?

22
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:22,480
So it's this thing that was the
first experience I ever had.

23
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:26,110
It gave me all this opportunity
and I just felt, if I'm honest,

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,130
I just felt like I needed to earn it
and I needed to deserve that amazing

25
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:30,641
opportunity.

26
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:34,360
So I tried to go out and do all these
new different things to push it because I

27
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,910
know all my friends that came up
with me would do the same thing.

28
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,210
That's really what it comes down
to. And so for me, it's just about,

29
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:43,120
and I'm so lucky to have this opportunity
to say this because some people,

30
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:43,961
most people can't,

31
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:48,640
but I just looked for the stuff
that really hits me and moves me.

32
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,610
And so it seems really
weird from that poster.

33
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,120
But this is truly a love letter to my
kids because this whole movie is about

34
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:57,970
parenting. And what would you do for
your kids to protect them? And again,

35
00:01:57,971 --> 00:02:02,290
I know that poster does not say that,
but when you see the movie,

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,190
I read the original script by Beckon
Woods and the idea is so great. I was,

37
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,500
I have never been into horror ever.

38
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,430
Like I was so scared as a kid of horror
movies that I've never really watched a

39
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:15,820
lot of horror movies.
And so when I was sent the script,

40
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:19,300
I definitely thought there's no way I'm
doing this. And then I read the, uh,

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,200
the idea of a family that
has to remain quiet. Um,

42
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,040
and you have to figure out why
it was such a compelling idea.

43
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,830
And then when I started to read it,
it was just all about family.

44
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:30,730
It was about this,

45
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,490
these parents trying to do
everything they could for their kid.

46
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,580
And the truth is we had just had our
second daughter three weeks before I read

47
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:39,760
the script. Listen, I cry at
anything. It doesn't really,

48
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,370
not that much of a compliment
that I cried reading the script,

49
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,560
but I was a wide open,
you know,

50
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:48,820
vessel of emotion and tension and I was
actually living through what this family

51
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:51,400
goes through, not the
creatures part, but you know,

52
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:55,150
trying to keep your kids safe and alive
and are you a good enough person to be

53
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:57,160
her dad? Like all that stuff
is going through my head.

54
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:58,390
So when I did do the rewrite,

55
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,590
that's where I focused that I thought I
could actually be the perfect person to

56
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:04,720
do this because I was feeling
so emotionally connected.

57
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,370
Well and it's great that you think of it
that way and there are so clear on that

58
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,510
messaging because it does really feel
aside from all the creatures that are

59
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:16,470
around it is this sort
of coming of age drama.

60
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,310
There's this great father, daughter
dynamic, great father, son dynamic, uh,

61
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,600
saw the movie. Um, um,

62
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,030
how was it to sort of put the horror
and the creature stuff aside to really

63
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:35,440
focus on that and dig into,
hey work,

64
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:39,600
we're going to deal with some really
heavy issues but also the world around us.

65
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:40,290
It's crazy.

66
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,770
It's this thing. The truth
of the matter is, and um,

67
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,120
Greg Daniels who created the office,

68
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:47,010
I remember there was one
day where he said to me,

69
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,030
your job is not to deliver these lines.
Funny. Your job is to deliver these lines,

70
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,070
play the truth of the moment.
And the people think it's funny.

71
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,550
People think it's funny. And if people
think what you say to Pam is emotional,

72
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:58,950
then it's emotional, but it's
up to them. It's not up to you.

73
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,900
And that sounds like a tiny bit of advice,

74
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:05,730
but it actually changed my entire career
and certainly was the reason why I did

75
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:08,010
this. I mean, truly if he
had not given me that advice,

76
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:11,760
I wouldn't have done this movie because
if someone said go direct a horror movie,

77
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:13,650
I'd say, I don't know. I
don't know how to do that.

78
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,070
But what I did do is I reverse
engineered it exactly as he taught me,

79
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:20,970
which is your job is not to scare
people or make the movie scary. Your,

80
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:25,450
your job is to make a movie honestly and
tell a story that you really connect to

81
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,900
and you're confident with.
And if people get scared,

82
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,620
that's up to them and you realize he's
absolutely right because of the family

83
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:32,131
dynamic.

84
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:34,530
You actually are more scared in the
movie because you don't want anything to

85
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:38,970
happen to that family member.
So again, I mean truly, uh,

86
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,260
you know, I learned everything from the
office and certainly Greg Daniels advice.

87
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:46,380
There was the reason why I felt
confident enough to do it. That said,

88
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,120
I am also a super nerd when it
comes to this stuff. You know,

89
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,660
I remember my dad when we were little,

90
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,270
one of the best bits of advice
he ever gave me was, you know,

91
00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:57,030
one of the most confidence things you
can say as a person is, I don't know.

92
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,770
And so diving into this,

93
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,970
I knew a lot of what I wanted to do
and I knew a lot of what I didn't know.

94
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,210
And so I had to go out there and
I had to a watch scary movies.

95
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:11,160
So if you look at my iTunes for the last
year, you'd think I have a problem. Um,

96
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,020
and I just watched all
the scary movies I could.

97
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,860
The first thing I realized
was how ignorant I've been
to not participate in this

98
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,420
genre world.
I mean,

99
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:22,590
some of the best movies I've seen in
the last few years are genre movies from

100
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:25,160
get out to the which to the
Baba Duke to let the right one.

101
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,880
I mean there's so many good movies.

102
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,530
So I just became such a huge fan and
took it all in and then creature design

103
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,770
just dove deep into that
world and it was just really,

104
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:38,040
really fun actually to stay. I love
stepping outside of my comfort zone.

105
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:42,060
I remember as a kid I wasn't
the best basketball player,
but there was like that,

106
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:45,840
that idea of like put me in and if
I screw up, never put me in again.

107
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,660
Um,
and that sort of how I feel about life,

108
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:51,360
I've taken on different genres
and tried different things,

109
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:55,410
but I'm fully confident with the fact
that if I do it wrong or I'm not good at

110
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:57,980
it, don't let me do that, please.

111
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,440
Well, I, I definitely think I did.
A lot of people saw the movie,

112
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:04,110
had the ability to see it.
The people who were crying,

113
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,680
the ones that you saw it last night.

114
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,320
One of the things when I saw you
don't really hide the monsters.

115
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:13,920
It's not like a jump scare kind of, you
know, some of that that takes place.

116
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:17,190
But really it's,
it's a masterful use of tension.

117
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,420
And I think back to like, uh,
like the concept of checkoffs gun,

118
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,280
there's so much great foreshadowing and
sort of like little glimpses and little

119
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:30,810
hidden things that then pay off
in such a big way. Uh, you know,

120
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,510
playing a, wearing multiple
hats, hymns, acting in it,

121
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:35,220
and also having written
it and directing it.

122
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:40,180
And did you find it difficult to embed
that stuff, navigate that stuff? Uh,

123
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,080
from both sides of the
glass? Uh, on the Lens?

124
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,160
Yeah. It's one of those things where
when you do this as a new experience,

125
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,370
you don't know how it
can go horribly wrong.

126
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,760
And so you just commit to
what you know. And so, I mean,

127
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:56,650
you're mentioning that
the, the gun idea, it's,

128
00:06:56,651 --> 00:07:00,820
it's that thing of I just
knew what would scare me.

129
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,970
And I also knew that story wise,
what would be interesting to me.

130
00:07:03,971 --> 00:07:07,960
And I thought that the conceit was so
brilliant that you have to just set it up

131
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:11,500
all along.
I also remember I wrote the script,

132
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,500
a promised land while ago that I wrote
with Matt Damon and we went to the

133
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,710
marketing department at focus features.
And first of all,

134
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:20,110
the guy scared the hell out of me
because he was like, I know everything.

135
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:22,660
I know what states you're popular in.
I know what states hate you.

136
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:25,360
You want to know that stuff? And
I was like, definitely not my, uh,

137
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,940
my ego cannot handle that.

138
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,490
But what I do want to know is what's
the biggest misconception, uh,

139
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,070
in your opinion of audiences?

140
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,940
And he said the biggest misconception
that the film industry has is that

141
00:07:36,941 --> 00:07:39,070
audiences are stupid.
They're very, very smart.

142
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:43,150
They want to be challenged and
they want to go on a ride with you.

143
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:46,270
They don't want to be told everything.
Again, I took that and put it in here.

144
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:50,140
So all the things you're talking about.
I remember thinking, wow, I mean if,

145
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,920
if we could get away with all these subtle
hints that later you feel you earned

146
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:54,401
because you're like,

147
00:07:54,401 --> 00:07:57,790
I did see that tiny thing in the first
act and it pay it off at the end.

148
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,910
That was great. I didn't want
to confuse anybody, but my,

149
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,740
my instinct was go with as little as
possible where people feel excited rather

150
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:09,820
than go with, okay guys, here's a
eight minute preamble of what happened.

151
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,030
This is a diagram of what everything looks
like and where they came from and all

152
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:16,840
that stuff. It was really fun to
have you be as an audience member,

153
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:20,310
as freaked out and nervous as to
what's going on is the family is

154
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,360
right. Yeah. The film doesn't really deal
with the backstory hardly at all. Um,

155
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,800
I did have one bone to pick,

156
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:30,330
which was comes the opening slate
and just says like, day 89. Yup.

157
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,300
It's like less than three months and
everything in the world has gone to shit.

158
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,950
Yup. Uh, they were quiet.

159
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,580
Not a lot of credit to give to humankind.

160
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,170
No less than three months.
But

161
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,980
it's funny, but you actually nailed
why I made it such a low day.

162
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:48,220
It's like it happened quickly
because, you know, for me,

163
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,520
alien movies are always about what
does the aliens, what do they want?

164
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:55,620
What's the grand plan? And I thought,
and I'm sure there, there has been, uh,

165
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,670
alien movies that are just about predators
or, or, or whatever. But my thing was,

166
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,730
what if these aliens just landed
and they don't want anything.

167
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,050
They just want to go for it,
you know?

168
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:07,710
And so it's like releasing wolves in a
daycare center. There's just no contest.

169
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:11,080
You know what I mean? So it was sort
of one of those things of like, Hey,

170
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:14,790
let's get into a war room and like, decide
what the, oh, everybody's gone. Yikes.

171
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,480
You know? So that's sort of what I thought
is what, that's, that's plausible too.

172
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,690
You know, everyone's like, did
he just say wolves in a, that,

173
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,060
that'll be played back. Perfect. That's
an interesting, uh, daycare center.

174
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:30,480
A very able bodied 30
year old. Sorry, sorry,

175
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:32,970
I did not mean the horrible
version that you thought. Um,

176
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:33,740
it's,

177
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,740
it's an interesting layer that I hadn't
considered the sort of how much we

178
00:09:38,921 --> 00:09:43,000
flounder over choosing decisions and
making decisions in a moment like that

179
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:46,230
where I just didn't want
the president scene of like,
what do we do? Right, right.

180
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,350
Because the president was just,
you know,

181
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:51,400
people are just taking a different times
and so we talked about the parenting

182
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:55,630
layer, but it also, I was curious if
there's like a living in New York layer,

183
00:09:55,631 --> 00:09:58,330
obviously, you know, you're
very well known actor,

184
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,150
creative person in the city is,

185
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,940
when did that thought ever cross your
mind when you were making this up?

186
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:07,860
Like having to navigate this city
without the massive monsters?

187
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,100
1000% yeah.
You're,

188
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,450
you're tapping into my secret idea of
how this would continue if it dig did

189
00:10:14,451 --> 00:10:14,871
continue.

190
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:19,250
I think the idea of this whole world being
explored is really interesting to me.

191
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,310
Growing up in the east coast
and growing up in Boston,

192
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,220
I had to do it as rural northeast.

193
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,250
And the reason is not just
because I have a connection to it,

194
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:30,890
but also because I wanted
it to feel like anywhere,

195
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:35,000
anytime America that if this did happen,
that you could place yourself.

196
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,470
If you're from Indiana,
you can say like,

197
00:10:36,471 --> 00:10:39,770
oh that sort of like a farm I grew up in.
It just places you in a,

198
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:43,760
I dunno when that way that sort of
nostalgic movies do really well close

199
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:47,570
encounters. I mean if you pulled
everybody here where that is, you know,

200
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,180
actually everybody here would
know because you're very smart.

201
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,510
But most people wouldn't remember.
They'd just say like, I dunno,

202
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,770
it's a guy who went crazy in the
middle of a mountainous area and I,

203
00:10:56,771 --> 00:11:01,220
and I liked that. It's South
Dakota, isn't it? That you Googlers

204
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,643
nailed it.

205
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,570
Even the, uh, the smallness
of it as, as grandiose as the,

206
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:14,040
the environment, as grandiose as the
world is, the movie is very small.

207
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,790
It really the amount of time we're talking
about two days out of these people's

208
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,420
lives and, and the area that's
covered is a very small, um,

209
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,660
did you find that keeping it small
helped you connect with the core of the

210
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:25,830
family involved?

211
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,350
Oh, a thousand percent. Yeah.
I think that, you know, I'm,

212
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,130
I'm one of those people that the
more information you give me,

213
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:33,780
the more my mind wanders,

214
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,110
which makes me a very annoying person to
watch a movie because if you even drop

215
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:39,810
a hint at something, I'm like, hmm, what
happened to that? And people are like,

216
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:42,420
focus, there's a movie happening.
I'm like, man, I don't know this, uh,

217
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,330
this thing over here seems very untethered
to the rest of the movie. Um, but,

218
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:53,130
uh, but I think also this idea of family
was so much scarier because again,

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,870
you know, all the cliches
are true when you have kids,

220
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:58,960
but like your kids are the only
kids who exist in the world.

221
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:00,400
You know what I mean?
It's why every parent's like,

222
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:03,820
I think my kids really smart and you're
like, I think every kid is really smart.

223
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,960
Um, but it does, it feels very
intimate. It feels very much to you.

224
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:12,961
And I loved the idea that this family
just decided the priority number one was

225
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:16,210
this unit that it wasn't everybody
else. So yes, being on a farm,

226
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:21,211
the idea of isolation that visually not
being able to see other houses or see a

227
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,570
highway or a way out was really important
to me because they can't make it a

228
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,260
hundred yards, let alone a
hundred miles. I would want to,

229
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:33,100
I almost went into a spoiler do it,
but it's talk about the two kids. No,

230
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,700
a troop and Millicent seven
were great in the film.

231
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,840
How was it to work with them? Obviously
Noah has a huge reputation already.

232
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,460
Reputation.
He's got a reputation of,

233
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:48,461
it's like the kid in the back cause like
I do movies and Millicent up for a lot

234
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:53,380
of young acting awards. How was it
to work with the two of them? I mean,

235
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,000
here's the thing, they, you know, they,

236
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,000
I've always heard don't work with kids
because they slow everything down.

237
00:12:58,001 --> 00:12:58,721
They never get the,

238
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:01,150
they never really understand what they're
saying and they don't get their takes.

239
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:04,720
Right. And they have kid hours, which
aren't the same full hours that you have.

240
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,320
And it just sounded like a nightmare.
I had the exact opposite experience.

241
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,380
So these kids are not only some of
the best actors I've ever worked with,

242
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,130
but some of the best people I've ever
gotten to know. That's the truth. I mean,

243
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:18,970
these kids are so unbelievably special
and you can see it in the movie.

244
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:22,360
And I remember Noah saying something
really interesting. He said, you know,

245
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:26,260
the lack of die, of course, he's more
articulate than me cause he's 13. Um,

246
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,630
but he said, uh, you know,

247
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:32,320
the lack of dialogue didn't
give me anywhere to hide
the fact that I didn't have

248
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:34,390
dialogue to hide behind. So what do you
mean by that? And he said, well, you know,

249
00:13:34,391 --> 00:13:35,860
when you're rehearsing your lines,

250
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:38,860
you think of like timing and how you're
going to deliver it. And I was like,

251
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:42,310
obviously you're delivering it. Super
Cool. Um, and he said, you know,

252
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:44,140
when you don't have that,
you actually have to live through it.

253
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:46,660
You have to be sad, you have to
be scared, you have to be happy.

254
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,500
And I just said yes.
Just to all of that,

255
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,510
that you said sounds super
smart. Um, and uh, and it's true.

256
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:58,630
These kids were just so phenomenal.
I probably ended up slowing them down,

257
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:02,170
but how I found them was, you know,
Noah had been on the night manager,

258
00:14:02,171 --> 00:14:05,770
which I saw and he was really great. And
I know this sounds horrible, but when I,

259
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,400
when I knew what I wanted for the movie,
I was watching him in the night manager.

260
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:12,580
I said, yeah, he's pretty good. And then
there's a scene where, sorry to spoil it.

261
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,630
Um, he gets kidnapped and I was like,
let's see how good he is with kidnapping.

262
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,360
And that kid does kidnap real
well. And I thought, well, he's in,

263
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,030
he's terrified and it looks,

264
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,400
I'm nervous to walk away and kidnapped
him and made him. Yes, that's right.

265
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,240
Not In the night manager, just
kidnapping, hired a couple of goons.

266
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,160
What am I talking about?
Are we in 1942. Um,

267
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:40,710
and then Millie was one of those things
where we just literally caught onto a

268
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:42,820
shooting star. I mean, she is,

269
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,320
it was nonnegotiable for me to have a
deaf actress in the movie, right? Um,

270
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,320
not for any grandiose PC reason,
but literally because obviously the,

271
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:53,720
the performance would be
much more textured, honest,

272
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:56,390
because she's living through it every
single day as, as a deaf person.

273
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,720
But more than that, I needed,
selfishly, I needed a guide.

274
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:01,940
I need someone to walk me
through this and I want,

275
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,070
I love collaborating and I love ideas.

276
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,870
And so I wanted her to come on set and I
wanted to know what it's like to be the

277
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:11,660
only deaf person in a hearing family.
What's it like? Do you get angry?

278
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,970
Do you get empowered?
What do you feel these things?

279
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:17,090
And she was so unbelievably
generous again, at the time,

280
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:18,650
I think she was 13 when we were shooting.

281
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,890
And Emily and I are convinced that
she's not actually from Earth,

282
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:25,610
that she's an angel. I mean, she's
the nicest, greatest human being.

283
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,920
And I know this sounds super poetic,
but it's true.

284
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,840
I've never had someone taking all of me
when they looked at me as I was talking,

285
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:35,660
she's looking at your hand gestures.
She's looking at your eyes and your,

286
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:37,820
your facial expressions.
But more than that,

287
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:42,680
she's legitimately feeling your essence.
She's a wonderfully powerful person.

288
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,950
I remember at south by southwest and my
mom went up to congratulate her and the

289
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:49,670
translator came over to help translate
for my mom or for Millie. And Millie said,

290
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:53,450
no, no, no, no. I know exactly what this
a woman is trying to say to me, which is,

291
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,760
it was just so beautiful.
So I mean,

292
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:57,200
I'll start crying right
now even thinking about it,

293
00:15:57,201 --> 00:16:00,080
but it was so nice to have her on set.
And then to boot.

294
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:04,490
She's one of the best actresses
I've ever seen. I mean, even Emily,

295
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:08,570
who I think is the best actors going was
like, no, this girl is the real deal.

296
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:10,940
She's so phenomenal. So anyway, long,

297
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,590
I think that's the longest
answer I've ever given. Um,

298
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,440
were really fun to work with. Did you
know AFL before going into the film?

299
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:19,610
Did you have time?
I remember,

300
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:24,050
I think in like elementary
school in junior high school,
we learned some ASL. Um,

301
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,950
but no, the answer is no. I was, I was
aware of certain tiny bits and pieces.

302
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,310
We learned all the ASL for the scenes
and then we learned a little bit to

303
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:33,970
communicate more, you know, more, uh,

304
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,350
casually and comfortable
for Millie offset.

305
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,550
But then all of a sudden the crew
started learning ASL. Noah learned,

306
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,410
I think he might be fluent in ASL.

307
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:46,700
My biggest regret was not learning more
because I was so busy doing so many

308
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:50,720
different things that I wish I had
learned more because I know it's, again,

309
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:52,730
it sounds like I'm harping
on this romantic version,

310
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:54,860
but watching Millie talked to her mom,

311
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:57,680
I was convinced that there's no more
beautiful language in the world. I mean,

312
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:59,510
truly there's great languages to speak,

313
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:03,590
but watching someone paint their ideas
through the air is unlike anything I've

314
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:07,130
ever seen. And it plays
off really powerfully. Yes.

315
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:10,940
It works as a great boon for the
family in the film. Exactly. Yeah.

316
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,320
It's sort of the leg up that they have.
Yeah. Deeper level of communication.

317
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,260
We'll talk about working with Emily
in the, in the film she plays in.

318
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:23,060
Your white is only um,
yes, right. The diva. Um,

319
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,180
no, uh, Emily, they just cut you out.

320
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,950
John was all alone on that answer.
Um,

321
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,160
we've always wanted to work together.
We, we've always talked about it.

322
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,100
It's weird because we keep our
careers completely separate.

323
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,730
We never wanted the story of us being
married to supersede whatever story we

324
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:44,690
were telling on screen.

325
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,140
So it was hard to imagine that
we would be able to find it.

326
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:53,070
Luckily this story is pretty out
there, so we're safe. But on top of it,

327
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,530
it had to be an organic thing.
If I'm honest,

328
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:59,460
when I was doing the rewrite of the
script, I knew that I only wanted her.

329
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,440
She was very busy.
Like I said,

330
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:04,170
we had just had our second child and
she was also doing a little indie movie

331
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:08,550
called Mary Poppins. So,
um, she was working a lot.

332
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,460
Um, and, and to be honest,
I think I was just scared.

333
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,230
I think I was just
playing scared to ask her.

334
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:17,200
So the truth is I never even
brought it up to her. Um, it,

335
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,500
she knew what I was doing.
I pitched her ideas.

336
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,290
She started pitching other actresses
that she thought would be great for the

337
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,040
role.

338
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,180
And the reason why I didn't ask her it
was because I sought going one of two

339
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:31,620
ways. One, I asked her and she says, no,
which makes her a very awkward dinner.

340
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,910
Um, or she says, yes, I'll do it for
you. Which would honestly be worse.

341
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,200
That would be a heartbreak to me because
I've been witness to how intelligent,

342
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:45,120
how classy, the, the unbelievable
tastes level she has in her choices.

343
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,650
Um, I just couldn't stomach the idea
of her doing anything as a favor to me.

344
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:51,570
I had to let her career be her own.

345
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,250
So she read the script when we were flying
on a plane one day. She said, you know,

346
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:57,840
do you mind if I read it?
And I said, yeah, no problem.

347
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,930
Truly not thinking that she would do it.
And when she finished the script,

348
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,360
she turned to me and she
did look sick. Um, and I,

349
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,920
I literally went for like a
Barf bag and she said, you know,

350
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:10,620
you can't let anyone else play this
role. And I turned around, I said,

351
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:13,230
what are you saying? And she's like,
you can't let anyone else play it.

352
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:14,820
And it was like she was proposing to me,

353
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,440
are you saying what I think you're saying?
And she was like,

354
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:24,180
will you let me do the movie? And
I was like, yes. And I was like,

355
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:27,540
hold on. Sorry. I should have played
that so much cooler. Um, I dunno.

356
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,920
Let's see how you are on tape.
Um, what's set up an audition.

357
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,330
So I screamed yes, on an airplane and
then we were working together. So how,

358
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:40,830
how was it working with her? I
mean, the short answer is, um,

359
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,980
I finally got to see why
she's such a good actress.

360
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:46,320
I remember the week before
we started shooting,

361
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:49,070
I went to find an editing bay that
we would then edit the movie in.

362
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,160
And they actually happened to be editing
Mary Poppins at that editing bay.

363
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,380
And so rob Marshall, who's a unbelievable
human being in a wonderful director,

364
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,560
said, when are you shooting? And I
said, next week. And he said, Oh man,

365
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:04,410
you're going to see, I said, I know I love
her so much. And he said, no, no, no, no,

366
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,590
you're going to see. I said, I know
I'm her biggest fan. And he said, nope,

367
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,650
not until you're in the room
when she does what she does,

368
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:13,740
will you know why she's such a
good actress? And I thought, wow,

369
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:17,040
what an incredible thing to
say and also how dare you.

370
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,343
And um,

371
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,730
the scene that's in that poster was like
day three and he was absolutely right.

372
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,790
I mean, she did one take of that scene.
We have coverage of different shots,

373
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:33,650
but the, the big momentous moment of
the scene, um, she only did one take of,

374
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,920
and genuinely the air changed in the room.
I mean,

375
00:20:36,921 --> 00:20:40,160
something came through the
room and I was totally stunned.

376
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,530
I couldn't say anything.
The crew couldn't say anything.

377
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,470
And then at the end of the take,
you literally hear me say,

378
00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:48,340
that's lunch question mark.
Like, what do you do after that?

379
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,850
And this is how good my wife is.
She was like, yeah, by the way,

380
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,370
what do they have for
lunch? And I was like, what?

381
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,990
You were just like possessed by the devil
and now the devil is not in this movie.

382
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:02,650
I'm sorry, that was a miss
phrasing. That is a different movie.

383
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:04,660
This is just creatures,
just creatures.

384
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,540
Let's expand a little bit more on that.
While it's definitely production,

385
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,723
there's a,

386
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:15,060
I recognized very early and one of my
favorite parts of the production of the

387
00:21:15,061 --> 00:21:19,290
film is the way that you deal with the
sound obviously sound is a huge part,

388
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,840
but the way it's dealt with,
uh, with Millie's character, uh,

389
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:28,020
the way that it's mixed throughout
the dynamic level. Yeah. How,

390
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,590
how far did you find yourself
wanting to push it? Uh, did you,

391
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,160
do you think you've got there?
Does it pay off for you as the director?

392
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:39,360
Yeah, I mean, it was really one of the
most fascinating parts of this experience.

393
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,160
I have always known the power of
sound because I did this movie with,

394
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,840
the first thing I ever did was I adapted
a script called brief interviews with

395
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:48,150
tedious men. That's David Foster
Wallace's book that I was in love with.

396
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,520
It's a very simple movie,

397
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:53,790
basically a woman interviewing
guys and I remember they said,

398
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:57,410
now you have to do your sound mix. And I
was like, cool, what does that, and um,

399
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,920
we went and mixed it and I realized
the power of even just dialogue scenes,

400
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,010
what happens when you sound mix, there's
a whole atmosphere and all these things.

401
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:09,210
So I learned very quickly,
little did I know how far you can go.

402
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:11,340
I mean truly through the
looking glass type stuff,

403
00:22:11,341 --> 00:22:13,770
you can really lose your mind
in the sound design of this.

404
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,710
And I had the greatest people on board,
Ethan and Eric,

405
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,500
these guys are just so
unbelievably talented.

406
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:23,370
And they realized that this was such a
huge opportunity because in the movies

407
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:26,580
that we have nowadays, you're completely
surrounded by a wall of sound,

408
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,920
which can be a bit of an
assault on the senses.

409
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,180
And weirdly taking the sound
out is just as assaulting.

410
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,410
It's just as disconcerting.
And it was really,

411
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:38,490
really fun to start playing
with that and then realizing,

412
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,170
let's take a big swing
and see what happens.

413
00:22:40,171 --> 00:22:42,330
And when you take certain
big swings, it's like, Whoa,

414
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,170
you really start pushing the boundaries
of certainly what I've experienced in

415
00:22:46,171 --> 00:22:46,981
the movies before.

416
00:22:46,981 --> 00:22:49,950
And that's been my favorite compliment
that audiences have been saying leaving

417
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,020
is that this is an experience.
It's not just the film.

418
00:22:52,021 --> 00:22:54,620
I mean you can't get that without sort of,
you know,

419
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,680
assaulting the senses and all,
all ways. And so, yes, I think we,

420
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,210
I love what we did theirs.

421
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,930
There was always that happy medium of
making sure it didn't feel like a sound

422
00:23:03,931 --> 00:23:06,360
experiment where people are
like, I get it, man. You,

423
00:23:06,361 --> 00:23:09,780
you wanted to take us all the way and
you want people to remember that it is a

424
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:10,980
movie.
It has to be entertaining.

425
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:13,340
So just the idea of playing
with these things and,

426
00:23:13,341 --> 00:23:15,780
and keeping it entertaining and
fun and moving was really good.

427
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,110
Important to me.
That's great.

428
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,340
How much more of this type of uh,

429
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,850
like all inclusive approach would you
like to take going forward from here?

430
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,090
Is it, is it a big challenge
to direct yourself, uh,

431
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,860
to get so involved in the production of
a movie and then be able to represent

432
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:37,060
the character as well? Yeah, it's so
weird because when you look at the

433
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,990
titles on paper, it seems
overwhelming. You immediately say,

434
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,190
what the hell are you doing? Why would
you do this on day one of shooting?

435
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:47,930
And you're like, why would you executive
produced help, right. Star and direct.

436
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:52,310
It sounds insane, but, and I, and I mean
this, it sounds super corny but it's true.

437
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:56,990
I've never been all in on a project
like this in my life. I mean this, yes,

438
00:23:56,991 --> 00:24:00,800
it's really exciting for me as a director
and career wise it's something new and

439
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:02,630
different and I'm really excited about it.

440
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:07,631
But personally I was so emotional and so
emotionally connected to this material

441
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:10,910
because of the family and because of the
kids and because of thinking of my own

442
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:13,790
kids and things like that,
and having my wife onset that.

443
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:18,791
What you realize is those four titles
ended up being my only weapons to protect

444
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:23,810
the project in every facet. So it
became this unbelievable gift that yes,

445
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:27,980
it's a ton of work, but I loved it. How
much more would I do? I gotta be honest.

446
00:24:27,981 --> 00:24:32,480
I love doing it. I love sort of developing
and producing and I'm sort of insane.

447
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:36,320
So I love sort of being crazy
with how much work is going on,

448
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:39,350
but I don't necessarily need to do
all of them all the time. You know,

449
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:44,090
maybe you direct and don't star. Maybe
you, you know, I'd also love to just act.

450
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,730
You know what I mean? That that's
also really fun for me. It's just,

451
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,180
I think I just love exploring is what it
is. That's the worst answer ever. Okay.

452
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,010
Have you ever,
I was to follow that up.

453
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,720
Have you found that the diversification
has helped you to transition out of what

454
00:24:57,721 --> 00:25:02,010
was kind of a defining role for
you as Jim and the office? Yeah,

455
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,980
absolutely.
But

456
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,870
the truth is,
is it's funny,

457
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:09,040
I always want to make it clear that
I never wanted to diversify from Jim.

458
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,050
I think at the end of my career I'll
probably still be best known for that

459
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:16,930
character. And that is awesome.
I mean that's an honor. I mean,

460
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,350
you can't get a better thing than that.
That was so special.

461
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,820
It was lightening in a bottle.
And I remember till the
very last day of shooting,

462
00:25:24,821 --> 00:25:25,780
it was lightening in a bottle.

463
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:29,380
We knew like I remember people coming
up who are on other TV shows being like,

464
00:25:29,381 --> 00:25:31,990
what seasons did you guys start hating
each other? And I was like never.

465
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,690
I mean truly we were a
family till the very end.

466
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:38,980
So that was something that I actually
wanted to move and try other things

467
00:25:38,981 --> 00:25:40,810
because I knew I could
never attain that again.

468
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,040
So it was trying to do different
things. And then the, the,
the truth is, and again,

469
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:45,581
it sounds Corny,

470
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:49,630
but I named my production company Sunday
night because when I first got to New

471
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,480
York, I was a waiter and a
bartender and whatever else,

472
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,870
weird job I could possibly find.
And I remember someone saying,

473
00:25:55,871 --> 00:25:58,300
the one thing you don't get to
do as a working actor, his act,

474
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,130
you've got to do all these
other things to pay the bills.

475
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:04,180
So my friends and I would meet on
Sunday night and we're all trying to do

476
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:04,930
creative stuff.

477
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,290
And you realize it was the only night
that we could ever talk about plays,

478
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:09,730
movies, books, music.

479
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,720
And so we just nerded out on each other
and talked about all these huge dreams.

480
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:17,350
And if we got the chance, we do
this. And you know, the, these, uh,

481
00:26:17,351 --> 00:26:21,340
these crazy Hollywood types don't know
how to do it. And, and it was so much fun.

482
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:24,550
Those people inspired my life forever.

483
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:28,060
So when I did get the opportunity,
like I said at the beginning,

484
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,630
when I did get the opportunity to
be in the office and have this huge

485
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,090
opportunity to have,
what do you want to do going forward?

486
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:37,690
I just thought of those guys and those
conversations than I thought I can't do.

487
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,580
I can't just sit back and wait for another
comedy or another show to come along

488
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:45,810
that's like that. I got
to try to, you know,

489
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,560
honor what we talked about at those
tables and, and that's why I did it.

490
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:53,070
That's why I started making different
choices and trying new things because I

491
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:56,610
thought these guys would 1000% do that
if they were given the same chance.

492
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,610
Excellent. Excellent. We do want
to open it up for questions.

493
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,270
If you guys want to make your way
to microphone over here a while,

494
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,000
they sort of get set and since
we're on the topic of the office,

495
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:09,330
Google here is a very big office really.
And

496
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,110
I was wondering in the time
where you're an office,

497
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:14,400
this looks like we're in Star Trek.

498
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,970
I feel like I'm,
I'm

499
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,120
[inaudible] up in space right now.
Right.

500
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:20,460
I was wondering in the time
since the show has ended,

501
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,150
if you've come up with
any great Jim pranks

502
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,520
that you would maybe go back and inactive
if you could know that we will take

503
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:37,500
your question over here. I
was never a prank. I, uh,
growing up, so I was so lucky.

504
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:40,830
The writers of the show were unbelievable.
I mean,

505
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:44,100
they've all gone on to create their
own hugely successful show so you can

506
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,850
genuinely see how talented they
were. But coming up, I mean,

507
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:51,120
it was my favorite thing to read those
scripts and be like, well, is he? Yes.

508
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,350
The like when you read the prank,

509
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:56,820
I think my favorite one was the nickels
and the receiver that was just so weird

510
00:27:56,821 --> 00:28:01,821
and amazing and it took way too
much time and I loved all of it.

511
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:05,670
I love that. My favorite might've
been Asian jet. Yeah. Really good one.

512
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,720
Randall's amazing.
We'll take a question over.

513
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,030
Hello? Hello? Hey, I'm checking
the mic. That was a good idea.

514
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,360
Um,

515
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,470
I'm a big office fan and I'm really glad
that you decided to use fruit farms as

516
00:28:18,471 --> 00:28:22,970
a set on your movie because
totally visualize that. Yeah.

517
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,030
Mom in Dwight to come out of the beat,

518
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,390
but as a director and a producer,

519
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:34,391
like what sort of decisions go into
choosing a set and choosing a location for

520
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:39,650
the film? I know you'd talked about city
versus rural, but even within rural,

521
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,690
you know, what kind of
decision making that you take?

522
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,260
Uh, a lot. It was really a,

523
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:48,590
so I started shooting the show Jack
Ryan and we were up in Montreal.

524
00:28:48,591 --> 00:28:52,940
And so every, well, to be honest, every
day, but on the weekends especially,

525
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:57,670
I was looking at, this is not a joke,
I was looking on Zillow for like, uh,

526
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,580
farms in upstate New York because I
thought, well, if they're selling,

527
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,000
then maybe they'd like crazy
Hollywood to come in before they sell.

528
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:07,670
It turns out most people do not want that.

529
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,253
MMM.

530
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,900
And uh,
and I found this,

531
00:29:10,901 --> 00:29:15,901
this house was on an old Zillow listing
and so I actually legitimately found the

532
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:18,490
house and then called the studio.

533
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:22,330
They send in someone to make sure that
people wouldn't fall into a sinkhole or

534
00:29:22,331 --> 00:29:24,230
something when we were doing it. And, uh,

535
00:29:24,231 --> 00:29:25,810
and then I met the guys
who were running it,

536
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:28,540
these two incredible farming farmers,
that family,

537
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:31,900
and they are the nicest people ever.
And I said, would you ever have a movie?

538
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:33,430
So then I flew down and
met them personally.

539
00:29:33,431 --> 00:29:37,030
I had to do it all by myself
because I felt like if you're,

540
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:40,750
if you're going to completely
change their experience day to day,

541
00:29:40,751 --> 00:29:43,930
you to have the personal connection of
letting them know that I'm here to do it,

542
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:48,160
not, you know, some group of 300 people.
So it was really fun to, to choose that.

543
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,950
So I had a lot to do with it
unfortunately. And so does Zillow,

544
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,800
I'm glad are also some crazy story
about growing a bunch of corn. Yeah.

545
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:01,900
So that farm, which you can't see, I
just pointed to nothing. So that farm,

546
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,600
uh, nowhere got it. Um,

547
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,820
it was a pumpkin farm and it
was something like 600 acres,

548
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,120
but they only used a certain amount of
acreage for Pumpkin's cause we were going

549
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:16,660
to be shooting in September or October
and they were the hottest Halloween,

550
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:21,010
Jabari and town. And so when I told them
that we needed corn, they were like, yeah,

551
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,410
yeah, sure. So some corn and
then we'll plan our pumpkins.
And I was like, no, no, no,

552
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,510
no guys, we're going to need
corn. And so they planted,

553
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,260
I mean something like 40
acres of corn or something.

554
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:33,730
And just as far as the eye could see.

555
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:37,960
And I will say the coolest thing is when
if finally cropped up when we started

556
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,980
shooting, the guys came and they looked
at it and they were like, this is awesome.

557
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,890
And I said, yeah, you're going to go back
to corn. They were like, God, no pumpkin.

558
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,440
So I was like, oh, okay. Great. Perfect.
That's the question from the side.

559
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,040
Hello.
Hello.

560
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,870
A question about how you evaluate
like your career and your best work.

561
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,200
You've mentioned how important your
family is. Obviously in the industry,

562
00:30:58,201 --> 00:31:02,070
there's people you idolize, that you've
gotten to meet. How'd you like evaluate?

563
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,620
Oh, that was, that was good work.
Or like the, the highlight. Yeah,

564
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,850
that's a really good question.
Um, if I'm really honest,

565
00:31:07,851 --> 00:31:11,540
it's very difficult for me because I don't
know, just the way I grew up, it was,

566
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:14,690
I was never the, I
don't know, it was just,

567
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,610
I feel like it's something about Boston.

568
00:31:16,611 --> 00:31:19,460
Boston was never one of those places
that you're like, I'm amazing.

569
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:23,090
And people are like, that's so great for
you. Usually you're like, I'm amazing.

570
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:27,230
And they're like, get them the one in
the back, take them out. Um, it was,

571
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,960
it's just a, it was a cool
place to grow up because you,

572
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,650
you got to focus on what you loved rather
than what you loved about yourself.

573
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,060
And so, um, it's really hard
for me to be like, it's amazing.

574
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:43,090
I think that in a terrible baseball
analogy, here it comes. Um,

575
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,780
it's that idea of like when you
hit the fat of the bat, you know,

576
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,450
when the ball connected in a way you
don't know what's going to happen to that

577
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:53,000
ball. But you know, you felt
really good about what happened,

578
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:57,800
told you it was a terrible,
there's a part of the bat that's fatter.

579
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:01,250
It doesn't matter. I blew
it. Basically. I can tell,

580
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,280
I can tell when I'm happy
with what what I did. And um,

581
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:09,830
I know when we were shooting this that
something felt very special for me.

582
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,630
And to be honest,

583
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,100
the most overwhelming thing about the
very kind response that this movie's

584
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:20,360
gotten is goes back to instinctual
high school days of like,

585
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,140
you have something that you think is cool
and you really hope that other people

586
00:32:24,141 --> 00:32:27,170
think it's cool too. And when other
people go, yeah, that's cool. You're like,

587
00:32:27,171 --> 00:32:30,290
oh my God. I mean it's
genuinely moving. I mean,

588
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:32,780
when we were at south by
southwest the night before,

589
00:32:32,781 --> 00:32:34,880
we premiered down there and my wife said,
you know what's,

590
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,770
what's the one thing you
want to take away from this?

591
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:39,600
Just so you're not stressed about the
whole thing. And I was like too late. Um,

592
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,420
and I said, you know, if, if
people cheered at the end,

593
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:45,960
that would be really cool cause it's
a kind of a fun experience. And uh,

594
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,040
when people jumped out of their chairs
and screamed at the top of their lungs,

595
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,610
I think I blacked out and only
woke up yesterday like I was,

596
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,910
I am so genuinely moved and
overwhelmed by that response.

597
00:32:56,911 --> 00:33:00,900
So I can say I'm happy by the response,
but I'm not like, I'm awesome.

598
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,823
I'm pretty awesome.

599
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,980
If that was terrible, people
are like an record that. Thanks.

600
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,730
Um, so one thing, I've only seen
the trailer so far and I can't wait.

601
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,080
See the movie.
Maybe it will be addressed,

602
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:16,040
but you had 89 days to take the
batteries out of that space shuttle.

603
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:21,950
What was going on there? All
right man. Turn off the cameras.

604
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:23,890
Turn on

605
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:28,510
the cameras. Um, uh, what
you'll see in the movie is,

606
00:33:28,511 --> 00:33:31,660
um, when you are putting a
situation and they're coming,

607
00:33:31,661 --> 00:33:36,460
these creatures are coming. This is
just a parable guys. Um, no, the,

608
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:40,100
it's everything is very
specific to survival. So, uh,

609
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,810
you'll see in the movie that that space
shuttle is not something that is theirs.

610
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:46,150
They do not own that. So the, they,

611
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:49,060
there was no way for them to know that
batteries were in the space shuttle

612
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:52,900
because they didn't know it existed. And
I'm not going to spoil it, but it had,

613
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:55,840
I known the batteries were in it, I
probably would've done something about it.

614
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,073
Okay.

615
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,810
We only have time for a couple more,

616
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:02,330
so we'll if we can wrap and
fire maybe two on this side,

617
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,360
two on this side and you
can at the same time. No,

618
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,640
Dwight. Uh, go ahead. Hi. First of all,

619
00:34:10,641 --> 00:34:15,200
thank you for coming. Oh my God, this
is so exciting. Thanks. Um, I have, uh,

620
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,620
basically pop of the paper,
a basic question,

621
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:22,160
but did you have any like favorite
scene from the office that you like to

622
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:23,120
Rewatch or anything?

623
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,530
Um, I rewatch everything all the time.
No. Going back to the other question,

624
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:28,280
I don't,
I,

625
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,940
I think one of my favorite scenes
there are two that I always remember.

626
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:34,730
I don't watch them over and over
cause I just play it in my head.

627
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:40,330
Two things really specific moment was
when Steve had us over to his apartment

628
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,400
and he took the TV and he said, and
then when guests, guests come over,

629
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:51,200
you can just do that. I think that's the
hardest I've ever laughed in my life.

630
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:55,320
And then the other one is when he
dressed up as Santa and had, uh,

631
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,580
Kevin sit on his lap.
I mean if you watch the outtakes,

632
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,020
I would very clearly it was unprofessional
person because I couldn't get through

633
00:35:03,021 --> 00:35:07,190
that scene. So those are the two that
I play back in my head and laugh.

634
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:11,720
Thank you. Cook one. Hold on a sec.
Oh Hey John. Hey Horan good. Um,

635
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,700
I didn't know that this movie was about
protecting your children and that's

636
00:35:14,701 --> 00:35:17,970
really cool cause I'm having my first
son when my first child in August.

637
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,840
Congratulations. Thank
you. That's awesome.

638
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,900
So now I want to see it and
I'm going to be my way. Um,

639
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,710
tell her it is way easier to
give birth and this I promise.

640
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:30,780
All right. She won't believe you,
but, um, I really want to know,

641
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:33,750
I'm getting advice from like everybody
and their mother and her landscaper for

642
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:36,060
parenting, but yeah. Cool. They
get parenting advice from you.

643
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,130
Oh, that's really, um,

644
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,360
and protecting from aliens and,
yeah. Yeah. So when aliens come,

645
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:47,280
you're gonna want to clear out all
the noisy toys. Take those away.

646
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,670
Anything plushes safe?
Um, no, it's funny. I,

647
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:55,800
my number one bit of parenting advice
has been listened to no one because it's

648
00:35:55,801 --> 00:36:00,700
always a unique experience, but
to me that, to walk away, um,

649
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,160
no, I, I got so many different
pieces of advice that I,

650
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:08,160
I still to this day use one of which
is, uh, communicate with your kids.

651
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:10,560
Don't just talk to them and
tell them what's happening.

652
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:14,160
You actually have to walk them through
it because they see things in extremes.

653
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,950
So, you know, instead of saying, you know,

654
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,400
don't hit your sister and we're going
to put you in a timeout or something.

655
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:24,930
It's like, Hey, so I've asked you three
times not to hit your sister in the face,

656
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:28,200
and now we're going to go over here and
you have to step away from the game.

657
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:30,690
And they actually process really,
really well.

658
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:33,480
And I think that that's a big
misconception certainly of mine,

659
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:36,930
was that they can't process,
there's so much smarter than you are,

660
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,430
and I know you work at Google, but
trust me, this kid isn't even out yet,

661
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:44,880
and he's smarter than
you. Yeah, you got it.

662
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,960
That seems like a pretty great place to
wrap up on the front. You've got, yeah.

663
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,440
I want to thank you for,
thank you very much.

664
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:55,040
[inaudible].
