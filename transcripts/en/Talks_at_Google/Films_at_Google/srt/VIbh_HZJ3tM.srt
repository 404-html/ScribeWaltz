1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:07,010
[inaudible] we just finished
watching Mr. Holmes.

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,820
So based on a novel,
a slight trick of mind by Mitch Colon,

3
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:14,540
Mr. Holmes reimagined Sherlock Holmes
as a real person who's adventures have

4
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:18,260
been turned into bestselling novels by
his friend and partner, Dr. John Watson,

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,720
now old and failing and health.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,990
The famously rational detective is forced
to engage for the first time with his

7
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:28,850
emotions as his mental powers dwindle.
So I loved it.

8
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,470
I thought it was very, very good.
Um, and both of you, gosh, you're,

9
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:37,570
you're acting awards, your
accolades go on. I've got, you know,

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,340
I could print pages of these
things. I mean, you're not so much

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,050
where'd you do get them? They
do Google. Do not use it.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,210
So what, what drew you to both to, to
this film? What was so unique about it?

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,100
The money. Okay. Or lack of it.

14
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,080
You've heard of independent movies?
Translated means cheap.

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,060
Well, I'm an, I'm sorry,
I've started talking first.

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,490
It's a, it's a wonderful
part. And, and the,

17
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,740
and the actor of my generation would have
jumped at the chance to play Sherlock

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,930
Holmes in his prime and then Sherlock
Holmes and his decline. I mean, you know,

19
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:34,760
two performances and in
the same film it's um,

20
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,950
it's a bit like doing a Gandalf the
grey and Gandalf, the white. Yeah,

21
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,330
they're the same but different and uh,
so that,

22
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:48,164
but

23
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,340
Laura will tell you the script arrives
and it says it's from bill con don it

24
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,350
your life stops while you recover,

25
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:01,610
breath and then you opened it and know
you're good to say yes because it's bill

26
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,670
and who we both worked
with a very happily,

27
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,620
I think both been number
that initially that

28
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,680
my feeling is if it's,

29
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,850
if a script looks like a film or
play that I would like to see,

30
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,380
then I then I get intrigued. If I
read something on that, I think I,

31
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,150
I really wouldn't want to go and
see that then I don't get involved.

32
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,830
But in this case,

33
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,760
the thing, Laura, same for you. First off,

34
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:40,940
it was bill Condon, who is,
you know, our, our friend and,

35
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,030
and director and there certain
directors who you will do anything for.

36
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:47,300
You have such good experiences working
with them that they whisper your name and

37
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,490
you will show up for two lines.
I mean,

38
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:52,460
not you do you do anything for them and
bill is certainly one of those people.

39
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,010
So it was bill in combination with,

40
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,190
right. You know, and

41
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,870
then on top of that,
Sherlock Holmes,

42
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:06,370
and I've been a Sherlock Holmes
fanatic since I was a child. So, um,

43
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,490
so the comp those three and it was
filmed in England for God's sake.

44
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:13,390
So all of those things
combined, it was just, you know,

45
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,120
kind of too good to be
true. The money though. No.

46
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,290
Yes. So you said you, I'm here we are.
We're doing this for free. God bless.

47
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,930
All right. Because we want you all to see
this room and you've seen it for free.

48
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,650
The beyond this particular
audience. Um, yeah. You,

49
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:44,000
you don't go around talking about a
film that you haven't enjoyed making an,

50
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:47,360
haven't enjoyed watching. Uh, we vote.

51
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,790
We both feel strongly
about it and I love it.

52
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,500
Well, you said, Laura, you said yes.

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,810
You said that you were a big
Sherlock Holmes Fan since
childhood, right? Right. So,

54
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,080
so bill Condon comes to you. You weren't
planning on doing anything for a right?

55
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,740
No, I, I had a baby a year and
a half ago. Oh, I'm such a baby.

56
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,370
A sweet little boy who's madly
in love with Anne. And I, uh,

57
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,280
Bill came over to meet the baby and we
spend a little time together and he said,

58
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:18,530
so what do you think you're going to
go back to work? I said, well, I'm not,

59
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,530
I have no plans. And he goes, okay. Okay.

60
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,510
And then the next day I got
an offer to do the movie.

61
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,760
I wasn't planning on going back to work,
but you know, for bill and you know, I,

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,140
I, I, you know,

63
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,650
got myself off the couch and strap the
baby to myself and we flew to London and

64
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,440
that was that. So did you know what
Ian was attached to it beforehand?

65
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,130
Was that part of the decision or would
you have taken it otherwise? Well,

66
00:04:43,131 --> 00:04:47,990
it was certainly an added bonus because
Ian and I have been sort of fond

67
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:50,750
acquaintances for maybe 20 years,

68
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,010
but have never really spent any time
together other than through our mutual

69
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:57,410
friend Armistead muffin.
So,

70
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,160
and we were both in the television version
of [inaudible], right? I mean, yeah.

71
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,740
So,
um,

72
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,220
I've played a tiny part in one of the
episodes and we didn't meet, but yeah,

73
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,293
technically live work.

74
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,190
Yeah. So we've known each other through,
through Arma said for a very long time.

75
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:17,660
So I was just happy to be able to have
the opportunity to claim him as my own

76
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:22,580
friends, which I was able to do.
So that's been a real joy. Well,

77
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:26,210
you've both been nominated for Academy
Awards when films you've done with bill

78
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:30,350
Condon. So did that have any part,
like I guess you're friends with,

79
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,740
with bell from long time ago and you've
worked with them and God than monster is

80
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:36,320
years and years back. Um, so how much,

81
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,600
how much did working with bill have in
your head towards your decision in coming

82
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,530
on to this bill? Oh, it was,

83
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,953
um,

84
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,470
you okay. You, you, you,

85
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:55,970
you wouldn't want to play a wonderful
part unless you felt there was something

86
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:59,600
going to guide you. Right? Yeah. Good
par. Part of the wonderful part is,

87
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:04,570
is that you're not exactly certain that
you've got to be able to play it. And, uh,

88
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,770
yeah.
If you are,

89
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:10,160
you're going to need help
and bill's there to help.

90
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,830
Did you approach this as two completely
different characters? Like the,

91
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:14,501
there's the,

92
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:18,760
the real life Sherlock Holmes who's
aging and frail and then there's actual,

93
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,230
I drew that

94
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,370
for the man.

95
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,190
Well, the vet, they are, they're the same
person. They've got the same name of the,

96
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:37,310
the, the sort of look alike, but one is
in his prime and one is in its decline.

97
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,360
And, uh, it's not as difficult as it,

98
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,400
but there's the,
there's the Sherlock Holmes in his prime,

99
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,140
that doctor that Dr. Watson has painted
him to be. And then when he actually is,

100
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:55,450
so there's in essence three different
characters. No. Oh, good. Sinking. Yes,

101
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,640
of course. You caught me certain
when a Sherlock Holmes said,

102
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:06,100
I'm nothing like the character that,
uh, uh, Watson portrayed the, that the,

103
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,140
that he's right. You may be wrong.
That's up for the oldest judgment.

104
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,400
Is that four characters,

105
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,240
there's a multilayered moving.

106
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,680
Yes, it was. So Mrs. Monroe,

107
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:21,390
the character has never appeared in any
Sherlock Holmes stories before. Have you,

108
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,900
did you enjoy that fact that you had
like a clean slate or would you have

109
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:29,070
preferred something to be there?
I didn't care one way or the other really.

110
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,320
It was, she's, she's, she's,

111
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,600
she's got spirit, this Monroe, you know,

112
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:41,601
and she's been through a lot and
she's tired and she's scared and she's

113
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,350
grieving and you know, there's just a
lot there to play. Right. You know, so,

114
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:54,150
and the fact that it's a new constellation
of people around a Sherlock Holmes

115
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:55,920
that we haven't seen it.
It's fun.

116
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,990
And uh, uh, it being a
British town, of course,

117
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:05,880
it concerned with class
social class and there's this,

118
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,810
there's a privileged man,
right.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Homes just taking advantage of is
Brian and his capacity for hard work.

120
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:19,090
That's true. But you're just feel life
hasn't been too difficult for him too,

121
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,280
to find himself in the position where
he can be fulfilled but pour owed a

122
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,820
working cold.

123
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,140
No.
Oh

124
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,160
No,
I got it absolutely wrong.

125
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:41,670
So it was a lot of makeup
for Mrs. Monroe. Uh, yeah.

126
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,240
Doesn't have the advance.
You just had to make her own way.

127
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:48,390
And she's a widow and she's got
a a little boy. She loves him.

128
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,480
It's just trying to do, trying to do
her best but against the odds. And so,

129
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,460
yeah,

130
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,980
and the fact that this takes place

131
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,330
after the war and thinking about all of
the women who were war widows and what

132
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:05,331
that did to an entire generation
of women who lost their husbands,

133
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:10,911
who then all of a sudden
had to be employed and in
areas that maybe they weren't

134
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:13,800
qualified for. I mean, misses
Monroe's not the greatest housekeeper.

135
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,890
She's clearly not a good cook and
she doesn't enjoy it. You know,

136
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,430
that these women found themselves having
to do things out of desperation in

137
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:24,480
order to support themselves. And, and if
they were lucky enough to have children,

138
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,770
um, you know, they had to raise
their children on their own. So it's,

139
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,390
and I had never sort of a why I had never
thought about that, but I, but I hadn't,

140
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,020
you know, that whole, and all those
women who then had to, they had to move,

141
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,010
they had to migrate.
They couldn't stay where they were.

142
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,960
They had to give up their homes. They, you
know, it was a, it was not an easy time.

143
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,580
I lived in the north of England and his
relative to safe parts of the country

144
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:52,380
during the Second World War.
Uh, and we, we had, um, uh,

145
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:57,630
did they call evacuees a mother
and two kids came up from London.

146
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,820
That's the husband behind a firefighter.

147
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,220
And they just came and lived
with us for a year stored.

148
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,180
One of things that we did,
uh,

149
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,340
and homes has just gone through the wall.

150
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,680
He wouldn't know that the war it happened.
As far as he's concerned,

151
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:14,130
he's just been, I've just be, his husband

152
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,630
lives come to an end.
And what does he do?

153
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:21,970
He goes off to Japan not to investigate
the Hiroshima that comes in as a

154
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:24,060
surprise to them that they'll,
that used to give you some,

155
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:28,280
that they plan to keep himself alive. He's
a really, really, really selfish purse.

156
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,810
Right. Uh, and so

157
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,760
I think, I think Mr Monroe's bitterness
is absolutely understandable, but

158
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,670
homes is, selfishness is not right. Uh,

159
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,060
and it's nice. Moran, it's a tad isn't it?

160
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,810
At the end they come together,
she gets some sort of security.

161
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,850
She gets her son's love back as it were,
and um,

162
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,990
and homes discovers that he's got a
heart and then they hold hands done.

163
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:05,350
So speaking of, of the family unit, what
was it like working with Milo Parker?

164
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,760
He's a 10 at the time,
right?

165
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,260
I think it might've been 11. I'm not, I
don't, I'm not quite sure. He's a dcis.

166
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,390
Tiny, sweet sprite of a boy. And
uh, he is, he's just adorable.

167
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:23,760
He's got that face and um,
Oh god, that face that,

168
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,480
that face that can look very, very old and
very, very young at the time, you know,

169
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:32,560
and he's, you know, I've been very
lucky in that. I've worked with,

170
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,050
I don't know about you, but I've worked
with wonderful children. You know,

171
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:39,760
there's that old saying never. We don't
work with animals and children and, and I,

172
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,800
I've really loved the,

173
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,510
the kids that I've worked with and my
low is from a wonderful family and has,

174
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:46,891
comes to,

175
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:51,770
came to work everyday cheerful and wanting
to learn and happy to be there. And,

176
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:54,250
and uh, you know, I had
a great phone with Milo.

177
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,210
You flirted a lot with the makeup

178
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,850
roommate.

179
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,360
If anybody in the audience has questions
a step up to these mikes. We're,

180
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,140
we're running a little short on time
so we can cut to the audience Q and a

181
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:16,000
pretty quickly here. Um,
yeah, watching, watching Milo,

182
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,710
I believe. Uh, it's always,

183
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:20,440
it's always so interesting to me because
I feel like with a child actor with a

184
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:23,410
story this deep that,
that children, children,

185
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:27,100
actors and maker can make or break a
story for me because they're either like

186
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,570
indicating or they're being the
character, right? So I think he did.

187
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,220
There's no question here.
I'm just telling you,

188
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:34,570
I think he did an extremely good job.

189
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,110
He did. And I'm, uh, I will say, and I
hope if Marla, which are here, the, she,

190
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:43,200
he wouldn't take it wrong.
You know, when you're acting,

191
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,160
you concerned with yourself that, that
that's it. That's your responsibility.

192
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,920
You shouldn't be worrying
about other people.

193
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,320
And what I was worried about Milo,
cause I,

194
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,670
although I was getting the performance
and he was responding and doing what was

195
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:00,750
suggested and I thought,

196
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,260
I don't see this performance is really
quite as vibrant lit on the moment as it

197
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:11,550
should be. Well, I was wrong

198
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,450
and I shouldn't demean bothering him out,
man.

199
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,530
I should have been getting on with my,

200
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,290
my own performance and
learn something from that.

201
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:24,230
So I was surprised when I saw
it. Uh, it was the same one, a,

202
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:26,580
a great English actress,

203
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,790
Sibyl Thorndyke who did very few firms
but was in Nazi Olivier's film called the

204
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:38,500
sleeping prince, I think, or something
like that with Marilyn Monroe, Monroe.

205
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,440
I did these,
are these names familiar to you or not?

206
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,420
Yeah.

207
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,140
Not Simple Song. No. Perhaps, but a
certain amount of Monroe and that she was

208
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,680
Sundeck sands two friends and the dreaded,
but this woman can't act.

209
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:56,020
I'm talking about Marilyn Monroe.
She's not giving you a performance.

210
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:59,470
I can't hear this absolute disaster.

211
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,070
And she saw the firm and realized that
her own performance was the disaster

212
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,420
because it was too big for
the camera. The, the genius,

213
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:12,421
which was a of the relationship
between Marlyn Monroe and the camera,

214
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:16,630
which unmatched really had passed by.

215
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,750
Uh, even the Eagle. I have an, uh,

216
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,620
an experienced actor and I've,

217
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,400
I'm afraid it was a bit like
that with me and Myla. Anyway,

218
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,560
he's a star now. He's working
with Spielberg, isn't it? Yeah.

219
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,053
Okay.

220
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:41,110
Sure. Thank you both so much for being
here. I really enjoyed the film. Uh,

221
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,040
and fun fact,

222
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,100
whenever I'm asked the question of if
you were to have lunch with one living

223
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,260
person, um, it's there,
Ian Mckellen. So I'm like

224
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,280
my one, uh, I think

225
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,810
back to when I was a musician in high
school and I had these moments that I

226
00:14:56,811 --> 00:15:00,080
would call really poignantly
memorable, um, during a performance,

227
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:03,890
whether it was a certain string of music
or a certain or a certain piece that

228
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:07,490
gave me kind of, you know, Google apps
on the IPAD. I have a checkered past.

229
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,020
I played the Tuba for many years.

230
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,340
There was an orchestra and I had these
moments and I was wondering if each of

231
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:16,880
you would share a moment in your
acting career where, you know,

232
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:20,150
you may refer back to a scene that you
performed in and every time you watch it

233
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,240
you get those, you know, hairs on
the back of your neck stand up.

234
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,910
That was something that was very
poignantly memorable to you.

235
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,320
I can't stand to watch myself. Oh yeah.
I just, I just can't, I can't take it.

236
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,960
Or how about in the moment of that
in memory of the theater is, is,

237
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,940
is it totally different
situation. Um, I just,

238
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,370
I have a very hard time watching myself.

239
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:48,200
I love watching everybody
else in the movie, but I'm
the, um, but for memories of,

240
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,800
of being the theater, there's
a bunch of them, you know,

241
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,090
and they don't happen very often,
but when they do,

242
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:57,320
and they usually happen within like
ten second periods of feeling like, oh,

243
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,820
that everything aligns perfectly. And
there's this wonderful sense of system of,

244
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,870
of suspense where you've completely
stopped working on the play and the place

245
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,240
completely working on
you and it served as,

246
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:12,200
carries you through in a
way of really is thrilling.

247
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,310
And I did a production of the crucible
with Liam Neeson and I think they did.

248
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,810
I have wonderful memories of that.
That's my answer.

249
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,840
Yeah. Well, the film
close to my heart, uh,

250
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,620
is one that I

251
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,020
helped to write over the age of William
Shakespeare, but she's the said that,

252
00:16:34,021 --> 00:16:38,010
and I also produced it.
And without my efforts it wouldn't,

253
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,980
we wouldn't have raised
the funds to make it.

254
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:46,010
And so I [inaudible] I hadn't at that
point really played much within a success

255
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,360
for the cinema. Um, I,

256
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,080
I did have the idea that the first,
the opening speech of

257
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,490
the play on the film,
uh,

258
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,830
now as the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer by the Son of York

259
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,800
should be a public speech,
uh, to his brother,

260
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,690
uh, newly made king. And of course
he wants to be king himself, Richard,

261
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,390
but we don't know that is
not in those opening lines.

262
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,030
And halfway through that
rather than long speech,

263
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:23,290
I knew from having paid it in the theater,
there was a t a change in tone.

264
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,800
The public speech suddenly turns private.
I met the owners.

265
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,630
Shakespeare could do this. Yeah. I mean,

266
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,290
you catch your breath when you're doing
it every night and you realize this is

267
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:42,970
the moment when you got to take the whole
audience into your insides and, and,

268
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,560
and, and uh, let them
know that. All right.

269
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,130
And I had the idea that

270
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,290
that halfway through
the speech in the movie,

271
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,820
we would go from the public situation
to enter the most private place of all

272
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,630
really,
which is the place where you urinate.

273
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,800
So suddenly in the middle of the
speech, uh, the public man is,

274
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,420
he's,

275
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:14,420
he's deformed his undoing his
flies and having a pee and when I,

276
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,620
every time I see it, and I don't say that
up, but I think what I'm really excited

277
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,560
yeah.

278
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,530
Sit on my a website I think.

279
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,643
Yeah.
Over here.

280
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,153
Um,

281
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,910
I have a question on how much leverage
do as an actor do you have of changing

282
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:40,380
things in the script? For example,
like along the movie we learn that hey,

283
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:45,530
show homes learns that logic alone doesn't
really solve the problem it solves in

284
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,550
on paper,

285
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,350
but not really salt because the woman
died and the husband was really angrily

286
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,970
looking at homes and homes feels guilt
and related that he hasn't really solved

287
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,893
the case.

288
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:03,290
So in when he went homes does is isn't
quite the contrary to what you would

289
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,280
probably expect an like
Sherlock Holmes to do.

290
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,140
I would like Sherlock Holmes to say,
Hey,

291
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,130
I learned something to do and
apply it to a new case rather than,

292
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,580
that kind of like was a let down
for me. Like, hey home. So the hero,

293
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:20,670
like I was like thinking
of that and they're, oh no,

294
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:24,890
why is he on get taking on so much guilt
and running away from everything? Um,

295
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,080
as an actor, if I just say hi, did
you get the script and say, Hey,

296
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:30,810
I'm not going to play this home,
so I'll probably going to change it.

297
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,430
He should be a hero.

298
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:40,370
Well, I started acting, uh,

299
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,010
and I've gone on acting with
total respect for the script.

300
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,223
Uh,

301
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,790
that's all you have to say.
Yeah. I mean, we are acting.

302
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,340
We, we don't initiate it
really rare circumstances.

303
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,140
We rather do anyway.
And if you're dealing with Shakespeare,

304
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,540
this is the map the master.

305
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:09,640
And if it's checkoff Anton Chekhov,
even in translation, these,

306
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:14,330
these are the words, this is what you
have to play with. And it must have this,

307
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:19,540
if you're doing a play by a, a new,
uh, a new play or an old play much,

308
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,190
the authors long dead,

309
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,300
you must rehearse it with the assumption
that any minute now he might come back

310
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,580
from the bathroom and say,
what you doing?

311
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,080
And that being, so that's my
training, uh, that, that site,

312
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,600
it's the same one. I read the
script, the other film. No Way.

313
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,830
Okay.

314
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,580
Do I have confidence that
I could contribute anything
to a script that's been

315
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:48,880
gone over maybe for two,
three or four years by a writer?

316
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,730
Uh,
and

317
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,090
however Lord of the Rings I,

318
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,880
I had to, I had him my,
uh, pocket. Sure. Out.

319
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:05,180
And sometimes when I'm striding
across Middle East, the, the, the,

320
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,770
the GAM catches and you could
see that inside here is the,

321
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,660
the big thick three volume
paperback at Lord of the Rings.

322
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:16,770
Because I was always referring to it.
[inaudible] seem to be detraction,

323
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,690
not you've missed out a line here that

324
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,850
I never got my own way. And uh, uh,

325
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,760
and I did point out to him that a Gandalf
in the book never says you shall not

326
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:39,174
pass.

327
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,820
He says you cannot pass.
It's not as good as it.

328
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,540
So we have time for one
last question over here.

329
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,233
I know,
I know.

330
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,520
So I guess my question is kind of serious
and now I feel bad that it's the last

331
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:00,354
one.

332
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,590
One other, there's one other person behind
her. Okay. We did two more questions.

333
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:06,690
Yeah. Do you talk to your
people? I'm okay with that.

334
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,050
I was just wondering,
uh,

335
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:15,390
so Siri and in the movie you're playing
like Sherlock who's like a bit older

336
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:19,480
than you are like 20 years
older than you or something.

337
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,990
Yes.

338
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,130
Uh,
sorry.

339
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,060
I was just wondering if like playing
characters who are like pretty old and I

340
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:32,500
thought Sherlock was going to die,

341
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:36,280
if that like gives you any
sort of existential crises

342
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:41,380
or if it's
because that's how I would react.

343
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:43,360
I Dunno.
What was the question?

344
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,440
Did playing someone old make
you existentially scared?

345
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,630
I find the older I get, the
less scared I got. I've had,

346
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,600
I'm not scared of dying. I'm
dying is a part of life, isn't it?

347
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:00,390
Okay.

348
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,220
I'm frank to solves up lots of promise,

349
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,650
but you know, I just, dude, I don't
have you died a lot as an actor.

350
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,120
Not a lot. No, but as you get
older, you'll know. Yeah, no,

351
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,980
I'm died twice that I can think of. Yeah,
there you go. Don't do it. There's more,

352
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,930
more troubled marriages that I've
done a lot of time, but I've,

353
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,790
but I've died twice, but I, I've
done quite a lot. And it's a puzzle.

354
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:38,560
It's a puzzle just to what to do
because I haven't actually seen.

355
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,550
And the body and the animal

356
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,333
die.

357
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,670
Well, we've all seen
actress dying. I'm it.

358
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,720
And I think what would be wonderful to do

359
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,850
on stage is for you to sync.

360
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,190
Got The actor has died.

361
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,420
It just managed to say the last line
of the part and then didn't year die on

362
00:24:09,421 --> 00:24:11,560
stage. Did he? Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

363
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,670
And um, I ran, Ryan died
onstage. Few people of it. Yeah.

364
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,930
But the trick of it would be that he
hasn't really died, but he was holding it.

365
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,510
Okay.

366
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,670
I did. I did see a David
Bradley and the road shows

367
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,180
national sales or production of Henry
the fourth part, two by Shakespeare.

368
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,740
And he's playing the old king.

369
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,820
How does she mom seen long specie and
who said that he had to a day he had to

370
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:52,500
die now. So he leaves the
stage to die. And I don't,

371
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,810
I'm witnessing my friend David Bradley,
he's dying,

372
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,620
not going to make it to
the wings. Um, when they,

373
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,110
when the Messenger came and
said the king is dead. Oh Wow.

374
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,430
That's wonderful,
isn't it?

375
00:25:07,431 --> 00:25:09,890
Maybe you imagine if we could
act height that all the time.

376
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,340
Guess the answer your question.
Does that answer your question?

377
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,090
All right now for real.
Last question.

378
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:30,250
Okay, thanks. I just love this
film so much. It was so good.

379
00:25:30,251 --> 00:25:33,460
And one of the things that blew me away
and I'm going to have to go away and

380
00:25:33,461 --> 00:25:38,461
think about is all the levels that we
saw of both reality and the direction of

381
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:41,560
the narrative. Because Laura,
your part, you were the beginning,

382
00:25:41,561 --> 00:25:45,110
the middle and end in what was the
films present time. And Sir Ian,

383
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:50,111
you were had a nonlinear existence and
you had to decide for yourself as an

384
00:25:50,141 --> 00:25:52,240
actor what was real and what was not.

385
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:57,250
So I guess are those things that that
drew you to this and and in condoms work

386
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:59,740
you see this a lot like in
gods and monsters as well.

387
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:04,741
There's what is reliable about
memory and how do you deal with that?

388
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,620
Sure. Hi. Good. That's
why she has a playwright

389
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,970
that's play right now. Yeah. Yeah. Uh,

390
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,690
it's, um, it's, um,

391
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,160
bill condoms, men for movers. I can
just think off the top of my head.

392
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:29,660
Got Gods and monsters. Uh, Kinzie.

393
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,220
Um, the, um, um, uh,

394
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:38,990
sounds moving on the fifth
estate. Yes. This the state.

395
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,490
Uh,
and now Mr. Holmes,

396
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:44,790
I'm the essential cat is brilliant,

397
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,410
uniquely, uh, achieving.

398
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,290
And I bet mad

399
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,080
bill wants to know where that comes from.
Funny isn't it?

400
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,880
And Amanda who likes nothing better
than to a director, a musical. I mean,

401
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,920
he's doing a beauty and the beast
and the iron minutes. I play a clock,

402
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:13,150
but I'm this, I'm that matter of,
of memory that, that, that has all,

403
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:15,710
all the parts of it.
And A, I don't know. Um,

404
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,110
I'm not sure I could, I
could answer it. There's,

405
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,510
there's something amazing
when you work in this is,

406
00:27:21,511 --> 00:27:23,370
I think one of the reasons
why we love working with bell.

407
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:26,190
We can look at a script,
which is sort of like a blueprint for us.

408
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:31,170
It sort of like an architect who does a
blueprint, a score for musicians. It's,

409
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:35,910
it's sort of the basic thing that we
then go into and we try and are our brain

410
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:37,290
sort of works like chess people.

411
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:40,620
We can sort of look through it the way
that someone who's playing chess can go

412
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:42,000
from move to move to move to move.

413
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,420
But what bill does is that he has not
only a narrative mind and an understanding

414
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:51,690
of the technicalities of film
production and also what actors do,

415
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,840
but he has a cinematic mind and I am
constantly amazed at how he tells a story

416
00:27:58,471 --> 00:28:02,900
cinematically and thematic Lee is this
stuff that you've just, and how he ties,

417
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,050
you know,
the visual and the the thematic together.

418
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,350
And that's what really great
filmmakers do. And it's always sort of,

419
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,700
I mean cause we're not aware that that's
happening when we're working on it.

420
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,000
You know, when you see we work at
scene to scene, to scene, to scene,

421
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:20,280
and we have our own arcs and we see,
you know,

422
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,460
hopefully you think beyond your own
arc and how does my character help this

423
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:27,300
character move into the next scene and
all those sorts of things. But then I,

424
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,880
and then when you actually see a movie
that's visually also told in the way that

425
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:36,690
only film can do, you know, it's really,
you're like, oh my God, I had no idea.

426
00:28:36,691 --> 00:28:41,580
That was like, wow. So, and
that's certainly, you know,

427
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,840
this movie was the first time
I saw it. You know, it's,
it's so visually beautiful.

428
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:51,110
Beautiful. So it's, it's uh, it's
been a joy to be a part of. Yay.

429
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:51,983
Yeah.

430
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,360
Before we say goodbye [inaudible]
can I say something please? No,

431
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,470
nothing to do with Mr Hubs.

432
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,510
Okay.
Um,

433
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,220
when that, when that,
when that was a land, mmm.

434
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,840
And I wanted to know something.
Okay.

435
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,510
Uh,
a fact or

436
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,560
a definition perhaps
definition is relatively easy.

437
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,210
Yeah.

438
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:33,130
Because we have a dictionary.
My dictionary at home is one of the,

439
00:29:33,131 --> 00:29:35,290
my most precious
possessions. I, I love it.

440
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,133
Read it again

441
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,980
about something that I couldn't access
at home and we had lots of books that

442
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,860
have,
I would catch a bus

443
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,850
into town,
the number two or the number four

444
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:54,730
and hope I got the times right and go
to the library and it'd be a reference

445
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:58,360
library of course.
And I would stand in line there,

446
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,780
Joe speaking alive,
everything was conducted in whispers,

447
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,970
have you got to book,

448
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,750
come sit down.

449
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,270
So I'd sit down and 15 minutes later she
would have done her job and she would

450
00:30:18,271 --> 00:30:21,570
have gone and collected a series of
books which she thought might concern the

451
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:25,500
answer to my question and their
beer, you know, a pile of books.

452
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,440
And I think there's some times brought
on a trolley and I was given a desk and I

453
00:30:28,441 --> 00:30:32,970
was allowed to sit at it. And I'm
speaking, no marking the books of course,

454
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,550
no indication, no little posted, most new,

455
00:30:35,551 --> 00:30:40,551
we just had to go through these books
and maybe I'm the seventh book outward,

456
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,940
find what I was looking for.

457
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,463
Hmm.

458
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,800
And then I had to catch the bus back home.

459
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,443
Google.

460
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,450
It's the biggest change in my life.
Uh, and it's a change, I think,

461
00:30:56,451 --> 00:30:58,460
without any regrets,

462
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,540
except you never have the joy
of doing all the work yourself.

463
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:11,120
You know, when you finally get
that in the book and there it is

464
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,760
and it's yours, you'll
never, ever, ever forget it.

465
00:31:16,761 --> 00:31:18,230
Those are the people who do all the words.

466
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:23,350
[inaudible]

467
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,900
do you go to the light,

468
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,790
ladies and gentlemen?
Laura Linney and Sir Ian McKellen.

469
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,860
[inaudible].
