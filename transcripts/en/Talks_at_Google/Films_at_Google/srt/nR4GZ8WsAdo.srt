1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,960
Thank you so much for being here

2
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,080
guys. Have a seat. Let's chat.

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,230
I know this is Google cause
we're miked right here.

4
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:20,800
Might all this tech is here and
cameras are all set up. It's, you know,

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,240
a Google the place. So, um, first
of all, welcome to Google Chicago.

6
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:29,710
We are so excited to have you guys
here. This movie is incredible. Um,

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,400
I guess I really shouldn't be saying
welcome to Chicago for you because you are

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,080
kind of a Chicago Guy, right? Yep.

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,770
I lived here 11 years.

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,960
Incredible. Yeah. Any love to hear?

11
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:43,320
I mean obviously you've done some amazing
work around Chicago stories, right?

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,930
Whole food barbershop.
Yeah.

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,070
Yup. Roll bounce. Right. I did about
at least about six, seven movies here.

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,580
Actually, one thing I'm very proud of
with my business partner Bob title,

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,670
when Obama was here, um, you know,

16
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,840
he actually greenlit the
tax incentive for film.

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,330
So we were one of the first major
guys to allow five, you know,

18
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,890
movies to come to Chicago with
a nice discount for a filmmaker.

19
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,610
So I was really proud of
that. Wild is, yeah. Yeah.

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,880
That's just incredible to me.

21
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:17,720
And so one of the things that I see as
a consistent theme through some of your

22
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:22,040
films is the fact that you have a pension
for telling stories about the culture,

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,180
all sides of the culture, right? You know,
you get your sadness and your happiness,

24
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:29,870
you get the joy and that's a lot of what
we get in the hate you give. So yeah.

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,500
Tell me, what about this book and
the screenplay drew you to it.

26
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:35,480
Why did you want to tell
this story specifically?

27
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,490
Yeah. What I really love about it was
it was specifically about the culture,

28
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:42,040
about this young girl and her family.
You know,

29
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,260
the ideal of navigating
between the two worlds.

30
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,590
So the ideal of her struggling and
then that being compromised when she

31
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:51,490
witnessed the shooting of her best friend.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,700
I just thought that was an
interesting character arc.

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,040
But what I love is how the family is
always centered and no matter how tough

34
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:03,130
things get,
no matter how you know,

35
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:07,630
people in the neighborhood telling her
not to say anything about the shooting or

36
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,870
how much pressure she feels
from the police department
and how much pressure she

37
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:15,550
feels from her white friends,
her white private school,

38
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,810
she just push us and it makes the
film has this emotional rollercoaster.

39
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,460
Where are you going
through all these emotions?

40
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,110
That's what I really imagine envision
for the movie. When I talked to Angie,

41
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:29,620
because her book was very amazing,
but what I really love is how,

42
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:35,070
which I find really significant is that
you can tell a movie about this specific

43
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:38,290
culture,
but it can be for everyone.

44
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,670
You can do it with a way where
you're not compromising who we are.

45
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,830
And I think that's the key.
Yeah,

46
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,250
and that's one of the things that was
the most beautiful about it. I mean,

47
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,970
it's the kind of movie that can speak
to a range of audiences and really

48
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:54,810
welcomes them in with open arms,
which is so incredible and hard to do.

49
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:59,290
I think so. Amandla for you.
What brought you to this movie?

50
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,100
So I hear

51
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,650
that you signed on even
before the book was published,

52
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,540
you were all in ready to go. This list
for you. How did you make that decision?

53
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,450
What connected you to star story?
Um,

54
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,900
what connected me to this story
was the book by Angie Thomas.

55
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,860
And if you haven't read it,

56
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,740
I highly recommend that you do because
it is so beautiful. Second that, um, uh,

57
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,260
yeah,

58
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,260
I was immediately just blown away by
this story and the power that it had in

59
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:30,811
depicting a nuanced experience of
blackness in a contemporary world.

60
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,100
I felt like not often are we afforded
those sorts of representations.

61
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,810
And so it was really exhilarating to me
to see this girl who was code switching,

62
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:45,300
you know, um, who was presenting
herself differently in
different spaces. Right. Um,

63
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,110
and then the way in which she's galvanized
towards activism because of these

64
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:54,730
really tragic events that we've often
become desensitized, desensitized to.

65
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,730
So to see those placed in a personal
narrative and to understand the power of,

66
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,100
you know,
instilling empathy in people through that.

67
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:05,020
But that's what really drew me to it.

68
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,060
And so you mentioned code switching and
that's a term that's kind of gaining

69
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:13,960
more and more attention as people are
trying to understand what it is to be a

70
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:18,100
person of color and two different spaces
in the world of white space and a black

71
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:18,820
space.

72
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,080
Can you explain a little bit more about
that and how star sees herself code

73
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:23,771
switching in the movie,

74
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:28,480
the specific situations that she feels
that she needs to make that change?

75
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,030
Yeah, sure. So I'm code
switching is, you know,

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,230
entering spaces that you know, you're
not necessarily fully accepted into.

77
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:42,940
And so understanding that the way that
you present yourself in that space might

78
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:46,810
be a little different from how you are
and your most authentic environment

79
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,840
because you understand that if you
present as authentically as you are,

80
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:57,340
it could be detrimental to your success,
unfortunately.

81
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,120
Or you can be further
alienated or isolated. Um,

82
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:03,620
which is something that everyone does,
you know,

83
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,990
and they're at home and probably a little
different than who you are at work or

84
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:12,160
at school. Um, but stars really
caught in this dichotomy,

85
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,940
which I actually experienced as well,
um,

86
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,240
of growing up in a
neighborhood that is black, um,

87
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,680
and has a lot less privileged than the
neighborhood that the kids at her school

88
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:28,040
are from because she goes to this school
an hour and a half across town. Um,

89
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,440
that's mostly white.

90
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,240
And so she's one of the only black
students there and she does a lot of self

91
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:39,220
policing because she knows that these
kids don't understand her experience of

92
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:43,330
blackness, don't understand her
community or who she is or her culture.

93
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,980
And so she figures out how to adjust
to that environment in order to be more

94
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,600
accepted.
Absolutely.

95
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,810
And so the way that that manifests in
the film is she has star version one and

96
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:58,910
star version two. And, and when
I first read it in the bucket,

97
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,110
it really just,

98
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,490
it registered in a way like I've never
seen it depicted like in any sort of

99
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:06,980
piece of media before. Um, where,

100
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:12,090
where star describes the experience of
feeling and hearing your voice change,

101
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:18,020
right? When you enter a space that
you're not most comfortable in a,

102
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,050
or at least when you enter a white
space in which you understand that your

103
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:26,060
blackness will not be understood.
Right.

104
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,810
So I've really connected to that
and this whole idea of star being,

105
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:33,140
you know,

106
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,760
kind of canonized by her
peers at school as a,

107
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,970
an accessible black girl,
as a nonthreatening black girl,

108
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,440
as a not like other black people,
black girl, you're different,

109
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,140
you're different. You're
not like them. Um,

110
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,560
which is just so kind of invalidating
and simplifies our existence in a way

111
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:55,760
that's really detrimental.

112
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,760
So it was so exhilarating to me to see
a portrayal of a black girl that was

113
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,920
actually reflective of our experiences.

114
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:08,921
And that was really expansive and all
encompassing and multifaceted because

115
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,840
oftentimes, you know, we're,

116
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,400
we're only given a certain amount
of tropes that were allowed to play.

117
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,330
It's a little box. Sometimes there's
a little box. Yeah. We can play, uh,

118
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,800
the humor. We can play the pain. Yeah.

119
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,350
But not often is it that
we get to be everything.

120
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,560
And so that's what was so exhilarating
about reading this character. Um,

121
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,960
you're right. And the unpublished
manuscript and wasn't out yet, but it was,

122
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,380
it was floating around because
people were so excited about it.

123
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,900
And I attached really early on

124
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,280
your heart latched on for sure.

125
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:48,470
My battery on that says something
about the work for sure. Yeah. Um,

126
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,160
another thing that I kind of want to
discuss, I mean it's super, super timely.

127
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:56,420
Obviously police brutality is on the
top of mind for so many people and

128
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:59,480
especially here in Chicago with
the case of [inaudible] Mcdonald's,

129
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,960
Jason Landegg just being
convicted for his murder. Um,

130
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,770
what is the importance of a movie like
this landing at this time? You know,

131
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:09,200
there's never a right time to,
to talk about the hard things,

132
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:14,201
but it seems like this is almost healing
in a way for this movie to happen right

133
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,730
now as some things are
changing in America.

134
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,360
Yeah. I just felt like, um, you know,
it was just that we were just in,

135
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,990
I was just telling a Madela like when
we were in Atlanta last week and, um,

136
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,820
and we finished the screening and someone
tapped me on my shoulder and I turned

137
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:35,730
around, he asked, can we take
a picture? And I was like,
yeah, we can take a picture.

138
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:38,550
And he'd like, thank you so
much for the movie. And he said,

139
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:43,410
we are the family of Emmett till.
And, and I was like, you know,

140
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:46,980
just kind of blow me away. It was
the whole family, like six of them.

141
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,380
And I just think back to, you know,
Ayman Til being here from Chicago,

142
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,860
going down to Mississippi. You
know, he had sort of the early,

143
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:59,070
because his mom was telling him how
to act down in Mississippi. Right.

144
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,710
And how to conduct yourself as a
little different from down there.

145
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,650
So that talk is something that
you progress over the years.

146
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:07,380
It probably was started through
slavery, you know, when,

147
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,230
when we were free and how do
you act around certain people.

148
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:15,030
So I just felt like it was very important
for other cultures to be able to

149
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:16,260
recognize and see that,

150
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,800
you know the talk to some people
it's like the birds and the bees,

151
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,970
but for us or African Americans or
people of color, it's a difference.

152
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,240
So I'm in a young girl like star,

153
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:29,790
just have to navigate
and keep pushing through.

154
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,000
She's very much of the world
and know how to interact.

155
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:37,530
I don't know how to move inside her guard
heart hikes world, but she has another,

156
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:39,720
we have these other
things on this as well.

157
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,510
So a lot of that is just to let people,
as Angie was say,

158
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,520
who wrote the book is to have empathy,

159
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:49,521
what people go through and
also recognizing how did
these things happen and in

160
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:53,370
the shooting of the cop,
why did he react the way he react?

161
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:57,450
We talked about that and we see it from
a black cop perspective with comments

162
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,240
and we'll see sometimes is
not that much of a difference.

163
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,920
So when you think about that, it has
to be the system, right? The system.

164
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,260
How did they teach cops? What
did they, who are in charge,

165
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,820
who are the leaders inside
those departments? And we
don't condemn. We don't.

166
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,720
We just show what the reality
is so we can cause conversation.

167
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,330
I thought Commons character, uncle Carlos
was so unique. Like you were saying,

168
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:23,480
you don't often get the
perspective of a black cop.

169
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,620
I mean it's such an interesting
situation to be and where you know,

170
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,630
you see what the people are going through,

171
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:31,190
you understand you're part of the culture.

172
00:10:31,191 --> 00:10:34,790
And then also being kind of on the
other side of these are your coworkers,

173
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,580
these are your colleagues and
how do you speak up? So He's,

174
00:10:37,581 --> 00:10:39,040
he's so nuanced in that way.

175
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,860
Yeah, it is. It is true. I mean that's,
let's say all of us in this room,

176
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,600
we all have it inside of us.

177
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:48,050
I mean let's just take
comes character myself.

178
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,700
Like as an African American man,

179
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:52,550
it is a conversation that
we have had in rehearsals.

180
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:55,070
If I'm walking on the
south side of Chicago,

181
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,950
if I'm by myself as an
African American man,

182
00:10:57,951 --> 00:11:01,670
and if I see three African American guys
walking on the other side of the street

183
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:04,730
and they walk over here, I'm going
to think something's up, right?

184
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,560
I'm gonna move over to car,
cross the street.

185
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,500
So that's that own internal
racism that I have within myself,

186
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,750
within my own culture.
So that has to be broken.

187
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:15,620
That's what common realizes when
this young girl start confronts him.

188
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,270
And those are the kinds of
dialogues that the movie brings up.

189
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,160
You know what I mean?
On both sides.

190
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,333
Beautifully done.

191
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,730
I think Angie's,
you know,

192
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,760
intention with the book was to like
present these topics and these issues in a

193
00:11:29,951 --> 00:11:34,870
way that was, yeah, I've come that was
inclusive of different perspectives.

194
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,600
Um, that didn't further
perpetuated divisiveness, you know,

195
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,620
that grounded it in humanity and like
we always get asked about the timeliness

196
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:48,810
of this project. Yeah. But the thing is,
has been timely for a really long time.

197
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:53,500
Waste unfortunately, will
probably be timely for awhile. Um,

198
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,410
but we always get asked is also
really interesting question.

199
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,260
Or I think last night we
got asked it, which was, um,

200
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,700
what is the role of an
artist in social movements?

201
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,450
Like what is the role of
the filmmaker? Um, you know,

202
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,480
when is it time to make art and then when
is it time to get up and go out in the

203
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:15,160
streets and protest. And, um,

204
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,430
and I think they're so
interconnected and both are so,

205
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,440
are so invaluable.

206
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,100
They weren't off of each other and they
work off of each other as, you know,

207
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:28,720
like art has always been one of the
driving forces are conduits for social

208
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,280
movements.
Absolutely.

209
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,390
Like they have like a really
beautiful symbiotic relationship.

210
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:39,391
And so I think that was the driving force
behind this pieces to make something

211
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:45,001
that in the midst of what feels like
chaos and what feels like times in which

212
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,300
things are postulated is
so black and white, right,

213
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,430
wrong versus right. Me versus
you, um, winner versus loser.

214
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,840
Uh,
I think it was,

215
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,550
it felt important to create something
that explored it in a way that would

216
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:05,551
ground us and what makes us most
human and understand that every single

217
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:08,230
experiences is multifaceted.

218
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:10,620
And it requires a,

219
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,250
in order for there to be any sort of
movement made or any progress made,

220
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:20,251
do you have to consider even your enemy
in a way that is not one dimensional.

221
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,480
Right. And it also comes down to empathy,
like you were saying before, just being,

222
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:29,740
um, being able to understand and look at
another side or perspective. Yeah. Um,

223
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,730
you mentioned the humanity in this, you
know, there's so much going on this movie,

224
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:34,750
there are so many themes,

225
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:38,500
but one of the things that I found really
interesting is your portrayal of the

226
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:43,140
black family. Right? Um, you don't get
a lot of that and TV. I mean we're,

227
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:46,870
we're starting to get there a little bit
more with shows like blackish and we're

228
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:48,120
normalizing it.
Um,

229
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,630
but maverick is such an
interesting character as well
because he is this father

230
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,910
who is so complex and you know,

231
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:58,120
he's done time and it wasn't
necessarily his fault,

232
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:01,960
but he's coming from this one life
that he had before and it's kind of

233
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:05,470
completely switching into a new
role and he's being a father. Um,

234
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,910
I'm interested to know what was the most
important thing to you when you were

235
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:14,911
portraying black masculinity and
fatherhood and the home in this movie?

236
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,270
Yeah. One of the things that,
um, that I love that, you know,

237
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:23,440
the perspective of having a father in the,
in a movie like this,

238
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:25,870
because you know,
when I look back,

239
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:29,650
I've been making films for for a little
bit since the 90 [inaudible] that full

240
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:31,900
out.
So when you look back at it,

241
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:36,700
I say some of the African American
characters that films that have African

242
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,540
American characters in it,

243
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,890
80 70% of them don't have a father figure
in the household was always a single

244
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:42,700
parent.

245
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,720
And that's not the case
in the neighborhood that I
grew up and I had fathers

246
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,420
next to me to the left or right of me.
It was a community.

247
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,830
The community actually raised everyone.

248
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,580
And that was always a barbershop like
Mr. Lewis and always a barbecue joint.

249
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,000
And like Mr Reuben, you know,
like, I don't know if, you know,

250
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,200
you noticed on the wall it was like he
would give kids free barbecue if they,

251
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:07,220
he sees their report cards and that's
the kind of re that's the kind of thing

252
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:11,200
that we wanted to bring community
back. Uh, one of the main thing is, um,

253
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,920
I love their relationship.

254
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:15,950
It was very strong in the book
between Matt and his daughter.

255
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,570
And I thought that was great.

256
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:22,571
And one of the things I love to say is
that the family has so much joy in it.

257
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,660
A, we had so many levels of
humor. Yeah. Believe it or not,

258
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:27,710
there's a lot of humor in that movie.

259
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,740
It'd be a lot of emotion and it's fun.
You will be entertained.

260
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,960
But it just were issues that
we see every day. And um,

261
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,840
I really do believe that film
is an entertaining venue.

262
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,890
That's why people pay to go see movies,
to be entertained. But the movie has that,

263
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:50,240
but you'd be able to relate to it because
there's the family and no matter all

264
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,430
of these obstacles they
keep pushing through.

265
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,880
They keep going through and at the
end we see star has her journey.

266
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:59,120
And that's the main thing that I'm
really proud of. That it was two parents.

267
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,710
They are very close. Yeah.
They talk about sex a lot.

268
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,320
Relationship grounds. Yeah.
Grounds them together.

269
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,460
I just had some memories.
I just had memories when I was,

270
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:17,960
we were doing a scene in the diner and
how the family after this big incident,

271
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:20,660
the families just hose the
hands together and they pray.

272
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,040
So to me that was a throwback to soulful
around the dinner table and the food.

273
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,260
And every,
and I even tell the actors to do it.

274
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:31,670
Everybody's just started overlapping,
talking dialogue, talking about food,

275
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:33,370
eat that hot sauce.
Don't put the hot sauce in there.

276
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,660
You better get to those
festivals for all that was just,

277
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,860
we're a family at the time.

278
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:41,070
Yeah. Yeah. And that's what makes for a
really authentic storytelling too. Um,

279
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,401
and you,

280
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:45,690
you mentioned the fun and the joy and the
humor and a lot of the things you were

281
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:50,280
shooting. How did you guys
maintain a sense of joy? You know,

282
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:53,310
I feel like black joy
and black excellence,

283
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:56,400
black happiness is so important
in terms of self care.

284
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,880
So like even when you're shooting
a scene that is so heavy,

285
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,160
that's emotionally charged,

286
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,600
how do you guys kind of come back and
find the joy in what you're doing? Well,

287
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:08,490
we have Regina Hall on sets,
right?

288
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:14,810
She has a jazz man. She's hilarious.
She always brought the joy,

289
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,550
all is brought the humor.
Um,

290
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:21,510
I think it's just kind of our natural
inclination to work through trauma that

291
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:24,210
way it's rely upon our humor and our joy.

292
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:29,211
And even though this experience was
so intense and traumatic at times,

293
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,770
yeah, there was always a sense of levity
and like all is a sense of community and

294
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:36,330
family.
Um,

295
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,390
and a feeling that if you really were
coming up against a wall emotionally and,

296
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,700
and you were tired and you know these
events and portraying them feel so heavy,

297
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,640
there's all this someone you could turn
to who would have your back. That's,

298
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,030
I think so

299
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,830
community and it's very finest.

300
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,730
Kind of having a nice family to shoot
with really helps with that kind of thing.

301
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,800
Yeah. Um, talking a little
bit more about, you know,

302
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,620
having that community and
that family all RMU onset, um,

303
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,010
in the movie,

304
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,780
I guess stars trying to figure out who
her community is even outside of her home.

305
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,650
So in her school I Williamson
Chris is a great character.

306
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:19,480
He's really interesting because he's
navigating allyship and trying to figure

307
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:22,270
out what that means for him,
how he fits into the scene,

308
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,440
how he fits into star's life.
Um,

309
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,170
if you guys had to I guess,

310
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,040
determine something that's important for
someone who is trying to become an ally

311
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,970
or trying to figure out how they can get
involved in movements and civil rights

312
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:41,350
and racial equality, what's
the first step? You know,
it, it can feel heavy right,

313
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:44,170
to, to step into a world you're not
used to and be like, you know what?

314
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,990
I'm with them.
How do you do that?

315
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,130
Um, one of my favorite lines when I,
when I read it in the script, it gave,

316
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,460
if I had this feeling of like a
retribution of like, oh my God,

317
00:18:55,461 --> 00:18:56,870
I wish I'd had this in high school,

318
00:18:56,871 --> 00:19:00,150
would have saved me so much
like internal strife. Um,

319
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,830
but there's this scene
where Chris says to star,

320
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,740
I don't see color.
I just see a person for who they are,

321
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:11,840
or like guys and star says,
if you don't see my blackness,

322
00:19:11,841 --> 00:19:13,850
you don't see me. Amen. Uh,

323
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:18,851
and that was so validating to read on the
page because I think there's this idea

324
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:21,560
that owner,
to be an ally,

325
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,390
you have to look at the
other person as your equal.

326
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,540
But almost as if in the process of
doing that, in order to do that,

327
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:34,190
you have to discredit the aspects of
them that are different or that make them

328
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,290
more marginalized than you.
Um,

329
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,940
when really it should be the opposite.

330
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,280
When you look at someone
wants to be an ally to them,

331
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:47,540
it's so important that you are inclusive
of all the aspects of their identity

332
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:52,300
that make them them and see them.
And the way in which, you know,

333
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,580
those aspects of self, uh, dictate or,

334
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,350
or influenced their experience cause the
idea of, you know, oh, I don't see color.

335
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:04,360
It's like, really that's a great, great
intention of course. For sure. Yeah.

336
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,400
But it also rests upon the assumption
that we live in a post racial post

337
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:13,700
identity is society. And we all know
that that's the case. I would love,

338
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,220
we would love that, but that's
not where we're at. So the king,

339
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:20,420
and I don't even know if it's possible
for be in a place that, you know,

340
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,860
it doesn't,
it doesn't use identity or as,

341
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,480
as a lens through which we
primarily look at each other.

342
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,480
So I think being an ally is
about looking at someone and,

343
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,700
and not being afraid of this comfort of,
oh,

344
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:42,360
this person is different than me. They're
experience is different than me. Uh,

345
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,770
it's not about trying to,
um,

346
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,910
postulate their experience
as equal to yours,

347
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:53,650
but rather like respecting it and all of
its differences. Testing, learning. Yeah.

348
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,190
Learning about it. And I really think
sometimes it's just about shutting up,

349
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,120
sending down, shutting up and
listening, open those ears. Uh, yeah.

350
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,910
Cause I think that's was
really, um, you know,

351
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,680
when there's a group of people who have
historically taken up the space and been

352
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:10,000
very comfortable in that,

353
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,800
it is very uncomfortable to no longer
take up that space or, or you know,

354
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,730
control it or kind of demand
that you take up most of it.

355
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:23,650
And so it's different what it
looks like, discomfort, um, to,

356
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,100
you know,

357
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,100
people who have historically had
privilege is often just equity.

358
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,150
Um,

359
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:35,150
and that's what's really essential for
Chris to understand is he needs to take

360
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:40,870
step back and not take up as much
space even in their conversations.

361
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:42,694
Right.
Um,

362
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:47,730
stars really assertive in and making sure
that he's listening to her and saying,

363
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:52,270
you know, actually this is my time to
talk and listen to me raise my story,

364
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,140
here's my story.

365
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:57,880
And so I think that's a huge part of
it is stepping back and being like, oh,

366
00:21:57,881 --> 00:22:00,760
I'm so used to taking up
all this space right here,

367
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,580
but actually let me step back.

368
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:07,930
I mean draw it back in and allow
this other person that the time,

369
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,370
um, and the space, he's in the word space
a lot in the time and the space, um,

370
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,500
to express themselves and express their,
their perspective.

371
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,460
Yeah. They're just like
two people. I'll be,

372
00:22:19,461 --> 00:22:23,810
there's two lines in a movie to define
that. How an ally can work, you know,

373
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:28,320
um, Sabrina Carpenter
plays Hayley, right? Eh,

374
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,850
she says who else is going to
speak up for our people? Girl is,

375
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:36,770
she's a white individual saying that.
And then you got shook my car. Yeah.

376
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:41,030
You got Kj. APPA who plays Chris
in his line is being an ally.

377
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,350
What do you want me to do? Where do
you want me to? What? How can I help?

378
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,191
Absolutely.

379
00:22:46,191 --> 00:22:49,820
So that shows the difference between the
two that we show two different sides.

380
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,540
One is about listening instead
of trying to follow somebody.

381
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,060
So being a part of it.
Yeah.

382
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,410
So, uh, one thing that's really
interesting is, you know,

383
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:04,060
as star is trying to figure out whether
or not she's going to use her voice and

384
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:04,720
speak up,

385
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,680
I mean we see that happening in
different ways in the world now with like

386
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:13,420
Hashtag activism, right?
So it's incredible that
we're using social media to,

387
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,710
to say their names and to learn more
about the stories that aren't really being

388
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:19,540
told without it.
Um,

389
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,840
but then bringing that into the real
world and taking another step is very

390
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:23,411
different.

391
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:28,411
So what advice do you have for
people who are learning to speak out,

392
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,080
who want to speak out,
who want to try and do something new,

393
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:36,490
but are kind of feeling that that little
bit of them that's holding them back.

394
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,690
What's the first step to,

395
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,360
to kind of opening yourself up
to trying something like that?

396
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:46,070
Hmm. Um, I really,

397
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,100
because I really love approaching activism
from a place of like art history and

398
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,920
humanity. And like when
Angie Thomas wrote this book,

399
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:56,690
she was still in college,

400
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,160
she was writing it on her lunch break,
lunch break.

401
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,770
That story too. There was a short, so
it's, sorry. Yeah. You know, she was

402
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,970
someone who is active socially active
on the Internet but wanted to find a

403
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:14,380
conduit through which she could express
it further or take the next step.

404
00:24:14,381 --> 00:24:17,380
And for her that ended up writing a novel.
Okay.

405
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,180
I know they run it up and that that
has now been New York Times number one

406
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:23,770
bestseller for 83 weeks.

407
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,500
You know lievable I'm not saying
that's going to happen to it,

408
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,840
but I'll name find your own lane.
But I feel like I'm,

409
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,110
I dunno,
I really believe in the power of,

410
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:37,670
of expressing your activism
through your artistry.

411
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,600
And this was such a beautiful opportunity
cause it was this like synchronistic

412
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:46,500
like beautiful thing where everything
came together and we able to marry all of

413
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:51,270
the things that we cared
about. Um, and I feel like, um,

414
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,580
yeah, it's about expressing yourself
and whatever conduit that may be,

415
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,980
you know? Right. And so we,

416
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:02,160
I think we have some audience
questions coming up for you guys.

417
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,230
Two quick questions
before we have to that.

418
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,230
And you guys can kind of start lining
up at the mic if you have any questions

419
00:25:07,231 --> 00:25:07,530
you want.
Okay.

420
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,040
Ask. Um, on a lighter
note for both of you guys,

421
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,520
you being a Chicago guy,
having lived here for so many years,

422
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,890
what's one of your favorite
places to eat in the city?

423
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,340
You know what, they got one and they
have one in Atlanta, but it's this, yeah,

424
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,020
this is not the same, but
right down on Wabash, you know,

425
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,720
right in front of Columbia college
was Harold's chicken. Okay.

426
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,840
Always still stop by when you buy.
Could we,

427
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,070
yeah, my wife. Can we stop by?

428
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,140
It's a classic. Okay.
And then for you, um,

429
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,170
I heard that your Harry
Potter fandom is real. Yes.

430
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,020
My heart is just skipping a beat as one.

431
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,660
So I want to know nothing to do with
the movie. Just my own curiosity.

432
00:25:54,661 --> 00:25:59,630
If you had a patronus, what would it be?
Oh my God, that's so challenging. Um,

433
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,530
take a second. I'll start with
mine. It'd be a dolphin fan.

434
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:06,750
That's accurate, right?
That's good. Right?

435
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,930
I would like to think that moms
would be like a deer or something,

436
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:14,610
but I feel like it would
probably be like a mouse. Hey,

437
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:16,800
they're cute though.
And real fast.

438
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,820
Just never know anybody with questions.

439
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:24,540
Anyone who wants to ask anything.
If not, I will keep on going.

440
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:27,210
Don't tell me what the good time.
Do you want step up to the mic over here?

441
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:28,350
Okay.

442
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:33,060
So my question is, you talked about
really living this dichotomy, life,

443
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:33,840
uh,

444
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,840
grown up from where you are and then
having to really change that persona when

445
00:26:39,151 --> 00:26:40,200
you go to school.

446
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:44,540
And I think about like Keith Stanfield
and sorry to bother you in the movie.

447
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:46,890
Now he switched to his white voice,
right?

448
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:50,280
Because he had to work and yet to
pretty much change the environment.

449
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,570
So I'm curious to know,

450
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:56,571
how have you been able to navigate your
life in your professional career where

451
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:01,980
you might have to change a mannerism a
little bit and kind of juxtaposing that

452
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:04,620
with your actual environment
from where you are back home.

453
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:09,000
How are you able to navigate through the
waters and kind of live two different

454
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:09,834
personalities?

455
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,583
Um,

456
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,860
and you know,

457
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,050
I mean I started going to that
school and I was 10 years old. Um,

458
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:28,800
so for me for a long time I had this
idea that there was something wrong with

459
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:32,260
code switching and that,

460
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,350
that there was something wrong with me
for having kind of this multi faceted

461
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,680
personality that shifted
depending on who I was around. Um,

462
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,650
and it kind of took me until I was a
bit older to understand that there's

463
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,230
nothing wrong with that and that
that's pretty natural considering the

464
00:27:50,231 --> 00:27:55,050
circumstances. Uh, I used
to hate that, that, that,

465
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,090
that I had to make myself smaller, um, or,

466
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,590
or change who I was in order to feel
more accepted into that environment.

467
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:07,591
But learning that language of whiteness
and privilege has actually been really

468
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:12,510
invaluable to me when it comes
to navigating Hollywood, uh,

469
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:17,410
who would have thunk
it? So, so it's a tool.

470
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,970
It's a tool at the end of the day,

471
00:28:18,971 --> 00:28:23,470
I don't necessarily look at it any
more as having to compromise myself.

472
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:28,480
I also have kind of witnessed the shift
happening where we are living in a

473
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:33,481
culture that is so transparently driven
by black culture and by blackness that

474
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,220
I'm starting to notice that even in
my spaces of work within my industry,

475
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,580
if I show up to that space
authentically as myself,

476
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,270
I seem to be more accepted than
I ever happened in the past.

477
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,430
And there seems to be this kind
of push for in inclusivity. Um,

478
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,800
that is new.
Um,

479
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:58,240
and I'm so I feel like I have to
compromise myself less and less. Um,

480
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:03,070
but I'm just more accepting of all the
different parts of me and the way that

481
00:29:03,071 --> 00:29:08,071
they manifest in my mannerisms or
the way I talk all wrapped up nicely.

482
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:10,780
Okay.

483
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,480
Oh,
thank you guys so much for being here.

484
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,200
We are just honored to be able
to talk to you about this movie.

485
00:29:17,201 --> 00:29:20,470
It really is such a movement right
now and we hope that it's going to be

486
00:29:20,471 --> 00:29:24,730
received so well by so many people and
seeing all across the world and I really

487
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:28,000
think it's going to start a lot of great
conversations. I was telling you before,

488
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,860
my husband and I saw it last night,

489
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,080
we talked about it for
like an hour and a half,

490
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,890
just chatting and chatting and chatting.
And I think that's one of the really,

491
00:29:35,891 --> 00:29:40,000
really special things about this movie
is that it allows for that conversation

492
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:44,350
in such a safe and open space, mixed
with humor, mixed with emotion,

493
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:46,450
mixed with, you know, your classic family.

494
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,220
And I think that's what's
really beautiful about it.

495
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:52,240
So congratulations to you guys
as a movie is out everywhere,

496
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:56,380
October 19th to make sure you go out and
see it. Also pick up Angie Thomas' book,

497
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:59,080
which is based off of,
it's also a brilliant read,

498
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,190
nice and easy all the way through
and just in a really robust story.

499
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,650
And it's kind of what inspired
you guys to be here this weekend.

500
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,840
Amen.
So you can see it tonight in Chicago,

501
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:17,050
right down the street, right? All
of you just got plans right tonight.

502
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,600
Like now you're done.
So you don't have to think about anything.

503
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,180
So George Tillman junior and
Amandla Stenberg, everybody.
