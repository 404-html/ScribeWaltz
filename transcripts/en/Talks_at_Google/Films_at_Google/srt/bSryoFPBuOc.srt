1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,390
Please welcome Brent
Haley and Nick Offerman.

2
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,010
Uh,
thank you for honoring pride,

3
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:21,450
months decor,
Google colors.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,810
That is right. Thank you guys both
for uh, for coming here today.

5
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:29,480
The movie opens tomorrow. Correct.
It opens tonight to narrow our,

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,430
there our preview
screenings, uh, this evening,

7
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:36,870
the movies playing at Regal Union Square
and that the landmark West 57 so you

8
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:41,871
can catch it starting tonight and
we'll be there offering whip crack

9
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,930
Rep parte, much like this. Correct nyquil
anyway. And they wouldn't be there,

10
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:53,910
but I'll be using foul language
because I won't have signed the, uh,

11
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:58,440
the Google contract. You are welcome
to use foul language. Here we are.

12
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:02,610
We're all adults in
the room. Thank you. So

13
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,870
I would love to get into the
history of the film. Brett,

14
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:11,871
you are the director and Co writer and
of course the Knicks executive producer.

15
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:17,080
And obviously we saw you're in
it, you played in it. Um, Brent,

16
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,480
probably your best to, to
start us off with this. How,

17
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,010
how did the concept of this movie
happen? How did this even get made? Uh,

18
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,380
well we've been wanting,

19
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,770
been wanting to do a, a movie in the music
space, the band space for a long time,

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,500
a big fan of that sort of sub genre
of movies. And so I was, you know,

21
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:37,260
I've had this idea for a
long time and my co writer,

22
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:40,800
Mark Bash and I had been talking about,
and we made a movie called the hero,

23
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,380
which with Sam Elliott and
nick was in that movie.

24
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,670
And after we worked with nick on that
film, I talked to mark and sort of said,

25
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:51,090
I think we found our dad for
that band movie we want to do.

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,920
I basically just wanted
nick to be everybody's Dad.

27
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,050
And uh, so we, we wrote that script
and we sort of developed it. We got,

28
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,011
we gave it to nick,

29
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:06,660
we premiered last year with the hero at
Sundance and we gave it to nick before

30
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:09,120
Sundance. And we're sort of
like, put this on your radar,

31
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:12,180
we want to make it this summer.
And we did,

32
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:15,870
we shot it in August and then it premiered
at Sundance in January and now it's

33
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,630
coming out in theaters. So it was
sort of a whirlwind, very quick thing,

34
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:23,631
but we worked very closely in the movie
is exactly what I intended it to be,

35
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,280
which is a feel good,
uh,

36
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,200
hopefully shot in the arm of just
sweetness and goodness and love.

37
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,780
And I was made out of a reaction to just
how kind of divisive and miserable the

38
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:47,580
general Twitter feed is right now.
So I,

39
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:50,760
that that was our goal and I think
we both went into it with the,

40
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:54,270
these intentions of just
spreading love and joy and music.

41
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:56,220
So that was the intent.

42
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,160
Nick, how did you, how did you, I
guess, fall love with this? Do you,

43
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,830
do you feel like you have to
have a personal stake in the,

44
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:05,780
in a script before you take
on a project? Well, uh,

45
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,870
I really had a great time working on
the previous movie, the hero with a,

46
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,950
with Brett and, uh, and I loved
his movie before that called,

47
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:19,630
I'll see you in my dreams with Blythe
Danner, Sam Elliott, Martin Starr.

48
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,610
Um, and so when they, you know, and,

49
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:25,430
and they work really fast.
Uh,

50
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,950
Brett has a really clear vision and I've
always gravitated towards independent

51
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:34,951
films because the artists usually gets
to have his or her say without the

52
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:39,020
corporate overlord saying, ah, Wah Wah,

53
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,450
how can we homogenize this
message? Um, put it in space.

54
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,910
And, um, and so I was already
a fan and I was on board, uh,

55
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,910
and then they said, we want,
you know, to write you,

56
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:55,120
we want to give you the Sam Elliott
treatment on this next movie.

57
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,440
And so I didn't really need to
see a script, uh, cause no one,

58
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,210
I mean I'm known I'm 47 and no one
has done that for me or with me.

59
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,580
Um,
but then when they gave me the script,

60
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:11,560
I was an incredibly gratified because
I haven't gotten to just play, uh,

61
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,740
you know, a human being that
we see go through, uh, the,

62
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,960
the banal scenes in his life,
you know, with vulnerability,

63
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,550
trying to figure out his conflicts,
trying to get his landlady to kiss him.

64
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,740
Spoiler alert, Toni Collette. If
Toni Collette was your landlord,

65
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,040
fair enough. Yeah. Right. You
might blush up a little walk.

66
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,100
And I think so collect the rent checks.

67
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,050
He mentioned that the character is very,
it is very human.

68
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:43,690
That was one of the things that,
that I would, that I was left with.

69
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:47,500
I've actually seen it twice already.
Um, super fan over here and watch out.

70
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,650
I want him to be my
dad. That's crazy. Yeah.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,840
Even though yet I saw a screen yeah.

72
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,450
Screen a while ago after Sundance and then
I saw it recently to prepare for this,

73
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:01,450
but I walked away.
We,

74
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,930
everything throughout the whole movie was
very real to me in a way that a lot of

75
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:10,960
other movies I've seen habit been in.
A lot of it is because like,

76
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,430
I'm looking at some movies, like I
said, shot in space. So wrinkle in time.

77
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,200
Super unrealistic. Right. Swinging a miss

78
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,400
in the realism department. Yeah. So
I guess for both of you and nick,

79
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:32,401
how much of of the real you did you bring
to this versus like a Ron Swanson type

80
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:38,230
of character or maybe that is the real
you, I don't know you very well yet. Um,

81
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,960
and then, uh, Brett for you
too, when you were writing this,

82
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:43,870
you and mark were writing this, I mean,
you're using your sign in red hook.

83
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,860
We were talking backstage really that I,
everything was shot on location.

84
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:51,790
You had your opening party at the art
gallery and you're using real names and

85
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:52,451
real products.

86
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:55,690
How much of that was you guys and how
much it was just kind of by accident.

87
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,810
I'd want to step too
much on Brett's answer,

88
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,110
but that's the,
it's part of the answer to my,

89
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,630
to the last question as well,
which is a Britain is his writing partner,

90
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:13,400
market bash, write these really great,
realistic human stories. You know,

91
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:17,960
there's no, they're not high
concept. There's no big flashy hook.

92
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,440
It's like, here's some people
dealing with their shit and,

93
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,770
and usually love gets involved
and by the end you're like, oh,

94
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:27,860
well if we love each other,
maybe things will turn out okay.

95
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,800
Which is not a great elevator pitch.

96
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,820
These people a face, some, um,

97
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,110
some obstacles and they overcome
them or not via love. Yeah.

98
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,920
Lame. But I mean, I,

99
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:47,921
I suppose there's probably more of this
character's foibles and goofiness and

100
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:52,910
human failings. That's probably
more like me than Ron Swanson,

101
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:55,970
who is more of a superhero.
I mean,

102
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,010
he's kind of a cartoon character.

103
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,430
No mortal can eat that amount of red meat.

104
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,720
And also he can make an Irish harp
overnight drunk on whiskey. You know,

105
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,290
he's, uh, he's hyper real.
Um, but, but so for this,

106
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:19,300
I mean, uh, when, when
you get the script, uh,

107
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,380
and I've gotten to from Brett,
you're, the work has done for you.

108
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:27,980
Like they make it really easy for an
actor because you don't have to figure out

109
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:32,900
like, why am I doing this? You just have,
everything is woven into the scenes,

110
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,460
the backstories, very apparent.
Um, which makes it easy.

111
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:42,110
So I suppose it was out of laziness
that I ultimately chose to do this

112
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:44,560
fair.

113
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,520
Yeah. And just to piggyback
on that, I, mark and I the,

114
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,540
at least these movies that we've done,
and I think they're,

115
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,200
they go together very nicely.
I'll see you in my dreams.

116
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:55,090
The heroin and hearts beat loud and they,

117
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,300
they're all about just good people
trying their best and I think that there

118
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:05,971
needs to be more movies like this that
don't deal in in dread and tragedy and

119
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,340
just overwhelming circumstances.

120
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,510
There is some kind of unspoken rule that
for a movie to exist it has to be sort

121
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:17,890
of miserable in some way or it has
to be so big like you say in space or

122
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,690
superheros and that's kind of it.

123
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,040
To be an nd you've got to be this dark
and serious and an overwhelming thing and

124
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,470
I don't want that from the cinema.

125
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,850
I really wanted something like this
that felt good that that made you feel

126
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:34,150
things like people telling me like we had
our premier last night in red hook and

127
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:36,620
someone came up to, they're like,
I cried like 15 times this moving.

128
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,870
I'm not really sure why.

129
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,940
Like I wasn't sad but I just kept crying
and I think it's because people can

130
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:47,410
look up there and say, wow, this
is something that I can relate to.

131
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,080
We can all relate to the
idea of leaving our nest,

132
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:54,280
of leaving our parents to
go off to college. And we
as parents, we can say, Oh,

133
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:57,060
if I have a child that going
to be like when they leave,

134
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,230
we can all talk about the creative process
and what it means to create something.

135
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:05,160
Not for fame and fortune, but for
just the sake of creating something.

136
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,510
These are things,
you know,

137
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:10,500
and there's a beautiful love story at
the center of his film between Kirsi

138
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,520
Keirsey's character Sam and an actor
named Sasha Lane who plays rose.

139
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,060
It's a beautiful relationship.
It's a queer relationship.

140
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:19,440
It's between two women of color.

141
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,560
It or it's this things I'm not
seeing in movies like this.

142
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,910
And it's not a plot point.
It's not made to be something that is,

143
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,000
you know, fretted about
this dad rep, you know,

144
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,130
accepts and loves his daughter for
who she is, a queer woman of color.

145
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,160
That's something that I want to
see on screen. So you know, they,

146
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,520
cause to me that's real. So the,
the realism was at every turn of,

147
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:48,510
of creating this project was there to
create something that people could say,

148
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,430
I believe this. I buy this, this is real.
And you know what, it made me feel good.

149
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,570
That's the idea. Right. I really
appreciate it. That actually,

150
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,240
that exact thing that you're
talking about. I walked
away and it was like, yeah,

151
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:02,890
that whole story between salmon rosy,

152
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,680
it didn't matter that like you saw
it and it was just totally normal.

153
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:11,250
It wasn't like shaping the plot, which I
applaud you for. I think it was really,

154
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:12,690
really good.
Um,

155
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,160
but the main character is
struggling musician, um,

156
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,270
maybe still a child in his own right.
Uh,

157
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,350
did this character come from anyone
you know specifically or just kind of a

158
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:30,330
genre of just struggling red hook
musicians? Probably the latter.

159
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:33,810
And he doesn't come from any, anyone
that I know. He Shit. He certainly, uh,

160
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,870
frank shared some of my musical taste
and some of Nick's nick and I both love

161
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:45,051
Tom Waits on unhealthily and there's some
good Tom waits forever to Dan and Jeff

162
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:45,601
Tweety who,

163
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:49,090
spoiler alert makes a cameo in the
movie if you saw him up in the trailers.

164
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:53,460
So we love Jeff tweedy and Wilco and,
and all of Jeff's pans.

165
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,330
So there's definitely my
music nerdery is within frank.

166
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,060
But I think this idea of a,

167
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,540
someone who I love this theme of,

168
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:08,100
of someone who tried to do something
great and didn't quite get there.

169
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,560
It's a beautiful theme in a,

170
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,450
in a great Coen brothers movie called
inside Llewyn Davis. And it was,

171
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,950
it's something that is really appealing
to me, this idea of like, well,

172
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:20,730
I want to do this great thing. I didn't
quite get there. So what do I do now?

173
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,890
And then this little spark happens between
them where their song gets on Spotify

174
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:29,280
and frank is like,
maybe I can still get it.

175
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,870
And it's so it complicates
their relationship. So to me,
again, it's just tracking.

176
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:37,200
I think the reality of the, of
that character, right, to check,

177
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,390
have to get permission
from Spotify or oh yeah.

178
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,770
Don't really every album cover shown
in the film. Every song played every,

179
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,800
every reference. You have to get
permission. Yeah. I noticed the,

180
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,240
there's a couple of youtube videos
and like you got to get permission.

181
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,190
That was fun companies or persnickety
about you using their brand.

182
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,023
Apparently.

183
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,460
You would wonder why

184
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,020
modern phenomenon, Nikki, you
just want to give them some,

185
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,470
yeah. Hello. Right side. How's the back?

186
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,010
How's the neck line look and not good.
It's fine.

187
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,190
So you executive produced this,

188
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,070
is this the first I it in the first
time give you Pete something, correct?

189
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,383
No,
I,

190
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,520
I have executive produced and also
produced a handful of film projects on

191
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:31,020
different levels and it it,
you know, it's always, uh,

192
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,280
your title has producer in it.
It could mean a variety of things.

193
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:37,810
It could mean you kicked in money.
It could,

194
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,630
it could mean that you texted Ted
Danson and got him to be in the movie.

195
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,180
Um, did you do that? Oh
yes. That is actually,

196
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,570
I thought once a dental lab
that you were going to say no,

197
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,720
like just as like a thing. Like you
could have done that but you didn't,

198
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:56,150
but you did. I did. Yeah.

199
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,820
Um, yeah, that's, I mean that's
when you texted Jeff tweedy.

200
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,280
That's my main contribution. So Jeff
and Ted Danson could doers. Okay.

201
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,540
I'm going to, uh, I'm
going to lead with that.

202
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,620
Is that any different from what
you've done in the past? Why, I guess,

203
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:11,760
why decide to,

204
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,570
to put forth the extra effort and be an
executive producer when you're already

205
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,790
like the main focus of the show? Well, it
depends. It all depends on the project.

206
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,290
I mean, uh, if,

207
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,850
if I feel that I can be of
service basically and, uh,

208
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:27,520
uh,

209
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,130
a film of this size is my favorite size
because you can literally see everyone

210
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:35,970
making it together.
When you get on a big budget studio film,

211
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,710
you begin to feel more like a prop
kept in your air conditioned container.

212
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,240
And I'm like, okay, bring in
the bus driver, uh, for his,
you know, his three lines.

213
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:50,640
Um, and you know, you know, just the
prompts department is like 38 people and,

214
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:51,740
but I,

215
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,770
I liked to work with a group of people
small enough that I can learn everybody's

216
00:13:55,771 --> 00:14:00,690
name and you can literally feel everybody
making this work of art together.

217
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:01,920
Um,

218
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,920
that's usually where I'm more likely
to come in as a producer on some level.

219
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,730
And in this, uh, I, I uh,

220
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:16,110
I did a lot less work than
all the producers. Um,

221
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,880
it has more to do with me
helping cast it. Uh, and I,

222
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:23,050
I take a morale very seriously.
I,

223
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,480
I try to act like the team
captain, you know, um,

224
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,790
I got us cool tee shirts.

225
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:36,260
Tis true the two two,
two tee shirts or red hook records,

226
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:41,090
tee shirt and a Sonny's bar t shirt for
day one of the shoot there were Sunny's

227
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,350
we were shooting at Sonny's and there
were boxes of Sonny's bar t shirts waiting

228
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,600
for everyone.
And that's the kind of Guy Nick is.

229
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:50,630
That's the kind of tone that he
sets on a film like this. There's,

230
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:51,800
there's no to do that.

231
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,010
He bought us.
How many ice cream trucks did you get us,

232
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,150
but I mean to in any cause I ate a lot
of ice cream because that's the idea.

233
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:02,000
It was a good ice cream.
You're basically a traveling Google

234
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,740
about tee shirt. That's high
praise. I don't know if I can,

235
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,810
if I can spell all of that.

236
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,990
Half my dresser is Google tee
shirts that I've never bought.

237
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,720
My algorithm might be
somewhat simpler than,

238
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,730
but I feel like I could
ask you almost anything and

239
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,490
I'll take a swing at it. Fallible. Google.

240
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,270
Um, so you mentioned you
touched on the rest of the cast.

241
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:33,410
So this is Ted Danson 20 clip life. Dan
Life Danner, of course. Kiersey Clemons.

242
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,700
Amazing, amazing actress.
She's on the up and up. Really?

243
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:40,040
Like how did you find you fixed it?
You literally,

244
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,910
you literally texted a couple of these
people and they said, don't do this,

245
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:47,390
but how did you find Kirsi? How did that
come across? I mean, I've known, I've,

246
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:50,660
I've been following Keirsey's
star for years. I mean,

247
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:55,310
I've been aware of her certainly since
dope, if not before. Dope. Great.

248
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,900
Mommy called Dope Sundance three
years ago. Yeah. Was there when,

249
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:04,070
I'll see you in my dreams were there,
so 2015. So I've been, I've been,

250
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:07,340
she's been on my radar and I think she's
a superstar. She was in transparent.

251
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:11,210
She was in a easy, which is on
Netflix. Um, she kind of do it all.

252
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,910
And when I discovered that she could,
she could sing,

253
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:18,500
I did some deep diving and I sort of
found some like deep cut clips of her like

254
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:22,970
doing grease in high school
playing sandy. And I was like, oh,

255
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:27,380
this girl can sing. And I'm a huge fan of
her. Uh, and we were nearing, we had had,

256
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,500
you know, we were, it's very hard
to find the person to play Sam.

257
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,410
I knew I wanted her to be
biracial. I knew, you know,

258
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:36,410
it was just trying to find the right
person who could sing, who could act,

259
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,610
who had the right vibe with nick.

260
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:42,650
And Sasha was cast at that point
and Sasha and Kirsi are friends.

261
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:46,790
And when I found that out I was like,
oh, we, we need to make this happen.

262
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,150
And I just called Nick and I said, I've
got a really good feeling about Kirsi.

263
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,240
Are you cool if I just make the offer?
And we made the offer?

264
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:57,020
And she said yes the same day.
So it was something that she just,

265
00:16:57,021 --> 00:17:00,860
I think because of Sasha and because of
that, it was very easy to go like Sasha,

266
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:05,840
nick, Ted, Tony, bleive and me. Sure.
I'll do that. Read script. Yeah.

267
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:09,230
And it's an 18 day shoot in Brooklyn.
I can handle that. You know,

268
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:10,970
it was not a big end.
She,

269
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:14,420
I knew she wanted to do something in the
music world and get herself out there.

270
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,040
And now it's like we've made
a movie. We've also made a
record. It's very meadow,

271
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,820
what's going on because our record
comes out tomorrow on Vinyl.

272
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:27,080
It will be on Spotify, iTunes, that'll
be everywhere. Who play Google play.

273
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:31,630
Thank you. Where are
we right now? Um, yeah.

274
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,290
Have Google play that too.
Um,

275
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:38,200
but it is exciting that we've made
this album, you know, like nick and,

276
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,830
and Kirsi sing all the songs, performed
all the songs and, and, and um,

277
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,750
it's crazy. So I think it's amazing cause
cause she has such a dynamic quality.

278
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,790
Uh, she's uh, she's a, and
when you see you're here,

279
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,770
see her and then hear her
saying you're like Whoa, it's,

280
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,910
and all the vocals in the movie are
live. I was going to, we're not,

281
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:59,970
we're not doing like in the trailer
and stuff that's, that's play,

282
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,090
that's like kind of lip
sinking in the movie itself.

283
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,470
When you hear the song being recorded,
when you see them perform, it's,

284
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,570
it's coming through the
actual mic that we did onset.

285
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,460
So nick plays a whole song on Acoustic
Guitar and sings live in one take.

286
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:19,110
It's beautiful and very, very sweet.
And so that was also going back to the,

287
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:24,180
to the realism was was making sure
that the audience bought this,

288
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,740
this we're not a band is a real band
and that it sounded and felt really real

289
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:32,310
and not just like a music video where
people are kind of lip sinking. Yeah.

290
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:36,270
You can often tell when people are like
strumming and it doesn't quite, yeah,

291
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,320
we had to do some of that just because
filmmaking is limited in what you can

292
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:40,771
record.

293
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:45,600
And I put everything towards towards the
vocals to make sure we got live vocals

294
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,580
on set.
So sometimes you've got actors,

295
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:50,280
literally they have earwigs and there
is these little ear pieces that are

296
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:54,600
playing the songs and nick and Kirsi
have them. I have them in my headphones,

297
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,250
there's like 30 extras.

298
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,490
No one can hear the music and nick and
Kirsi just have to sing and play pretend

299
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:06,870
play and, and like sing acapella.
And the audience is like,

300
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,950
yeah,
this is so good as her,

301
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,790
it's really awkward but I'm like dancing
cause I can hear it in my headphones

302
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:18,270
and everyone's like, this guy's
crazy. But he's, you know,

303
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:21,840
that's the kind of stuff you have to
do to make it, to make it seem real.

304
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,990
You know, you don't, you know, I took
cues from inside Llewyn Davis and,

305
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,680
and other movies that I think
did it right. So we, we,

306
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:33,180
we did our best on our small budget and
schedule them to do it that way. Oh,

307
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:37,280
it was wonderful. And then the songs
themselves, she can do it. Compose,

308
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,220
he could most all of it. Right. He did
with a little help from his band mate. Uh,

309
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,220
Jeremy Bullock, he was a,
he was our onset coach,

310
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:47,700
taught nick how to play the electric
guitar, helped him through, you know,

311
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,690
how to do that. And he contributed
some to a few of the songs. But yeah,

312
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:55,230
Keegan is a pretty good,
pretty good at what he does.

313
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,230
I was listening to his 2009 album,

314
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,030
like his standalone have
nothing to do with this,

315
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:04,190
like all day on repeat yesterday.
So you know, it's a very good tone.

316
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,260
It fits the movie. And then the
heartbeat beat love the title track.

317
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,780
He wrote that in 2010 right? It was a
long time ago. It was a long time ago.

318
00:20:10,781 --> 00:20:14,820
It was a version. It was a version of it
a long time ago. And I love the title.

319
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,810
Like, it's always stuck with me and I
loved the kind of ear warm quality of it.

320
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,120
It doesn't have a proper chorus,
it just builds. And then I'm,

321
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,910
I'm sorry you guys had
to hear it on repeat.

322
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,090
It's going to be stuck in
your heads all day. Um,

323
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,440
but it has that great kind of quality.

324
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:33,110
And I bought it as something that she
could write kind of in a day. So we,

325
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:37,560
we, we started reworking that and figuring
out how that would sound in this movie

326
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:41,820
with a female vocal and, and, and
I just bought it as like Guitar,

327
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:46,110
like Dad rock meets cool,
new young hip, electronic,

328
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,400
Indie pop rock, you know, like,

329
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:53,530
it felt like a good mix of those things.
Like Red Hook. Yeah. Yeah. More or less.

330
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,040
And Nicky said, or he said that you
had to learn the electric guitar.

331
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,800
Do you know what,
what instruments did you know before this?

332
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,040
Um, the, uh, the unplugged guitar.

333
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,670
I mean, that, that's my main instrument
these days is the Acoustic Guitar,

334
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:14,690
which I play as a humorist. Um, so,

335
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,520
but I had never played electric before and
it was, uh, it was difficult. I mean, I,

336
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:20,361
uh,

337
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:25,361
the stuff I play is pretty rudimentary
and foci and so just to play like rifts

338
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:30,290
up the neck, uh, it was like
learning to dribble, um,

339
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,760
because my hands didn't know how
to do what was required of them.

340
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:35,900
Uh,

341
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,900
but Jeremy was a great coach and I had
had enough time and I'm old enough to

342
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:45,650
know that you have to put in your
practice on the fundamentals. And so,

343
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,760
but at the time we shot,

344
00:21:46,761 --> 00:21:51,470
I was able to actually play all the stuff
I was supposed to. Um, and I, you know,

345
00:21:51,471 --> 00:21:55,250
I grew up playing the saxophone.
I play a little bit of a lot of stuff,

346
00:21:55,251 --> 00:21:57,290
but no one ever asks me to,

347
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,620
he plays drums and bass and guitar,

348
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,330
Acoustic and electric in the
movie. So He's, he does it.
He does it all. Almost all.

349
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,540
We didn't get him on the Sax. He's
kind of done that before. Yeah.

350
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,280
Thank Kirsi plays a synth.
Yeah. She had, he had a sampler,

351
00:22:14,281 --> 00:22:18,960
the Ableton push and the, and the, and the
keys. Yeah, I mean it was that all real,

352
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:21,780
what she was doing as well was like
you were trying to replicate it

353
00:22:21,781 --> 00:22:26,550
authentically. Totally. Like everything.
I learned all about Ableton, Ableton push.

354
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:30,240
It was like a whole new world for
me about how to sample and how to,

355
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,110
how to create a sample. Like she's not
like taking samples from other songs.

356
00:22:34,111 --> 00:22:37,680
She's creating the sample on the
keyboard, recording it, playing it back.

357
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,930
So what we learned a lot and you see that,

358
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:43,590
you see that creative process in the
film, you see how these, you know,

359
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:48,150
you can create such incredible stuff by
yourself and your bedroom these days and

360
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:51,810
record it and put it on Spotify.
That's kind of the idea or Google play.

361
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,680
And that's sort of the idea behind
the movies that you can kind of create

362
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:59,070
anything now with technology. You can
go make a movie, you can make a song,

363
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:01,620
you can, you know, and get it out
there to the world. And if it's good,

364
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,100
it's got a shot. Yeah, it
was absolutely incredible.

365
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:09,720
And I love breaking it down like this
and I'm more of a behind the scenes kind

366
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,990
of person. And I love watching
it all builds, like in the movie,

367
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,070
it just all comes together and
it works. Um, and then it's like,

368
00:23:17,071 --> 00:23:19,940
what's our band name and we're not a band.
Okay, cool. Let's go with that. Yeah.

369
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,150
And uploading and Spotify
immediately. Yes. Right. Um,

370
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,470
what were the rehearsal process is
like when you first came in the room?

371
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,770
Like was it you and Kirsi and Keegan
and the were all just like, all right,

372
00:23:31,771 --> 00:23:36,560
here we go. Let's do this. Uh, Keegan
wasn't there at the beginning. Jeremy,

373
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:36,690
right for me

374
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,910
was, um, and uh,

375
00:23:38,911 --> 00:23:42,360
that was when Keirsey first arrived.

376
00:23:42,361 --> 00:23:45,320
We had a few days of rehearsal
before we started shooting.

377
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,330
And so she blew into the room.
We had been rehearsing with Blythe Danner,

378
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:52,550
who plays my mom.
Um,

379
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,970
and Kirsi blew in and just started hugging
everybody and it was like a Rainbow

380
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,930
Unicorn had gal into
the room. And I mean, I,

381
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,630
I can't say enough about Kirsi.

382
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,250
I think this movie would have
been really good without her.

383
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:15,000
And with her, it's sublime. Like
she's, she's just exceptional. Um,

384
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,220
she's such a personality
and such a beautiful soul.

385
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,870
And then she starts singing and your hat
just flies off and you're like, oh shit,

386
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:28,330
this is it. You guys got
really lucky. Yeah. Yeah.

387
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,680
So, you know, we, uh, we,

388
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,770
we were very gently coach w we both have
musical skills to the level that we do,

389
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,470
but there's a,
there's an element of,

390
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:44,360
of superhero origin story because
through the filmmaking, you know,

391
00:24:44,361 --> 00:24:48,830
I can play a drum set, but they
make me look like I can play a song.

392
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,970
Like we create a song like a Keegan
Dewitt song and that's a super power where

393
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:56,140
it's like, oh yeah, what do
you think about this? As,

394
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,420
as though I can casually come up with
those riffs, which I can't, you know,

395
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,440
that's what I, it was really fun
to see the movie and be like,

396
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:08,690
I seem like a kick ass musician
and it's really fun. See

397
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,360
that this scene where they're coming
up with heart, speak loud and,

398
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,710
and see him playing the ref
and see Kirsi plane, the keys.

399
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:18,470
That's all happening in camera.
That's all real.

400
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,510
And we allow that to be really organic
and let them kind of put their spin on it

401
00:25:23,511 --> 00:25:27,500
when they discover your melody
meets my melody and Oh that,

402
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,840
that really works. It's, it's pretty fun.

403
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,430
And Keirsey's really playing the keys
and all that stuff when they're kind of

404
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,350
being inspired and figuring out the
tunes and the melodies and stuff. It's a,

405
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,220
that was again, a big part of it
for me just to be like, yes, they,

406
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,160
they're doing this, this is actually
happening. Well, um, well cool.

407
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:47,450
So if anybody has any questions,

408
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:50,450
you can start letting up now and
I'll continue to talk here. Uh,

409
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,480
I guess we'll go back to the
location for a little bit. We've,

410
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,660
it's obviously a red hook. We've talked
about that a couple of times. Why,

411
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,330
why Red Hook and why these specific
locations that you found? Well separate a,

412
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:03,680
I'll let nick tell his
connection to red hook,

413
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:07,820
which I didn't know at the time
when first when we didn't, uh,

414
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,040
we didn't know Nick's
connection to Red Hook,

415
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:12,920
but I live in cobble hill
and I have for 13 years.

416
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:16,400
My wife and I lived there and I've
just always walked to red hook.

417
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,240
It's just what I do. I walk over to
Red Hook. When I first moved to, uh,

418
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,970
to New York, I lived right on the
edge of Red Hook in Carroll Gardens,

419
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:27,040
like right on the BQE. It
was really nice. Um, so I,

420
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:30,140
I just would walk over there and I'd go
to Sonny's and I'd just walk around the

421
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:34,950
piers and I just loved the feeling and
it, it's sort of like this own weird, uh,

422
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,210
beautiful and eclectic thing. And in
Brooklyn that's its own thing. It's,

423
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,320
it's Brooklyn, but it's red hook. It's
totally, it's, it's, it's something.

424
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,970
And so there's just,
we wanted, we've been,

425
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,940
mark and I had been wanting to
set a tail there for a long time.

426
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:51,210
We did write another script that was
no good, that took place in red hook.

427
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:53,310
And we thought with this one,
hey,

428
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,280
why don't we have it take
place in red hook and go full.

429
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,480
And it was great to shoot it baked and
she sunnies and just out on the street

430
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:05,310
and called this record store red
hook records. It was really fun. Um,

431
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:08,340
so that's why you know that it's
like kind of like home to me.

432
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:12,120
We shot in Cobble Hill and red hook
almost the whole movie a little bit in

433
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:16,350
Greenpoint, but that was pretty
much, yeah. You know your
neighbors. Yeah, it's good.

434
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,950
It's good stuff. Well, and then nick,
what your connection to red oaks?

435
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:20,880
Really interesting, I think. Yeah.

436
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,390
So they did this and handed me the
script and unbeknownst to them,

437
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,740
10 or 11 years ago,

438
00:27:27,741 --> 00:27:32,741
my wife was doing young Frankenstein on
Broadway and we were living on the upper

439
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:34,930
west side. And, uh,

440
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:40,180
the only caveat to her taking that job
was I had to leave my woodshop in Los

441
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:44,900
Angeles for a year and a half. And I
said, good. I, uh, I'll leave my clients.

442
00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:47,630
I've been wanting to build
my first wooden canoe,

443
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,700
this will give me the chance to do that.

444
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:54,701
So I brought a bag of chisels and hand
planes with me as one does as one does.

445
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,300
And uh, this, uh, you know,

446
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:01,100
it took a little time to
get through Tsa, but I, I'm,

447
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,920
I'm charming.
Uh,

448
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:10,090
and so I got here and I looked around
and the only affordable shop I could find

449
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:15,650
was in red hook and one of those big
old brick warehouses down below at the

450
00:28:15,651 --> 00:28:19,750
bottom of Van Brunt.
Uh, the super cool, uh,

451
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,120
would co op and I got this shop out.

452
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:26,060
The window was perfectly
the statue of Liberty.

453
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,220
It was a super romantic and dreamy.

454
00:28:28,221 --> 00:28:32,650
And I built my first canoe there
also Ron Swansons first canoe, um,

455
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,610
named huckleberry and, and baked.
I stopped at every morning.

456
00:28:37,611 --> 00:28:41,690
I rode my bike there every day from
the upper west side and just had this

457
00:28:41,691 --> 00:28:46,130
incredibly romantic year and a half
as though I was in on the waterfront,

458
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,340
which is set in red hook. And, uh,

459
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,980
and I baked and Sonny's
were two of my spots.

460
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,180
So it was just a wonderful piece of
serendipity when I read the script and was

461
00:28:56,181 --> 00:29:00,950
like, oh, this is me.
I love their biscuits.

462
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,950
Picked baked, not knowing
that he went through all the
time. I, yeah, Sonny's Bay,

463
00:29:05,951 --> 00:29:10,780
all of it. I had no clue. He, we sat
down in La, we had lunch together and I,

464
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,290
and we had read the script and he's
just like, dude, like I built my first,

465
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:17,230
he knew in red hook,
like I'm so connected to this place.

466
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:21,400
So there's some kind of magic there.
It's like I, I knew in my heart,

467
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:25,690
like I wouldn't have made this movie
without nick. Like when we met and I,

468
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,700
we wrote it with him in mind and it was,

469
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:32,530
so there's something obviously
kind of Kismet e about that, that,

470
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,370
that he had that connection
to and we didn't even know
that. So he's like, he was,

471
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,610
he was made for this, this
role, you know. Yeah. I agree.

472
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,100
I love how he keeps saying his first canoe

473
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,020
because he's built more than one. Um,
yeah. Let's take a question over here. Uh,

474
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,350
my question is more about like your
roles in sort of like how they fit into

475
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:52,600
culture because a lot of your
roles are like very masculine,

476
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,610
but they're also super
positively masculine.

477
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,990
So I just wonder like how you feel about
your sort of status is like a super

478
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:02,890
awesome masculine character to like change
how a lot of people feel about it and

479
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:04,900
create more positive
masculinity in the world.

480
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,490
Well, thanks. So the, the,

481
00:30:07,491 --> 00:30:11,780
there are some nice compliments
laced into that question. Uh,

482
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:19,100
I, uh, I have great parents. Um, I uh,

483
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,610
was brought up with good manners and,
um,

484
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:26,090
and I love performing, you know, stories.

485
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,290
I tried to pick things that are
medicinal in some way for the audience.

486
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,920
And so, uh, through
good fortune, you know,

487
00:30:33,921 --> 00:30:37,070
I've landed some roles that,
uh,

488
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,440
I've seen the audience
accusing me of masculinity. Uh,

489
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:47,480
and it's a weird thing to be accused
of because often certain sects of the

490
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:51,680
audience are a little more narrow
minded or a little more old fashioned.

491
00:30:51,681 --> 00:30:53,660
And so when they say masculinity,

492
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,240
it's a little gross or it's
a little old fashioned,

493
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,940
it's laced with misogyny or
bullying or just a, you know,

494
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:04,430
a general, a sense of, of testosterone.

495
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,460
And so I dunno,
uh,

496
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,970
given the opportunity to speak to that,
uh,

497
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:16,120
I try to steer people in the other
direction and usually if a, if I,

498
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:21,160
anything I say sounds like good
advice. Uh, I'm usually the, the, uh,

499
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:26,150
intended target more than
anybody. Um, and so, you know,

500
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,760
regardless of what people ask me when
they say like, how should a man behave,

501
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:37,030
I kind of answer with my present
sensibility of how should a person behave

502
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:42,980
because men are a part
of the group of people.

503
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:48,260
And I, uh, I believe we should
all be nice to each other and,

504
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,200
and treat everyone as equals,
you know, across the board.

505
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,820
And that's my starting point.

506
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:58,330
I am also aware that I'm human,
therefore a dip shit.

507
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:03,030
Uh, and so that's why I'm the,
the first intended target. It's,

508
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,530
it's something we'll never
be done getting better at.

509
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:10,870
And so we should always keep talking
about it, especially in front of a,

510
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:15,140
a rainbow colored curtain.
My pleasure.

511
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,450
That's the quote from today as I'm
human. Therefore a dip shit. Oh yeah.

512
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,293
Question over here

513
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,533
is first off,

514
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,440
awesome casting with mayday Malone as
a bartender in this movie. I love it.

515
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:31,360
Um, I have a personal question
for things that I like to create.

516
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:35,980
I'm actually going to be building a two
benches for my fire pit this weekend.

517
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:38,530
I would love to have a
couple of words of advice.

518
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:44,330
I'll take this one
first.

519
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,860
Would hammer nails good luck.
Now,

520
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:53,660
take it from the master here.
Um, well first of all, I, uh,

521
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:58,490
my wife, uh, Megan Mullally, who's
on the program will and grace,

522
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,020
uh,
on television,

523
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:07,380
she also played Tammy to on parks
and rec was like just in case.

524
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,520
Yeah. Case they didn't
know. Yeah. Ps, if you're,

525
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,870
if you haven't been to Nancy and
beth.com that's the tip of the day.

526
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,050
That's her band. She'll
knock your socks off. Uh,

527
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,350
last night she saw the movie
for the first time and, and uh,

528
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,850
still slept in my bed,
which I take is a great compliment.

529
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:32,030
She said that Brett so good at,
uh, at making his movies seem real,

530
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:36,740
which is such a great compliment from
her. She has, she has really, uh,

531
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,950
exacting artistic taste.
So it's,

532
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:43,660
I was terrified sitting next to her
watching the movie. Yeah, he teaches,

533
00:33:43,661 --> 00:33:44,750
he texted me like,

534
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,290
so Megan's going to see the movie
tomorrow and now it's real for me.

535
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,970
It's was like, yeah. Um, but,

536
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,300
but she also said, uh,
bread is so good at casting.

537
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:59,660
And that's why I wanted to
reiterate that because it's,

538
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,580
it's something that you
can take for granted,

539
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:06,500
but when somebody has a knack for it,
uh, it makes all the difference. Um,

540
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,910
I don't know what, uh, your
benches are made out of, but I'll,

541
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:14,210
I'll suggest that you take your time.
Uh,

542
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,890
go to work sober measure twice,
uh,

543
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:23,330
so that you can cut once and
if you're using bladed tools,

544
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,450
make sure they're properly sharpened.
Thank you very much.

545
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:33,350
Past your tools wisely over here.

546
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,950
Hi,
I'm so broad.

547
00:34:34,951 --> 00:34:38,760
I know you already touched upon the
queer elements of this movie a bit and I

548
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:43,160
just wanted to say thank you for including
that in the narrative because uh,

549
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:46,500
it was really refreshing to read about
this movie and hear that there were queer

550
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:51,170
women who got to survive throughout
the movie cause that's not typical. Um,

551
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:56,490
and I think a lot of times movies fall
into those harmful tropes because there's

552
00:34:56,491 --> 00:35:00,030
just not queer women involved in
the production of the film. Um,

553
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:04,830
so my question is how influential work
here and Sasha and kind of gunning to

554
00:35:04,831 --> 00:35:07,770
like sculpt their characters and
sculpt the narrative of the movie.

555
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,210
Thank you for that question.

556
00:35:09,211 --> 00:35:14,211
And I do want to talk a little bit about
going back to the masculinity thing,

557
00:35:15,691 --> 00:35:18,780
going back to what it means to be a white,

558
00:35:18,781 --> 00:35:22,470
straight male in society and the
privilege that comes with that and

559
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:26,670
acknowledging that privilege
and understanding that as
part of that privilege,

560
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:31,850
we must be putting other
people in things and on, in,

561
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:36,840
in media that represent the
reality of these situations.

562
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,150
Not as a plot point,
not as a trope,

563
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:43,620
not as something to be pushed away
or, or, oh my God, here, what,

564
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:48,300
what is that? Oh, what is like sort
of doing that, which is so ridiculous.

565
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,840
And it was always my goal to have a queer
relationship in this film and treat it

566
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,410
with no sort of posts.

567
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,290
Just saying this is like
any other summer romance,

568
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:05,070
which it is any queer person,
any trans person,

569
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:07,710
doesn't sit around going all
day. Oh God, I'm this. I'm that.

570
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:09,210
They just live their lives.

571
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:13,740
And that's what I wanted these characters
to be able to do. And by total chance,

572
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,340
when Kirsi and Sasha came on board,

573
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:21,210
they both opened up to mark and I and
said, you know, we identify as queer.

574
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,740
And I said,
well,

575
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,510
tell me exactly how I
can make this better.

576
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:32,010
How did we do? And they said, you did
pretty good, but they're talking about it.

577
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,640
We don't talk about it. We don't sit
around talking about how we're queer.

578
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:40,080
We just love each other and kiss
and enjoy the summer together.

579
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,620
And it was a really big moment. And so
we went through each scene with them.

580
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:48,621
We spent a half a day with just Kirsi
and Sasha and mark and I being educated.

581
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,590
Tell me, tell me how you would
want to see this on screen.

582
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,910
And we did something that a lot of
white men should do more. We listened.

583
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,620
And so I hope that you will see this
film and I hope that it will move you.

584
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:06,390
And I hope that anyone of of any,
any race,

585
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,680
any gender, any sexuality, sexual
preference, whatever it may be,

586
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,810
can just see a beautiful love story
between these two characters and move on.

587
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:19,140
And that's why I'm so proud. I'm so,
the thing that I'm also so proud of,

588
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:21,210
his health,
Frank's character,

589
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,040
Nick's character of frank responds to it
and it's, I don't want to give it away.

590
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:27,920
I want you all to go see it.
It,

591
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,700
it really is kind of quietly
radical when you don't judge,

592
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:35,430
when you don't make it something
that's bad or something,

593
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:37,350
that punishment is
waiting around the corner.

594
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,220
It's just love and embracement
and that's what we need.

595
00:37:41,221 --> 00:37:42,870
And that was my goal.

596
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:46,590
And obviously I could not have done it
as well as it has done in this without

597
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:47,520
Kirsi.
And Sasha,

598
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:51,090
it's so important to listen to the
people whose stories that it is,

599
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,240
especially when you have the
privilege that I have, I don't under,

600
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:57,840
I have to acknowledge that I do not know
what it's like to be in the shoes of

601
00:37:57,841 --> 00:37:59,100
someone else.

602
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,290
So listening was key and I owe
them a ton for that. Thank you.

603
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,420
Wonderful. Thank you. Um,

604
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,970
I have a fun question though. Not
that, that was fun. Oh, sorry.

605
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,630
I was super fun.
Fun.

606
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,720
I've always wanted to know.

607
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,230
And in movies where you see
old pictures of the actors,

608
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:28,700
where do those pictures come from?
We see a wonderful album cover of,

609
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,930
oh man,
that one beard.

610
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:35,860
He submits Sukus busted glass night.
He saw that it's his old,

611
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:36,190
that's

612
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,550
his old headshot, which
is infamous. Just Google,

613
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:44,530
nick Offerman young
headshots and wait for it.

614
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:49,570
I'm not going to give it away, but
no, nick gave me a ton of photos. Um,

615
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,850
and,
and we,

616
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,880
and we photo shopped and then there's
a great playbill of Ted Danson.

617
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,720
Uh, and a status status quo. Vadis yes.

618
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,310
And that is real.

619
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,180
That is from a production
that he did on Broadway.

620
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:11,500
The only time Ted was on Broadway
and it closed in one night,

621
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:16,180
which fits the character and fit. I
didn't know that though. I was like, oh,

622
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:16,961
we're going to use this,

623
00:39:16,961 --> 00:39:19,600
that play that he was in on Broadway
and then Ted was like, yeah,

624
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:22,300
we did one night I came back to the
theater and the security guard was like,

625
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:24,550
what are you doing here? And he was like,
I'm going to work. And he was like, no,

626
00:39:24,551 --> 00:39:29,170
you're not. He did fine. You guys,

627
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,820
you guys are like, Oh, poor ted. He, he
did pretty good. Yeah, it worked out.

628
00:39:33,821 --> 00:39:36,610
I think so. [inaudible] I love
putting that stuff in again,

629
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:41,380
making it as real as possible. And we did
some trickery to make, to pull off, uh,

630
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,750
his wife in the film and
make sure that it kind of,

631
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:46,120
I think they turned out pretty
well. Yeah. I mean, we, uh,

632
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,250
Brett cast a great actress
and we did a photo shoot,

633
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,860
like, you know, which is that,

634
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:55,270
that's a testament to you.
It would be,

635
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:58,920
it would have been very
easy not to have paid, uh,

636
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:03,910
an actress and instead just gone
into, you know, the world of,

637
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,080
of images on the,

638
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:10,510
the Google location on the computer.

639
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,393
Um,

640
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,990
but we didn't, yeah, we can, we
cast an actor and you made the,

641
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:20,050
put him in like nineties and early 2000
clothes and like the found pictures of,

642
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:24,140
of Nick and then recreated the way
he was in that photo. So he, he,

643
00:40:24,141 --> 00:40:28,610
it was his body and then we took his
head from the other photo and put it on

644
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:30,530
with the act. So it looks,
it looks really great.

645
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:34,910
It has sort of a very authentic quality.
At least we, we, we did our best. Yeah.

646
00:40:34,911 --> 00:40:39,430
No facial hair. Nick always takes
me for a loop, but it's okay.

647
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:44,470
I'll take that as a compliment. Thank
you. Yeah, we're not used to it. Um, yeah.

648
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,323
Question over here.

649
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,993
Hello.

650
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:51,200
My question is basically
going from being in a,

651
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:55,220
on a show that has like many seasons
and be on those actors for a really long

652
00:40:55,221 --> 00:40:56,220
time.
Uh,

653
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,440
what's the difference between having
like a smaller project and do you see

654
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:04,900
yourself kind of going more into the
indie route or is this something that like

655
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,790
you're just still playing
around with other things or?

656
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:13,840
Um, well, it's interesting. I, you
know, if you're lucky enough to get,

657
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:18,500
get on to a series a period,

658
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,590
you're, you've won the actor lottery. Um,

659
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,970
because the hardest thing for an
actor is just to get a damn job. And,

660
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,900
and you know,

661
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:32,390
the term starving actor
is a become commonplace.

662
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,110
Uh, you're lucky enough to
get on a series. That's good.

663
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:41,140
That's good writing then that's like
winning the lottery among the lottery

664
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:44,390
winners. Uh, and um,

665
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:49,660
and so something on parks and rec
is such an such a dream a moment.

666
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:56,390
Because if I'm trained in the theater,
so you know,

667
00:41:56,391 --> 00:42:01,010
I get cast in a play, I, you
know, I get a script that's,

668
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:01,490
you know,

669
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:06,490
somewhere around two hours long and you
learn it and then you'd do it for maybe

670
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:11,120
some months, um, on a, on
a TV show like that. Uh,

671
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,630
you get cast and,
and maybe they have a few,

672
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,950
a handful of episodes
written, but if it goes, uh,

673
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,870
you all together get to create
the lives of these characters.

674
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,900
And it's really gratifying because
these really smart writers, uh,

675
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:33,800
they deserve most of the credit, uh,
have the wherewithal to say, okay,

676
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:38,300
we're, you know, season four, where
are we going to take these people?

677
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:40,310
And, you know, uh,

678
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,430
they came up with such positive,

679
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,330
beautiful and hilarious things
for us to do. And so that's,

680
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:52,260
to get to do that for seven years
is just beyond. I, you know, it's a,

681
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:54,020
it's an incredible,
um,

682
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,570
but it doesn't feel very different
than working on a film like this.

683
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,960
It's just a different duration. Uh, if,

684
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:07,990
if for some reason a
channel like a or a website,

685
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:11,800
I don't know if you, if you
know any computer companies, um,

686
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,680
if they called Brett and said,
we love your movie,

687
00:43:15,681 --> 00:43:18,890
how would you feel about making a
hundred episodes of it or something,

688
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,780
I'm available. Then it would
be the same for me to be like,

689
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:27,500
oh, we're going to keep, we're gonna
keep following frank in his life.

690
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,060
And it's a,

691
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:34,080
I don't know if my wife and I both
choose our projects based on our,

692
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:39,081
our feeling that the writing is good and
is somehow going to help us evolve or

693
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:44,300
at least make us laugh a uncontrollably.

694
00:43:44,301 --> 00:43:46,520
Those are the parameters.
Uh,

695
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:50,540
cause I don't know if children's
hospital is particularly revolutionary,

696
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:54,440
but we thought about, we thought it
was super funny and we do thought,

697
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:59,390
we did think that it breaks down rules of,
of what comedy can be.

698
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,360
Um, but I don't, uh,

699
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:05,660
I don't have any particular ambition.
Uh,

700
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:08,180
whatever the next good
writing that comes in.

701
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:11,330
It could be for the stage for
the F it could be indie film,

702
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,250
could be studio movie.

703
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:17,610
But probably not because they're usually
not as good writing because they've

704
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:22,610
been through corporate. It's art by
committee. Um, or it could be a TV series,

705
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:26,000
whatever. I, I'm not particular, uh,

706
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,210
as long as I can spend
some time in my woodshop,

707
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,040
I'll be happy to show up and be

708
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,660
in your project always. Cool.

709
00:44:36,661 --> 00:44:40,850
Thank you. If we got time for two more
questions, let's take this one. Hi. Uh,

710
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:45,510
so I don't know how like twiddly a movie
dose, three hours, something like that,

711
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:50,310
but going from audience to the Sundance
in January and do an 18 days to shoot,

712
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,950
did it feel very rushed?
Does it feel

713
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,960
no, all the time in the world.
I'm just kidding. I'm just
kidding. Yeah. Yeah, it was,

714
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:58,794
it was very rushed.

715
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,130
Crazily fast. It was gnarly. Did,

716
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,520
do you feel like you kind of miss
something or do you feel like you kind of

717
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,200
wanted to put something else in

718
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,980
you? You, you always do. I mean, I,
I can't, not at not a healthy, um,

719
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:16,100
cabi to look back at the movie and
go, man, I should've done this.

720
00:45:16,101 --> 00:45:20,720
And I wish that one scene was like that
I made the movie I wanted to make and

721
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:25,460
that and that's because I was told,
hey, you're going to have 18 or 19 days,

722
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,700
you have this much money,
here's where you can shoot it,

723
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,260
that these scenes need to take
place in these locations. Good luck.

724
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,450
And so I knew,

725
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:40,510
I knew what I was going into and mark
and I knew and so we worked that into the

726
00:45:41,451 --> 00:45:43,880
script to ensure success,

727
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:48,830
at least for the level of success at
this movie is going for it. It is.

728
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:52,400
People sometimes call my film small films.
I don't mind that at all.

729
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:57,860
It doesn't bother me in any way to call
my movie a small film because it might

730
00:45:57,861 --> 00:46:02,540
be, it might, it was quick, it was cheap,
it was a little scrappy, but it has,

731
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,060
the themes within it are,
are big,

732
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:08,870
are the biggest ones that we talk about
love and a father and a daughter and

733
00:46:08,871 --> 00:46:12,980
creation and dreams and grief. These
are, these are not small things.

734
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,000
These are big things and you
just kind of go, you know,

735
00:46:17,001 --> 00:46:21,290
it's like I finished the movie on August
31st I knew I had to submit to Sundance

736
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:25,090
at the end of September. I didn't
want to have to work, you know,

737
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,220
seven days a week with my editor, 18
hour days. I didn't want to do that.

738
00:46:28,221 --> 00:46:32,360
My wife's certainly didn't want me to
do that. And Patrick, my editor's wife,

739
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:36,380
who has a kid, he, she, she wasn't happy
with me for 18 days or for the month,

740
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:40,130
but we did it, you know, we pulled it
together. We got to cut to Sundance.

741
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,150
Thankfully they loved it.

742
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:44,030
We got in and we finished the movie
by Christmas and turned it around.

743
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,350
But it's all very fast.
I mean,

744
00:46:45,351 --> 00:46:49,640
the movie is going to be out to the
world and kind of kind of boom, poof,

745
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:53,750
before the one year anniversary of a
shooting it. But that's great. That's,

746
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,430
I love that pace.
You know,

747
00:46:55,431 --> 00:46:57,800
once you work on something for
a really long period of time,

748
00:46:57,801 --> 00:47:00,800
for me as a director,
you can get a little lost in it.

749
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:05,360
Unless we want to do heartbeat loud,
the TV series I will give,

750
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:09,500
I will give a hundred episodes for
that. I'd be very happy to do that. So,

751
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,950
and I would like to add a couple things.
One is that Britt,

752
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:16,380
it was incredibly fast,
but Britain, uh, I,

753
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,330
I don't imagine he ever felt rushed
because he knows what he's doing is a very

754
00:47:20,331 --> 00:47:24,480
clear vision.
And there were things in the script there.

755
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:29,690
There was a very romantic scene where
I was riding my bicycle over the East

756
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,550
River,

757
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:34,540
probably on the Manhattan bridge.
And I was like, oh my God,

758
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:38,410
they're going to shoot me riding a
bicycle. It was like the sky and you know,

759
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:42,090
it'll be around shit. Yeah. And, um,

760
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,140
and immediately like,
you know,

761
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:47,260
as soon as the line producers started
laying out the schedule, they were like,

762
00:47:47,261 --> 00:47:51,870
okay, that's cut. Uh, and
we were like, ah, okay. But,

763
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,900
but when I was doing, and
I'll nutshell this, when,

764
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,860
when I was doing theater in Chicago,

765
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,380
I learned this lesson that I think
really applies to art of this size.

766
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:08,010
My theater company was very broke and
we did a car chase between a cop car and

767
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:14,770
some bad guys with these two cars that
were built out of like refrigerator boxes

768
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:19,570
and with great paint jobs.
And we had s cocaine stage hands.

769
00:48:19,571 --> 00:48:21,130
It's a Kabuki convention.

770
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:26,370
People in black robes like shoving the
cars around and with sound and acting

771
00:48:26,891 --> 00:48:29,140
and, and this, uh, convention,

772
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:34,120
the audience totally was got what we
were doing and life was with it and like,

773
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:35,170
Oh shit,
you know,

774
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:40,171
a fruit cart came out and
God tamable ass over tea cup.

775
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,840
And then at the same time,

776
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:47,920
some friends were in a play at a big
great theater company in Chicago.

777
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:52,600
And in this play somebody
wrote a motorcycle on stage
and made us cool entrance

778
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,733
on a Harley.

779
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,930
And I went and saw this play and I just
really noticed the difference between

780
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,530
when you have the budget to be like,
let's fucking ride a motorcycle on stage.

781
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,920
It's, it's briefly, uh, and
superficially impressive,

782
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:12,190
but there's no magic involved. So
you're like, Whoa, that's loud.

783
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,860
That's a real motorcycle on
stage. Okay, that's over.

784
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:20,700
But when you involve the audience in
the Mechan mechanization of creating

785
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,250
whatever the magic of the storytelling is,

786
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,140
it's so much more satisfying and I
just think it makes better art to place

787
00:49:29,141 --> 00:49:32,830
limitations on it so that way
I'll have to work together to say,

788
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:37,840
let's tell a story. This is a rabbit,
you know, and it, and everyone's like,

789
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:42,700
okay, I'm with you. Then we're together.
Where as opposed to being like,

790
00:49:42,701 --> 00:49:43,870
check out this fucking rabbit,

791
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:50,490
I need to limit the limitations
that are put on me constantly.

792
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:51,470
As a filmmaker.

793
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:57,000
Do you bring out the best in you because
you have to say what is essential to

794
00:49:57,001 --> 00:50:01,770
tell this story appropriately.
You, you can't be like, well,
like you said, like, oh,

795
00:50:01,771 --> 00:50:02,610
we can do this.
We did.

796
00:50:02,611 --> 00:50:05,910
You end up wasting a lot of time on stuff
that you're like, well that's pretty,

797
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,490
but it doesn't really
help move the story along.

798
00:50:08,491 --> 00:50:10,620
So you mark and I were like forced to go.

799
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:15,120
What really is going to help this
movie. So I, I don't, I don't mind it.

800
00:50:15,121 --> 00:50:18,240
I would certainly take more money and
more days to make a movie. I mean,

801
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:23,040
if anybody's giving those
out. Thank you. Thank you.

802
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,040
Final question real quick.
You mentioned,

803
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,100
you talked about how you all about the big

804
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,060
happy positivity to
counteract today's world,

805
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:35,660
but then you mentioned inside Llewyn
Davis a couple of times as an inspiration,

806
00:50:35,661 --> 00:50:39,170
which I feel like is not exactly
that. Yeah, that movie's not,

807
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,130
I'm curious what you took from that
movie and if there are any other music

808
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:47,570
centric movies that you took
his inspiration for this
one. Absolutely. Yeah. No,

809
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,670
this is certainly not inside Llewyn Davis.

810
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:54,671
I think it does share that theme of being
good but not great and not having made

811
00:50:54,861 --> 00:50:58,250
it and what that means and the Coen
brothers movie certainly goes in a much

812
00:50:58,251 --> 00:51:00,200
different direction than than ours does,

813
00:51:00,201 --> 00:51:04,280
but I think they actually have similar
outcomes because it, it, it, again,

814
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:09,080
this is not the rocky battle of the bands
movie where they go and get fame and

815
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:13,580
fortune. This movie's not about
that going after that star.

816
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:17,090
Can you find happiness if your
dreams don't come true? Correct.

817
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,970
That's what it's about.
And I think inside Llewyn Davis,

818
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:22,790
Llewyn Davis is having
a very difficult time.

819
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:28,540
I think our characters do find some kind
of peace and happiness and love within

820
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:33,500
failure or within coming up short
of what someone's goal was. I mean,

821
00:51:33,501 --> 00:51:37,400
I'm fascinated by that. Just as an
artist, as a person with aspirations,

822
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:42,200
what does it mean to be satisfied
by said art is the doing of it.

823
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:44,180
Enough itch it should be.

824
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,950
It's hard to not put success and money
and fame and all that bullshit on top of

825
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:52,460
it. But that's what I'm
after. And so the, the real,

826
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:56,390
the real movies that tonally I think we
mixed in and sort of a blender for this

827
00:51:56,391 --> 00:52:00,140
would be high fidelity,
that thing you do,

828
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:05,090
which I adore. Um, and once probably,

829
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:08,210
and then there's a great Japanese
film called Linda, Linda,

830
00:52:08,211 --> 00:52:12,020
Linda about an all girl band.
That's incredible.

831
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:14,720
So I would say those five
movies with Lou and Davis,

832
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:17,510
she kind of in a blender also.
Then the music man.

833
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,670
And West side story, you know. Um,

834
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:27,230
but I think that that kind of blend
of the realism of once and the joy,

835
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:30,650
like that thing you do is not a,
again,

836
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:34,370
it has the feeling that I think this
movie has where you can watch it and just

837
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:39,500
go, yeah, I knew that that was, that
made me feel good. There's, there's,

838
00:52:39,501 --> 00:52:42,500
there isn't anything tragic that's
going to happen. You're not,

839
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:45,800
the filmmakers not going to knock you
in the face when you turn the corner.

840
00:52:45,801 --> 00:52:49,400
It's just kind of taking you on this
journey, showing you beautiful characters,

841
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,430
interactions, what it means to
have gone through something.

842
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,350
And that is 100% the
goal. And I, you know,

843
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,520
anytime you open a movie and you start
looking at the reactions and it's like,

844
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,630
this is what we wanted to do and,

845
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:08,660
and I hope that you all will go check
out the movie because there is conflict

846
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:14,840
and there is resolution.
Thank you. Thank you.

847
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,640
Cool.
Everybody help me thank them for it.

848
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:20,620
Thank you.
