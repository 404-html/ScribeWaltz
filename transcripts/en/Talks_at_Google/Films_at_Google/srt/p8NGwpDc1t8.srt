I'm diggity diggity uh,
so thank you so much for joining us.

8
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,520
Your latest film is learning to drive.

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,130
Do you mind telling us a little bit
about it? How many of you've seen it?

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,920
Good. And the rest of you will see it
when it comes out this yesterday, right?

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,880
You will flock and you
will take all your friends

12
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,780
and you will scream and cheer when
our names come up on the screen.

13
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,450
Um, uh, it's a beautiful story about, uh,

14
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,573
uh,

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,880
two separate worlds coming together.
It's a woman,

16
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:15,750
a of fierce intellectual in
New York book critic, uh,

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,490
who pretty much has everything but forgets
to realize you has everything. And,

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,960
uh, her husband walks out on
her and into her life comes,

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,240
um, this exceptionally beautiful and, um,

20
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,090
patient and kind and admirable man.
Yeah.

21
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,493
Um,

22
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,700
emphasis on exceptionally and sexy and
amazing and extraordinary and one of a

23
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:42,324
kind.

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,260
And, um, uh, and, uh, through,

25
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,780
uh, the process of learning to drive
shit 50. She's a hardcore New Yorker,

26
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,460
never driven. She learns to
drive for the first time at 50.

27
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,850
And of course she has a the one and only
Sir Ben Kingsley is her teacher and she

28
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:06,280
learns, uh, and they learn
many things because he's on a,

29
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,440
uh,
a new path.

30
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,610
They both set out on new paths and
the paths collide and come together.

31
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:16,330
And in a,
I think a unique and surprising ways.

32
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,170
I think those of you have seen the film
will allow me to describe the form as a

33
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:25,430
poem. So I have been referring
to it all day as a poem.

34
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,900
And at the beginning of our time we
see a woman in complete distress,

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,060
almost completely destroyed by the
disintegration of her relationship.

36
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,820
And at the beginning of the poem
that's called the first stanza, um,

37
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,140
she hates men.
She will never trust men.

38
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,300
She's lost her faith in man. Now, for
those of you who've seen the film,

39
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:54,590
and those of you haven't,

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,910
I will go right now to the end stanza.
Oh,

41
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:01,390
the film where,

42
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,990
because of her relationship with this man,

43
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,210
she's able to say something very special.
Now the heavens will in our poem,

44
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,400
the heavens will look down and see a
woman in great distress who's lost her

45
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:18,970
faith. And the heavens
say, I know what we'll do.

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,450
We'll send her this warrior,

47
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,400
this pure Ma'am silent.
That's what she needs.

48
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,430
And by bringing them together in,
as Patricia will tell you,

49
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:37,090
a very confined space, a
car, a little vehicle, um,

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,900
which,
which,

51
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,900
which is rather like the ferry in the
archetype of fairy man who will meet you

52
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:44,860
on one bank of the river,

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,150
puts you in his little boat and take
you to the other bank of the river.

54
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,290
But wa on your voyage,
you realize as you step off his boat,

55
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,720
I've learned something.
Something's changed in me forever.

56
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,820
The gift of the ferry man is that he is,
or she is a great teacher,

57
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,240
a great giver of life and
an a show or of the way.

58
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,340
So when we get to the end of our
poem with this particular fairy man,

59
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,450
she's able to say from utter
devastation at the beginning,

60
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,340
you are my faith.
So that's a remarkable journey.

61
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,190
Um,
that lasts the whole length of the film.

62
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,280
It's very delicately handled
verse by verse by verse.

63
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:27,840
If I can continue calling it a poem and,
um,

64
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,320
the unlikelihood of the pair.

65
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,790
Is there salvation?

66
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,150
I honestly think that if Wendy had
said to somebody in our office,

67
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,360
I'm in great distress, what should
I do? She got all the wrong advice,

68
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:44,880
particularly from your sister,
um, uh, in the film. Um,

69
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,480
and if, and, and I, um,
I am in the throes of,

70
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,290
in anticipation of an arranged marriage,
uh,

71
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,770
and learn from my friendship. Uh, sorry.

72
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:59,740
He learns from his friendship with Wendy,

73
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,950
how to bring his Punjabi wife who's
terrified of New York out into the world.

74
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,740
And I think how to love her. I think he
learns how to love her through Wendy too.

75
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,870
So it's, it's quite, uh,
uh, quite an extraordinary,

76
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,670
but I think at the end of
the day, it is a, uh, uh,

77
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,520
a beautiful story about adult friendship,

78
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,090
about true profound meaning and, uh, of,

79
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,090
of a real friendship and a,
a,

80
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:31,100
a friendship that,
um,

81
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,720
has changed them for the rest of their
lives and end it ends in just the right

82
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,650
place. I don't want to ruin
anything. It ends in just the right,

83
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:42,640
there won't be a sequel.

84
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,000
Well, if there's enough
money, but now, uh,

85
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,650
let's talk about faith for a moment
because that is such a huge part of it.

86
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:53,190
And I think,

87
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,680
I think the character of
Wendy is definitely someone
who in the beginning it's

88
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:58,220
just completely lost her in men.
Not,

89
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,700
not in the religious sense, I mean, in
men and men. But also I think there's a,

90
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:04,780
isn't there a moment where she just
goes, I'm, I don't believe in God.

91
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,590
I'm mad at you, or God bless. But yeah,

92
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:12,340
no, I don't think when he was ever
particularly religious woman, but I think,

93
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,380
I think faith in general,

94
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:18,880
I think she's lost trust and belief
in and a lot of life, right? Suddenly,

95
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,230
you know, a woman who was often
the smartest woman in, in any room,

96
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,510
um, top of her game, uh, a
major critic in a tough city.

97
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,440
And suddenly,
uh,

98
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,120
she is forced to go from a incredibly,

99
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,960
very valuable intellectual
life to this visceral,

100
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,210
um, uh, life, this life that is
uncomfortable for her to be in.

101
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,950
And she has to navigate
her way out of that.

102
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,840
And, uh, it's a journey. I, I relished.

103
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:56,950
It was not easy,
but it was a journey I relished taking.

104
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,670
I think that they are connected by words,
their love of words.

105
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,720
My father in the Punjab
was a university professor.

106
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,530
My character's father was a
university professor and I,

107
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:13,790
to my character to a
Donavon sing was a unit,

108
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,230
a university professor in
the, in the Punjab. And He,

109
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,100
he has to migrate away from his homeland,
a terrible loss.

110
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:27,050
But he does take with him in
his DNA that need to teach,

111
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,440
that need to hand something
on that needs a slight,

112
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,510
that needs a slowly alter for the
better the lives of others. So,

113
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,710
um,
there's,

114
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:41,570
there is a commonality in the intelligence
and that's very, very important.

115
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:41,871
It is,

116
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:46,700
it is a film dealing with two people
of equal intelligence who meet,

117
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:50,450
greet and salute one another.
Uh, as, as loving friends.

118
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,450
It's nice to see a film
about smart people.

119
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,170
Um, yeah, no, it's, it's wonderful to see
that. But it's also, it's interesting,

120
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:04,580
it was interesting for me to see this
character and your character who it's his

121
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:09,230
faith is such a whole part of who he is
and he's very unshaken in it for most of

122
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:09,591
the time.

123
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:13,400
But then there's this event in his life
with this impending marriage that maybe

124
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:15,980
does have an effect on that.
And so what was that sort of,

125
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,530
that journey like for you?
Ooh,

126
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,730
I was very fortunate when I was
filming Gandhi in India to have,

127
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,700
um, uh, seek, uh,

128
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,600
bodyguard driver who drove
me to the set every day,

129
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,930
who protected me on set all day
and drove me home in the evening.

130
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:40,070
And he was a man of amazing
stillness, very protective. And,

131
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:40,851
um,
I,

132
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:45,230
I certainly drew upon my acquaintanceship
with him over those months,

133
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,810
um, on, um, on my portrait of a,

134
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,890
of Darwin. Um, I think that, um,

135
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,770
we must be careful of the word faith.

136
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,480
I think that his faith
allows him to be still,

137
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,280
it is not, um, a,

138
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:08,010
a faith that needs to be historically
demonstrated. It's, it's not,

139
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,480
um, it's not external.
It's not externalized. Um,

140
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,990
there are scenes in the temple of,
of,

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,380
of great stillness and dignity and
family unity and enormous respect.

142
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:24,381
We were allowed to film in a Sikh temple
not long after six where were shot in

143
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,790
their own temple. So that was
a huge gift. And by Osmosis,

144
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,880
by being with my wonderful
driver body guard,

145
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:37,260
by being with my one or two seek
friends with whom I'm, I'm quite close.

146
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,860
And then of course, our dear Harpreet
Singh tour on the sell to who,

147
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,650
who put my turban on
everyday quietly dig it, man.

148
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:50,280
Make a gentlemen. I would like to
make, uh, forgive me if I'm wrong,

149
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:52,230
I'd like to make a slight generalization.

150
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,640
I feel that if you know
one Sikh gentleman,

151
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,330
you know them all because
there's something extraordinary,

152
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,040
Lee consistent about their moral compass
and their ethics would, would, would you,

153
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,120
would you agree with that?

154
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,420
Yeah.
Good.

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,090
I can go home.
Thank you.

156
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,060
But no, I, um, I must say,
um, uh, you know, as you know,

157
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:21,960
I was, it may have been attached
to this film for a very,

158
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:25,200
very long time and I love the
character character of Wendy,

159
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:28,890
but what I will say is in,
and this story in this journey,

160
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:32,190
but one of the most beautiful aspects of
shooting this film was getting to know

161
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:37,140
the Sikh community, getting to
know her preach and, um, uh,

162
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,020
an awakening to,
you know,

163
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,870
to this incredible and beautiful culture
and the fact that they embraced, uh,

164
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,270
this film and embrace her. Ben. Well,
who wouldn't want, Sir Ben playing you?

165
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,920
Come on. Um, uh,

166
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,310
but that was valuable and
incredibly comforting,

167
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,120
um, for all of us with
the film that we had them,

168
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,580
we had their blessing, so to speak
with this film. And, uh, but it was,

169
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,600
um, uh, a beautiful lesson
and, and, and journey for me,

170
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,120
one that I will carry
for the rest of my life.

171
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:16,020
Getting to know the Sikh community.
It's, um, very, uh, it's a very,

172
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:17,010
very beautiful thing.

173
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,820
Whilst we, Patricia and I have
been talking about this phone,

174
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,380
a retrospectively revisiting it,
um,

175
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,670
I find that I have many thoughts
about the film that I didn't have one,

176
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:29,250
I was shooting and I've just had one city.

177
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,310
Yeah. Right now. And there's
this, hold on and it's this,

178
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,690
your Wendy,
the very modern meets

179
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,250
the very ancient, yes. He who
will not cut his beard. Yes.

180
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,970
He who will not cut his hair.
He will always wear a turban.

181
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,910
And he who carries a sword.
It's as if,

182
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:50,980
yeah,

183
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,750
he's traveled.
Thousands of

184
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,630
Sikhism hasn't been with us that long,
but hundreds of years to be with you.

185
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,980
And he learns,
you learn some ancient truths from him.

186
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,980
And I learned some modern truth from you.

187
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,900
And I hope to impart them to just
lean my, my, my arranged bride. Yes,

188
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,340
I know. Yes. That equals
yes, it's, it's in New York,

189
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:19,900
but the heavens look down to someone
in distress and say she doesn't want a

190
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:22,460
modern guy. Let's not
send them modern guy. No,

191
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,120
let's send a warrior
from the past. Uh, and I,

192
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,480
I think that that's just hit me sitting.
Yeah.

193
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,500
But you are, I mean,
that's, that's the beauty.

194
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:36,770
And what I love also about the film is
as strong as the Sikh community and the

195
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:43,050
beautiful life that is present in
this film. At a certain point. Um,

196
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,290
this film is really just about two adults.
Uh,

197
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,630
at the end of the day it
is about two people, um,

198
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:55,020
who have different cultures,
but even the cultures fade.

199
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:59,730
And it really just at the end of the
day is about two people finding a better

200
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:03,330
life and a better self. And, um,

201
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,540
I think that's what cheers me most
about this film is that it is,

202
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,100
um,

203
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,100
at the very core of
film about humanity and,

204
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,480
and how we can cross divides in subtle and

205
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,600
simple ways. And, uh, I,

206
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,320
I hope you find that and
see that in the film. Um,

207
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,060
that's a wonderful point. And, and as
you mentioned, it's about two adults,

208
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:38,640
but at least in the u s like
learning to drive is a very,

209
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,000
it's kind of a landmark of this, this
journey into adulthood. You know,

210
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:45,420
getting your driver's license is
something, I think every 16 or 18.

211
00:13:45,421 --> 00:13:48,480
Now you're all once and
it's this badge of honor,

212
00:13:48,481 --> 00:13:51,510
but these are two people who've
passed into adulthood, you know,

213
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:55,500
and now they're kind of facing
these maturity decisions that are,

214
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,800
it's probably putting them back into
this kind of like teenage place of mine

215
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:02,250
almost. Um, you know, how did that
play into it at all for you guys?

216
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:05,720
Did you see that as a part of the journey
or was that just kind of a Oh, yes.

217
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,563
I mean,

218
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,040
learning to drive both learn, um, uh,
the, the enormous amount of information.

219
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:17,041
I think the number of times at
Donovan sing asks when d questions,

220
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:22,290
what should I give her? How
can I talk to her? I mean many,

221
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,760
so many questions in subtly
disguised or quite, you know,

222
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,880
quite quite overt. So the, the, the, the,

223
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,960
the two way flow between them, uh, um,

224
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,650
both learning and bringing them mature.

225
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:39,990
Mine's two baby steps,

226
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,220
but it, it, it is also for me,

227
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,650
the real true physical act of
driving. Again, s as Patty,

228
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:54,230
my driving had lapsed. Sadly,
I'm, you know, I'm was born in,

229
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:58,760
raised in the great city of New Orleans,
and my father taught me to drive at 16.

230
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,380
Um,
and I was a driver.

231
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:07,430
And slowly as I became more and more
new, Yorker became more Wendy's. So,

232
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:12,140
and I lost my ability to
drive. And as, and we,

233
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:14,120
when we arrived at this film,

234
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,660
I really had not been
driving and you know,

235
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,850
Serbinis trust

236
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:26,710
that I could drive him through
the streets of Manhattan.

237
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:32,880
I thought, oh my God. I said,
Oh my God, I'm driving Gandhi's

238
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,460
[inaudible].

239
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,890
Oh,
I was very passive.

240
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,290
But through the course
of shooting this film,

241
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,270
I became a better driver. And through
the course of shooting this film,

242
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,200
I realize so many things
that Wendy had to learn.

243
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,190
I mean it was life and art mixing in,
in,

244
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:06,191
in his vast and fabulous
and precarious ways.

245
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,640
Um, oh, driving over the
Queensboro Bridge, uh,

246
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,130
everyone was like, didn't you have a tow
truck? Didn't you have a stunt double?

247
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:19,310
I was like, you look at, uh,

248
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,400
but in the course of shooting this
film and truly learning to drive again,

249
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:30,000
I learned all the lessons that
Wendy had to learn. I had to learn,

250
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:34,520
have to listen, to look, to pay attention,

251
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,000
to be present,
to take in the world,

252
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,350
to be selfless to,
you know,

253
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,310
to read the signs, to read
the signs. And I realized,

254
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,820
Oh my God,
I haven't read a sign in so long.

255
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,840
I haven't looked up and taken in the
world right in front of me in so long.

256
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,210
And it was a very,

257
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,440
it was a very powerful experience for
both of us shooting this film at all.

258
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,950
Jenny as aren't. Cause when life
and art, when they do coalesce,

259
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,440
it's quite an extraordinary
feeling and journey. Ah,

260
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:16,820
it's beautiful and it's at its best.
It should always be like that. Yes.

261
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,780
You will.

262
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,500
You always hope for that
when you're shooting a film
to come out the other side,

263
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,360
a better person having more
knowledge. Maybe having, you know,

264
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:28,460
a new lover you always once,

265
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,743
I did not move.

266
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,810
I mean, you want, you want
to have taken, you know,

267
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:43,740
you want at the end of this journey.
But I mean, I'm making light of it,

268
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:45,100
but it was truly a,

269
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,530
a profound experience for us at
the end of this film. It was,

270
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,370
it was difficult to leave them behind.

271
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:57,600
We went to do a talk at AOL and,
um,

272
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,690
we saw the end of the toy.
We saw the trailer or something together.

273
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,900
Yeah. And we both thought,
oh, we missed the,

274
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,240
in Darwin, we missed them. Uh,

275
00:18:11,241 --> 00:18:15,120
I have a very dear friend who saw
the film the other day and he really,

276
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:18,750
he loved it. He's an academic,
he's brilliant. And he said, I,

277
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,430
I want to have coffee
with Wendy and Darwin,

278
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,630
not you and Sir Ben,

279
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,420
Wendy and Darwin.
What we,

280
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:33,130
what we hope as actors,
because I'm skeptical of messages.

281
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:36,400
I have to be honest.
I think that sometimes if you,

282
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,970
if you respond to a question
regarding what do you hope for,

283
00:18:39,971 --> 00:18:42,610
what's the message of it?
Clutters you.

284
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,410
So all I all I would like to
say in terms of this film,

285
00:18:47,411 --> 00:18:52,330
and I know Patty agrees with me, is that
audiences, audiences who see the phone,

286
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,430
we'll have thoughts pop in their head
that they would not have had had they not

287
00:18:57,431 --> 00:18:59,530
seen the film.
That's all we can hope

288
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:04,150
for. That I think is that's
what we can help for.

289
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,400
That is somehow makes you think about
something you hadn't thought about before.

290
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,660
And,
you know,

291
00:19:10,661 --> 00:19:15,160
I know that this is a film
starring two people who are not 25,

292
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,660
but I will tell you something.
I've had my nieces and nephews,

293
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:24,190
I have 10 of them. Oh my God.
It's why I didn't procreate.

294
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:28,020
It's enough. There's enough of us. Um, uh,

295
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,730
and they,

296
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,690
they were surprised at what they,

297
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,630
what they felt about this film been there.

298
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:41,140
Like they range from
25 to 34 or something.

299
00:19:41,141 --> 00:19:43,770
And so I think,
um,

300
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,500
this is a film that can resonate with
people of all ages and all cultures and

301
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:52,510
all backgrounds and,
uh,

302
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,490
we've played a very diverse
audiences and they have responded.

303
00:19:57,491 --> 00:20:01,090
So I, I hope, um, when you see it,

304
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:04,840
those of you who have not seen it,
I hope you, it takes you somewhere.

305
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,480
When I was, I think I told
you this story, um, when I,

306
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,120
when we were with the
Hollywood foreign press, Gosh,

307
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:14,250
was that yesterday or the day before?
Where are we now?

308
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,140
We're on a whirlwind tour then
we're in, we're at, we're in,

309
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,000
it says it that Google
got it. Um, the Internet.

310
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,030
I am Palo Alto. Fuck.
One of the, one of the,

311
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,800
the very last into interview of
the day and had done several,

312
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,050
um, was a young woman probably in
her late twenties, early thirties,

313
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,160
from Belgium. And I started, um,

314
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,420
as I introduced our talk,
as I introduced myself to you,

315
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:50,421
I started with that idea of the poem
and have the woman in total distress,

316
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:56,410
lacking faith and trust
in men and the heavens,

317
00:20:56,411 --> 00:21:00,670
looking down and sending her the warrior.
And I looked up,

318
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:01,780
whilst I was talking,

319
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,330
tears were streaming down her
face and this was on camera.

320
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,740
And I said,
you know,

321
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:12,430
for the s for the sake of you
and I in this conversation story,

322
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,140
please keep that in your broadcast.
She said, well, the, there's no choice.

323
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:20,230
Of course I will keep it in my
broadcast. This was, this was this,

324
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:24,940
these are the generation that you're
alluding to. She found it deeply,

325
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:29,970
deeply touching. It just hit a nerve
in her, which is very gratifying. Yeah.

326
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,420
It's great to make girls cry.

327
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,310
I don't have any Oscar nominations.
I can't cry right now. I'm sorry

328
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,720
man. I don't know how
to follow that up. Um,

329
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,210
I'm gonna, I'm going to talk
about New York for a moment. Okay.

330
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,320
New York is a wonderful city and
it's also one of the places that one,

331
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:56,280
it is terrifying to drive in. Like
I used to live there and it's, I,

332
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,320
I do not want to drive over the bridge.

333
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:02,170
I was terrified for you
guys in that moment. Um,

334
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,310
but it's also one of the only places
in the world where I could probably see

335
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:09,780
something like this happening with this
culture kind of meshing and where yes,

336
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,980
it's just totally normal for all of these,
you know,

337
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,980
groups to cohabitate and stuff like that.

338
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:18,330
But there's also this kind of moment
of discrimination and, and you know,

339
00:22:18,331 --> 00:22:23,160
raids on onward I is living. Um, I think
it's something people often forget about.

340
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,420
Um, that happens, you know,

341
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:27,730
I think maybe we focus a lot on
other immigration issues. Um,

342
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:32,470
but it's one of those things where you
think, oh, New York melting pot. No. Um,

343
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,070
so, and, and you guys got to shoot in
New York City. Um, so what was, you know,

344
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,550
did that add extra to it?

345
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,190
It actually getting the students end
up in front of a green screen as you

346
00:22:41,191 --> 00:22:42,300
mentioned it,
it adds a lot.

347
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,680
We had, you know, when I was first
trying to get this movie made, you know,

348
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:51,360
everyone was like, well, could we
shoot this in Toronto? I was like,

349
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,880
yes, let's drive around Toronto. Um,

350
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:01,550
uh, someone actually
said, I love this film.

351
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:03,110
If you cut all the driving scene,

352
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,980
I will help you make this film. But I
think we have to lose the driving seat.

353
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,900
Thank you sir. Thank you. Good day.

354
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,790
But yes, New York was essential
in a crucial part of it.

355
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,690
And the cacophony of New York is,
uh,

356
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:27,290
only can be the cacophony of New York
and, and the streets and the people. And,

357
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,780
and it was essential that we were there,
but yes,

358
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,720
we did face, you faced certain
challenges every day, uh,

359
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,623
as

360
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,900
I did just until it just sharpens your
resolve to make a beautiful film and,

361
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,210
and to rise above it. I'm, and then a
little bit of Darwin was a, you know,

362
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,480
taught me because I didn't hear this
abuse that was yelled at my character w

363
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,340
just before our most crucial scene.

364
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,590
But some of my colleagues on the set dude,
and they were very distressed and,

365
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:07,460
and I said, come on, come on,
tell me. I heard something, um,

366
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:12,080
what happened? And they were
very reluctant to tell me. Um,

367
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,470
but in fact, two guys, uh,

368
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:20,020
shouted across to me whilst
I was in the dealership, uh,

369
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,780
helping Wendy by her red car and,
and they shouted,

370
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:28,130
he should be buying a fucking
camel, not a fucking car. And, um,

371
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:32,810
it's hard to say that it's
very distressing for the crew,

372
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,220
but actually I thought,
well then that's why you're here.

373
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:40,210
This is why we're making the film.
Come on. That's why you're here. Yeah,

374
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,570
no. So you know, you, you, you, you,

375
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,580
you think that, uh, all of New York, uh,

376
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:54,530
is, um, uh, advanced. You
want to believe you live,

377
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:59,450
live in a, uh, in a, uh, a
city that, uh, ignorance,

378
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,320
uh, it has escaped
ignorance, but it hasn't,

379
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,620
and it's ever present. And it's, um,

380
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,870
it's now the biggest problem in my,
in my opinion,

381
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:16,550
that we face in the world
today. So, um, so you've,

382
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:21,050
you've talked about this earlier, but
you guys actually were in a car, um,

383
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,980
that creates a certain sense of
intimacy for characters, for actors,

384
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,390
and you've also worked together before.

385
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:30,050
So was it easier to kind of slip into
this relationship between these two

386
00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:31,000
characters are,

387
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,880
here's a paradox because we
weren't together so intimately.

388
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,250
I Dunno if you saw a movie,
we didn't call it a log.

389
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,500
We played lovers in that film.

390
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,130
You did move your hands on that one.
Seriously.

391
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:54,690
I had the first day go on Patty,
go pick up my life.

392
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,240
Um,
I met Sir Ben

393
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,410
and then we got naked and shot.
There's the sex scene.

394
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,340
That was the first thing we shot. I
mean, Isabelle just threw us together.

395
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,450
Best Way to do it.
Yeah.

396
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,240
Yes,
it was before lunch,

397
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,200
but he did it,

398
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,700
you know, it bonded us. It
gave us, uh, uh, uh, uh,

399
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,200
that's a lot.
Whoa.

400
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,980
Paradoxically, uh, what it allowed
us to do because we, you know,

401
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:33,180
we trusted each those scenes demand huge
trust and respect from one another and

402
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,580
we therefore knew the level of trust
that we had and we'll tap into his actos.

403
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,190
Therefore sitting the car between

404
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,870
takes,
we hardly spoke,

405
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,650
we kept it very separate.
We,

406
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,700
because we knew one another so well we,

407
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,820
and we have a great trust and uh,

408
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,820
but we wanted to make sure that savanna
and patty didn't blur the lines with

409
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:04,940
Wendy and Darwin,
that it was because the beauty,

410
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:09,970
the beauty of this film is it's very
subtly work a and charted and finally

411
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:13,550
etched of when the lines
blur with the two of them.

412
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:18,560
And we had to be very careful that those
lines blurred in the appropriate times.

413
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,270
And so we really,
we could trust one another enough.

414
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,430
It was a very quiet shoot.

415
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,600
We would sit often in silence in the car,

416
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:30,710
in between takes

417
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,500
that would trouble some people that

418
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,190
there and we completely trusted to be,

419
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,090
could be totally in repose
and still between takes,

420
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,820
which was a great gift.
So, yeah, no. Um, so the,

421
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,750
some of the other cast members
aren't here obviously, but,

422
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,070
but what was it like working with them?

423
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:54,130
Because a lot of them you've
worked with before, um,

424
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:57,940
did was that it's just an easy way to
kind of also slip into this sort of

425
00:27:57,941 --> 00:27:59,340
familiar relationships.

426
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:05,170
Yes. I mean I um, uh, you know, having
been with this film for so long,

427
00:28:05,171 --> 00:28:08,440
I had, you know, dreams of
the people I was hoping,

428
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:10,780
and I love Jake Weber
who played my husband.

429
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:13,240
We did this little film
called when to go together.

430
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:18,100
That was this little tiny horror film
director by, uh, Larry Fessenden.

431
00:28:18,101 --> 00:28:18,791
We did it many,

432
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:23,791
many years ago and I thought he was
just the perfect mix of handsome and

433
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,770
academic and uh, just a fine, fine actor,

434
00:28:29,771 --> 00:28:31,750
really fine actor.
And um,

435
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:37,410
and so it was a real treat to get to
work with him again and grace gummer um,

436
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,130
I met her six years ago
and six years ago I said,

437
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,010
if and when I get this movie made,

438
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,650
I want you to play my daughter
and thank God she still looks 18,

439
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,060
her good jeans. I was like, thank you. Uh,

440
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,770
but she's a beautiful,
stunning, a young actress.

441
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:04,420
And I was thankful that she did this and
you've got to work with gorgeous Serita,

442
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,750
terrific, gorgeous. Those were
actually some of my favorite,

443
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,680
almost uncomfortable scenes just
in the sense that he wanted,

444
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:20,000
I felt like he wanted so badly for
her to fit this kind of archetype,

445
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:23,270
bird or mold that maybe Wendy
was influencing a little bit,

446
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:27,530
much too quickly ahead in his
expectations yet. But it was,

447
00:29:27,531 --> 00:29:31,730
it was wonderful for just to see someone
who was willing to step back and try.

448
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,050
Um, and then she goes to
college and she, you know,

449
00:29:36,051 --> 00:29:38,960
she is led out into the
world by her friends,

450
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:42,250
by motto meets or in the
supermarket and goes to her house.

451
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:46,660
So, um, she does, she does take those one.

452
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,750
She in turn takes those baby
steps to being a liberation.

453
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,870
You got woman and I think she'll make it.
I think she'll do it.

454
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:57,960
She had some gumption and with the
support of her husband. Yup. And Yeah,

455
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,480
you get a sense with Serena that she
can kind of do anything. Yeah. Yeah.

456
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:06,290
I feel coke, but some, I mean I think
the thing for me with those was, um,

457
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,070
this,
this interesting non-existent language.

458
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:12,190
It was a language barrier but it wasn't
a language barrier and the scenes were

459
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:14,860
very interesting to watch in
the sense that, you know, it's,

460
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:19,360
it's somebody who wants this other person
so badly to communicate yet is having

461
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,140
trouble communicating maybe the emotions
and what they want out of their partner

462
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,090
themselves.
Um,

463
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,590
I don't know if he felt that way at all
or is that is just a beautiful acting

464
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:34,591
exercise where you have a very narrow
corridor of communication between the two

465
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:38,830
characters and therefore as actors,
you have to,

466
00:30:38,831 --> 00:30:43,831
you have to be so accurate into getting
that on film down that tiny parameter of

467
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:49,210
communication that it absolutely
is this also where beautiful too.

468
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,940
Isabel question at our director that
we both worship and we love her.

469
00:30:53,941 --> 00:30:56,570
She's Kathalyn and she,
uh,

470
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,580
she shoots with such a delicacy
and intimacy. You know,

471
00:30:59,581 --> 00:31:04,581
she's the operator at like Soderbergh
and there's very few directors who are

472
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:08,940
operators, but she gets behind
that camera and she's able to,

473
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,730
you're never quite sure
sometimes where the camera is.

474
00:31:11,731 --> 00:31:16,500
So the scene is just about life.
It's not about just blocking it out.

475
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:20,970
She rarely blocked something out
in a very strategic way. She just,

476
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:26,270
and it gives the scenes a delicacy
and an a true intimacy and that,

477
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,220
that we owe to Isabel

478
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,850
porch the camera and exactly the
right place every single time.

479
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,190
So that we as the actors
never have that anxiety. Well,

480
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:43,490
you wonder whether or not the director
has seen what you're trying to do. Get it.

481
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,321
It was not happening.

482
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:49,321
Sometimes they miss it completely or they
bring them their own agenda and their

483
00:31:49,811 --> 00:31:52,990
own narrative and it doesn't,
they're not filming what's there.

484
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,200
And Isabelle films,
what's there

485
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,270
and she, she never misses
anything. Not a thing.

486
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,980
It's crazy there to watch her
shoot. It's, it's art too.

487
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:10,010
She puts the camera on like a Bungee
cord and it swings in and out silently.

488
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:16,080
It's, it's, it's something to
behold and it's her own style. Yeah.

489
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,680
And the DP is behind her and she just,

490
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:24,770
she starts to move and swoop the camera
on this like almost like little arm.

491
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,380
Yeah. And it's hitting on,
uh, engineering and art.

492
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,270
It's engineering and art and
it's, um, something we love. Yeah.

493
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,890
Um, so we'll take audience questions in
a moment if anyone wants the lineup. Um,

494
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,970
so I,
I have to ask,

495
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,010
do you yourselves drives and if so,

496
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:47,590
what was one of the memorable moments
about learning to drive? Well,

497
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:52,100
because you know, I become a
commodity, therefore I'm driven.

498
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,340
I'm driven to the studio.
I'm driven to here.

499
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:57,740
I drive less and less and less.

500
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,310
Where I do drive is in,
in Oxford.

501
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:05,330
Sherry is the English countryside
narrow country lanes. It,

502
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:09,950
it happens to be farming country.
So if I'm running an errand in,

503
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,420
in my vehicle, so it's a
land long wheelbase, Land
Rover. It's a really tough,

504
00:33:14,421 --> 00:33:18,200
beautiful car. Um, I'm running
errands, they're working,

505
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,220
they're moving Matt, tons of
Hay. They're moving livestock.

506
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,690
They've got combine harvesters. I've
learnt to be alert to the narrow corners.

507
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,800
Anything could be horse riders,
anything could be coming round it.

508
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:35,120
I've learnt pullin Polin they're
working like the guys passed.

509
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,690
I love the etiquette of driving in the
English countryside is really something

510
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:42,340
beautiful. I don't, I, yeah,

511
00:33:42,341 --> 00:33:43,700
I don't really drive anymore.

512
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,920
I drove for this movie and I joked with
my father that maybe when I come home to

513
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:54,080
New Orleans next time he'll teach
me to drive again. And he said,

514
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,180
I don't think so bad. Huh? There's
not enough red wine in the world.

515
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:05,270
And I think my final question
before we had the audience is, um,

516
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,850
what do you think was the
most rewarding part of,

517
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:12,920
was it just getting this film made for
you or has it been the journey afterwards

518
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:17,921
or it's telling the story
to people is a joy for me.

519
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:19,993
Um,

520
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,240
we're storytellers and to have
people touched by moved by amused,

521
00:34:25,811 --> 00:34:28,940
by entertained, by what we do for
a living. It's absolutely glorious.

522
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:34,670
Uh, there was one moment early on
when we were shooting, you know,

523
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,351
like I said,

524
00:34:35,351 --> 00:34:40,351
this has been a long journey for me to
get this film made and one day in pretty

525
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:46,501
much the first day and when we were both
in the makeup trailer and I was sitting

526
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:51,541
there and I was talking about Wendy and
my hair and what we're doing in makeup.

527
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,720
And I looked up and I saw Sir Bannon
is beautiful turban and he looked so

528
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,250
extraordinary and there he was.
He was Darwin.

529
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:09,000
And I looked at the two of us.
I thought, oh my God, it's,

530
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,170
we're here. He's here. Ron
is here, Wendy is here. Um,

531
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:17,860
we made it, we, we've got
the, we got this movie made.

532
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,430
It was a remarkable moment
that I'll never forget.

533
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,113
Wonderful.

534
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,230
Come on guys. Any audience
got da, we got one.

535
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,430
I have a question.
I wondered,

536
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:36,431
you've played these
extraordinarily diverse roles
recently and I wondered if you

537
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:39,120
had anything that was

538
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,860
discovered about yourself during these
roles of playing people from other

539
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:50,190
cultures. You know, what, what we,

540
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,440
what I discover,
uh,

541
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:56,250
is not necessarily anything
from the character.

542
00:35:56,251 --> 00:36:01,251
I'm playing because my job as a portrait
artist is to put oil paint on the

543
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:03,030
canvas.
In other words,

544
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,500
it's pretty well a one way
street with some tiny exceptions.

545
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,360
But what I learned about being a,

546
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:16,370
an actor in the out in the world
is the politics of the film set.

547
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:22,610
Because I can tell you now every version
of human life is alive and well and

548
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:27,480
present on the film set.
And it's not just patty and I,

549
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,780
a lot of people behind the camera who
are trying to make something beautiful

550
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:37,480
with you and for you. And sometimes
they really get it wrong. Um,

551
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,740
we won't mention that the department
that consistently got it wrong,

552
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,280
but boy did that tax
our patients that what,

553
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:47,220
what it teaches you is to read,

554
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,280
read the signs from the film crew
patients and understand that everyone is

555
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:55,110
doing,
giving it their best shot.

556
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:00,620
And I learn a great deal from my journey
as an actor and not necessarily from

557
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,080
the characters I've played,
but from the process itself.

558
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:05,943
Thank you.

559
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:14,320
Hi, uh, uh, it's been a pleasure
listening to you and, uh,

560
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:17,590
I promise I'm going to waste a movie.
Okay. But I'm gonna to take this,

561
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:20,260
just one chance to say to serve Ben,

562
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,750
thank you so much for your great,
uh, acting in the movie. Gandhi.

563
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,120
Uh, it's one of the most popular
movies in India even today.

564
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,720
And I have two kids who
are a bit small right now,

565
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,040
but when they grow up to an age,

566
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:41,110
I'm going to like play this movie for
them because it tells so much about India

567
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,431
and I'm a great man.

568
00:37:42,431 --> 00:37:47,431
So thank you so much and I want to
thank the organizers here for giving me,

569
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:51,340
giving me this opportunity. Thank
you. All the best. Thanks. Thank you.

570
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,403
Thank you.
Thanks.

571
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,431
So Patty,

572
00:37:58,431 --> 00:38:02,120
you've sort of mentioned a few times
that you've been wanting to do this movie

573
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:06,290
for a long time. It's, it's
spends something to spend on
your mind. So how did you,

574
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,820
how, uh, what was it the, that um,

575
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,620
gave you the idea of wanting
to create this movie?

576
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:13,890
Yeah,

577
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:18,210
well, there was a beautiful, um,
essay by the Great Katha Pollitt.

578
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,020
I don't know if you knew,
she has been, um, is she, uh,
I'm sure some of you do. But,

579
00:38:22,021 --> 00:38:25,560
um, she, uh, she had this beautiful essay,

580
00:38:25,561 --> 00:38:29,670
semi autobiographical in the
New Yorker many, many years ago.

581
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:34,650
Uh, and I read it and I resonated
with me even many years,

582
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,920
many years ago,
and I thought it was at once,

583
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,070
uh,
this,

584
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:44,590
the humor and the pathos in equal
dose and sometimes simultaneous.

585
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,480
I, I just was taken by it. And, um,

586
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,160
I then found out that a woman named Dana
Dana Friedman had option the story and

587
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:57,280
turning it into a store, into a
script. And that Sarah Koenig,

588
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:02,290
she had written this script and then they
came to me and I thought I'd died and

589
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:07,340
gone to heaven. I said, oh my God, I
know this story. I love this story. Um,

590
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,401
that was long.

591
00:39:09,401 --> 00:39:13,780
I joked that I was an ingenue when they
first brought me this to the script, but,

592
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,760
but I, um, I, uh,

593
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,050
I just loved,

594
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:23,920
I thought that the meeting of the minds
of Katha Pollitt and Sarah Koenig Shin,

595
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:27,430
I thought she would be captured
the, this story, the essence,

596
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,740
the heart of Katha Pollitt in the story.

597
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,490
And yet she opened it up and
made it her own and a beautiful,

598
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:38,500
a beautiful journey, um, of
these two people. And so why,

599
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,270
you know, that last
line, I say one of the,

600
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,340
pretty much the last line I say in
the film, you know, you're my faith.

601
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:51,100
And I had to remind myself of that,

602
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:56,480
that line almost daily, uh, uh,

603
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,290
that I had to have faith that,
that someone would,

604
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,860
would believe in this project that
someone, that all the, the, uh, the,

605
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,170
the movie gods would bring everybody
together at the right moment.

606
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,570
And that some person would say yes.

607
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,130
And that's what happened.

608
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,260
A man named Gabriel Hammond
and his brother Daniel Hammond,

609
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:22,450
we're starting a new production company
and they're young. They're like your age.

610
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,910
And these young men could
have chosen any film.

611
00:40:27,911 --> 00:40:31,840
I mean, a film with storing
hot young stars, you know,

612
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:35,660
with models in Bikini's running around.
Um,

613
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:41,250
I can't believe I just reduce,
um,

614
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:46,570
but these young men chose,

615
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:50,470
uh, to make this film. Uh,

616
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,520
I went to dinner with Gabriel Hammond
and we had a three hour dinner at my,

617
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,070
my hangout. I live at this restaurant
called Cafe Lou in New York.

618
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:04,870
And he met me there and we sat in my
booth and we talked for three hours.

619
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,830
We never once talked about the movie.
We talked about his life,

620
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:14,410
his mother, his mother had passed away.
He loved the movie pieces of April.

621
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:20,350
And we talked about life and love and
growing up. And at the end of that,

622
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:24,460
the three hour dinner,
he said,

623
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,420
I want to make this film.
Mm hmm. He said yes.

624
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:33,920
Just took one person.
Oh,

625
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,440
good question.
Um,

626
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:41,750
you talk about reading this
article in the magazine.

627
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:46,770
How did that come about? I did
you just pick up them? No, I, I,

628
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:50,840
I'm obsessed with in New York.
I did tools. No, I'm obsessed
with the New Yorker. I,

629
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,680
I read the New Yorker,
uh, I, it's an addiction.

630
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,120
Um, but, uh, here we go to jail.

631
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:02,270
The Light, the manuscript that when did
it leaves in the back of the carb. Yeah.

632
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:06,650
Is there a possibility ability that you
might have missed reading that story?

633
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,660
Just, you know, you may not
have got the New Yorker on that,

634
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:14,220
that additional, that's very
possible. Yeah. But I didn't, yeah,

635
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:18,700
that's the important thing. Yeah.
I read it and I saved it. Well,

636
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,100
I save, I had, I had boxes of in New
York or I wouldn't know the New Yorker.

637
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:24,810
I wouldn't throw them out.
I eventually people said,

638
00:42:24,811 --> 00:42:27,840
petty takes the New
Yorkers out of your hands.

639
00:42:27,841 --> 00:42:32,490
Just give me the New Yorker
and giving me. But I, um, I, I,

640
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:37,230
I did,
I did happen to read this story and I,

641
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:41,280
um,
that's really how it happened.

642
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:46,820
But it wasn't that unusual because I, I
was, I always read the New York. Right,

643
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,130
right,
right.

644
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,940
Hi, thanks for coming out today. Uh, I had
a question sort of on acting mythology.

645
00:42:53,941 --> 00:42:57,150
So, you know, it seems
like you're both very, uh,

646
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:01,080
in tune with these characters that
you play and you know, as the movie,

647
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,470
the completion of the movie and
then you move on away from it,

648
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,290
it wouldn't do you separate yourself
from those characters that you played and

649
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:11,790
sort of become Sir Ben and Patty
again and move on to other roles.

650
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,180
The W when I was at school,

651
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:19,460
I studied physics and there
is a law in physics which,

652
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:23,690
which, um, confronts elasticity.

653
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,040
And the law says that if you stretch
something beyond its point of elasticity,

654
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,940
it's point of elasticity. I have a
physicist to hit nodding on my left.

655
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,150
It will not shrink back
to its original shape.

656
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,280
So although we throw
ourselves into our roads,

657
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,750
we have developed a technique.
We have developed boundaries,

658
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:52,190
which we alluded to earlier.
And we are,

659
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,530
there's something in our DNA, in our,
in our reactive bodies that says,

660
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:59,630
well,
if you go there,

661
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:03,470
you will have passed your point of
elasticity and you will not shrink back.

662
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:07,130
And fortunately, um, I know
it doesn't always happen.

663
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:11,900
There are some actors who
will get terribly distressed,
uh, they resort to drugs,

664
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,480
to alcohol to compensate,
to try and get back to,

665
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,680
to cope with this rather dangerous
thing that we're playing with.

666
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:23,450
We are playing with that point
of elasticity. And, um, for me,

667
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:28,640
because I have a rather forensic
approach to my, to my work, um, it,

668
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:33,660
it does, I know the is shrinking
back. I can feel it even,

669
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:38,640
you know, after every take, after
every take, it has to come back for me.

670
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,390
Some people like to stay in
the stretch zone all day.

671
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:46,920
I come back to me and then take a
jump to the next, to the next take.

672
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,120
I think, um, uh, for me as, as I work a,

673
00:44:52,121 --> 00:44:55,530
the emotional life of a character, I, Eh,

674
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:59,490
what is essential for me is to marry
it to the emotional life that I have.

675
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:04,491
So I have that well available
and readily available.

676
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,060
So it is,

677
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:10,170
it's difficult at the end of each day
when you're doing very emotional scenes.

678
00:45:10,171 --> 00:45:12,300
It's never easy, but if
it's easy, you should,

679
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:16,720
I've often thought if it's ever
easy, I shouldn't be doing this. Um,

680
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:21,540
uh,
but I will say when a movie is over,

681
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:23,130
there's a small part of you.

682
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:28,190
For me that's always been given
away that you'll never get back.

683
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:32,730
And it is, um, it's just,

684
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:39,000
that's part of the, that comes with a job
in a way. It's just, it's a small little,

685
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:41,640
there's something you've given away.

686
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:46,670
There's something you've
sacrificed in some way for this.

687
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:51,480
And it just, it, it's just, it happens.

688
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:56,600
And I find I've now learned to find
peace with that and realize that,

689
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,170
you know, the recovery
process is, uh, it's, is,

690
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,590
is slow, but it does, it will come.

691
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:09,890
But it is more info
when, when you end, uh,

692
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,020
these projects, it's, it's for me. Um,

693
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,180
I just finished doing the elephant man.

694
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,430
I did it on Broadway
and then I took it to,

695
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,760
with Bradley Cooper to London and I
just closed the play two weeks ago.

696
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,860
And here I am in Palo Alto

697
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:34,070
and I haven't quite mourn the loss of
Mrs Kendall and that whole journey with

698
00:46:34,201 --> 00:46:39,030
the elephant man because I came straight
into doing press and maybe that's good.

699
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,860
Maybe I'll just, I won't have that, that,

700
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:47,480
that mournful process.
I don't know if you,

701
00:46:47,481 --> 00:46:49,590
when I get home to New
York after all of this,

702
00:46:49,591 --> 00:46:53,570
I'm going to sit in my bed
and drink bourbon. I don't

703
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:01,170
know. I think I'm probably going
to do a celebratory Bourbon,

704
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:02,940
you know? Okay. Celebratory Bourbon.

705
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,740
Yeah. Anyway, thank you so much Bryce.

706
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:10,790
He mentions the word sacrifice
in response to your question,

707
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,090
but also there's another word
that you could also apply,

708
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:19,800
which is that you share and
you share with audiences.

709
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:24,950
And that's why that young woman cried
because you are getting amazing responses

710
00:47:25,381 --> 00:47:27,570
from people who are sharing what you do.

711
00:47:27,571 --> 00:47:32,120
So I don't sacrifice would go into
the vacuum. Yours doesn't. Yeah,

712
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,810
no, no. I mean it's just, it's a
very life affirming. Well, yes.

713
00:47:36,811 --> 00:47:40,490
I mean you give up a part of yourself for
the greater good. Yeah. That's what it,

714
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:44,430
oh, no, it's a beautiful thing.
Beautiful. It's a beautiful thing. I mean,

715
00:47:44,431 --> 00:47:49,260
when it works, there are times
when no, I mean, in this film,

716
00:47:49,261 --> 00:47:53,650
the response we've gotten
has been, um, it's,

717
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,140
it's been,
it's been great.

718
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,260
I have a question.
Um,

719
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:05,760
so I guess one of the things that being
accomplished actors who gives you is a

720
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,800
very strong platform to have
influence across the world on masses.

721
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:15,620
I'm a Sikh and I want to tell you
this is a movie Debbie celebrate,

722
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,450
um, in our community. Um,

723
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:23,490
one of the things it does is it helps
some of the lesser known religions kind of

724
00:48:23,491 --> 00:48:24,324
highlight.

725
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:28,320
And the question I have for you guys
is do you at a personal level have a

726
00:48:28,321 --> 00:48:31,110
humanistic goal of when
you play a such rules,

727
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,680
does it satisfy an innate desire
to do something for the humanity,

728
00:48:37,111 --> 00:48:41,310
you know, across that cuts across
geographical lines, country lines,

729
00:48:41,311 --> 00:48:45,350
and you know, it's going to be
celebrated perhaps more so in a vase,

730
00:48:45,351 --> 00:48:48,870
smaller section of the
the world. Um, you know,

731
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:52,650
and still be able to sort
of have the influence.

732
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,760
I think that we are distant
descendants from something tribally,

733
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:04,700
absolutely essential. And that is that
we are descendants of the ancient,

734
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,360
ancient,

735
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:10,360
ancient storyteller who used to light a
fire and get the tribe around him or her

736
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,900
and comfort them in the night.

737
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,830
Tell them very reassuring,
beautiful stories.

738
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,700
So that they would have the confidence
to know that the night would pass,

739
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,890
the sun would come up again.

740
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,400
And I'm sure in our DNA that
both patty and I are distant,

741
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:35,570
distant, distant descendants from
the healist Sharman storyteller.

742
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:39,590
I'm sure we are. And certainly, um, uh,

743
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,630
W I think we're aware that,

744
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:46,190
that you drop a pebble into the water
and the ripples can be extraordinary. Um,

745
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:51,080
I don't think we strive to do that,
but I think it comes with the job.

746
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:51,943
Would you agree?

747
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,250
Yes. But I have to say
through what you just said,

748
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,120
made the whole nine years
that journey worth it.

749
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:02,523
Yeah.

750
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,860
Hi, I'm patty. This, um,

751
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:18,720
this film clearly has been a very long
coming goal for you and now that you've

752
00:50:18,721 --> 00:50:19,770
finally achieved it.

753
00:50:19,771 --> 00:50:23,550
I was just wondering if there's some
other project that you feel just as

754
00:50:23,551 --> 00:50:26,820
passionate about that is next on the list.

755
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,350
Yes, I do. I have another, I have
another long journey of a film,

756
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,090
uh, about, uh,

757
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:40,120
my next journey is to make a movie about
this fabulous woman from the forties,

758
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:42,980
thirties, forties, 50s
named Tallulah Bankhead.

759
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:49,010
If you don't know who she
is, Google her. Uh, uh,

760
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:53,900
she was, um, quite a character,
a brilliant, funny woman,

761
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:58,670
a great actress. And, and, uh, Phil did,

762
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:03,200
she really defined the word
Joie de vivre. And, uh, she, uh,

763
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:06,920
she broke all the boundaries and
broke all the rules in Hollywood.

764
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:11,570
She's just someone I've wanted to play
and you have to have a very deep voice.

765
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:18,560
And, uh, and I'm, I'm, I'm
pretty much there. And, uh,

766
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:23,230
so, uh, it's just, she's a
woman that fascinates me. Um,

767
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:27,680
she was, uh, omnivorous
and a carnivorous. She was,

768
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,870
she, uh, she wanted everything in life
and every person, male, female, she,

769
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,920
um, I'm, I'm looking forward to,

770
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:40,220
that's the next journey.
So beautiful script. Uh,

771
00:51:40,221 --> 00:51:43,910
I'm in the process of getting that
together and to make that very cool.

772
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,960
Thank you. Wish me, please say,
hopefully it won't be nine years.

773
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,160
Good luck. Thank you. Well, thank you

774
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:57,340
so much.
[inaudible].

775
00:51:57,341 --> 00:52:00,580
Thank you both so much for joining us
today and I hope everyone enjoys the film

776
00:52:00,581 --> 00:52:02,620
very much. Thank you so much. You guys.
