1
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,020
Uh, pregnant women smell soul. Wonderful.

2
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,080
Okay.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,290
I'm actually doing a piece on motherhood.
Really?

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,400
Did you know embryonic fluid is
actually urine? Let's open that wine.

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,510
We're having a baby too. Yeah. How far
along are you? I'm not actually pregnant.

6
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,220
We have a surrogate.

7
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,930
I'm Kiki and Wayne and Tina's
baby surrogate mom. Did
you screwed? Sorry again.

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,853
Whoa.

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,190
I think Donna's boning someone else.
Okay. Suppose he is. They care.

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,090
Of course I care.
There are five phases of a woman's life.

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,750
I am in phase four.
You have to be a mother.

12
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,910
If government and businesses are
going to devalue women's work and make

13
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:07,570
motherhood economically unfeasible,
why not outsource it?

14
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,430
See, this is why people
hate liberals. Huh?

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,160
I made fresh orange juice for Karen.
Folic acid.

16
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,050
Tina is like a sperm donor.
I'm so not like a sperm donor.

17
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,350
God, I feel so bad. Wow.

18
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,400
Let's welcome to the
stage at least Reiner,

19
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,420
David Allen face and Madeline didn't
know. No, just to get things started.

20
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:50,300
We celebrated International
Women's Day on Friday.

21
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,760
Did anyone do anything
exciting and celebration? Yeah.

22
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,270
I wish shooting actually. But,
um, at the end of the day live in,

23
00:01:57,271 --> 00:02:00,360
I made a video. We, I work
a lot with equality now,

24
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:02,280
which is another amazing organization.

25
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:07,281
And they asked a lot of different women
to make a video about what freedom means

26
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:11,280
to them. And I wanted to
wait and do it with live. So,

27
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,830
so if you check my Instagram,
yeah.

28
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,400
Freedom means to me.
Yeah. That's excellent.

29
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,680
And we just did so many
corporate presentations.

30
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:25,160
We did a really large global
presentation for Sony,

31
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:26,990
for all the divisions of Sony.
Okay.

32
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,970
And then the day before I did
a big presentation for a Carew,

33
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:36,150
which is the children's advertising
and online, um, organization.

34
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:37,900
So it was a busy presentation week.
Yeah.

35
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,820
Yeah, I would imagine it's kind of peak
season for you guys. So that's wonderful.

36
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:43,300
Um,

37
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,010
I actually took the day off of work
I not specifically for when I was my

38
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:49,200
father's birthday,
but I'm,

39
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,580
I got to see him spend some quality
time with his grand daughters,

40
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:54,130
which was incredible. Um, so great.

41
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:57,880
So we are here to talk about
this amazing film egg. Um,

42
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,200
and as I said before,

43
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,650
I've watched it a few times and every
time I'm catching more and more of the

44
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:07,030
complexity of the characters
and the nuances of, um,

45
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,150
really both what it means to be a woman
and what it means when we consider or

46
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,930
find ourselves faced with or decide not
to move forward with motherhood. Um,

47
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,920
but also what it means to all of
those around us. Um, so you know,

48
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:24,250
how our partners perceive
it. How are, um, you know,

49
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:28,150
former friends from different parts
of our lives perceive our roles. Um,

50
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,670
and there's really just
a ton to unpack there.

51
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,430
But I'd love to hear from Alicia,
David,

52
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:36,100
kind of what brought you to
this project very quickly.

53
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:36,280
Okay.

54
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,280
We did a reading of it almost 10 years
ago and I felt when we did this reading

55
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:48,430
that it's spoke to things, the character
said things that I've always thought,

56
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:53,431
but I had been afraid to
say and I loved it so much.

57
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,690
And at that time it was, they were
considering it for the stage and, um,

58
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,170
and I just was like, oh my God, I
want to do this. I want to do this.

59
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,540
And then I got really busy, like first
of all, making an actual human being,

60
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:11,680
but then also on orange is the new
black and all these other shows.

61
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:16,681
And two summers ago we were on
a ferry boat from fire island.

62
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:21,640
And I only bring that up because
it was from the town of Kismet.

63
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,820
So it was actually kismet.
Um,

64
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,420
and we bumped into the
writer and she said,

65
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:31,890
I just did a rewrite on the screenplay
version of it. Would you like to read it?

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,700
We were like,
yes.

67
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,210
And I felt more than ever it was these
things that no one was talking about,

68
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,050
about the relationship between work
and art and commerce and parenthood and

69
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:50,970
career and friendship.
And you know,

70
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,240
I was talking to someone recently about
how we're changing so much in reference

71
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:59,500
to gender norms and

72
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:06,390
how we talk about gender and
yet we haven't made those
changes around parenthood

73
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,780
and how we talk about the roles of
parenthood and we have such an antiquated

74
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:17,080
version of what a mother and a father is.

75
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,890
And it just hasn't caught
up to our world today.

76
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,590
And I wanted to bring up
some of those issues. Yeah.

77
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,630
It had stuck with us. I mean, yeah,
it was, we were actors by trade.

78
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,690
We both make a living as actors,
which is great. Um, you know, Alicia,

79
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,000
Alicia and another partner
produced the Wall Street, uh,

80
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,680
the female driven Wall Street
movie called equity. And, um, yeah,

81
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,860
I had just finished five years on a
Sitcom and I thought I had a break and

82
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:50,660
Alicia said, hey, you're going
to produce this with us, um,

83
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,830
you get to be the associate producer.
And I said, what the hell is that? Um,

84
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,640
it turns out that he runs around putting
out all the fires. Right. I learned that.

85
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:00,680
And then, um, uh, you know,

86
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:03,500
we really weren't necessarily sure
we want it to produce anything again,

87
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,670
but then we met the writer on the ferry
and there was egg again and we said,

88
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,720
Oh man, it's, it's so
good. And I as a man,

89
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:16,580
I love the male characters in it. I love
what the male characters have to say. I,

90
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,330
you know, I, I've, I was excited
about it. Um, even if, uh, you know,

91
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:24,470
even if it's quote unquote female driven
content, you know, uh, I was all in.

92
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,140
So when something sticks with you like
that, you know, you've got to do it.

93
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,190
Yeah. It's interesting to hear that
it was like a multi year process.

94
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:33,480
So just kind of sticking
until it finds its final form.

95
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,970
And I'll also say for me,

96
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,390
I like as a producer,
I need to,

97
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:45,150
I don't produce something unless I
feel like it needs a voice. You know,

98
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:48,660
there's a lot of stories that I'll
read and I'll be like, that's amazing.

99
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:52,560
But I know so I know this
will get produced. Like I
know someone will do this.

100
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,210
This is one of those where I was like,

101
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,580
I feel like too many people would be
afraid to make this movie and I wanted to

102
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:03,390
be the one who wasn't afraid to
make this movie. We're glad you did.

103
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,550
That actually is a great segway. Mallon,
I would love to hear, um, you know, from,

104
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,090
from the Lens of the Gina Davis Institute,

105
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:15,720
why was this film so important to,
to your mission?

106
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,020
Building off what Alicia is saying is
that there was probably a lot of people

107
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:23,070
who would pass on this because it's not
something that is obvious to be spoken

108
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:26,400
about. And why is that just even
more important to be spoken about?

109
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,770
It's important in terms of
onscreen behind the camera,

110
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:35,000
which I'd love for Alicia and David
to talk about it. And you know,

111
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:36,380
there's a social imperative.

112
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:41,381
So how do we take these kind of societal
norms and turned them upside down,

113
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,570
um, which they did, you know, beautifully.

114
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:47,600
But from a business imperative,

115
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,610
we just did a benchmark study,

116
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:54,290
which looked at 10 years
of films, family films, g,

117
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:58,160
PG, PG 13. And what we found
is over the past decade,

118
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:02,930
female centric films generated
55% more at the box office.

119
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,470
And that change happened in 2016 where
female centric films generated 70% more

120
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:15,110
at the box office. And in 2017 it
was 38% more through box office.

121
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,170
So it's, there's the social
imperative, which we're talking about,

122
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,790
but there's the business
imperative. So it's, it's really,

123
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,410
really important. But yet, even
still female lead characters,

124
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:31,550
there's still a two to one ratio of
male characters to female characters.

125
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:36,350
So that's not what happened
in the case of a egg.

126
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,940
Um,
so it's really important.

127
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:41,650
And then I'd love to throw to you to
talk about behind the camera. Yeah.

128
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,840
Mm. So, um, our third partner on this,

129
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:50,340
Michelle gainless who was the president
of comedy central on who had left in,

130
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:54,480
was looking into producing her own
stuff and who has now started a great

131
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:58,050
production company as well.
Um,

132
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,000
this was her first piece, you
know, off of comedy central.

133
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,370
And the thing that I loved
about Michelle from the get go,

134
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,530
or we loved about
Michelle from the get go,

135
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:15,531
was that she was equally committed
to hiring all women across the board.

136
00:09:15,861 --> 00:09:20,280
So we hired all female heads of every
single department. So we have a female,

137
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,510
for example, a female writer, female
director, a female cinematographer.

138
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,160
And I love to talk about her because
she had never shot a feature.

139
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,900
Not because she wasn't insanely talented,

140
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:34,740
but because no one had given her
the opportunity. And I saw a short,

141
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:39,741
she did in Africa with children and a
leopard and they say like the two things

142
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:45,540
you should never do or work
with animals and children.

143
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,830
And she did this Spec Tech.

144
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,420
I mean the film is
spectacularly beautiful,

145
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,830
but this was her first feature and now
she's shot like three more in the past

146
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:59,400
two years. And female sound
design, female sound design,

147
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,260
female set designer,
rube or job had female camera,

148
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,690
camera op. Yeah,
everything. So, um, editor.

149
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,120
So we did all female heads of all
departments and then 70% female crew.

150
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,900
And that felt amazing.
And yes,

151
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,430
the women made as much if
not more than the men. Um,

152
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,290
and it felt amazing.

153
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:30,291
And one of the things that I love to
say is there was way less drama than any

154
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:34,920
other set I've ever been on.
You know, if we like have that,

155
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:40,170
the gender norms of like women are
dramatic and throw a hissy fit,

156
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:44,070
whatever did not happen,
there was no drama. Um,

157
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,100
we finished our days on time or early
every day and we were shooting sometimes

158
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,840
like eight pages a day.
Um,

159
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,990
and it was an incredible experience and
I think my favorite part was the emails

160
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:03,231
from women and young women who this was
their first job on a set and they wrote

161
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:07,560
to us afterwards and said like,
I've been on a couple of sets in,

162
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:11,100
it's not like egg. Even our production
designer recently wrote us and she's like,

163
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:14,280
I still haven't had another
experience like egg.

164
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,110
And they said,

165
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:19,950
I haven't like other
sets weren't like this,

166
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,370
but you gave me hope and you made me feel
like I can create that in the future.

167
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:29,430
Like when I'm the boss, I'm going to do
that and I'm going to hire more women.

168
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:34,431
And that's really why I'm sitting up here
with this woman is because way before

169
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,130
I made this movie,
before I made movies,

170
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,770
she inspired me in the Gina
Davis Institute inspired
me about if you can see it,

171
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:47,250
you can be it both onscreen and off.

172
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:49,710
And that is so deeply important.

173
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:54,190
I'll never forget when I first heard
this statistic of when you watch

174
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,540
anything, even a cartoon, 77%
of the characters are male,

175
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,130
which means any girl watching any
media feels like she's a minority.

176
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:08,110
Like that's a ridiculous concept.
Women are up 50% of the population,

177
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,020
but no matter what they're watching it,

178
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:15,430
when they're watching any screen,
they feel like a minority.

179
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,290
And just to add some context to that,
our friends had common sense media, uh,

180
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,710
do a lot of analyses
on a media consumption.

181
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:28,711
So your average tween in the United
States is engaging and watching media

182
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,420
upwards of six hours a day.

183
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:36,421
And teens are still engaging with media
and watching about nine hours a day.

184
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:39,550
It's more than sleeping school,
anything else they're doing.

185
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,820
So when you think about media impressions
and you think about the repetitiveness

186
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:49,570
and how it's being reinforced,
they're seeing that, uh,

187
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,680
stereotyped media image
over and over and over.

188
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,030
And it does make an impact
on how they view the world,

189
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,940
how they view each other.
So it's very significant.

190
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,840
Actually, it's a question for you on
that because we were talking earlier,

191
00:13:05,841 --> 00:13:10,160
I feel like I'm starting to see more
female leads, more female driven.

192
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:12,350
We're starting to see a lot
of female superhero movies.

193
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,430
Is this the case of being hungry and
seeing signs for food all the time?

194
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:19,190
Or are we really seeing
a shift in the industry?

195
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,050
Well, in terms of this benchmark
study that we just did, you know,

196
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:27,670
unfortunately 10 years later it's
still a two to one ratio of male carer,

197
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,720
male leads,
you know,

198
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:33,721
to female leads and women are 52% of
movie going audience and we're 51% of the

199
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:39,340
population.
So we're not really being represented.

200
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,410
And when we talk about people of Color,

201
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:45,160
people of color are 38%
of the US population.

202
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,310
But in terms of the past decade of
film there solely 16.7% and then if you

203
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:54,790
really want to get into the
intersectionality of it,

204
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,410
which is an a really
important conversation, uh,

205
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,720
people with disabilities,

206
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,080
people who identify as Lgbtq are less
than 1% of any character in a film over

207
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:14,290
the past 10 years.
The top 100 films from the United States.

208
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,730
So we have a lot of work to do.

209
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,940
I'm glad you guys are doing the work. Uh,
there's another interesting facet to, um,

210
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,720
the film where a Alicia,
your character, Tina,

211
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,850
is financially leading the partnership.
It comes up in a way,

212
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,980
um, in a couple of different
conversations that she is, um, you know,

213
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,060
leading the highest household from a
contribute contribution perspective. Um,

214
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,930
she's spun as kind of,
you know,

215
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,170
not being woman enough or
not being nurturing enough.

216
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,280
And when you compare that with,
um,

217
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,800
Kiki's who is very needy
and very dependent, um,

218
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,020
and you know, the men, sorry,

219
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,960
David or like tripping over
themselves to take care of her. Um,

220
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,010
talk about that a little
bit about that storyline.

221
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,330
I think you should talk about
that. Yeah, talk about it.

222
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,620
I think, I believe the line in
the, in the uh, film where, um,

223
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,060
Tina Alicia's character says is accused
of not being nurturing and kind of

224
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:21,110
comparing the women in the room and she
says, I'm not nurturing. And just look at,

225
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,020
look at her. She's a
fucking train wreck. Right?

226
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,430
And the power of the powerless
woman, no man can resist. Hmm.

227
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,200
Right. And I, and additionally,
I, my character, you,

228
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,620
you find out in that moment is
supporting her husband is, you know,

229
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:41,310
and like how is that not nurturing?

230
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,960
And she says, look, I support
you wanted to do this.

231
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,270
I, I supported that. You want to do this.

232
00:15:48,271 --> 00:15:50,570
That's where did that you want to do this?
They supported that.

233
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,280
It's never enough. It's never
enough. That's, and that's
an interesting thing. Um,

234
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,340
and it is, it is fascinating
to see, uh, the shift in,

235
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,330
in society. You know, um, we were talking
about this earlier or from, you know,

236
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:05,910
women who are breadwinners in their
family and make more money than their

237
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:08,940
husbands do. Um, and in this case,

238
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:12,930
I think it was one of the things I really
liked about the film and I read it, uh,

239
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,430
even before we made it was a
dawn. My character a is, you know,

240
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:20,790
very happy to be the
wealthiest person in the room.

241
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:24,060
He's fairly certain of that even though
none of us know anything about anyone.

242
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,360
Right. But he makes that assumption
and a is a perfectly fine with that.

243
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,630
And that gives him power over people,
especially over women.

244
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:35,100
And so it's a very interesting
thing to see the when,

245
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,330
when a woman is an artist,
um, self assured, um,

246
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,500
financially stable, I'm financial
independent and speaks her mind.

247
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,010
You know, it's fascinating to hear
what people have had to say about,

248
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,260
about that character in the film.
Yeah. And, and I like that. I and I,

249
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,030
dawn judges everyone in the room,
um,

250
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,830
and we're all judging everyone all
the time, but yeah, a little more.

251
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:02,130
So that's what makes it fun. Um, and uh,

252
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:07,250
and dawn gives voice to some of the
stereotypical misogyny that we're hearing

253
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:11,130
all the time. And, and I don't like him,

254
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,890
but I liked the chance to, to do
that so that people will go, oh,

255
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,890
or people will go, oh, he didn't just
say that. Did he just say that? Yeah.

256
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,820
You were a lot of audible groan when,

257
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,430
when I get very happy about those.
Yeah.

258
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,010
I have to just knowing you, I was, I mean,

259
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:33,270
it was making me laugh at every turn
because it was so antithetical to who you

260
00:17:33,271 --> 00:17:38,170
are, but it was, it's almost like,
and because it takes place in,

261
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,960
in this loft, throughout the
film, mostly in this main area,

262
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:47,961
you kind of get this insular feeling of
almost being in somebody's head and you

263
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:51,900
have all the different judgments
or different aspects of,

264
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,370
of what could be firing off.

265
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:56,730
And there's a tremendous
amount of judgment and it's
coming across both genders

266
00:17:56,731 --> 00:18:01,300
and it's coming across, um, different
parenting decisions. And, um,

267
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,870
it really to that.
And I'm curious,

268
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:08,871
did you guys have to let go of any of
your preconceived notions coming into this

269
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:12,120
film in order to portray these characters?
Like how was that for you

270
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,690
to see one, you know, um,

271
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:22,560
I mean, yes. I mean, yes,
right. We owe, as the actors,
we always do because we're not,

272
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,510
unless we're playing ourselves,
then yeah,

273
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,770
then we have our own preconceived notions.
But character,

274
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,770
the characters that you inhabit
always have preconceived notions.

275
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:34,470
Sometimes that's your way. And sometimes
the, I mean, with Donna Asleep,

276
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,900
he's such a judgmental asshole that I
was like, God got it. Got It. Yeah, no,

277
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,650
that guy. Yeah, we all know that guy.
But we may work with some of them.

278
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,910
May I probably not here,
not here at Google. Um,

279
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,060
but we've, we all know those
guys. And um, uh, I had, yeah,

280
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:58,500
I mean, and honestly I was on, again,
I was on a set that was 70% female and,

281
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,010
and fairly invisible unless I was in
front of the camera and they don't,

282
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,330
and that's not a criticism,
it's not a complaint. Um, and I,

283
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:09,320
so I had to set aside my preconceived
notion of, Oh, well, I'm,

284
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,720
I'm a man and I'm producing a movie
and I'm one of the big bosses. Oh no,

285
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,680
but he's going to come on now, let's do,
do what I say to do. What up dude, go on,

286
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:21,630
fall in line. Um, not that, not
that I was ever that guy, but, uh,

287
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:24,900
I was in a room full of smart women and
that things are getting taken care of.

288
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:28,050
And I was kind of like, it's okay
if, if I don't have to, you know,

289
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:30,390
at least we're talking about drama.
Like I don't have to yell.

290
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,100
I don't have to be typically male
or loud or to get things done.

291
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:39,150
They seem to be happening just fine and
it's okay if I'm not seeing it's because

292
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:40,920
there's no problems, no
fire to put out. Like,

293
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,130
so I had to kind of adjust what I thought
my role was going to be as producer in

294
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:46,980
that way.
Right.

295
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,470
What does that change the dynamic
of the set and the dynamic of the

296
00:19:51,471 --> 00:19:54,980
relationships? Was that palpable too as
well from previous films you've been?

297
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:55,814
Oh yeah.

298
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,080
Oh for sure. Yeah. You know, um,

299
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:05,170
I love that you brought that
up because for me as an actor,

300
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,460
as an actor playing Tina,

301
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:12,461
like Tina has a lot more preconceived
notions and judgment and um,

302
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,380
her way of doing things than I do.
Like,

303
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:20,840
I think as a human being,

304
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:25,841
one of my biggest goals is to sort of
strip away as many biases as I can.

305
00:20:28,371 --> 00:20:33,371
Cause that makes me a more open artist
and more able to play the widest variety.

306
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:36,980
It also makes life more interesting.
I'm just much more,

307
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,600
I find life much more fun if you're
really willing to listen and wonder,

308
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,111
you know,

309
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:46,880
our production company company is called
to wonder fold to be limited like two

310
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,160
people full of wonder.

311
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,490
And my biggest goal is I grow
and age is to keep wondering.

312
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,610
Like I feel like people tend to get
more and more narrow and they hang on to

313
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:04,990
their beliefs more and more as they age
where a small humans like are much more

314
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:07,300
like I wonder,
oh I don't know.

315
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,980
And I want to stay like that
wonder place as long as possible.

316
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,780
And I think Tina feels like she
knows things a lot more than I do.

317
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,340
But um,

318
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,480
in reference to the dynamic of the sat,

319
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,990
it was very surprising
I think to everyone.

320
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:31,770
And I didn't realize what a white
male I was married to until we were,

321
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,680
and this dynamic cause by the way
they're married. Yeah. It's a really like

322
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,250
evolved feminist white male.

323
00:21:41,251 --> 00:21:46,251
But you put him in a room with a lot of
powerful women and he's still a white

324
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:49,860
man and he still can fall.

325
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,890
Like we all as women can fall into seeing
him as such and he still can fall into

326
00:21:57,811 --> 00:22:02,340
those, um, stereotypical roles. You know,

327
00:22:02,341 --> 00:22:03,330
like we all,

328
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:08,331
we all fall into our roles sometimes
on an off camera without realizing it.

329
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,513
Yup.

330
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,920
Actually, let's, um, let's roll.
Uh, we have a couple of quips.

331
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,200
The throw the first clip here,

332
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,920
I forgot. I'm, I'm not,
not actually pregnant.

333
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:20,380
We have a surrogate mother.

334
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,050
Oh, oh, oh, wow. Yeah, yeah.

335
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,640
Oh, a surrogate. Yeah. We know a
gay couple of weeks at that. Yeah.

336
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,230
The guy who did our a window treatments.

337
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,780
Did you have to go through all that awful
IVF fertility? Snow? Well that's good.

338
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:42,310
Yeah. No I can't. I mean we
can, this was more of an option.

339
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,173
Okay.

340
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,113
Uh,

341
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:50,150
sort of a utopian pregnancy,
utopian pregnancy.

342
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:55,330
It's sort of a dismantling
and restructuring of the
traditional family unit.

343
00:22:56,211 --> 00:23:01,211
A redistribution of roles to a
more shared economy kind of thing.

344
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,830
I, you're the first people we've told,
we don't really have the wrap down yet.

345
00:23:06,831 --> 00:23:10,240
So you can have the baby
yourself, right? Yes. I,

346
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,070
we can we choose not to.

347
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,970
You're paying someone to have
the baby for you. Yeah. Perfect.

348
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:21,641
I love,

349
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:26,200
I love this clip because you come up with
the notion of language and you're like,

350
00:23:26,201 --> 00:23:29,830
we don't have the wrap down yet.
And I think this is something that,

351
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,250
you know,
we all,

352
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,440
we all have these judgements.

353
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:39,441
We all have these opinions that we bring
with us into certainly family dynamics

354
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:42,870
and this assumption of how things should
be or how they can roll off the tongue

355
00:23:42,871 --> 00:23:46,010
or not. And when we tend to
go outside lines with what

356
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,510
we expect, that's where we really
start to get tongue tied. Um,

357
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,770
and that's why I love the vulnerability
of showcasing your character.

358
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:59,540
Just working through that with exactly
the judgments that you would expect.

359
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,400
What, why, what, you know,

360
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,660
talk to me a little bit about
the importance of that language

361
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,360
language. Such an interesting
thing. And as an artist,

362
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,060
there are some writers,
for example,

363
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,750
who are very specific about language.
You know,

364
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:22,751
Aaron Sorkin doesn't want you to change
a single word or a period period.

365
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:27,740
Um,
and other writers are much more open,

366
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,540
reset. Our writer, and this was
somewhat open, but interestingly enough,

367
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:37,250
our director didn't want us to
change a word. She's like, she felt,

368
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:40,910
and she's,
she's written and directed things.

369
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:45,911
And in this case she was just the director
and she felt that the writing was so

370
00:24:46,731 --> 00:24:47,564
purse

371
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,310
precise that she didn't
want us to change a thing.

372
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:57,140
And she didn't want us to Improv a lot,
but she wanted it to feel like Improv.

373
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,600
So that moment that you just saw,

374
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,650
even though I'm floundering for the words,
that's actually,

375
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:08,651
that was all written as such
and language in our culture.

376
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:14,480
I think we are in this moment where we
don't have language for a lot of what's

377
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:18,950
going on in the world and we're
creating new language. You know,

378
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,140
um,
when I was growing up,

379
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,970
there was no such thing as
gender fluid and nonbinary.

380
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,990
And we have a 10 year
old and that is such,

381
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:33,290
it just is for her. And that's, um,

382
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,420
and that's such a beautiful,

383
00:25:35,421 --> 00:25:40,100
miraculous thing because we
as a culture are evolving.

384
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,130
But this,
as I said earlier,

385
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:48,131
like the way we handled parent roles has
not of hall like were my daughter knows

386
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:56,711
how to describe her gender fluidity so
much better than we as a culture know how

387
00:25:58,071 --> 00:26:02,960
to describe parenthood.
And that's to me a problem,

388
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,590
you know, and part of what we
were looking to delve into,

389
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:09,950
and sometimes it's my deepest tube,
why I'm an artist,

390
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,980
is that we can express these things
and delve into them and art as a way to

391
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:20,621
bring up conversation to then
move our society forward.

392
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,850
And I think you were alluding to that too,

393
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:26,630
and I'm thinking back to you guys on
the boat of this being a story that some

394
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:31,010
people would shy away from because it
does unpack those things and you can even

395
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:35,210
see the characters questioning themselves.
Am I happy?

396
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:39,560
Is this what I wanted? Was that decision,
the right decision for me? And, um,

397
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,151
you know,
it's,

398
00:26:40,151 --> 00:26:44,100
it's just very human that grappling and
I think we don't see so much of that.

399
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,371
I mean,

400
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:49,371
certainly Madeline within the industry
where there's a lot of glamor and Shane

401
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:50,431
to everything,

402
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:55,320
we don't see the characters really crumble
as much on these definitive parts of

403
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:59,600
their lives. Do you have any thoughts
on that? Well, when we look at, um,

404
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,450
attributes and careers,

405
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:07,750
only 15% of female
characters in TV and film.

406
00:27:07,821 --> 00:27:11,030
And this is from our 2018 data,
which we haven't published yet,

407
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,860
are shown working. Mm
hmm. Um, and then 15,

408
00:27:15,861 --> 00:27:19,730
15% just showing, you know, working. Um,

409
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,470
and when you look at also the ageism
of it, which is another thing, um,

410
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,470
in the movie, um, you know,

411
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,580
most female characters
are shown in their teens.

412
00:27:31,581 --> 00:27:33,530
Most of them are shown under 19,

413
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,510
only 30% are shown in their forties
and only 3% in their fifties.

414
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,800
And,

415
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,800
and so when you think about motherhood
and women having children at an older

416
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:50,120
age, that's not something that's really
being reflected, you know, in, you know,

417
00:27:50,121 --> 00:27:51,990
in the media.
Um,

418
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,400
and then when you think about
Kinda the caretaking of it, uh,

419
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,750
there's very few men depicted as um,

420
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,300
caretaking and when they are,

421
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:06,730
you see a lot of the bumbling
yes, you know, this silly lazy,

422
00:28:06,731 --> 00:28:11,390
bumbling dad and,
and we know from our friends at Promundo,

423
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:14,330
but I happened to sit on their board that,
you know,

424
00:28:14,331 --> 00:28:19,220
changing the dynamics of masculinity and
really reflecting that in the media is

425
00:28:19,221 --> 00:28:23,240
important because most American
fathers want to spend more time.

426
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,240
I think it's nearly 70% want to spend
more time with their children and that's

427
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:31,910
their data, not our data. So you know,

428
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:36,911
media is not really keeping up
with how our society is changing.

429
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,980
Yes. Preaching to the choir, you percent
of the dads want to be doing, by the way.

430
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,790
Yeah. Well what we've
done, well, it's funny,

431
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,870
when we did an average,
a study on gender bias and advertising,

432
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,320
a 48% of the female characters in ads
will most likely to be in the kitchen.

433
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,680
And the men were at sporting
events and driving around in cars.

434
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:04,920
So that's where they were driving
around what they're doing. Yeah.

435
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,103
We'll get there.

436
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,860
Uh, we have one, one more.
Click ahead. Equip number two.

437
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:16,120
I can see why you guys chose her. Oh,
shut up. I'll get you something to put on.

438
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,380
Hi, I'm Kiki. I'm Wayne and
Tina's baby surrogate mom.

439
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,310
I'm Karen. You're pregnant too,
right? Oh No, I'm not pregnant.

440
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,780
I'm kidding.
Oh good.

441
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,890
It's always so horrible when you ask
someone if they're pregnant and then it

442
00:29:32,891 --> 00:29:37,120
just turns out that they're just, you
know, fat. Oh, well I'm pregnant and fat.

443
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:42,700
Oh God, no, no, no. I didn't mean
that. You're, uh, I know. I mean,

444
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:45,460
obviously you're pregnant.
Doesn't she look wonderful?

445
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:50,470
You have such a rosy cheeks here.
Oh,

446
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,423
thank you.

447
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:59,160
Awkward. So awkward,
but also so relatable.

448
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,230
Um, and I just, I think there's so
much packed into that one exchange,

449
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,760
whether it's, you know, the,

450
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,710
the body shaming hypersexualization
of Kiki and then there's the,

451
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,811
you know,
the,

452
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:15,720
the question around is she pregnant
or is she fat and why does it matter?

453
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:18,630
And why is this a public thing?
When women are carrying that,

454
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:20,790
then it's all they can talk to you about.
You know,

455
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:25,290
there's so much packed into
that one exchange. Tell us,
tell us about the scene.

456
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,300
It's funny. Um, I was, I did a an evening,

457
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:31,750
Liz,

458
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,390
I'm totally going off on a tangent because
everyone's going to watch the movie.

459
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,660
Watched it already, right?
That's right. Oh Man.

460
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:42,010
I don't want to like give anything away,
but I did a with time's up.

461
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:44,480
I produced an evening,
uh,

462
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,460
about Rebecca Traister is book or
inspired by Rebecca's chasers book,

463
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,590
good and mad,
which all of you should read.

464
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,210
It's really the history of
rage and female rage and anger.

465
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:59,920
And I did it honestly because
I'm afraid of my own anger.

466
00:30:59,921 --> 00:31:04,630
I'm afraid of anger. And so
when I, in that wondering way,

467
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:09,310
when I find something that I'm afraid
of and that makes me have a pit in my

468
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:12,250
stomach, I'm like, go towards
that and go explore it.

469
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:17,251
So we did this evening and we had a lot
of different women find a passage about

470
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:22,180
rage are raging to express.

471
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,870
And so we had a comedian
who I love because, um,

472
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,420
she's a woman obviously. She, uh,

473
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,090
is disabled and she is Muslim.

474
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,900
And so she, like, she is one of
the most amazing women I know.

475
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:46,230
And she does a comedy bit about being
pregnant and about how you never should

476
00:31:47,111 --> 00:31:50,800
ask anyone if they're
pregnant ever because,

477
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,980
or parents because people will tell
you like they will show you the baby

478
00:31:57,191 --> 00:32:01,000
pictures before you can even ask.
So you never even,

479
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,740
and it's not even just pregnant,

480
00:32:02,741 --> 00:32:07,360
it's parenthood because we assume
that all women want to be parents.

481
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:12,361
And that's a really big topic of this
movie is not all women want to be parents.

482
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,230
Not all men want to be parents.
And that's okay.

483
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,130
A woman is enough whether
she's a mother or not,

484
00:32:21,131 --> 00:32:26,131
she's more than enough and that we've
created this standard and this norm that

485
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:33,450
is completely inappropriate and
lets go of any choice for women.

486
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,670
And that's what enraged me about it.

487
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:40,610
And it was another thing that made me
really want to make movie is I want women

488
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,661
to have free,

489
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:46,661
all women's have freedom of
choice in a full and complete way.

490
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:52,060
Um, so that's uh, you know, for me
with that, oh, mint is about, yeah.

491
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,360
Yeah. I think it's interesting how
you see the characters evolve from,

492
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:58,441
you know,

493
00:32:58,441 --> 00:33:01,920
pushing each other to each other's edge
and then really coming to each other's

494
00:33:01,921 --> 00:33:06,170
rescue at the same time. And I think
there's a lot, there's obviously the,

495
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:09,270
the motherhood and parenthood, um, topic,

496
00:33:09,271 --> 00:33:12,870
but there's a lot to feminine
relationships that's explored as well.

497
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:13,950
And I found that really,

498
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,690
really powerful.
I mean,

499
00:33:15,691 --> 00:33:20,040
that's my favorite thing about the
movie is these two women, you know,

500
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:25,100
Kiki aside sort of who are old friends
and really believed Dee bleed different

501
00:33:28,231 --> 00:33:31,290
things,
have made different choices,

502
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:36,680
but are willing to lovingly accept and
listen to each other as choices without

503
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:43,050
making the other make the same choice.
And that to me is what true,

504
00:33:43,051 --> 00:33:45,090
authentic friendship is about.

505
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,600
And it was another reason why this was
so deeply important for me to make as a

506
00:33:54,091 --> 00:33:57,240
filmmaker in this moment because it was,

507
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,460
we read the script in like October.
Um,

508
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,110
the man people call president,
uh,

509
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,160
became president in January.

510
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,840
And I met Christina at the women's March,
um,

511
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,760
and it,

512
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:19,761
which was the weekend of the inauguration
and I found out that she was childless

513
00:34:20,761 --> 00:34:23,370
by choice. And I thought, wow,

514
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,400
how interesting to make this movie in
this moment when women feel like an

515
00:34:29,851 --> 00:34:34,050
endangered species.
And additionally,

516
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:39,210
when 53% of white women
voted for that human being,

517
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:44,430
um, it's a little bit of a
Baltimore thing for me. Um,

518
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,360
I, um, I,

519
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,550
I realized I wanted to also make art
about people listening to each other,

520
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,550
even if they didn't
believe the same thing.

521
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,750
And that's incredibly
important to me in this moment.

522
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,430
Learning how to listen without
judgment or even if you're judging,

523
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,230
shut the fuck up and try and really
listen and learn something and ask as many

524
00:35:10,231 --> 00:35:15,000
questions and try and really
open up your heart to what's,

525
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,810
what can I relate to here?
What can I possibly relate to here?

526
00:35:18,811 --> 00:35:23,760
And I think these two women do a
really magical job of that. Um,

527
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:28,740
and that to me is what the, the
story, the core of the story became.

528
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,450
And it wasn't what, I didn't know
that that's what it really was deeply,

529
00:35:33,451 --> 00:35:37,340
most deeply about until the
editing room. Really. Um,

530
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,840
but in watching the edit it was like,
oh,

531
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:44,841
it's really about being willing to
listen and support even if you don't

532
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:50,910
necessarily believe the same thing. Yeah,
I think that definitely came through.

533
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:55,070
And in particular, uh, the
scenes with just the two of
them, then it's very strong.

534
00:35:55,080 --> 00:36:00,080
I'm curious your take on that clip we
just watched in terms of what you saw

535
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:01,380
there from your [inaudible].

536
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,560
Well, there's a few things.
There's one clip that was in the,

537
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:09,420
a little bit of it in the trailer where
Kiki talks about kind of the five phases

538
00:36:09,421 --> 00:36:14,130
of being a woman. And uh, the
second phase is boobs, teens.

539
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,710
And she talks about that's
when you have your most power.

540
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:20,100
But I'm in the fourth phase and I
have to be, you know, just a mother.

541
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:25,101
And then there's the other scene where
you first see Kiki and you completely see

542
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:28,380
her, you know, sexually objectified. And,

543
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:32,970
and so when I think about that and I think
about some of our new data, you know,

544
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:37,971
female characters are six
times more likely to be
hypersexualized and five times

545
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:43,410
more likely to be verbally objectified.
And I thought,

546
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,510
you know,
and maybe you can just talk about it,

547
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:50,160
but there's scenes in the movie that do
it with such great humor, um, and kind of,

548
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:54,680
you know, point, fun added. But truly
that's what we're seeing, you know,

549
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,170
in our, in all of our,
you know, family films.

550
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,730
So I don't know if you want to,

551
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:04,610
yeah,
it definitely was taking a ribbing at it.

552
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:08,890
Um, and that, that five phases,
I'm obsessed with that five phases.

553
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:13,160
You have to watch them. One of the
most brilliant things I've ever read,

554
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:17,090
or an Anna camp does a genius job of it.
And she,

555
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:21,260
I love that character so
much because she really,

556
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,620
she's kind of doing it to herself.
Like she,

557
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,200
her choices as a human being,

558
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:32,530
the characters traces as a human being
are so fascinating and the patterns she's

559
00:37:33,741 --> 00:37:37,400
going into and without,
you know, ruining too much.

560
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:41,030
But she's in a relationship
with a married man and, um,

561
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:47,090
these, these patterns that we fall
into and her choice of what she wears,

562
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:51,860
you know, which is written into, into
the script. And we just followed that,

563
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,830
that lead that in a,

564
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:59,950
in a way she is choosing
this s stereotype,

565
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,370
um, and this, um,

566
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,840
paradigm of what a woman is.

567
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:14,270
And it's the diametric opposite to what
Tina is because Tina's really interested

568
00:38:14,271 --> 00:38:16,820
in sort of breaking all those stereotypes.

569
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:22,190
And then Wayne's in between trying
to sort of navigate these two women,

570
00:38:22,191 --> 00:38:26,570
which is, that makes it all, and
that's a very complex part of it too,

571
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,770
because each character. Dot.
David said earlier about Don,

572
00:38:30,771 --> 00:38:35,230
like we all know that guy eats character.
We all know that character, right?

573
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:35,980
There's someone in our

574
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,270
lives where there was a time in our
lives where we felt like we subscribed to

575
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,810
very similar paradigms.
So I definitely feel like there's that,

576
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:48,070
that sense of, um, identification
that you can have through,

577
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,980
through each of those characters.

578
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:55,180
There's also every dinner party, we've
all ever been to gone wrong. And,

579
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,350
and usually,
I mean,

580
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:59,080
I think we've all been to those dinner
parties where someone says something a

581
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:03,340
little bit off and most eyes just kind
of go to the plate or someone gets an

582
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,040
elbow under the table or a kick
and that's, and that's it. Right?

583
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:08,910
And then you just rip it apart
on the way home. Right, right.

584
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,470
Like on the subway ride home. I
can't believe she said that. I want,

585
00:39:11,471 --> 00:39:13,480
I know what's her problem was she
had a ride to work a day in her life.

586
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:17,290
So she's apoe and he's probably
right. And we all do that. And so,

587
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:20,800
but we do it there. Yeah, we
don't do it in the ride home.
We, we do it there. Right.

588
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:24,460
It's like we're at the table and someone
says, why would you say that to me?

589
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,323
The other person says,
well,

590
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,640
because I think your acts and the
person says you don't know me. I'm not.

591
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,090
Why would you say that? Like this is an
idea of how we want to live our lives on.

592
00:39:31,091 --> 00:39:33,340
The person says, well, I don't
agree with that. So it's,

593
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,940
it's we get to live out that dinner
party fantasy that we've all had of like,

594
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,430
yeah, wouldn't it be great if
you could just tell him like,

595
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:43,960
nobody likes to hear you talk about x,
Y, z. We don't give a shit and you know,

596
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,470
you don't seem to care
about people and what,

597
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,740
like it's that dinner party
thing that I think, uh, you know,

598
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,570
that we've all wanted
to talk about and uh,

599
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,330
with subjects that we've all wanted to
talk about but are a little bit afraid to,

600
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:59,710
like Alicia said earlier, are very afraid
to. Um, and I think that's part of,

601
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,540
I hope that's part of
what happens in the film.

602
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:04,700
We've been hearing from a lot of people
that have seen it, that, you know, they,

603
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:07,960
they have questions, they want to
talk. Why did we do it this way?

604
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:10,600
Why do we do it that, you know, and that's
great. That's what we want. It's not a,

605
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:13,210
you know, you don't watch it and
be like, yeah, pretty little bow.

606
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:18,580
It's not one of those paintings.
And a lot of people have said that.

607
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:22,740
I went back and watched it a bunch of
times and every time it's different. Nice.

608
00:40:22,741 --> 00:40:26,640
See different things in.
That's really exciting and rewarding.

609
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,260
Well, there's a moment, there's a moment,

610
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:32,430
there's a scene where as David's
describing, it's uncomfortable.

611
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:33,270
It's almost like,

612
00:40:33,271 --> 00:40:36,300
I think this way sometimes when you
watch Ben Stiller's comedies like you,

613
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,850
you're like, no, don't, don't,
don't do that. You know,

614
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,200
it's uncomfortable to watch because it
puts you in that position where you feel

615
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:46,440
that vulnerability of sharing something
that you normally would just keep to

616
00:40:46,441 --> 00:40:49,130
yourself or share with your
partner in the way home. Um,

617
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:54,090
but there's one scene where there's
a question that comes out and David,

618
00:40:54,091 --> 00:40:56,410
your character, dawn, just goes,
well, that's a little personal and

619
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,110
we're talking about the most personnel
things ever. But there's that,

620
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,820
that dry humor to it.

621
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,260
It was a question about money.
Oh, right, right, right.

622
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,050
Does your boyfriend pay your rent?

623
00:41:07,051 --> 00:41:09,120
Like why do you have to move out
of your apartment? Oh, right.

624
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,130
We've just talked about her uterus
or life or relationship or, yeah.

625
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,740
Or identity as a woman. And then I say,
someone says, well, why do you have to,

626
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,490
to the apartment? And I said, well that's
a little personal. We all just get along.

627
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:19,910
Again,

628
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,550
that unfolds.
A whole other thing is a whole other,

629
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,370
thinking back to your
last project with equity,

630
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:29,870
well not one on one of your past projects
with equity is just the comfort around

631
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,850
women and money and certainly women
and money as portrayed in media. Um,

632
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,760
and we, we talked a little
bit about, uh, you know,

633
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:41,960
breadwinning women and primary earning
women who are 42% of our nation.

634
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,180
Um,
and you know,

635
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:47,480
we're not seeing that
showcased on screen anywhere.

636
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:51,610
We're not seeing that pride and we're
not seeing that kind of expert. Yes,

637
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,680
I love it. Yeah. So that's
a great segue. What's,

638
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:56,900
what's up next for you guys
that you're able to share?

639
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:00,280
Is there a pardon your next
project for me. That's great.

640
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,960
No,
there were no men in it.

641
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:08,120
Right now I'm shooting the Deuce,
which is so much fun. Oh my God.

642
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:12,770
Where it last season was
season two. We, we shot in the,

643
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:15,260
it was the seventies
and now in season three,

644
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:17,860
it's the 80s in New York and items,

645
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,700
the writing is so genius and
I'm so, so, so enjoying it and,

646
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,790
um, better things, which I'm also on,

647
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:28,880
just started airing like two weeks ago,
I think this week.

648
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,880
Sharon Stone is our guest star
wars. Oh, that's terrific.

649
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,350
A gorgeous scene with her. She
was such a joy to work with. Um,

650
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,570
and um,

651
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,960
just to keep things even I'm going across.

652
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:44,830
Um,

653
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:49,830
and we just wrapped season seven of
orange and they never tell us when that's

654
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:55,070
going to be out. But my guess is some are,
but don't quote me. That could be a lie.

655
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:59,690
And this is the F is this the final,
final season? That's for sure.

656
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,980
That's for sure. And um, I've definitely
been mourning that a little bit,

657
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,600
but how does that feel? That's a, uh,
that's a light hurts. You know, it,

658
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:12,110
I'll miss the character because
she was so extraordinary.

659
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:16,940
And this season is quite epic in its,

660
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,913
um,

661
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,640
social commentary on what's going
on in the world right now. Um,

662
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,450
I'm really proud to be part of
this season for that map, for that,

663
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,770
for that reason. Um, and,

664
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,130
but more than anything, I'll miss the
people because there are some mixed,

665
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:40,190
spectacular humans both behind and in
front of the camera who made that all

666
00:43:40,641 --> 00:43:44,840
happen. And I will love them
forever and I'll see them forever,

667
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:49,270
but I won't see them as much. Yeah.
Not behind bars. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

668
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,290
Hopefully not. I mean, we never
know. Who knows. She still

669
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:56,190
curious. Yeah. David,
what's up next for you?

670
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,280
Uh, if Alicia hires me and our next
project, then I'll tell you what that is.

671
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:04,920
We get there. I just did a show
on CBS called instinct. Okay. Fun.

672
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,490
And uh, yeah, trying to get a job
and, and being a hands on dad,

673
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:13,450
that's the most important job I'm very
proud of. And Alicia is a hands on mom,

674
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,340
but she's been a lot busier
than I have, especially since
it came out. Yeah. So, uh,

675
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:22,000
yeah, I'm doing the laundry and
the dishes and being a dad and,

676
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:23,920
and your building tree forts.

677
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:27,400
Yeah, we did. We did build a tree house to
were power tools involved. So yeah. Yeah.

678
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,040
You Bet. More stereotypic. Yeah.
But yeah. Big shoes to fill. Yeah.

679
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,980
I don't want to let, what is your
season look like coming up with?

680
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,410
We've, uh, we have a
really rich research year.

681
00:44:38,411 --> 00:44:43,411
We're just about to published the next
iteration of what we call the Gdiq,

682
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:47,260
which was generously funded by google.org.

683
00:44:47,261 --> 00:44:51,550
It stands for the Gina Davis Inclusion
quotient and it's a machine learning tool

684
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:56,730
that automates gender screen and speaking
time and actually race for screen time

685
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:01,480
using audio and facial
recognition. So, um, we have,

686
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:06,250
we're really rich partnership with Google,
so we're really grateful for that.

687
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,180
And this year we're releasing not
only film, which we have done,

688
00:45:10,181 --> 00:45:14,260
but also TV. Uh, so that's been
really important for us to, uh,

689
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:19,240
to evolve the Gdi Queue.
So that's coming out soon for us.

690
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,470
And then as I mentioned,
we're partnering, uh,

691
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:26,650
with Pomono on a masculinity study.
We're also partnering,

692
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,460
partnering with Plan International on
a study about girl's relationship to

693
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:31,294
leadership.

694
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:35,770
So we have a lot of really interesting
research projects coming out.

695
00:45:35,771 --> 00:45:39,070
And then we also are commissioned
to do a lot of research.

696
00:45:39,071 --> 00:45:43,840
So we've done a lot of research
for leading brands, uh,

697
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:46,900
content creators, studios.
So behind the scenes,

698
00:45:46,901 --> 00:45:50,890
a lot of people want to know how they're
doing and so will also conduct a lot of

699
00:45:50,891 --> 00:45:51,850
research that way.

700
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,260
So important.
I'm so glad to hear it.

701
00:45:54,261 --> 00:45:58,820
We are a data driven company here at
Google and I think the more you have data

702
00:45:58,821 --> 00:46:02,450
telling a story, while it may not
be the story we all want to hear,

703
00:46:02,451 --> 00:46:06,080
it's telling a certain story and only
then can you start to see action and start

704
00:46:06,081 --> 00:46:08,780
to measure the progress. What's very,
very important work that you're doing.

705
00:46:08,781 --> 00:46:13,520
I'm thrilled that we're finding ways to
partner together on that initiative. Um,

706
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:14,170
so

707
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:19,170
egg is available on Amazon
and iTunes and video on demand

708
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,080
coming up on Hulu as of March 31st on Hulu

709
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:28,280
31st it's a great mother's
or father's Day gift. Yeah,

710
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:32,060
exactly. We actually flipped mother's
and father's Day in my house,

711
00:46:32,061 --> 00:46:35,790
so I get father's Day, my
thigh, you say. And for anyone

712
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:38,810
who's watching the global channel,
aren't you coming out internationally?

713
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,060
Yes, yes, yes. March
31st we open in theaters,

714
00:46:43,061 --> 00:46:46,990
which is mother's Day, or
you can, Yup. Australia.

715
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:50,380
It's actually called something else there.
It's called motherhood.

716
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,380
I wasn't sure if you were
going to share that yet

717
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,640
for our UK, uh, subscribers and
counterparts, make sure that you,

718
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,140
he polyols other hood.
And if you follow at Alicia Reiner,

719
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,530

about it. Always. Yep.

720
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,980
Dates. Yeah. Yes. And for
the Gina Davis Institute,

721
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,490
anybody that wants to learn more,

722
00:47:09,491 --> 00:47:12,010
there's some great
infographics throughout there.

723
00:47:12,011 --> 00:47:16,390
I don't just think some of the
data just really makes you mindful.

724

Um, and that can be found
