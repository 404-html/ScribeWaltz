1
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,040
Good Morning Ladies and gentlemen.
It's an honor to be here.

2
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:13,030
Thank you for having
[inaudible] Hong Kong. Um, yeah,

3
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:16,870
I hope today through this session,
both parties can have a blast.

4
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:20,470
And then at anytime if you feel that
you want to voice out or ask questions,

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,410
please feel free. Okay. So, um,

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,010
when I first got the invitation
to come to Google Hong Kong,

7
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:30,250
I was thinking to myself, what the hell
am I going to do at Google? Seriously?

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,123
Cause

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,760
you guys are the people I go to when
I look at my stuff seriously. Um,

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,050
it could be through the search engine,
it could be through, um, through maps.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,400
I like to travel a lot.

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,240
I just want to unpack pack and not just
a wander off somewhere into the world

13
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:49,060
and, and, and see the world.
So I'm always, you know,

14
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:53,950
navigating to maps and a lately
actually speaking of which, uh,

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,980
I've been trying to pick
up on Maura Japanese. So

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,910
I do this a lot now.
Everyday. Hey City Sun

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,630
[inaudible]

18
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,173
Stella.

19
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,960
I've been trying to pick
up on more Japanese.

20
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:18,470
So lately I've made a Google
translate my best friend.

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,100
Right.
So have you been for forcing

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,670
my, my smart phone to converse in
Japanese with me? Cause you know,

23
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:31,810
we only have 24 hours a day, so yeah. But,

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,370
but I must say,
yeah,

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,330
sometimes the translations
I still a bit funky,

26
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:41,890
but 80% of the time it
does the job very well.

27
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:45,520
So thank you for whoever out there that's,
that's making my life a lot,

28
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,460
a lot easier. All right. So yes,

29
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:52,550
I do visit you guys very,
very often every day. Um,

30
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,000
but I'm not here to talk about,
you know, what we can Google.

31
00:01:55,001 --> 00:02:00,001
I think you guys out of everybody knows
best what we can search on the Internet.

32
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,420
But,
uh,

33
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,920
maybe today we could touch on some
other keywords where we cannot fully

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,900
understand through the Internet. Maybe
keywords like, um, like creativity.

35
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,840
I think, um, I think creativity for
me, it's, it's, it's the biggest thing.

36
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,330
Um, either it be through my music or
my food shows or movies or my business.

37
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,780
Because I think without creativity we
cannot really ensure our place in the

38
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:33,310
market, in the market, and eventually
you will be left behind in the world.

39
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,773
Um,

40
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,490
creativity comes in many
different forms and styles.

41
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:43,840
I guess it doesn't have to
be through through movies
or or that kind of artistry.

42
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,000
It could be through through
tennis, it could be through
agriculture, architecture,

43
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:52,090
woodworking or electron,
whatever it is. It may be.

44
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,580
It could be through
programming or engineering.

45
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:59,470
I think if Google was not
as creative when were,

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,250
you know, doing the algorithm this back
then, it would not be what it is today.

47
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,480
So a lot of people would say,
you know, yeah, I'm not the,

48
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,670
I'm not the creative type now we all are.
We just have to find that one edge.

49
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,190
We have to find, you know, what, how we
can synergize and capitalize on that,

50
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,630
on our own strength.

51
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,360
But it is getting harder and harder to
be creative I think in this world because

52
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,830
everyday we are,

53
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,810
we are flooded by so much
content in our phones. You know,

54
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,470
all the blogs that we look at,
all the comments, all the lights,

55
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:38,470
all the streamings, all
the films, everything.

56
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,680
But unknowingly,

57
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,770
unknowingly we are so almost two
inspired to a point where we are losing

58
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:55,501
ourselves because we are taking
it in everybody else's ideas,

59
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,000
their thoughts, their voices. Therefore,
if we are not creative enough,

60
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,570
we tend to what we call,
uh,

61
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,320
we would ride on other people's
ideas. Let's twist. That's tweak.

62
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,110
That's a in golden while
we would say [inaudible].

63
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,720
But when we get into a habit of that,

64
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,910
we forget about being original,
being really creative,

65
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,830
starting our own ideas.
And to me that is very,

66
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:31,831
very dangerous because if what you put
up is no different than the person next

67
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:33,964
to you,

68
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,350
if what you contribute to the company is
just the same as everybody else in the

69
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:41,230
room, let me tell you something.
Next year, you won't be here.

70
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,430
The company doesn't need you.
Eventually.

71
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,580
The market doesn't need you and the world.

72
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,943
They don't need you.

73
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,550
So constantly ask yourself how you can
contribute more than the person next to

74
00:04:58,961 --> 00:04:59,794
you.

75
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,020
I've been in my industry for more than
22 years now and they can tell you,

76
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,600
I asked myself that
question every damn day,

77
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,180
every day for music, through
film, through my shows,

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,070
through my business. How
do I be more creative?

79
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,350
That is very,
very hard.

80
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,340
And maybe even in some fields
it's getting harder and harder.

81
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:29,341
Like in music I would say that it is
harder for me now to compose a very good

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
piece of music then it was 1520 years
ago because the time signatures or the

83
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,860
combinations of the notes are
simply being taken, taken up.

84
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,690
It is harder to write something original
in the now and have it not sound like

85
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:47,080
that.

86
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,080
It has been written by someone sometime
like some song back then because it,

87
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,130
it's,
it's been done.

88
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,850
But in our world that's what is happening
is because all of the ideas are being

89
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:01,670
voiced out and we are seeing it.

90
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,650
So if we don't voice out loud
enough, clear enough, soon enough,

91
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,030
we are actually behind.
So I urge you there,

92
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:14,270
you know at the first keyword that
I would want to touch on is actually

93
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,820
creativity. Does anybody
have any, anything to say?

94
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,800
Any other things that you
want to talk about? Uh,

95
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,850
another word I would say is a
key keyword for me is experience,

96
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:28,900
especially well experience in terms of,
um,

97
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,650
the verb experience,
not the noun experience,

98
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,180
especially for you lot where your work
requires you to sit behind a desk and a

99
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:42,460
computer the whole day,
maybe the whole year. Um,

100
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,100
but I would say that it is very important
too to get out there to the world and

101
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:55,361
really experience it because I think the
phone still only brings you halfway and

102
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:00,170
you must walk the other half.
You know,

103
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:03,710
nowadays when I'm chatting with a
lot of the younger generation kids,

104
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,510
what really happens a lot is a, and maybe
the topic would be along the line of,

105
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,330
uh, Oh man, I was in, um, I was,

106
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,730
I was in Finland last weekend. The Aurora
lights was there, they're beautiful.

107
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,540
And then the kid would say something
like, yeah, I know, I know.

108
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:25,450
I saw it on Youtube. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. I thought that was really cool.

109
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:30,250
I saw it on Facebook.
Yeah. Okay. I'm sure.

110
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,720
I'm sure it's an opening. It's an idea.
It's a glimpse of what it really is.

111
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,630
But if that's how you see
things you don't know.

112
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,060
Yeah. Again, it's a great entrance
to the world, but it's halfway.

113
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,523
Please,

114
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,760
when the opportunity allows get off
your butt and walk the other half,

115
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,440
which may be even more important.
Okay. Experience the world.

116
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,370
Okay. The phone is awesome. You know
the net is awesome, but that is,

117
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,900
that is halfway halfway.
Is it too early for you guys?

118
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:09,070
Cause you guys look kind of stale.

119
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,120
Okay.

120
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,810
The James Bond movie. We could start with
a more, more Q and. A if anybody wants,

121
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,680
please jump in

122
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,840
and thinks that that is on our minds
is also giving back. Right, right.

123
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:24,360
What about creativity?
It's about experience.

124
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:29,220
A lot of that is because we're sort of
going through life to a screen and we're

125
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:32,460
not interacting much.
I'm here at Google. Uh,

126
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,100
we spent a lot of time thinking
about what we're doing for Hong Kong,

127
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,320
how we're supporting nonprofits, how worry
providing services for schools, train,

128
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,460
break breakdown.
What advice do you have for us?

129
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:49,190
And also for the broader millennial
crowd who was interested in,

130
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:52,040
in doing something for Hong Kong.
How'd it get started? How to,

131
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,200
how to think about that and what
approach to take. Thank you.

132
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,740
Thank you. I think, uh, I think keep doing
what you're doing really, but, uh, we, we,

133
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,430
we cannot lose the, what we're trying
to do is, is share, I think this, uh,

134
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,650
this in this era and of course
sharing comes in different forms also.

135
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,420
And that's what chef nick the brand is
trying to do is because I think even now

136
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,900
when you see a family's going up, got
the other dinners, they're actually just,

137
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:21,730
you know, they're, they're eating
through looking through there.

138
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,090
They're looking through
their phones the whole time.

139
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,560
Actually that's losing the true
essence of why we are eating together.

140
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,800
And that's what we're trying to
promote through the chef nick show is,

141
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,910
is the guy who gets [inaudible] fine.
Yeah. What is [inaudible] fun is to,

142
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,020
is to actually enjoy a meal together.

143
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,330
And that's why that's what cooking is,
has also taught me is, let me tell you,

144
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:46,320
I was in really,

145
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:51,321
really bad terminus with my parents
for the longest time I was in.

146
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,660
I was in boarding school ever since I
was 12 and then at the age of 14 I was

147
00:09:56,941 --> 00:10:01,140
sent to Tokyo to, to, to
start training in, in music.

148
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,280
By 16 I started working and I
never really got a chance to,

149
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,760
to have a relationship with my parents
and we have been on bad terms for the

150
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:16,590
longest time until, until I started
cooking because when you cook,

151
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:20,640
it's the food. You don't eat
it alone, you want to share it,

152
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,700
you want to get some feedbacks and it
gave me a medium to to know how to talk to

153
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:31,080
my parents and say great
load of Lou Hall or

154
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,050
in the East and Gogo,

155
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,740
whatever you cook back then was really
cool and you want to teach me. It became,

156
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:41,790
now it's now it's a habit. You know,
does a food matter? Of course it does,

157
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,330
but what really matters
is how you find your,

158
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,300
your way to share.

159
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,940
And I think keep doing what you're doing.

160
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,600
But if you can think of the third party,

161
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,220
then I think that the whole
picture is much bigger.

162
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,990
Cool. Why don't you take a seat. Okay.
We'll chat a little bit. Get comfortable.

163
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,510
Um, it was very inspiring. Talk,
hearing you talk about creativity and,

164
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,120
and the journey where you just mentioned
how cooking brought you and your family

165
00:11:16,121 --> 00:11:20,500
closer together. Okay. Um, so
a little bit on chef nick. Um,

166
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,180
it's now in its fifth season.

167
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,030
We're seeing a lot of traction
both online and offline,

168
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,250
but I want to kind of go turn
back the clock back to 2014 what,

169
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,310
besides what you just mentioned
about the parents thing,

170
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,370
but what was the thing that made
you transition from the singer,

171
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:43,270
the accurate setting a phone to, to chef
nick. And what was that transition like?

172
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,250
I didn't think I,
um,

173
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,250
I wasn't looking forward
transition really.

174
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,320
I thought I could do everything together.
I'm,

175
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,220
I'm still doing music. I'm
still doing films. It's, it's,

176
00:11:57,221 --> 00:12:01,060
it's weird because people look at this
like it, like, like I'm moving from, um,

177
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,980
from woodworking to pharmacy.

178
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,900
It's not that far. I think what
I'm doing with food, with movies,

179
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:15,160
and also music and the business together,
I think as a whole,

180
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:16,450
it has perfect synergy.

181
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,470
I don't think that they're really
unrelated and that's how I do things.

182
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:25,471
If I cannot pull resources from somewhere
somehow to contribute into a new thing

183
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:27,634
I do,

184
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,080
then I really would reconsider
to either do it or not,

185
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,030
because to start fresh at, uh,
you know, at, at, at a later age,

186
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,350
later age is maybe at a disadvantage.
Um,

187
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,640
but first of all, I, I've found
food to be a true passion.

188
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,890
And then I also saw that it
would be the next biggest thing,

189
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,180
uh, after communication and, and tech. Um,

190
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,260
so I thought how I could, you
know, kind of rejuvenate the whole,

191
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,530
the whole entertainment business
of mine and make it a yeah.

192
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,040
And make it a long lasting one, I
guess. Was this interest in food?

193
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,820
Something that was always there,
that was always there, but, uh, I,

194
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,090
I thought to make it a bit more
bit more serious. And at the time,

195
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:19,970
I think mainland China was actually,
it was really lacking, uh, uh,

196
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,860
a decent food or lifestyle
show. Okay. Yeah.

197
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,900
So we started, uh, two Oh
14, right? Yeah. And um,

198
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:29,950
and it's,

199
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:34,720
we just finished the fifth season
this year that I've been watching.

200
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,790
Uh, thank you. Um, so on the food topic,

201
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,820
I'm sure you hear this a lot and then
even people who know me doing this have

202
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:49,300
asked this as well as that you've
never worked in the kitchen. You can,

203
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:50,140
you really cook.

204
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:54,970
Like obviously I heard stories and I
know that you put a lot of hard work and

205
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:56,590
dedication,
courage into,

206
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:00,250
into being who you are today
in achieving what you've done.

207
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,870
But not everybody has seen that.

208
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:06,670
So what goes through your mind when you
hear criticism like this and how do you

209
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:10,930
deal with is logically acceptable?
Because first of all,

210
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:15,280
we may think that because someone has
not been doing something for really long,

211
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,290
they can't be good at it.
Right? That's the logic.

212
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:26,140
It's okay. It's okay. But that's almost
like saying, let, let me put it this way,

213
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,380
that's almost like saying
we as a human race,

214
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:32,050
we've been using the landline
telephone for centuries.

215
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,920
Why don't we stick with it? That must be
the best way. So dump all your iPhones,

216
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,960
dump all your mobiles right now let's go
back to the landline because we've been

217
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:43,240
doing that for the longest time,
right?

218
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,410
That's like saying we as a human
race, we have been using the, uh,

219
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,160
we've been driving gasoline
automobiles for centuries.

220
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,320
So has Elon Musk on crazy
to start the hustler,

221
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,010
right? Why? Why are there so many
electronic cars out there now?

222
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,370
Because that must be the best way because
we've been doing it for the longest

223
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:08,570
time.
I think we are that narrow minded.

224
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,890
That really frightens me
because we are in a new era.

225
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,150
There are,

226
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,710
there are perks and different texts now
out there that allows us to pick up on

227
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:23,711
information much more rapidly than
it has been in a traditional kitchen.

228
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,020
I would say. Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.
But the way I've heard is, you know,

229
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:32,021
maybe the first apprentice cook with
would would be be peeling vegetables for

230
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:35,420
maybe a year or two.
But I have,

231
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,910
I have my ways or I am,

232
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,800
I have saved up enough money to be peeling
something much more in the first year.

233
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,910
Yeah. I mean like we hear
all these stories about like
chefs training in Japan,

234
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,530
like washing rice for like seven
years before they can play Sushi.

235
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,770
So is that the best and only way?
I don't think we have,

236
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,090
we can be that narrow minded in
thinking like that. Right, okay.

237
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,220
Of course there has been a lot of hard
work and time and effort put into it,

238
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:09,610
but yeah, I don't have
to get into those. Yeah.

239
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,130
But how do you stay focused
on doing what you need to do?

240
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,450
Do you have like a system,
do you have a way to do things or,

241
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,130
um, cause obviously it's a lot
of work. It's a lot of work.

242
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:24,890
There's a lot of learning involved.
Like do you, how do you stay organized?

243
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:28,820
How do you stay focused? That's
one thing I learned in the, in the,

244
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,470
in the kitchen is time management.

245
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,150
Because when you're just trying to
serve two dishes, it's easy for too,

246
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:37,940
it's easy for, for, it's okay
for eight years, not bad.

247
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,720
But when you're trying to do
eight dishes for a table of 10

248
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,260
and they have all the, they all have
to be hot. When you serve and liking,

249
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,570
you know, Chinese food,
it's not that easy.

250
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,620
And when you do one of the more
than one of my Michelin guidelines,

251
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,220
when you're searching for a 700,

252
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,460
they still have to be hot and you've got
eight minutes of serving time for a 700

253
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,050
fine dining. It's very
hard. But then you learn,

254
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,790
you know, gradually, eventually you
learn how to, how to, um, how to time.

255
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:14,210
You have to pace ourselves and
then your, your, your organization.

256
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:20,280
Like what I just demonstrated the, on
the, on, on, on, on my phone. You know,

257
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:25,330
I tried to squeeze in all these little
seconds and milliseconds in my life to,

258
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,510
to,
to gain that just that much more.

259
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:35,120
But I guess when there's a will,
there's a way, I don't know,

260
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,700
you're a time schedules,
but you figured that out for herself.

261
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,130
But there are these little gaps in life
where you can just squeeze in a bit more,

262
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,993
you know,

263
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,380
here and their knowledge and
then eventually that adds up.

264
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,370
That adds up.
Yeah.

265
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:50,821
Yeah.

266
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:54,240
I think it's amazing how you're able to
balance so many things and do everything

267
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,880
so well. And I'm a very
naturally, I'm up very

268
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,730
Bhagwat person. I'm a very,
I, I'm very curious about
everything, you know? I mean,

269
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:08,260
I, I look up stuff just to, just to
know, just to ask why, where, when,

270
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:11,410
how so and when I start something,

271
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,870
I don't like to stop until I actually
get somewhere, you know? That's the,

272
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,560
that's just the personality.
I've heard many stories as well.

273
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,220
Oh really?

274
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,043
How,

275
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,550
how kind of focus you are and how deep
down you drill in to everything that you

276
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:32,400
try to learn. And I think that's
something that's very admirable.

277
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,370
I can be a pain in the ass
in that aspect. Yeah. Um,

278
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,770
but like, like I said,
you're a man of many hats.

279
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,560
You're developing a
chef career on the side,

280
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,630
you're have music, you have
acting all that together. Um,

281
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,010
kind of bringing the conversation
back to where it started with music.

282
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:58,140
You're last Cantonese album was in 2005.
Really?

283
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:00,840
One second

284
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,340
closer. Yeah. Right.

285
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,720
And then your last mandarin album
was 10 years ago was 2009. Oh.

286
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,763
So

287
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,380
I know that, I know you haven't stopped
doing music, so you've done movies, songs,

288
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:18,090
he's written songs for your, for your
show. And over the past 12 months,

289
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,900
personally I've seen you kind
of do a little bit more, um,

290
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:26,010
started with a 2018 six hat,
that performance,

291
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,640
he launched three singles this year.
Uh,

292
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,670
and you were a guest judge on the voice.
Um,

293
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,480
and now just recently you
had the Rth k performance.

294
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,030
So there's this foreshadowing something.

295
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:42,720
Are we going to see more
music coming from you

296
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,870
really planned this? I think I'm just
going with the flow really sometimes,

297
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,180
but I think at different
times with different um,

298
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,400
inspirations or,
or sometimes I,

299
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,460
I feel that there are different
advantages for different fields.

300
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,640
You know how sometimes the
stock market, you know, it's,

301
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:07,440
it's doing better than the real estate.

302
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,910
Sometimes like music is doing better
than film and that's how I can kind of

303
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:16,911
weasel around and do my thing because
there's never one trend that's always at

304
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:17,964
the top.

305
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:19,560
Yeah,

306
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,380
that's actually true.
If you really look at the market,

307
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,720
something is always doing a bit better.

308
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,330
And if the trend is like that and
you can kind of catch the wave

309
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,090
man, you're on top because
like when we started the,

310
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,200
the chef nick show,
we are definitely the,

311
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,330
the biggest food show in China.

312
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,120
When we started in tool 14 by,

313
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:50,420
by the third season we were doing over
300 million RMB and now we're in the

314
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:56,250
third season. But if you
catch the wave, that's that,

315
00:20:56,251 --> 00:21:01,040
that's a different thing.
That's a different thing. So
I think, you know, we, we are,

316
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,730
we're doing various stable in,
in chef nick.

317
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:09,690
So I think now I have the time to
kind of do more music to more music.

318
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,380
So does that mean we'll see
the album an album this year?

319
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,320
I don't know if I'm working
on a full album, but, um,

320
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,280
but I don't really think if that
really matters anymore in the,

321
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,040
in the new market. Right.
But, uh, yeah, I'm,

322
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,900
I'm hoping for, I'm actually
working on a concert, but there's,

323
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,360
I'm going to ask. And in Hong
Kong everybody is, do you know,

324
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,820
starting a concert as a,
they have nothing else to do

325
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:44,220
and still hard to buy tickets. So we need
a bigger stadium. That's what we need.

326
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,840
Yeah. Yeah. We need a bigger
platform. You see more creativity.

327
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,200
I can book my, My, My,

328
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:54,270
my stadium schedule cause I've
been dissing it the whole time.

329
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,340
Well, time to get creative and think
about something different. Right. Um,

330
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,040
back on the topic of jungle hosing,
I'm the voice.

331
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,650
A lot of people have
said that this season,

332
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:13,150
it was a lot better than previous
seasons, I think. So, um,

333
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:19,040
personally I think you being on it
injected kind of a different dynamic.

334
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:23,610
It was, um, it was
interesting to see how you,

335
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,180
how seriously you took
it. Um, again, stories,

336
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,580
I heard a story that maybe I want
you to share with everyone about the,

337
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,680
the drumming performance. So actually
I heard from Derek, all right, uh,

338
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,370
how hard you prepared for it and how,
how you kept on like

339
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:46,210
preparation for, for, for, for the,
uh, performance is a, is a, is a given.

340
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,340
But actually when you
talk about the voice,

341
00:22:48,341 --> 00:22:50,080
what I would actually want to share is,

342
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:53,500
I don't know how many people has to wash
the, uh, the, the, the, the, the show.

343
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,700
But you know how I got totally
bashed when I started, you know,

344
00:22:57,701 --> 00:22:59,150
hammering the onto the,
uh,

345
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:04,210
the button at first and the first two
episodes because there are actually these

346
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:09,130
two new perks they change to with
a game play this year that, uh,

347
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,110
to start off with, um, all
of the contested, there
are about 150 contestants,

348
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:14,380
you know,

349
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,380
put into one room and they are watching
a live feed of whatever is happening on

350
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:23,260
stage. That performance along
with the judge's comments and,

351
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,170
and how they would choose their team.
That's one thing.

352
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:31,260
The second thing is each judge would
have a six person quota, uh, to,

353
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,510
to, to, to choose into, you
know, assembling their team.

354
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,380
And if you do choose a seventh person,

355
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,310
that person would have to battle
out any of their chosen, you know,

356
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,170
the person from the, the,
the, the original team.

357
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,660
So thinking like that,

358
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,230
there are a few things
I tried doing is um,

359
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:56,620
the first episode if people who has seen
this seen the show would see me just

360
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:57,720
hearing the,
the,

361
00:23:57,721 --> 00:24:02,690
the first two sentences and then I would
be smashing on to the button. And then,

362
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:02,901
you know,

363
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:06,650
the reporter is the viewers who would
say he doesn't know Jack about music,

364
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,480
you know,
go back to cooking.

365
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,290
How could you choose some round from,

366
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,480
from just listening for
the first two words?

367
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,880
What I found out was I am very aware that
for the past 10 years, like you said,

368
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,240
my last album was maybe 10 years
ago. I'm very aware that, you know,

369
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:25,520
a lot of the younger kids,
they don't see me as a singer.

370
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,320
They don't see me as a musician.

371
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:32,590
If I were to fight for
these contestants over with,

372
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,830
you know, with the other other judges,
I would have a very big disadvantage.

373
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:42,580
The only way I could plant some ideas
into the hundred and 50 contestants that

374
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:49,271
are watching the live feed is by
hammering onto that that button and solely

375
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,720
turning around because
therefore I have the floor,

376
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:58,700
I have the power of speech because
they didn't choose the person I did.

377
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:03,890
So actually I'm trying to voice out
and tell not the person on the stage,

378
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,810
but the 150 in the room,

379
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,380
what I have done or what my views on
music is so that they would feel more

380
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:16,520
comfortable joining my
team. But then, man, I got,

381
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,850
I got totally bashed by the media, by
everybody else. Yeah, I can stop this.

382
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,960
This thought stopped this guy,
right? He's, he's crazy or whatever.

383
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,610
And the best one thing I found that was
really helping me out strategically.

384
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,130
The second thing is, um,
people are also passionate.

385
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,140
Before I would choose a lot of contestants
because I was solely pressing onto

386
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:39,304
the button,

387
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:45,420
but what I was also doing is I found out
if you had to choose a seventh member

388
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:51,320
and if your whole team was equally
matched, there were all, you know,

389
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,560
six of them were equally as good.

390
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,070
It's very hard for a newcomer to
choose who they would like to battle.

391
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,630
But if you have two that are,

392
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,050
it's crudo say this,
but if you have to,

393
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:07,990
that is obviously a bit weaker.

394
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,200
It's easier for the
newcomer to choose from.

395
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:17,080
So you can always keep on upgrading your
team, if that makes sense to anybody.

396
00:26:17,081 --> 00:26:18,760
But, but strategically, I think I've

397
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,560
done something to you in the show.
Yeah.

398
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,820
So it seems that you took a very
strategic approach on how you,

399
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,700
how you picked your team and how you yes.
But at the end,

400
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:35,680
I hope all of these elements would
bring a better show. Right? What,

401
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,570
so how long was the filming
of the entire process? It was,

402
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:42,760
the shooting days was 29 days.
Okay.

403
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,080
But the whole process with all the
rehearsal thing and all the training was

404
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:48,960
maybe three months.
So over that span,

405
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:53,290
like being on the voice and this is a
relatively new experience for you. Yeah.

406
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,270
What do you think was the biggest thing
that you learned or gained from that?

407
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,723
Um,

408
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,260
for me it was a great platform to get
back into music because it has the most

409
00:27:08,311 --> 00:27:12,480
reach right now in, in, in terms of
a variety variety shows in China. So.

410
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,050
Okay. Yeah. Are you going back?
Let's see. I Dunno. I Dunno. Uh,

411
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,500
okay. Yeah. But at some stuff like that,
like, um, kind of music shows and stuff,

412
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:26,630
ours still something you'd
like to definitely more
involved in. Definitely. Okay.

413
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,750
Um, as I talked about the
beginning of the talk,

414
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:34,680
you're the first guest we're having
here at toxic Google in Hong Kong,

415
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:39,210
so I'd be remiss not to
bring the conversation back
at the tech a little bit.

416
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:44,040
Um, I heard that you're
very heavy youtube user. Um,

417
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:48,570
so let's start from there. So, no,
no, I, you told me in the room.

418
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,390
So,
um,

419
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,560
what's your view on kind of
technology and how we interact with,

420
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,080
with platforms like Youtube
and other social media and,

421
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,440
and how do you think that plays into
today's world and even your own life and

422
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:07,230
career? Well, definitely
for, for me, it's a,

423
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:11,490
it's a very important part of my life now.
I think, uh, for, for any of us really,

424
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,180
we've just got gotten into the habit of,
you know, learning a lot. Even like my,

425
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:19,950
my kids, they're always on youtube.
Seriously. I think the tech nowadays,

426
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,440
it has really enhanced the
speed of our learning curve.

427
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,050
Uh, we are picking up, you know,

428
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,750
the goods and bads through the
three in the Internet. Like,

429
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,880
like even through food,

430
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,930
like how tech has really changed
food immensely. Do the, the,

431
00:28:37,931 --> 00:28:42,931
the past 10 years now they deliver
delivery system has allowed us to,

432
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:48,360
to, to, to choose, you know,
fresh goods from the Internet. Uh,

433
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,700
stuff like that. You're not a
very heavy user on social media,

434
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,240
not as right.
And I'm not a social media guy,

435
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:02,130
but, but, um, I, if there's a
destination I'm looking for,

436
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:04,230
then I would definitely, you
know, go, go, go on that.

437
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,440
Do you feel that social media nowadays
has kind of become something that's,

438
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:16,340
that more or less kind of consumes
people and it's become more of an a deck

439
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,880
addiction for some people and what
takes away from kind of the benefits of

440
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:21,714
technology,

441
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:26,520
but then I think it's a balance between,
you know,

442
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:31,500
for everything that we do here, if we go
too extreme, it's, it's always, you know,

443
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:34,440
kind of harmful. Okay. So we
just have to balance it up.

444
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,540
Is that why you're not on it or just don't
like it? I'm just not in the habit of,

445
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:44,560
you know, doing the that, that
maybe it's just just not me.

446
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:47,110
Right. Yeah. But it's, it's uh,

447
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:51,640
I think it's also a platform for you to
kind of share your views and sure what

448
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:55,980
you've done and, and something like that.
So, sure. Maybe something to consider. Oh,

449
00:29:55,981 --> 00:29:56,814
of course.
Of course.

450
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,080
I'm sure

451
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,800
you opened up a youtube channel and shared
your cooking tips. People every year.

452
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,820
One here would be love to subscribe.

453
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,990
That's another thing right
now that's really, you know,

454
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,700
there, there's a bit of a
language barrier, you know,

455
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,290
I mean I have a lot of clips
but they're in Mandarin. Yeah.

456
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,410
So if I do put it on Youtube, then
I would have to kind of, you know,

457
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,180
we do the exact same thing,

458
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:23,200
but one may be an English or in
Cantonese with that really pisses me off.

459
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,930
Right.
I have to do three of the same thing.

460
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:33,830
I would have to kill three fish.
Yeah.

461
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:37,250
And if you only kill one face,
people will be commenting again on saying

462
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,160
there's already a cut there.
Yeah.

463
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:50,380
Okay. Been meaning to ask you
about a show that you did, uh,

464
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,780
called celebrity chef east versus West.

465
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,620
So you faced off against
our chef David Rockwell, um,

466
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,670
and it was a five episodes in the mini
series and spoiler alert, you won.

467
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:06,170
Why did you choose to go film in English
or, uh, what was that experience like? Um,

468
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,480
well, back to the part where, you know,
a lot of people has been doubting me for,

469
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:10,780
for the cooking part.

470
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:15,150
So all you could do really
is just to go the extent to,

471
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,180
to prove yourselves. Uh, I think that in,

472
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:22,030
I've been doing that in
every field really. Um,

473
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:27,460
that's why I put myself
through competitions,
especially when you do a, um,

474
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,280
a foreign show like from,

475
00:31:29,281 --> 00:31:34,281
from Fox den is not a chef nick show that
if I can put myself through that kind

476
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,840
of platform,
then the haters will be haters.

477
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,150
But at least I've gone the extent,
you know,

478
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,700
I might even be going back
this year to do, to, to, to,

479
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:48,490
to be judging or even competing.
Um, I'm okay with competing.

480
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:54,250
But yeah, I think you just have to
find yourself to find, find ways to,

481
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:55,210
to prove yourself.

482
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,350
I have done many crazy
stuff just to prove myself,

483
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,530
but sometimes that's,
you know,

484
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,940
that's the extent you would have to do.
I've jumped off buildings,

485
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:10,660
I've jumped off the convention center
in Hong Kong to to do my move and this

486
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:15,250
story when people, people also thought
that because I'm the son of, you know,

487
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:20,310
two celebrities, maybe I don't take my
job seriously. And that's, you know,

488
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,650
that's why I've been putting myself
through all of this hardship and this pain

489
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,350
and buildings after buildings.

490
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,910
Because if that's not serious
enough for you, then then what is,

491
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,960
it may be silly to some people,
but then you go try it. Right?

492
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,100
Yeah.

493
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,090
I mean like I'm sure like in the room,
not everybody is familiar with,

494
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,220
with how you started and everything,

495
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:46,790
but definitely as someone who
grew up in that generation,

496
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,220
I was able to witness this. All
the, all the negative. Yeah.

497
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,110
It was the same generation.

498
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,020
Yeah.

499
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,820
For people who didn't,
who, who doesn't know.

500
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:04,180
The first four years of
my career was 99% booing.

501
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,550
Yeah.
I would not get any applause anywhere.

502
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,580
The minute I stepped on stage,

503
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:19,300
it was all booze and foul language
and profanities for years.

504
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,550
And it wasn't because of what you did,

505
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:26,840
it was because of your background
or you weren't sure. And uh,

506
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:31,040
it was really, really tough for four
years. Every time I walked off stage,

507
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:36,650
I would see my managers and my, my, my,
my team, they would be just, you know,

508
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,180
they would,

509
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:42,180
they would be all holding their fist and
just crying and I would be the only one

510
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,910
that could walk back to the
changing room and cool myself down.

511
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,110
But I would,

512
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,940
I would have to endure that
for every day for four years.

513
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,660
And you kept going because back
then we had so much, you know,

514
00:33:56,661 --> 00:34:00,140
when so much promotion to do all the uh,
all the uh,

515
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,880
performances back then it was work after
work cause there was no internet yet.

516
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,060
So everything was live everyday was live.

517
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,060
Every time before I walked on the stage,

518
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:18,250
I would almost get paranoid about being
booed because it got to an extent where

519
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:23,620
I could not hear one word of
the song I was saying it could,

520
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,250
it was getting that nasty.

521
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:30,770
Then somewhere in year 2000,
it turned around.

522
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,070
What was the turning point? I
don't know man. We don't know.

523
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,863
Maybe

524
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,560
be there was some new kid to pick on them

525
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:40,130
or

526
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,630
maybe they just got tired
of, you know, the, all the,

527
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,480
all the hating or maybe they saw or
maybe there was enough buildings jumped.

528
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:51,780
But, but what you mean is you didn't jump
the convention in 2000 you? No, I didn't.

529
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,160
I jumped it in a two or three, somewhere,
somewhere like that with, with, uh,

530
00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:00,050
Mr Jackie Chan. But yeah,
you know, when, when,

531
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:05,150
when there is that need, you just have to
find your way to excel. Maybe, you know,

532
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,050
there are some crazy things that
we gotta do. Thank you for that.

533
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:14,240
Any live questions? During the
first few years when things were,

534
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,650
did you ever doubt yourself?
And

535
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,540
I did. Uh, but maybe
for a very short time.

536
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,960
I never doubted myself in terms of music.

537
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,130
I never doubted myself in terms of
all the hard work I was putting in.

538
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,350
Um,
I believe in,

539
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:43,580
I think I'm a logical person and I think
anybody can accomplish anything if you

540
00:35:45,121 --> 00:35:45,990
work hard enough.

541
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,133
Yeah.

542
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,200
Really. I don't think there
was a time where I think I,

543
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,550
I could've given up.
I would just,

544
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,670
I'm the person that does not give up,
you know,

545
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,370
naturally I just have that kind of
personality. And the second thing is

546
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,650
I, I can't give up because I
had to make a living, you know,

547
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,860
a lot of people would, would, would,

548
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,880
would imagine that because I came from
a family of two actors and actresses,

549
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,870
an actress that I don't take my, uh, my,

550
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,950
my job seriously,

551
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:28,610
but I've been self sustained
ever since my debut at the age of

552
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,350
20.
I been paying my sister's education.

553
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:42,700
So, you know, that's behind the store
behind the scenes stories. But, but I,

554
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:47,250
I could not afford to give
up my, my, my job back then.

555
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,120
So I took everything more seriously
than anybody would have ever thought

556
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,110
of a question online. Um, do you think,

557
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,420
so you've been in, like I said, 50 over
50 films. I didn't know that. Yeah,

558
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,150
I look that up.
Um,

559
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,500
what's your outlook on the genre?
I've gone champion.

560
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,980
Do you think there's a future?
What do you think that future looks like?

561
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:20,320
Back to the creativity thing.
I think we are Hong Kong right now is we,

562
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,990
we are really lacking this part.

563
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,300
I think we have been geniuses
in the stock, the stock market.

564
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:32,160
We were, we are, you know,
excellent in the real estate market,

565
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:37,650
but maybe that's the last generation
that past generations to get by in this

566
00:37:37,651 --> 00:37:41,460
generation, we've got to be really
creative in, in, in our own fields.

567
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,080
Like in movies, if you're
talking about the movie industry,

568
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,500
I think we've all had our fair shares
of the Marvel DC franchises where we've

569
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:56,540
all seen our Superman's Batman, Batman's
or iron mans are a hoax. Our flashes are,

570
00:37:56,541 --> 00:38:00,780
I wonder woman's are, I can go on
and on and we have all seen them.

571
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,113
The thing is,

572
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,830
don't we have 5,000 years
of history and culture,

573
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,770
but yet we are still
shooting the monkey king,

574
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,143
right?

575
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,063
Right.

576
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:21,480
Yeah.

577
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,810
Someone's seen [inaudible] now,
right?

578
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:29,580
So I urge any of you guys out there, if
you guys ever fantasize about, you know,

579
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,060
our own superheroes,
please jot down something,

580
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,380
write a paragraph or two,

581
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,440
send them to me or to whoever you know
that you think can make something happen.

582
00:38:41,621 --> 00:38:46,420
Because we have to, if we don't, we're
going to be really, really behind really,

583
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:48,930
really far.
Sin Send in

584
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,030
your movie ideas to me.
I'll pass them along. Yeah.

585
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,100
X life question.

586
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,130
Good question. I want to ask is
can you share with us the failures,

587
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,400
one of the famous story or the moment
you dealt yourself is a good decision to

588
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:12,150
kick off these chef nick show
and then if that, uh, yes.

589
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,070
How you overcome like how you self
motivate yourself and then put back the

590
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,210
passion.
Thank you.

591
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:22,710
Thank you. Uh, failures.
Wow. Many failures. Really.

592
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,940
Um, but I think in, in in business,

593
00:39:26,941 --> 00:39:29,040
I would say one of the more
obvious ones who are, um,

594
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:34,430
I invested in a company that does
data postproduction at the age of 22,

595
00:39:35,131 --> 00:39:40,080
23. That was two oh three.
I started a post company,

596
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,780
post production company and
we would do computer graphics,

597
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:45,390
we would do color grading,
we would do editing, um,

598
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:50,000
dubbing for a lot of
commercials and films, uh,

599
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,933
stuff like that.
Right?

600
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,700
So when you're in that kind
of a hardware tech company,

601
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,940
you buy a lot of stuff.
You buy a lot of, um,

602
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:03,990
we call tell us Sienese or editors and,
and Mike's and this and that.

603
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:09,960
But back then we were at
the end of the analog trend

604
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:15,320
and all of a sudden
things changed.

605
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,750
They don't use tapes anymore.
They went from analog to digital,

606
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,210
but all my hardware,
they were a lot of a lot of money.

607
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:31,630
So all of those all of a sudden went
into the cat and that's, you know,

608
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,910
back to the well where I was just
seeing if you can't cash the trend,

609
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,490
that's a different story.
I didn't back then and I lost,

610
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:43,100
I lost a lot of money back then. You
know, I had to mortgage my mind, my,

611
00:40:43,101 --> 00:40:48,020
my house and all that, but
that was on me, you know,

612
00:40:48,021 --> 00:40:50,900
everything just changed.
So,

613
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,060
but do I still do at
that time it was hard,

614
00:40:56,061 --> 00:40:58,800
but I still believed in the,
uh, the net worth that I,

615
00:40:58,801 --> 00:41:02,900
that I had built all the connections
and the work we were doing.

616
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:07,520
And then at the end we were okay,
but there were a few years I was really,

617
00:41:07,521 --> 00:41:12,200
really tough. But as long as you have
to, you have to stick with it. I mean,

618
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:15,710
a lot of stuff I do, they, it
doesn't reflect right away.

619
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,290
Most of the stuff doesn't
reflect right away.

620
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,890
The chef next show didn't
reflect right away,

621
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,700
but eventually,
eventually like,

622
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,930
like how everybody would dump me
through my, uh, in my culinary journey.

623
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:35,060
But then last month or
two months, just, just,

624
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:35,894
just now,

625
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:40,160
I think maybe a lot of people that had
also had the chef Nick Mcdonald Burger.

626
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:44,870
It was really good. Thank
you. Thank you. At that price,

627
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,730
I think we did a great job. You know,
actually you're right after this meeting,

628
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,170
I'm going into inventing into the central
kitchen to invent the two Oh 19 one

629
00:41:54,171 --> 00:41:55,004
again.

630
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:59,600
And we sold within five
weeks just only in Hong Kong.

631
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,470
We sold over 2 million burgers and
there is only, let me remind you,

632
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:06,500
only 6.7 million population in Hong Kong.

633
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,310
So things like a five.

634
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:14,030
Thank you.
Thank you.

635
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:17,100
But then yes, it took
five years to, you know,

636
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:21,300
to kind of prove yourself just you had
really have to stick with it on the,

637
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:25,840
just a quick question also online on the
Mcdonald's collaborations, right. Um,

638
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,590
throughout the whole process,
how many burgers did you have to eat?

639
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,713
Man,

640
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:36,510
lot of burgers and there were there,
there are w w w I a lot of burgers.

641
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:41,220
We also tested a lot of fries, a lot
of the ice cream, a lot of drinks.

642
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,540
And Yeah, there were a lot of
other crazy stuff that we tested.

643
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,170
Was that creative process like working to,

644
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,050
to create a new menu item or to do
something that's never been done before?

645
00:42:52,051 --> 00:42:54,900
Like the pork chop. Right. I was so good.

646
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,900
I'm so good.
It's best part of being creative.

647
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,110
I think. Uh, that's something that I,

648
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,930
I really enjoy is creating menus or
writing songs and making something my own.

649
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:14,160
And, and when they gave
me the, uh, the, the,

650
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:19,770
the homework to, to, to start up something
that has home gone the full name. Yeah.

651
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,970
Hong Kong from way it actually,
right.

652
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,010
I didn't know how to translate
that, that, that, you know,

653
00:43:26,011 --> 00:43:28,890
tastes a space of Hong Kong. Right. Um,

654
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:34,790
I was thinking how I could relate the
taste of my childhood to a Mcdonald's

655
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:40,920
Burger and there are other ideas that
I'm still working on, on, on right now,

656
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,640
maybe later in the kitchen
today. Stuff like, um,

657
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,600
you know how Hong Kong people would
love their gotta you Donna Ray, right.

658
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,760
I think that it would probably work
with a Golly, you will owe power, right?

659
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:55,150
Because that's almost as you were saying,

660
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:58,843
but

661
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:04,040
solder finger one gutsy
Haunebu it. Right, exactly.

662
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,790
But then you know, there, there are, there
are ups and downs we have to, to, to,

663
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:09,890
to um,
overcome like me,

664
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,480
if we do work on a curry dish and then
the kids would be left out. Right.

665
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,380
So it's a long journey,
but I'd really love it.

666
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:22,310
These are some of the creative juices
that I have to get out and I can't wait to

667
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:26,150
see what you have in store. Thank
you. Thank you. Any other questions?

668
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:30,470
Thank you for coming. Thank you for
being so honest with everything you say.

669
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,160
I could just feel it that you're,

670
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:36,960
you're not scripted. Um, so thanks James.

671
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:40,500
Uh, with, uh, seems like you have
a lot of wisdom, but you know,

672
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:43,680
you're invested in a company
back in when you were 22,

673
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:48,240
even though it kind of went through
rough times. So through all these times,

674
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,140
do you look up to somebody if somebody's
your mentor and the has always been

675
00:44:52,141 --> 00:44:53,910
since day one,
um,

676
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,290
or that has involved depending on which
part of the industry that you're in.

677
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,640
Good question.
Actually,

678
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,140
I don't have that person.

679
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:09,950
I've always sort of my mentor as logic.
I,

680
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:13,890
I've really not gone to anybody
about much of this kind of stuff.

681
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:18,930
Maybe I should write really, but, but
I just don't have that person in life.

682
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:24,360
You will have to you. Um,
so yes, in my company, yes.

683
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:29,190
That's actually interesting. I
don't have that person. Are you,

684
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,030
are you open to seeking mentorship?
Like seeking help?

685
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,620
Yeah.

686
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,960
What I'm saying,
like I do with department.

687
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:51,100
Like I know you help a lot of young
people. Um, but you're also like,

688
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,700
I don't present yourself. Right. So like
when, when you do come across it? Yeah,

689
00:45:56,701 --> 00:45:57,534
yeah.
Same gender

690
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:02,040
you do come across like
difficult decisions and stuff.

691
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:07,050
Like do you just solely you're comfortable
relying on yourself and I was just

692
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:07,670
thinking that through.

693
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:11,220
That's something I'm actually really
interested in because I'm facing similar

694
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,160
kind of situations for my career.

695
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,580
I've always been able to,

696
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:24,440
I've always been able to gradually work
out the problems in my life. So yeah,

697
00:46:24,441 --> 00:46:27,410
I've really not, you know, found
that person to, to, to go to.

698
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:30,840
And then because of the different
fields that I work on, you know,

699
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,730
sometimes it's music, sometimes it's
a, it's film, sometimes it's business,

700
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,500
sometimes it's kind of a bit tech.

701
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:41,630
So there's not really that one person
that I can talk to regarding all the, uh,

702
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:42,523
different fields.

703
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,400
Believe it or not, some of us actually
laid off as well. So we can generate,

704
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:52,650
thank you. Thank you. Some people actually
flew in everything. Thank you. Thank you.

705
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,170
Nice to know that.
What is sort of,

706
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:59,320
what are the messages or expectation
or an impact that you have to bring?

707
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:01,650
I Ron Carson

708
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:06,700
through music, through movies. Of course.

709
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,310
Mainly it's entertainment and music.
I could say I,

710
00:47:11,311 --> 00:47:14,740
I hope it brings more,
uh,

711
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:21,010
I hope my music can also stimulate or
console you in your everyday day life.

712
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,320
But in terms of a deeper message,

713
00:47:23,321 --> 00:47:27,460
we're trying to do that through the chef
next show because as like what I was

714
00:47:27,461 --> 00:47:30,400
saying about, you know, we
don't share correctly or,

715
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:35,350
or how we are missing the essence
of eating together. Um, I,

716
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:38,620
I really, really learned a lot
through the, did the kitchen,

717
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:41,470
the time management stuff,
the uh, the sharing part.

718
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,160
It has changed my personal
personality immensely.

719
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:47,980
I was a really different person
before I started cooking.

720
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:52,480
And I think especially
in this day and age,

721
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,900
um,
we hope to promote a lot more

722
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,820
activities or,
or

723
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:07,610
wilderness wildlife activities or
stuff that you could do, you know,

724
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,350
apart from just looking at the phone
or the computer, I think that's a very,

725
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,840
very important part of life.

726
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,390
Uh, I got a question more
about, uh, your film career.

727
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,330
So I just wanted to know
moving force. So, first of all,

728
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,160
congratulations on the best actor award,

729
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,910
but it's moving forward for your future
film projects are going to be pursuing

730
00:48:26,911 --> 00:48:31,550
more action driven movies like the story.
Are you going to go for more uh,

731
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,710
virtual or dramatic roles that
have been a further challenge?

732
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:35,640
Your acting abilities?

733
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:38,010
I don't really have a preference.

734
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:43,530
I think that I am.
Um,

735
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:48,900
sometimes you need a bit of luck
when you, when you, you know,

736
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,890
when you're giving a script,
the cast has got to be right.

737
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:56,340
The story has to be right.
The whole crew has to be right.

738
00:48:56,341 --> 00:48:59,820
The timing has to be right. We always
say that in the movie and the street.

739
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,120
Each movie has its own journey.
Really.

740
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,800
All you could do is do our best
when it is handed to you. Um,

741
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:11,880
but I do think there, there is
one that I'm planning on, um,

742
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:14,580
in a few months it is action packed.

743
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:19,670
I do think Hong Kong has defined
its roots some way somehow.

744
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,050
And to me,
Hong Kong movie is about Hong Kong action.

745
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:29,850
It has never really been
about Hong Kong drama. So

746
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:34,830
it's going to be tough. But I think, yes,

747
00:49:34,831 --> 00:49:39,500
I'm going to have to take down and fight
again and maybe jump off some buildings.

748
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:42,420
I think many of us are

749
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,380
on video. And that you started
the talk with your work.

750
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:53,710
So I was just wondering, reflecting
back on your life path, um,

751
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:57,030
what are some of the keywords
that define your character,

752
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:02,110
who you are today that made
you to be a successful life?

753
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:06,480
Successful career clusters
and wisdom with us. Thank you.

754
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,460
Keywords would be creativity.

755
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,980
Create keywords would be,

756
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:13,723
uh,

757
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:19,370
B tenacity. Keywords
would be synergy, actually

758
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:25,730
resourcefulness, but different
keywords come at different times.

759
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:29,960
Really it to,
if I was to be greedy,

760
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:34,640
I would say every word is a keyword.
Yeah.

761
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:39,670
Cool. Um, so before we wrap
up, just one question from uh,

762
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:44,180
somebody watching from the
states actually. Wow. So
what time is it over there?

763
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:49,130
It is late. So basically they said, um,

764
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,980
at our headquarters we have a
program called kitchen sink.

765
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:57,160
And there are chefs that come all
the time too to teach how to cook.

766
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:02,520
And if you're ever in the area,
would that be something you would be

767
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:03,483
just did it?

768
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,130
Speaking of which,
you know,

769
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:13,080
I think I'm tech wise right now I'm
having problems with working on the Vr

770
00:51:13,081 --> 00:51:17,040
goggle. Like when you're teaching cooking,
the problem is the depth. You know,

771
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:20,160
you can't lean into the pot
and see what's in there.

772
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,560
If you guys crack that problem,
please tell me.

773
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:24,850
Okay.

774
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:27,660
Yeah. Oh we can, we can work together.

775
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:29,953
Yeah.

776
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:31,480
Cause I'm still the,
uh,

777
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:35,650
Asia Pacific marketing director for the
digital domain company right in, in La.

778
00:51:35,651 --> 00:51:40,651
And we were still doing all the
post production for a Avengers for,

779
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:45,670
for all those series. So if you guys ever
come up with that kind of tech, yeah,

780
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,410
tell me please.
Awesome.

781
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:51,340
So that brings us to the end
of our talks that Google.

782
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,600
Thank you everybody for coming and
thank you nick, for taking your precious

783
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:56,960
share with us.
