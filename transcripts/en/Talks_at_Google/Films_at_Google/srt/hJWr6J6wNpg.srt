1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,420
Please help me welcome to the stage.
John [inaudible].

2
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:09,040
Nitsky Haylie Meyer Shire and released.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,460
Hmm.

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,340
Have a seat. Any seat? You black.
Welcome. Any seat except for mine. Okay.

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,460
So, uh, reviews came out right

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,630
this morning. I, I don't know if
you've read them or if you guys, uh,

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,020
don't read them.

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,860
No, no. What is that noise making device?

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,700
And I mean through reviews were great.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,890
Read one,
which was,

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,050
which I guess we'll lead into the
whole talking about the story here,

12
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:47,110
the unquestionable feelgood movie of 2017.

13
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,240
Have you heard that Pete
Hammond deadline Hollywood? Uh,

14
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,360
congratulations on writing an incredible
story. Thank you. This is Holly.

15
00:00:55,361 --> 00:00:58,390
This is your, your writing debut? Yes.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,500
Directing debut and film debut in general.

17
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,800
Yeah. Yeah, that's my debut. So where,

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,390
where did

19
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,930
the, uh, I guess, where did the idea
come from? Where did this originate?

20
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,110
Um, you know, I came from a
bunch of different places.

21
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:18,770
I had had the character of Alice in my
head for a long time of this woman who

22
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:22,370
had sort of made a lot of decisions
early in life and then started,

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,720
started questioning them.

24
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:28,220
And that kind of post-separation
post-divorce time in a
woman's life. And, um,

25
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:33,221
I had a friend who had three guys move
into her family's house growing up and I

26
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:36,710
just thought that was such an interesting
idea and a great setting for a comedy.

27
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:41,030
So I sort of put this character in that
sin, in that scenario. And you know,

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,920
all came from there.

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,920
Huh. Okay. So was there the, in real
life, was there the sexual tension that,

30
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,270
no, I actually don't, I don't
know anything about the,
what actually happened. I,

31
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,000
it is a fictional film.

32
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,500
Sure it is. Yeah. Right.

33
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,940
And recent. John, how did the two of
you get on board the film yourselves?

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,410
I read the script, um,
and I just loved it.

35
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,820
I thought it was such an original
idea and um, the idea that, you know,

36
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,810
a decision you make a 25 isn't necessarily
the right decision for the rest of

37
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:11,351
your life.

38
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:14,380
And I think a lot of people are crossroads
at certain times and trying to figure

39
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:16,630
out chapter two of their life.
Um,

40
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,060
and so I met with Holly and she was wildly
impressive and had a great vision for

41
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:23,530
it.
And we went ahead.

42
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,530
John, what about you? I mean, Sam,

43
00:02:26,531 --> 00:02:29,950
I read the script and was
blown away and you know,

44
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:33,690
it's about also about three
young filmmakers who uh,

45
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,760
move out to la hoping to make it and may
nat and Pico can all relate obviously

46
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:41,590
to that. Um, so, you know,

47
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,170
I was honored to be a part of it.

48
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,380
John John came in on my first
day of casting. Yeah, just
very special. Really. Yeah.

49
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,370
And so none of you knew each
other beforehand? No, no, no, no.

50
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,280
I heard.

51
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,880
Yeah. Right. So I guess we Reese you've
been acting since you were 14, 15,

52
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,900
14 and uh,
so with hits gushy,

53
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,030
Pleasantville still one of my all time
favorites from when I was younger.

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,010
Cruel intentions, American psycho,
uh, legally blonde, sweet home. Hello.

55
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,360
This is the legally blonde hair.

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,660
Sweet. So Alabama walk the line with
what she won the academy award again.

57
00:03:32,661 --> 00:03:33,494
Congratulations.

58
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,393
So

59
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,690
I guess you've been putting out a
movie a year since you were a teenager.

60
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,490
I guess so.

61
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,270
And so you went, you were a child star
and then went to be an adult star.

62
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:52,140
How did you navigate that complexity
without sort of going a little bit

63
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,480
typically child star?
Crazy.

64
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,100
I mean, I don't know.
I wasn't aware that I,

65
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,830
I wasn't really like a big child starting.
I worked in movies in,

66
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,570
my parents were very adamant that I
stay in high school and then I went to

67
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:08,040
college so I didn't really start working
with any kind of regularity until I was

68
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:13,041
about 19 I got a big audition when I was
at Stanford and then I had to drop out

69
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,660
to do the movie and then I got another
movie and I've got another maybe instead

70
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:22,020
it just started working on, but I thought
it was going to be a doctor. I really,

71
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:26,460
I'm not the kind of person who would
move to la and live in a car because I

72
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,160
can't, my parents are
about doctor. Yeah. Yeah.

73
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,880
So they did. They want you to be doctors
because my parents were always like,

74
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,560
you can act with computer science degree.

75
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:36,420
You can't do computer science
with an acting degree,

76
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,720
which is the only advice I really ever
listened to, which landed me here.

77
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,620
So thank you mom. Thank
you mom and dad. Um,

78
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,070
um, yeah, they wanted me to be a doctor.

79
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,210
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they
still want me to be a that.

80
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,990
Did they call you up after they
seem so your movies and like Reese,

81
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:57,780
we really wish that you had, you
know, become a brain surgeon.

82
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,580
Well I think in the movie is more like
after I do a talk show and I talk about

83
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:06,540
them a lot, they're like, oh, we wish
she wouldn't talk about us. They're in,

84
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,430
they're against sports.

85
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,470
And there you grew up in the south,
right?

86
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,780
I grew up in Nashville, Tennessee.
My Dad was in the military,

87
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:17,090
so we were all over the place. How did
you kick the southern accent? Oh, um,

88
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,830
well I got advice when I was about 18.

89
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,540
I went into a casting
office and they said,

90
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,100
you're never going to get work
with that terrible accent. So I,

91
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,730
I watched a lot of TV shows,

92
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,760
like 900 to 100 and I watched the way
that they would articulate and I would

93
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,143
copy them.

94
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,650
Oh Wow. I'm not gonna, I'm
just gonna leave it there.

95
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,820
That's crazy. So your parents burying
a man out of London. What's that?

96
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,160
We're just going through that

97
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,670
and John. Okay. So
dude, SNL. Yeah. People,

98
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,100
people dream about being on

99
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,310
that show.
How did you make the crossover from,

100
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,000
from I guess let's sketch comedy
TV over into this movie business?

101
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,740
Well, um, I wouldn't have gotten the
opportunity to even audition for this,

102
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:12,860
had it not been for SNL, that
kind of helped, you know,

103
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,680
put me in a room with Halley
and Nancy to begin with,

104
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:19,240
which was pretty crazy to
even have an opportunity to,

105
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,390
to be considered for
this movie. Um, but, uh,

106
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,120
my background is an acting. I, I, um,

107
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,400
I've been doing theater my whole
life and I studied theater at USC,

108
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,940
so I really have always wanted
to, to act, you know, just,

109
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,290
I just happened to do comedy. In addition
to that, you know, happen to do comedy.

110
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,370
You can, but he's not from the Midwest,

111
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:47,200
so we're not sure where that,
this looks weird.

112
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,450
Michael Keaton x isn't

113
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,540
cam and he and I know where it's
coming from. I Dunno. I Dunno.

114
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,650
Do I do it all the time or
is it just sometimes, no,

115
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,030
he does lots of different voices.
Yeah. I can't quite tell. Yeah. Yeah,

116
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:02,860
there's just certain

117
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,850
words that I just like, like I,
I'd like to say about, even though

118
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,130
that's I'm from Jersey,

119
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,420
but like more fun to say about
and I'm going to the buyer,

120
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,480
like I'm going to the buyer. Like why
wouldn't you choose to say it that way?

121
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,240
Just take what you like from
every accident, I guess. Yeah.

122
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,850
Good pack. The cod hovered.
Yeah. Hey, go. Right.

123
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,510
And so highly now turn 30 pre recently.
Yes. I don't know how you hear. No,

124
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,600
that's fine.
I'm good with it.

125
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,100
I bring this up because you make me feel
really insignificant with my own life

126
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:38,630
decisions. Being older than that. Um,

127
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,290
and having seen now what
you have accomplished? Uh,

128
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,460
I guess it makes me feel like I've had
a few wrong choices when I was 25. Um,

129
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,370
but you started your own acting
career when you were like four. Yeah.

130
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,950
Well,
it's funny I'm being asked a lot,

131
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:56,920
but I was in no way a child actor.

132
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,920
My parents forced me to be in
their films with basically,

133
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,200
but I'm very grateful because now
it's kind of like I have this personal

134
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,730
connection and a little bit of a
photo album. But no, I was just,

135
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:09,760
I was always on their sets so
they'd throw me in the movie,

136
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:13,870
but it wasn't because I wanted to be
an actor. And who are your parents? Um,

137
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,921
Nancy Meyers,

138
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:19,921
a producer of if our movie and my dad
is trial Shire who was her partner for a

139
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:22,290
long time. Yeah. And

140
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,390
for those who don't know,
a,

141
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,360
the two of them have produced many
things such as the intern holiday.

142
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:32,590
It's complicated. Parent trap, Baby Boom,
private Benjamin, a father of the bride.

143
00:08:32,591 --> 00:08:35,800
And if you've heard of any of those
came from this family lineage.

144
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,010
And now apple has not
fallen far from the tree.

145
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,190
This movie is absolutely incredible
and you're standing on your own.

146
00:08:42,191 --> 00:08:45,430
So thank you for continuing this.
Um,

147
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,580
and it is such a fun movie.
Was it as fun to write as I guess?

148
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,550
I guess the question is, was it as fun
too, right as it was for us to watch?

149
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,623
Oh boy,

150
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,780
you got a little over excited Mike Dry and

151
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,610
make the movie writing is, um,
I love writing. That's, yeah,

152
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,490
it's where I identify most
in the filmmaking processes
with writing your, um,

153
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,950
I mean, in my case, I don't
have a writing partner,

154
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:18,970
so you're completely alone with these
characters and there's so much fun to be

155
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:19,800
had there,
but it's,

156
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,800
it's it really challenging writing a movie
and layering your character's and uh,

157
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,940
you know,
I,

158
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,940
I think I did probably upwards
of 30 drafts of this script also.

159
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,330
Um, well, I, you know, I did 15 on
my own, then I gave it to my mom,

160
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:41,420
another field out of that. So, um, is
that scary and giving it to your mom?

161
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,640
Like his hands it back with
a big no because she's the
only person I give it to.

162
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,480
So it's not like I'm
getting a, I just, you know,

163
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:51,370
I gave it to her and she has such
thoughtful, good notes and just, um,

164
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,640
I think good notes are just
raising the right questions.

165
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:56,820
She never said you should
do this, you should do that.
It would just say, you know,

166
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,080
why did they break up?

167
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:01,770
Why did they just raising those questions
that make you go home and think for so

168
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:06,210
long. Like, Oh my God, why? I don't
know and I don't figure this out. Um,

169
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,370
so I don't even remember the question.
But yeah,

170
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:12,840
writing is a lot of work and super
rewarding. It was fun. I love,

171
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,480
I love to write. I sort
of, there's this great Joan

172
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,311
Didion quote,
like,

173
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:19,970
I don't know what I'm thinking until I
write it down and I really identify with

174
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:20,241
that.
You know,

175
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:23,090
sometimes you just don't know how you
feel about something until you just write

176
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:23,924
it down.
[inaudible]

177
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,200
that's interesting. Uh,
yeah. As someone who writes,

178
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,530
because I have to answer emails.
I appreciate someone who

179
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,840
does it.
Yeah.

180
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,000
All right.
I guess where you grew up in the industry,

181
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:40,480
you grew up around very
successful parents and, and,

182
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,750
and being on sets all the time.

183
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,820
Obviously you have written the maturity
into this film that I wouldn't have

184
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:51,680
expected from someone, I guess
as young as you are, um, from,

185
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:54,500
from a certain perspective. So, yeah.
Where did that maturity come from?

186
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:57,410
Where did your larger view on like,
relationships in life happen?

187
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,970
Um, you know, I think for me, I was,

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,490
I was trying a little bit
to honor the medium of film,

189
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:06,090
which I respect so much and
I wanted to, I, you know,

190
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:10,740
film is forever and I didn't want to
write about trivial issues. So for me,

191
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:14,670
the themes of family and divorce
and starting over are important.

192
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,220
So that's kind of why I,
you know,

193
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:20,500
I think Allison's story and crossroads is,
um,

194
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,290
a little bit weightier and real, or
then the issues of sort of, you know,

195
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,200
you know which guy and you know,
the kind of like 20 something story,

196
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,310
right? Yeah. And that I
enjoy in this, that did,

197
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:39,100
it doesn't take the normal like slap
stick kind of silly turns that that Rom

198
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,680
coms, romantic comedies do
in most cases. So it was,

199
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:45,230
it was a pleasant surprise and I think
that's why of course today the reviews

200
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:48,680
are coming out and they're
all very positive. So, uh,
you've done a good job there.

201
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,860
Um, regarding the characters, I
guess. So we saw in the preview,

202
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:55,300
there's lots of other people in it.

203
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,790
Obviously it's not just the three of
these people. Here are the two of them,

204
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:01,240
then a director. Um, Michael Sheen is the,

205
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:05,670
is is a house as husband Candice
Bergen is Alice's mom. Uh,

206
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,480
we've got lake bell's
a wonderful addition.

207
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,950
How did all of these wonderful people
come give you get attached to this first

208
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:13,060
time directors film?

209
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,480
Um, well, you know,

210
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,690
the casting is such an important
part of the process because you're,

211
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,390
you're sort of handing your character
off to somebody and letting them make it

212
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:25,100
their own. So it's, it's um, it's
such an important thing and we,

213
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,070
we thought really deeply
about this and um,

214
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,980
it was a really nice mix I think of
newcomers and seasoned actors and I think

215
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:34,410
that mix added something
fresh to the equation.

216
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:38,380
It really felt like there was different
generations in this movie. And um,

217
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,480
I have to say, you know, we,

218
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,050
we sent it to these people and sometimes
you think you'll never hear back or

219
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:43,570
what.
And the,

220
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,710
a lot of them responded and my mom
had worked with like bell before,

221
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:48,510
so we knew her,

222
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,270
but the rest of the actors in this movie
or just good old fashioned sending them

223
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:53,600
the screen

224
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,340
then hoping they'll say,
yes.

225
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,830
You have to realize as an actor you don't
get a lot of scripts where you get to

226
00:12:57,831 --> 00:13:01,940
play a character anymore. Like it
is. Yeah, it's pretty rare. And,

227
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:06,260
and to have a fully fleshed out character
with a beginning and a middle and an

228
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:11,261
end or a real journey or real lines to
say or humor is really an anomaly these

229
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,260
days. I mean you're honestly just
reacting to a green screen and, okay.

230
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,463
Ah,

231
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,350
does it hurt here?
Like what am I on?

232
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,710
Said I'm not sure we're
going to put it in language.

233
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,330
Just give me like six different reaction.

234
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,323
Do it

235
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,210
hers are starving and do something
really meaningful and deep.

236
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,500
Hmm. I, I guess I didn't realize that the
bad guy with the green screen was never

237
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:35,550
preconceived beforehand.

238
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,160
Sometimes they just,
they have no idea what's coming next.

239
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,350
It's a working, working with
the w, the three stooges. Um,

240
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:52,120
was there any parallel there by
the way? No. No. Why three guys?

241
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sidetracking here. Why three
guys? Why not one? Why not two?

242
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,290
Uh,
I think good things come in threes.

243
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,520
It just was always going to be
a trio for me. I don't know.

244
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,210
Fair. Okay. So back to my original
thought. It was always three.

245
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,270
So this is a little bit of a spoiler.
Um, some of you have seen the movie,

246
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:09,940
we screened it here last night.
Uh, so at the end I was actually,

247
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:12,700
I was pleasantly surprised to
find that the end of the story,

248
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,320
Alice doesn't choose any
of the men, um, which is,

249
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,010
which is cool.

250
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,620
Great.
They just das

251
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,380
imagine that,
don't need a man to be happy.

252
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,210
Uh, it, it's refreshing to see a romantic
comedy where like the fee the female

253
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:35,960
protagonist finds happiness
on her own. Sure. John,

254
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:36,540
I choose here.

255
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,373
Yeah,

256
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,140
I did. I did think that you
were going to go for John.

257
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:47,140
That was going to say that to me
too. Yeah. I'm writing a sequel.

258
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,543
Okay.

259
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,503
Home again.

260
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,130
Okay.

261
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,480
Still home again. Um, yeah,

262
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,340
I guess that's what that is one of the
most powerful things about this movie

263
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:04,280
that I feel every woman is
portrayed as a strong woman.

264
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:08,930
Even like the smaller
supporting characters are,
they're all, none of them are,

265
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,380
are typically like you're frail,
weak sort of women, you know,

266
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,450
they're often portrayed.
Uh,

267
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,930
was this a conscious choice when you were
writing it and I guess for you Reese,

268
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:21,230
was this something you noticed in the
script that attracted you to the role?

269
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,470
Yeah, I don't, I don't, I mean,
I don't play a lot of weak.

270
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,633
Amen.

271
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,740
I don't really know any week.

272
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,013
Amen.

273
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,990
Say if you want to be a woman,
you better be tough.

274
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,190
And that's the only kind of women I know.
So that's, that's, yeah. Hell he writes.

275
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,680
Yeah, I wouldn't have, I don't know.

276
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,590
I also don't know any Greek
women who wouldn't have gotten,

277
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:50,590
it wouldn't have come naturally to
me to right. That she's vulnerable.

278
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,610
[inaudible] that's for sure.

279
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:56,170
And she gains strength by the end of the
film and self confidence and feeling,

280
00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:59,230
you know, like she's going to be okay by
the end. But no, I don't, I don't know.

281
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,380
Never. I wasn't consciously
thinking this is a strong woman.

282
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:03,790
I just thought this is a woman.
And

283
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,550
so you've also, yeah, I
agree. Very well written.

284
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,290
And so Erica Oldie,

285
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,510
oldie produce this as well. So she's
only just only been producing for,

286
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,910
you know, just a few years
too. She's a new producer. Um,

287
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,260
and I was reading up on her too,
and she produced this film.

288
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:26,100
It's primarily made by women as well.
So how did,

289
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,960
how did you find her?
How did she become attached?

290
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,510
Um, after I had written the
script, do you know, we, uh,

291
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,630
gave it to our agents who wanted to help
us get the financing for this movie.

292
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:37,450
And Erica was the right person,
I think because she,

293
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:42,510
her whole company is based around
women's stories and I think she has a

294
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:46,450
particular affiliate, like she
loves these kinds of movies and um,

295
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,660
she wanted to tell women's
stories and help female directors.

296
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:53,720
So it was a really nice pairing and
she's a young woman herself. And, um,

297
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,210
I was great.
Yeah.

298
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,430
That's wonderful. And so
Reese, a little side question,

299
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:01,230
I guess over the last few years,
um, so you'd be getting in,

300
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:04,100
producing yourself and your
produce big little lies, which

301
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,640
donations for that,
which is wonderful. Um,

302
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,530
what made you want to get into producing?

303
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,270
Um, well, about five years ago,

304
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,620
I read probably the worst script
of her ride my entire life. And,

305
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,610
uh,

306
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,560
the part for a woman was just
absolutely dreadful opposite of guy.

307
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,230
And I called my agent and I said,
well, let's just a piece of crap.

308
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,750
And I don't want to do this.
And she said,

309
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,730
every actress in
Hollywood wants this park.

310
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,170
And I thought we deserved
better than these parts.

311
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,680
And so I was like, I better, I can
either start complaining about it,

312
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,080
which isn't gonna do any good
or I can do something about it.

313
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:50,010
So I started buying books and turning
them into movies in my first two were wild

314
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:52,440
and gone girl.
And um,

315
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,770
and so I just started from there and
creating parts for other women as well.

316
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,680
And that's sort of been the
next chapter of my life.

317
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,540
So do you enjoy performing still more
or are you aiming more towards the

318
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,360
producer side?

319
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,310
No, I like being an
actor. I really love it.

320
00:18:06,311 --> 00:18:08,740
It's my first love it and I get
on set and I get all excited.

321
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,690
She's so good at it, I enjoy it. But

322
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,600
I love pretty saying and
I'm really a big reader,

323
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:18,900
so I read a ton and um,
and then I can just,

324
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,930
and I kind of have an eye for what
is actually going to get made.

325
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:25,590
And what's cinematic because
not every book is, you know,

326
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,980
things can be beautifully written but
just it's not going to happen. And, um,

327
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,600
I think those two things together really
help create a successful producing

328
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,340
career.

329
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,130
You should produce a movie you star in
where you play a doctor and it would

330
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:41,450
satisfy everything I said. Yes.
A brain surgeon. Thanks mom.

331
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,500
Uh, going back, I guess to the casting,

332
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,200
you have two wonderful
children that you cast,

333
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,150
Lola Flannery and Eden Grace
Redfield. Yeah. Was it,

334
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,340
is it harder to find a,

335
00:18:55,341 --> 00:18:59,120
to cast roles for children or to cast
roles for adults and specifically for

336
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:00,410
these two kids?
How did you,

337
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,840
yeah, it's really hard to catch
children because um, you know,

338
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:08,050
their parents rehearse it with
them. So there's, it's hard.

339
00:19:08,051 --> 00:19:11,380
Sometimes when I was watching
the auditions it would be
like they've had a very

340
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:14,740
specific way of saying it in a specific
rhythm and you feel like you might have

341
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:15,730
to undo that a lot,

342
00:19:15,731 --> 00:19:18,970
but these two kids and that you could
just feel that there was something

343
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,800
supernatural,
not supernatural,

344
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,090
but very natural about them.
Um,

345
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,663
there was sort of,

346
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,760
well the little one caught my eye honestly
because she was racist twin and we

347
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,830
were like, this is a little Reese.
And then she happened to be,

348
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,320
to have this fantastic comedic timing
and be, you know, super unique and um,

349
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,040
Lola,
you know,

350
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,780
I really wanted somebody in that part
that could play the comedy of being

351
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:48,380
anxious, but you wouldn't
actually be super worried for her.

352
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,060
You just felt like this was a
stage she was going to come out of.

353
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:54,490
And I think Lola has kind of an
inner happiness to her that are very,

354
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,400
she's very sweet and then the
sweetness comes through and um,

355
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,100
I think they just both were so
natural, you know, they really,

356
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:05,850
they didn't feel like child
actory they just, you know. Yeah.

357
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,970
And John, I guess your
character, uh, you guys, you,

358
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
you and Lola have great onscreen chemistry
where you liked that offset or off

359
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,340
camera too? Yeah, we really hit it off.
We were, uh, we would sing a Dell alive.

360
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,560
We were tight. We all got along.
It was really one big family, uh,

361
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,320
almost instantaneously I would say.

362
00:20:26,321 --> 00:20:29,500
Cause the guys actually
ended up living together

363
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,260
together. Yeah. You know, I didn't,

364
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,620
when they got cast that we all live
together like now was a bad idea,

365
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,260
but it turned out all right. Turned down.
I can, I can still speaking now. Wait,

366
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,250
well yeah, a little bit more jacket
and we are, we are one busy working,

367
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,650
uh, around the globe.
Still owes you some rent.

368
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,360
But now when we all talk we all love
each other a great deal. And then, yeah,

369
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,790
I guess you touched on
family, I guess that uh, uh,

370
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,520
the whole cast does to
me seem like a family.

371
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:04,420
Like we're watching this family
literally and figuratively on screen. Um,

372
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,440
when did,

373
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,330
when was the first time that everybody
sat down together that everybody met as a,

374
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,880
was there one point when
everybody got together to

375
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,420
can also rehearsal?
Yeah.

376
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,660
Yeah. Everyone. Yeah, we sort of,

377
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,940
there's a lot of intertwined
relationships in this movie.

378
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:22,820
So we did a lot of rehearsals,
you know, with the different, um,

379
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:25,790
like John and Lola and then John and
Reese. And the reason that, you know,

380
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:29,090
it's like everyone has a different
relationship in this movie. So we, um,

381
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,670
we all got together and talked
about those different dynamics.

382
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,630
I think that's when it first
started. Jelling yeah. Yeah.

383
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,030
When did you realize that you had
something really special that was kind of

384
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:39,864
bubbling up here?

385
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,920
Um, that's a good question. You know,

386
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,790
I think there was a really great energy
on the set. It didn't, it didn't feel,

387
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:51,300
I felt like we were making a feel good.

388
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,770
I thought when we were making the movie,
you know, it had a nice energy and um,

389
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,820
you know, my mom was the producer,
which added another family element.

390
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:02,700
It really literally was
a family. Um, recess.

391
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:06,020
Kids would come by and John's parents and,
you know,

392
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,080
it was fun.
Why is that?

393
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,980
Work on my lines.

394
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,103
Yeah.

395
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,850
The tone of the movie really match the
tone on set, honestly. Yeah, I really did.

396
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,010
Oh, that's, that's incredible. Um,

397
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,910
I guess I would have loved a
bit of fly in the room, I guess.

398
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,430
Did you don't do a table read or
anything for the movies to you?

399
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,310
I think for this head, you, Tamari,

400
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,910
y'all and y'all came in and was
somebody who was auditioning. Again,

401
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,430
I read this with all my friends. No, not,

402
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,240
I did a table reading at his house with
actor friends. Yeah. That's amazing.

403
00:22:41,241 --> 00:22:44,050
Why didn't you invite any of us?
Well,

404
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,960
we all just debated about this word that
none of us could say. And we were like,

405
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:51,750
what was the word? He
was like c h. A I. S. E.

406
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,090
I was like, oh shit. And
then John was like, shoes.

407
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,190
Yeah.

408
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,290
What do you call it? I shake machine.

409
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,270
That was one of the bank to me.
So every time there was in the room,

410
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,640
they'd be like,
there's the

411
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,940
had to be it Shay's because
you sleep on it that night.

412
00:23:27,001 --> 00:23:29,970
And that's why I said chat. So you
couldn't sleep on a chair that night.

413
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:33,540
So it has that is that, I know
today we'd call it a self. The bad

414
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,740
hello.
So for medicine is different.

415
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,590
I don't know.
Not a shoes

416
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,960
or John is wrong.
That's little I know about.

417
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,150
Yeah, she's doesn't have a pullout.
That's, I guess that's the difference.

418
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,620
You're fancy. It's got the little
swoopy arm thing, doesn't it?

419
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,330
Oh yeah. Am I wrong? It can. It
can have a swoopy arm. All right.

420
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:10,360
Well my shit smartest minds in the world.

421
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,023
Okay.

422
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:18,000
And they have randomly Google it.
I guess you're in trouble here though.

423
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,960
Yeah.
Nobody's banging it.

424
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,940
Not a single person brings it.

425
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,980
What? Q and a are they doing right? Yeah.

426
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,873
They're not

427
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,890
the clown from it.
Yes.

428
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,960
A
balloon.

429
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,410
A bunch of scared kids.

430
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,003
Hi Kelly.

431
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,400
I'm just, I'm that no one's picturing
somebody on a stage over there with a,

432
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,710
the little face drawn on scary.
Oh Gosh. Okay. So the whole,

433
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,120
the whole movie takes place in La.
Um, where did you actually film this?

434
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:11,954
Was it actually in la?

435
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,770
Yes, it was actually in
La on the west side of La.

436
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:19,710
And what, whose house was a
lovely gentleman named bill.

437
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,190
Um, it used to be Cindy
Crawford's house. Yeah.

438
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:25,570
It kind of has a Hollywood history
for gardeners before that. Okay.

439
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,530
Yeah, I found the house. Um,

440
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:33,150
I googled that Spanish houses on the
west side of Los Angeles because I knew

441
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:34,620
that's where we wanted to shoot the movie.

442
00:25:34,621 --> 00:25:37,890
And I found it on a real estate listing
and we left a note in your mailbox.

443
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,240
Wow. Crazy. That stuff doesn't happen.

444
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:49,070
Yeah. I mean I was watching
like that. I'm very lucky.

445
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,950
Wow. Am I mean, I guess talking
back to the family lineage,

446
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,050
like everything your parents did to
had it was set in these massive just

447
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:00,400
beautiful houses. Is that yeah. They
got to build there. Is it really?

448
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,490
Yeah. Back in the heyday of the romantic
comedy. Wow. And they build their set.

449
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:07,370
So, um, you know,

450
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:10,460
which is the nice thing about building
your sets is when you write a scene and

451
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:11,061
you say,
you know,

452
00:26:11,061 --> 00:26:14,390
she enters this way and he enters this
way and then you can build that and it,

453
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,980
it tells your story through the sets.
Um,

454
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,510
but what was amazing about this house was
I had storyboarded the whole movie and

455
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:22,370
I was so nervous to find a
location cause I, you know,

456
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:26,090
you write things that he fixes this and
this and they look through that window.

457
00:26:26,091 --> 00:26:29,990
So I was like, I'm going to have to find
a house full of windows because so many,

458
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,440
it's kind of a visual Motif and the movie
is people are looking through windows

459
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:36,220
and seeing things happening and then
it got to this house and it was,

460
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,030
the windows were all in the right
places. I was like, this is it.

461
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,590
I had a guest house to and an had a guest
house, which was great. That's crazy.

462
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,020
Yeah.
And so was it empty?

463
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:50,280
Did you stage it or was anything
like original? This guy bill,

464
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:52,860
you said any bells,
furniture and make it into the movie?

465
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,860
No.
So we sold

466
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,060
some of Jennifer Garner's curtains.
Yeah,

467
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,180
the movie.
Thanks Jen.

468
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,040
Does she get a credit and thanks to
Jennifer Gardner for providing curtain for

469
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:06,874
having good days?

470
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:10,510
Yeah, I guess so. I guess, uh,

471
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,300
what happens to the PR?
The bill wasn't living there.

472
00:27:13,301 --> 00:27:15,520
What happens to the person
when you're displacing them?

473
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:16,840
For how long did it take to shoot this?

474
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,200
No, he didn't. He didn't
live there, live there? No,

475
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,560
he was about to renovate it and I think
we got to him right before, right before.

476
00:27:23,561 --> 00:27:27,090
Yeah. I was very lucky that he didn't
live. That's also an unusual thing.

477
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:30,870
Usually you have to put that person up
and when you inconvenienced them in such

478
00:27:30,871 --> 00:27:34,360
a way, but he didn't actually live
there. I don't know. Something was right.

479
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,730
It was some, something in the stars
were aligning for their special.

480
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,860
Oh, super natural. This is
what it was. Cause it was the
kids. The kids grow pecans.

481
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,890
Yeah. How long did it, 30 days.

482
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,750
I think you shut the whole thing in
a month. Less than, yeah. Wow. Yeah.

483
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,380
That's crazy.
Nope.

484
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:53,950
Okay.

485
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,783
All right.

486
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,240
How do you long do you think it takes to
make a movie? I don't know. Green screen.

487
00:27:59,241 --> 00:28:01,880
This stuff takes like eight months.
Right.

488
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,140
Actually, when we wrapped, my
mom was like, I mean I usually,

489
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,660
this is like, I have five
more months. This, you know,

490
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,320
it was amazing that I think everybody
really, a lot of movies. Yeah. 90 days.

491
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:18,840
What else? 30 35 almost every
movie my entire career. Wow. I,

492
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,700
I don't have like monsters.
Blasters.

493
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,440
Hey Leah, you could actually
just shoot people writing.

494
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,520
Yeah.
It usually takes about 30 to 40 days

495
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,640
and with rehearsal and everything
too. Yeah. Wow. That's incredible.

496
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:38,960
I didn't know know that there's
some new thank you audience.

497
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:40,160
If you guys have questions,

498
00:28:40,161 --> 00:28:44,840
there's two mics in the aisles and you
can begin to line up here and ask anybody

499
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:47,720
anything, whatever you would like to. Um,

500
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,820
Oh yes. So we've got one
already. All right. Hi.

501
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,770
Hi Guys. Thanks for coming. Um,
before I ask my question, John,

502
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,560
I actually saw your mom
before standup comedy

503
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,440
at the comics. Wow. Okay.

504
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,140
Yeah, she told us a story about how
she liked, messed up your camp clothes.

505
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,220
This is crazy.

506
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,390
It's amazing.
Do you want me to comment on that?

507
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,880
Yeah. My Mom, first of all, my mom
is 57 and just started doing standup.

508
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,123
Great.

509
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,491
That's pretty cool.

510
00:29:28,491 --> 00:29:31,880
She's going to freak when she finds
out that you're asking this and yeah,

511
00:29:31,881 --> 00:29:36,170
my mom tells a story about, uh,
when I went to sleep away camp,

512
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:41,060
um, my parents are divorced
and my dad's very Thai Bay.

513
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,010
My mom's a total

514
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,100
mess and my dad called her is like,

515
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,040
you put John's name and all the clubs,
right.

516
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:52,480
It labeled his name on all
the clubs. My mom was like,
Oh yes, of course. Of course.

517
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:55,850
And she like immediately hired
somebody but the labels on.

518
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,270
But when they were all done,
it said my name on the front.

519
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,050
Okay.

520
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:07,880
So it's like down my zipper
and I crossed my hands. Yeah.

521
00:30:07,881 --> 00:30:12,400
My Mom's whole joke is when I got
back I was crying and I said, uh,

522
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,530
it didn't make any friends,
but everybody knew

523
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,960
my name.

524
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,320
Yeah.
My question is for East

525
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,900
[inaudible].

526
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,813
That's great.

527
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,700
A really big reader.
In fact,

528
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,850
Pacific Standard's last movies had been
like my favorite books from last five

529
00:30:45,851 --> 00:30:49,600
years. So it's been really
exciting. Um, but my question is,

530
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:51,520
so how do you know kind of,

531
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:54,910
I'm a very big believer that the books
are always better than the movies,

532
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:59,620
but it's been really enjoyable to watch
all of my favorite books in the last

533
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,690
couple of years been these
amazing movies and shows.

534
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:05,230
So how do you know kind of when you're
reading something that this is going to

535
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,180
translate really well to the screen?

536
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,910
That's a really good question.
Um,

537
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,650
it's a little complicated I think because
of knowing what people will actually

538
00:31:14,651 --> 00:31:19,300
buy and turn it into a movie and it's
two sisters during the French Revolution.

539
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,240
It's just not going to be a
movie. It's too expensive. Um,

540
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,970
it's too niche. So I think I try
to find things that are universal,

541
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:30,280
kind of relatable and um,

542
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,020
and my main directive has just been
have a woman at the center of it doing

543
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:39,760
something, sort of telling another
aspect of um, the female experience.

544
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,320
So gone girl is like, I don't know
what she psychotic, I don't know.

545
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,420
But it's something that took a,

546
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:50,450
an idea of the perfect girl and kind
of flipped it on its head and wild.

547
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:53,860
I'd love the idea of a woman versus
nature cause you see men versus nature all

548
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:54,760
the time.
Right.

549
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:59,080
And then I'd never really thought about
what's the movie where women are up

550
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:02,950
against the environment by themselves.
Um, so it's just stuff like that.

551
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:04,360
Things that feel fresh and new.

552
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:11,060
Cool. Over here. Hi.
Um, so you talked about,

553
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:15,060
um, the availability of
roles for men and women, um,

554
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,790
over your 20 years, uh, in the industry.
How have you seen that evolve in,

555
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:22,820
do you feel like we're at a point in
time where there's a lot of momentum for

556
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:24,800
roles for women?
Or how does that work?

557
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,220
Yeah, I mean, I think it's
a better time than ever. Um,

558
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:33,130
but I have to say when I started, it
was a good time for women's movies. Um,

559
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,760
women were the stars of their own movies
at the time I came up. I was, you know,

560
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:40,520
I was lucky I got in a window where I
made legally and sweet home Alabama. And,

561
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,800
um,
I can be the lead of a movie.

562
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:45,410
I think it's harder now
and particularly in movies,

563
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:50,120
you don't see women being the
star of movies very often. Um,

564
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,490
I've heard people say
it straight to my face.

565
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:55,370
We have one movie movie that has
a woman starring in it this year.

566
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:58,310
We don't need another one. Um, so,

567
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:02,450
but the great news is with all these
streaming services and the, um,

568
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,980
the new platforms, there's now
they need content more than ever,

569
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:11,600
and that creates opportunity for women
of all ages, women of all color, um,

570
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,850
people. So it's really kind of
broadening the spectrum and,

571
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:16,160
and creating more roles.

572
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,980
Thank you. Yeah. Yeah.

573
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,780
Um,
I want to thank you guys for being here.

574
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:27,350
I want to hell you mentioned earlier
that you felt like you were making a feel

575
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:32,270
good movie and I feel like we all
need that right now, so thank you.

576
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,140
Um, and then I just wanted to say, um,

577
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:40,340
I was thinking yesterday while
I was watching movie, you know,

578
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,960
you're one of my favorite actresses.

579
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:46,020
What would I say if you're actually
here and actually at Google, um,

580
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,700
and I was thinking about how you've had
this history of performing in election,

581
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,180
in curl intentions,

582
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:57,110
all of these women who are not too strong
but sort of strong in ways that people

583
00:33:57,111 --> 00:33:59,720
don't want them to be or
don't quite understand,

584
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:04,400
and that they're successful in ways
that don't fit with expectations.

585
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:08,870
And I think that's sort of
a really interesting message
for the women in Google

586
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,651
right now.

587
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:14,651
Many of whom are enrolls that people
don't expect them to be in our don't quite

588
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:17,600
trust them to be successful in.

589
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,800
And it's your particular
history of performances.

590
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,540
An interesting one right now.

591
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:27,830
And I'm not shocked to see this many
women here in this room and screaming for

592
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:32,460
Aarp legally blonde, crazy flick, although
she was left out of your recitation. Um,

593
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,120
so just want to thank you
for that. And also, Hi John.

594
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,523
Yeah.

595
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,280
Hi.
Um,

596
00:34:49,281 --> 00:34:51,740
I feel like I have so many questions to
ask race cause I feel like it would be

597
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:52,300
best friends

598
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,070
if we ever left. Really. I
think we probably would. Yeah.

599
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,130
But you actually said something that
changed my whole life question dynamic

600
00:34:59,131 --> 00:34:59,910
before.
Um,

601
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,360
you said there was a script that you
read that was like really crappy for the

602
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:06,900
woman. Did that ever
get made? Yup, sure did.

603
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,580
An Oscar winning actress.
Really?

604
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:14,980
Are you able to say I
didn't do well or that dot?

605
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,980
No, it did not terrible. Maybe, you know,

606
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,790
I've always had a thing where,

607
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:25,720
and back to your point about being a
woman who does sort of unorthodox things,

608
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:30,010
I turned down so many parts were like I
got a lot of opportunity after legally

609
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:32,740
blind to play the girlfriend and superhero
movies, girlfriend, girlfriend, I,

610
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,470
I was like, why would it be a
girlfriend when I give me the lead?

611
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:39,180
I would rather take less money be the
lead of a movie show girl that she can be

612
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:44,090
the center of her own story than be a
very wealthy girlfriend and you know,

613
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,480
cause it doesn't move the needle for me
and a certain point, it's all about it.

614
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:48,180
I also have a little,

615
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,830
I had a little girl when I was 23 so it
kind of shifted my perspective of like,

616
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,260
what do I want her to see on film?

617
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,510
I grew up with Holly hunter and Debra
winger and Diane Keaton and Meg Ryan and

618
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,540
those were events for me when they had
movies coming out on a Friday night.

619
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:07,380
Like that's what I wanted to see
a woman who's figuring it out.

620
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:11,010
Like she doesn't know what the next step
of her life is going to be and I just

621
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:13,740
think that's what drives me every day.
It's why I have a mission,

622
00:36:13,741 --> 00:36:16,320
just to create those parts for myself,
for other women,

623
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,640
for female directors to have that
opportunity to tell women's perspectives.

624
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:24,510
Because if we don't see women's
perspectives, I mean we've,

625
00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:28,650
we've talked about this, women and
women's films treat men differently.

626
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,250
The men treat the women differently.
That's a narrative that's important.

627
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,470
And I would say the same
thing about women of color,

628
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,530
women of different
generations, you know, all,

629
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,950
all different perspectives need to
be represented and it's just enough.

630
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,910
I've had enough of the same people
telling the same dang stories.

631
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,880
Like if we don't,
if we don't see some new perspectives,

632
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:50,910
society can't change and we can't
have different conversations.

633
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,833
And that's how I feel about it.

634
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:57,310
[inaudible]

635
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,850
hi guys,
my name is Brooke Taylor,

636
00:37:10,851 --> 00:37:12,980
which is actually a
character in legally blonde.

637
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,610
It's made me super popular in fifth grade.

638
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:21,240
A question I got asked on my first day
at Google is if I could have lunch with

639
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:24,780
anyone dead or alive, who would it dead
or alive? Who would it be? And I said, oh,

640
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,230
what's that made me even more
popular. So thank you. Um,

641
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,600
thank you very much for
the glamour article.

642
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,240
I'm sure that's been
circulating quite a bit. Um,

643
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,940
you have a lot of ambitious
women in the room who are strong,

644
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,140
not because they're strong women,

645
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:39,540
but because we're women
and that's what women are.

646
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,440
Can you speak a little bit to the article
and just give us some advice and um,

647
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,860
even talk about how it's been received,
if you've gotten any sort of feedback.

648
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:50,390
Yeah. Well, thank you so much for saying
that. I worked really hard on that.

649
00:37:50,391 --> 00:37:53,540
I recall I probably did 30 drafts.
Um,

650
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,300
because I do think it's really
important what she say. But I,

651
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:00,340
for probably like three years ago I was
asked to give a speech at this glamour

652
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:05,350
vet about ambition and women and why
that's considered a negative trait and

653
00:38:05,721 --> 00:38:06,410
women,

654
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,430
and they did this study at Columbia that
identified it as a negative trait in a

655
00:38:10,431 --> 00:38:14,690
coworker, as a female coworker that
she seen as selfish or self serving.

656
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:19,430
And I thought why has that become such a
negative thing? I was always ambitious.

657
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:22,100
Even as a little girl, I didn't know
you were supposed to hide it. Right.

658
00:38:22,101 --> 00:38:26,600
So there's this new Harvard study that
women who are seen as ambitious hide it

659
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,690
if they're single. And I, I really,

660
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:34,130
that just drove me up a wall
cause I thought I run away
from anybody who doesn't

661
00:38:34,131 --> 00:38:38,500
like your ambition a guy or a partner
because it should be encouraged. I mean,

662
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:40,240
and it's not a self serving thing.

663
00:38:40,241 --> 00:38:43,720
It's like most women who are
ambitious have a bigger goal,

664
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,800
were community leaders where
we're strong family leaders,

665
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,860
we can change a lot and
and create a lot of change,

666
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:55,861
but we're stymied because of this
stigma around being ambitious.

667
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,360
I think it's why a lot of women don't
run for office. As we look at women go,

668
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,330
of course she wants to win,
why shouldn't she went?

669
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,420
She's probably going to help us, you
know? And I think we have to change it.

670
00:39:06,421 --> 00:39:09,570
We have started talking about it and I
have had a lot of response from men at

671
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:12,600
big companies who wrote me and said,
I never thought about it that way.

672
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:16,470
And I've heard women talked about
in board rooms and stuff is boy,

673
00:39:16,471 --> 00:39:19,920
she's climbing and she, and he goes, I'm
going to change the conversation. And I,

674
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,620
I just, Oh yeah, they're talking,
you're talking about your daughters,

675
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:24,240
you're talking about your sisters.
You know,

676
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:28,710
we need women were 50% of the population.
We're 50% of the change. Yeah.

677
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,430
You know? Amen. Sister

678
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:35,580
[inaudible]

679
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,610
my question is also for Reese,
it's about big little lies. Okay.

680
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,810
I'm actually born and raised in
Monterey, California. I'm like, God,

681
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:45,980
I know it's rare.

682
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,140
And I wanted to ask you about the decision
to change the setting of that book to

683
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:55,840
Monterey because it feels really
important to the story. So why Monterey?

684
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,670
Um,
why like that story in particular?

685
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,960
Oh, that's, that's a good question. And
because it's set in a Sydney, Australia,

686
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:08,140
the writer said it there and we
decided to Americanize it, um,

687
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,760
because I want it to be in it.

688
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:13,230
[inaudible]

689
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:18,370
so is there sat and I do a
terrible Australian accent and um,

690
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,690
and then Monterey,

691
00:40:19,691 --> 00:40:24,610
because we wanted it to be in a coastal
town that wasn't Los Angeles because

692
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:27,380
that has its own identity.
The writer was, um,

693
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:32,270
David Kelly is from that area and lived
in that area. And, um, the directors,

694
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:36,280
Jamar Valet wanted to use water
as a metaphor for the dark,

695
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:38,410
mysterious unknown that lies inside of us,

696
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,380
the secrets that lie underneath the calm.
And he did,

697
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,430
I don't know if y'all have seen it,

698
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:47,110
but the last episode is you see why
he's always filming the ocean. And, um,

699
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,350
so yeah, it's a metaphor. Yeah. Cool.

700
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,870
Hey guys, thank you for
being here. I'm Katie.

701
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:57,200
So my question is a little
interactive in nature.

702
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,290
It's directed towards you,

703
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:03,770
but I would love it if you could
maybe use John as your student.

704
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,953
Yeah,

705
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,740
so as I'm sure you guys have heard as
well as a lot of us in this room have

706
00:41:11,741 --> 00:41:16,610
experienced dating in New York is
notoriously pretty tough. Gosh,

707
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:20,410
a
girl,

708
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,900
a girl

709
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,960
or a guy could use all the
help that we could get.

710
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:30,961
So I was wondering if you'd be able to
give us all a refresher on the bend and

711
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:32,194
snap.

712
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:42,530
I do the, it's Santa as you.
Okay. You want me to teach?

713
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,480
Yeah. Well first you have to
know why you're doing. Sure.

714
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,420
You're trying to get someone's attention,
right? Motivation. Okay. Right.

715
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,940
So you pretend that you
dropped something on the ground

716
00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:00,370
and then you lean forward
and then you snap.

717
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:11,450
Well done.
Pause.

718
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:12,920
Oh my God.

719
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,510
I follow that question.

720
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,300
Talked a lot about the importance
of having really powerful,

721
00:42:22,301 --> 00:42:25,600
strong female characters are presented
in the narratives we tell on screen.

722
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,610
But there's so much work that goes in,

723
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,510
whether that's on the part of producers
or writers or a cameraman on the

724
00:42:31,511 --> 00:42:34,870
backside of things to make those
characters appear on screen.

725
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,840
What advice do you have for,

726
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,230
there are lots of creatives that are at
Google who outside of our nine to five

727
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,490
are like myself,

728
00:42:42,491 --> 00:42:45,970
are screenwriters or work on the
production side or the editing side.

729
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:50,050
What advice do you have for trying to
get your material in front of the right

730
00:42:50,051 --> 00:42:52,720
eyes in an industry where there
are so many barriers to entry,

731
00:42:52,721 --> 00:42:53,890
especially for women,

732
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:57,040
right?
Do you want to attack to take that?

733
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,000
Um, well, I mean, in my opinion,

734
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,310
the best way to get your
content out there as a,

735
00:43:03,311 --> 00:43:07,990
to have a very original voice and to not
be afraid to tell your specific story

736
00:43:07,991 --> 00:43:12,460
because then it feels very you. Um, and I
think like Reese mentioned, it's such a,

737
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,950
it's a really good time
to be a content creator,

738
00:43:14,951 --> 00:43:19,180
I think because there's so many
platforms. Um, so, you know,

739
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:23,500
I think just not being afraid
to cold email people, send
your material out there.

740
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,490
I mean, I know it's idealistic, but I,

741
00:43:25,491 --> 00:43:29,110
I am a big believer in good material
gets found and gets recognized, you know,

742
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:33,280
and, and like Reese mentioned, there's
not a lot of strong roles for women.

743
00:43:33,281 --> 00:43:37,210
And so if you are,
I hope writing those kinds of characters,

744
00:43:37,211 --> 00:43:39,670
I think it will be
recognized and you know,

745
00:43:39,671 --> 00:43:43,630
from youtube to Amazon to
Netflix, I think, you know,

746
00:43:43,631 --> 00:43:47,500
all of these places have their
own content now and will not,

747
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,450
I don't know if we're at wa or Google,
you know,

748
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,600
wherever you want it to
send your material too.

749
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,970
Yeah. Youtube. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so I
mean that's, that would be my advice.

750
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:00,090
And just start making stuff.
Don't, don't get stuck cane out.

751
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,350
Even if you make a short with your
friends or you get everybody together on a

752
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,990
weekend and make a short film a year,
you're getting stat,

753
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,030
actual film and experience
under your belt. And, um,

754
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,060
there's so many places,

755
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,000
like New York Film Festival has a
new program for female directors.

756
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:19,740
Warner Brothers is doing a pilot program
for female screenwriters that want to

757
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:22,950
be directors that you read a 10
minute short and submit it. Um,

758
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,580
there's a lot of those kinds
of things and um, yeah,

759
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,640
you just start making but
don't get stuck or over.

760
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,713
Um,

761
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:33,061
I don't know.

762
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:36,480
I just see a lot of creative people get
stuck and it's good sometimes to work in

763
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:38,970
a group too because it pushes you
out the door and you have a partner.

764
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:43,010
Yeah. Yeah. And um, when
I was first starting out,

765
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,800
youtube was how I,

766
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:49,600
that's how I got my agent was from making
sketches with buddies, you know? Yeah.

767
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,390
That's great. Yeah. Let
me think. It is, I mean,

768
00:44:52,391 --> 00:44:57,230
even though the statistics are terrible
about being a female director, um,

769
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,830
I do think because of
people like Lena Dunham,

770
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:04,600
people think that young women
might be great at what they do.

771
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,450
And I think she's paved the way
for a lot of young women too,

772
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,580
for people to recognize. I do think
it is in some ways a good time to be,

773
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:16,180
you know, a female content
creator. Great. Thank you.

774
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,370
Cool.

775
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:21,580
I look down and look up and there's 5
million people asking questions again. Uh,

776
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:22,800
yeah. Molly. Hey. Hi.

777
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:27,620
Um, hi. I'm Molly. I'm super excited that
you're here. All of you. Thank you. Um,

778
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:30,590
so my question is for Reese, but
I think you can, Haley, I'm Don.

779
00:45:30,591 --> 00:45:33,980
You can both answer it. Rick, you've
done so many different movies,

780
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:38,870
different genres, production company,
draper, James. Um, what's next?

781
00:45:38,871 --> 00:45:42,350
What is one thing you'd love to do? And
John and Hailey, what's next for you?

782
00:45:42,351 --> 00:45:45,290
What's your next big projects?
I'm thinking we would like
to do outside the box.

783
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:47,500
Um,

784
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,950
well I just extended my production coming
in to digital and mobile programming,

785
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:54,640
so I'm going to be capable of making more
short form content because I do think

786
00:45:54,641 --> 00:45:58,960
that's the first step to finding new
female voices. That's great. Yeah.

787
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,700
I mean, I'm going to, I don't know if
I'm doing anything outside the box.

788
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:06,040
I'm definitely going to keep trying to
do what I did here and make you know,

789
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:07,780
comedies.
Um,

790
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:12,640
which seem to be fewer and further between
now and put women at the forefront of

791
00:46:12,641 --> 00:46:15,250
them. So yeah, more of the same.

792
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,940
Um, I'm working on a show
with my writing partner with,

793
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:23,270
for comedy central at the moment.
And then I'd like to, you know,

794
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:27,380
like to do more good movies,
man. Keep working. I'll be nice.

795
00:46:27,381 --> 00:46:32,250
And this is my first really. So our
first. Yup. Yup. Thank you. Yeah.

796
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,700
Cool. All and we have time
for a few more questions.

797
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,120
Hi. Thank you all for being here. Um,

798
00:46:37,121 --> 00:46:41,560
so today there was an article in the New
York Times about rotten tomatoes. Um,

799
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:46,210
basically there's a bunch of people in
Hollywood who are planning like putting

800
00:46:46,211 --> 00:46:49,450
blame on rotten tomatoes for
movies, not doing well. Um,

801
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:53,350
basically saying when these reviews
come out and they get like an aggregated

802
00:46:53,351 --> 00:46:57,910
score that kind of like predicts movies
not doing well at the box office. If,

803
00:46:57,911 --> 00:46:58,151
you know,

804
00:46:58,151 --> 00:47:01,930
the critics are saying it's bad and
it's surfaced on different sites like

805
00:47:01,931 --> 00:47:04,450
Fandango or even when you
search iMovie on Google,

806
00:47:04,451 --> 00:47:08,560
which is relevant to all of us here.
So I'm curious what you think about that.

807
00:47:08,561 --> 00:47:10,810
If that really is
something that's relevant,

808
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:13,600
if that's something we can lay blame for.

809
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:19,160
I know about blame. I mean I think rotten
tomatoes is owned by Fandango, I think.

810
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:23,770
Yeah. So you know, it's one in
the same. Um, I, you know, for me,

811
00:47:23,771 --> 00:47:28,670
I think it's a part of the equation, but
I don't think the actual audience, um,

812
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:33,520
cares that much about it. And I
think rotten tomatoes is largely men.

813
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:37,510
So we made a movie about a woman and uh,

814
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:40,810
so I don't know that they're
necessarily, I don't know. For me,

815
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:44,100
I wouldn't look at it. I, but I
wouldn't judge a film by it, but I,

816
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:48,730
I'm am aware that, you know, it is a
big part of things. I think, I mean,

817
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,610
correct me if I'm wrong, but I think
more men look at the scores too.

818
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:54,270
Like my boyfriend would say,
well, that huddle and I'd be like,

819
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:57,750
care if game of fine art.
Yeah.

820
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,420
I think it does have an
effect in certain capacities.

821
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,640
If there's something people really
want to say, they're going to see it,

822
00:48:02,641 --> 00:48:06,570
but I think it can drive a movie that
might be on a bubble for two people

823
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:11,130
waiting to later. And you know,
certain movies like this, like we are,

824
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:14,100
we're coming on the box office. We need
people to show up and see the movie.

825
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,550
And if you want more movies
with women at the center,

826
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:21,090
you have to shop and buy the tickets.
Or it's just, it's hard. It's,

827
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,480
you know, it's data that the
studios look at and they think, oh,

828
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:28,290
well that one didn't do good in this wind
in it. So they don't make more of them.

829
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:31,710
Um, it's just a numbers
game. But I will say we need,

830
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,800
Ann Patchett wrote this
amazing essay about like,

831
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:39,240
don't let other people make your
judgments for you. You know, don't,

832
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:44,380
don't you have your own opinions
about art and books and music.

833
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:48,570
I hate, oh, I might, I'm
fortunate on son. He'll be like,
well, I heard it's not good.

834
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,300
And I'm like, yeah, but
who did you hear it from?

835
00:48:51,301 --> 00:48:54,270
And maybe you guys don't have the same
taste and maybe you're not interested in

836
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:58,200
the same thing. So I really encourage
people out there form your own opinions,

837
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,390
have something to talk
about, you know, see movies.

838
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,960
I loved seeing movies and
having a different opinion
than other people because

839
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,300
that's what makes you you.
Um,

840
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:10,170
and we've taken that out a little bit
by reading too many reviews or listening

841
00:49:10,171 --> 00:49:12,540
to too many people's opinions
on Twitter and stuff.

842
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:18,260
I think makes probably two more questions.
Yeah.

843
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,090
Hi, I'm Chloe. Um,

844
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,720
so we'll just talk about like this
quote unquote strong female character.

845
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:28,320
It got me thinking. Um, this
is a question mostly for Reese,

846
00:49:28,321 --> 00:49:30,930
but I would love to hear how these
thoughts too, if you have any. Um,

847
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,030
obviously I love legally blonde,

848
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:37,710
but one of my favorite movies of yours
actually is freeway. Um, and it got to be,

849
00:49:37,711 --> 00:49:41,860
you know, I was thinking about
the, how a lot of people, um,

850
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:46,080
see women in action movies and how
just a woman like punching someone or

851
00:49:46,081 --> 00:49:49,080
shooting someone can be like just enough
for people to give them the strong

852
00:49:49,081 --> 00:49:51,930
female character label. But,
um, obviously there's like,

853
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,830
you've been doing so many romcoms and
comedies and like big little lies.

854
00:49:55,831 --> 00:50:00,831
And I was wondering what you think of
the difference in value of a strong woman

855
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:06,410
in a comedy versus like a family drama
versus an action movie like freeway or

856
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:10,470
like some more recent ones
like Mad Max and atomic blonde.

857
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:11,780
Yeah,

858
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:16,780
I mean all of those genres are great
and I think more than like looking for

859
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,550
strong or weak.
And look,

860
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:22,970
I answered that question because I
think of myself as a strong person,

861
00:50:22,971 --> 00:50:27,680
but like I'm just looking for complexity
because women just aren't good bad.

862
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,310
There's this whole rainbow of
other things in between, you know,

863
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:36,700
they're complex and confused and I'm
contemplating things and some of them are

864
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:40,490
just plain strange,
all know,

865
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:43,940
like I want to see every color of the
rainbow. I don't want to just see like,

866
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,050
I dunno.

867
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:48,830
Sometimes I think you just get watered
down and it gets watered down because

868
00:50:48,831 --> 00:50:52,370
they don't understand the complexity of
the female brain because you're not a

869
00:50:52,371 --> 00:50:56,900
woman writing it. So, um, yeah.
What do you think? I don't know.

870
00:50:56,901 --> 00:51:00,530
I mean, I don't see a ton of action
movies. It just not, you know,

871
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:03,570
as an audience member,
my favorite John Rhe um,

872
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:07,040
but I do think sometimes the women in
those movies are considered strong because

873
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:10,190
they're acting like men.
Um, and you know, for me,

874
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:11,720
the characters that have meant most to me,

875
00:51:11,721 --> 00:51:15,260
the ones that resist portrayed are strong
because they're complex and they're

876
00:51:15,261 --> 00:51:17,540
real, you know, there's something
real about them. I don't,

877
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,000
I don't think you see a woman in an
action movie and think that's me. Yeah.

878
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,260
Just like her and atomic blonde.
Um,

879
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,080
even though it can be super entertaining
and great to watch, you know,

880
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:30,860
for me it's the relatability of a
character that is that, you know,

881
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:35,150
if you see Reese on screen being strong
and she's going through separation,

882
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:37,670
that might give you, you know,
if I can do it too, you know,

883
00:51:37,671 --> 00:51:40,910
and I think that's for me where
the strength comes from onscreen.

884
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:47,330
Thanks John. You have a favorite
genre, favorite genre, genre, you know,

885
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:51,740
the right answer really.
I, I'm not really into, uh,

886
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,690
like superhero action movies.

887
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,890
I do like smaller stories
typically. Yeah. Interesting.

888
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:02,670
But it drama or comedy and done.
I just finished Ozark.

889
00:52:02,671 --> 00:52:06,660
I thought that was real good.
Really good. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like,

890
00:52:06,661 --> 00:52:11,400
that's cool. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. So
we have time for one more question here.

891
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:15,310
All right. So first of all,
thank you. Cruel intentions,
favorite movie of all time.

892
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:19,690
Um, so the best part of working at
Google is our colleagues are incredible.

893
00:52:19,691 --> 00:52:24,160
And half of my meetings I'm like just
in awe at how talented the people are in

894
00:52:24,161 --> 00:52:28,540
the room. So I was curious about
who you guys have worked with,

895
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:32,620
where you've had that moment of like,
oh my God, this person is so impressive.

896
00:52:32,621 --> 00:52:37,330
Like who's the most impressive actor, uh,
that you've worked with outside of John,

897
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,193
obviously?

898
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:43,803
Well,

899
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,880
Gosh, I've worked with some really
amazing talented people, but the, yeah,

900
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:55,310
isn't it great that you can be
around people and you're like, wow.

901
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:58,760
And the great thing about movies
is it's a collaborative experience.

902
00:52:58,761 --> 00:53:01,310
So every movie,
this movie has amazing,

903
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:04,070
we had so much fun and I
loved working on these people.

904
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,500
I'm trying to think of like one
person. I was like, oh my God,

905
00:53:06,501 --> 00:53:07,820
this person is so incredible.

906
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,900
Maybe like super intimidated
when you found out they were,

907
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:16,300
oh, I ain't got to work with Jack
Nicholson once and I was pretty tight.

908
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:19,050
I can barely speak.
I mean,

909
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,360
it got to his clothes off and he was
standing there and I just kept inching and

910
00:53:22,361 --> 00:53:25,060
just like, he goes, hey
kid, get out of my closeup

911
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,360
because I'm a leaner. I tie.
I tended to lean on people.

912
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:35,220
I like get away.
Um,

913
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:38,910
but I was struck about that.
That was pretty cool. Yeah,

914
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:40,720
that's, that's flooding John, to have you,

915
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:43,270
I guess on Snl till you've had a
lot of people come through it. Like,

916
00:53:43,271 --> 00:53:47,910
have you experienced anything similar?
Um, well, I mean, obviously this movie,

917
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:52,810
getting to work with these
lanes and Nancy, um, at SNL,

918
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,593
right.

919
00:53:55,810 --> 00:54:00,450
Specifically at Larry David
is my comedy hero. So,

920
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,780
uh, getting to work with him, it
was pretty awesome. I see the movie,

921
00:54:03,781 --> 00:54:06,210
it comes out in theaters tomorrow,
September 8th.

922
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,610
Excellent question.
Yes,

923
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:14,390
Haley. Thank you guys. Wonderful.

924
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:16,790
God help you.
