1
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,910
Welcome to talks at Google.

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,960
I'm Shane Peltzman and today we welcome
the cast Bohemian rhapsody Gwilym Lee

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,130
Rommy Malick and Joe Mozilla

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,750
[inaudible].

5
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,440
Hello Buddy.
How's it going?

6
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,480
Yeah. Um, cool. So, uh,

7
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,480
congratulations guys on awesome film.
I saw the from yesterday and loved it.

8
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,201
A lot of the people here,

9
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:51,810
I think what we're able to see it last
night at the screening. Did you really?

10
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,310
Oh yeah. Oh, I am Mike.

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,690
Uh, we happen women screened at
many times, so this is one of them,

12
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,770
one of the first audiences in America and
for that matter the world to see this,

13
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:11,520
which is really cool. Thank you guys for
watching. Yeah, it was, it was fantastic.

14
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:15,060
And what I actually just heard was
that, uh, and tell me if I'm wrong,

15
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:16,710
but day one of shooting,

16
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:20,280
you guys were thrown into Wembley
and shooting the live aid concert.

17
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,820
Is that right? Yeah, I mean,
no, no. Wembley is specifically,

18
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:25,920
it doesn't actually exist
in its old shape anymore.

19
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:30,921
So it was actually a replica full size
replica in an air field in the north of

20
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:33,630
London.
Not particularly glamorous,

21
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,640
but it was a pretty full way
to start a film near Luton,

22
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,540
near Luton metropolis.
It's a really lovely spot.

23
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,010
The trip have you go back in the,
in the UK. But yeah, it was a,

24
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,030
it was a pretty fun way to
start. Um, pretty terrifying.

25
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:54,590
But it was great because you know, you,
you sink or swim in that situation, right?

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,360
You've just got to, you've
got to go for it. Yeah.

27
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,680
Take your time and be cautious about it.

28
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,220
It just jump on in and hope for the best.

29
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:01,560
Really.

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,560
The first seven weeks were dedicated to
live aid because we were brought in six

31
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:11,810
weeks early to do band rehearsals and
to learn this 20 minutes set that we had

32
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:15,860
to get down in its entirety.
Um, and it was very precise.

33
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:19,850
It was actually for this one
concert because the actual
footage is so famous and

34
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:24,410
everyone can see it. Um, we wanted
to make sure that we were exact.

35
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,560
So if like John's head turned
to the left at an exact moment,

36
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,820
I had to do it at that moment. And, you
know, especially for Rami, he had to,

37
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,020
you know,
Freddie is just going nuts.

38
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,150
He had to have all of that down. And
so that's why we, uh, but it was great.

39
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:41,090
It was great way to bond. It was a great
way to come together as a band. Um,

40
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,740
Polly bander movement coach, uh, she was
instrumental in, in, you know, our morale

41
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,420
and are coming together and our movements.
So he was really amazing. There's,

42
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,650
there's, uh, uh,

43
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:56,760
his hammer to fall where Freddy's really
feeling himself and he's doing some

44
00:02:56,761 --> 00:03:00,220
things with his body that I just can,
you could never

45
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,881
replicate.

46
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:05,770
And when you lose a shot that on the
third day we would go song by song.

47
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:09,460
Monday we did Bohemian rhapsody,
Tuesday Radio Gaga,

48
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,280
Wednesday we did have an
AFOL so on and so forth.

49
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,650
And so we would jump into the middle of
a song and I had been rehearsing this

50
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:21,190
over and over and there were twists
and things I knew I could do,

51
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:25,840
but I wasn't able to do them.
Uh, on Wednesday, on Friday,

52
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:29,740
I could do them because that's when
we ran the entire concert together.

53
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:34,660
And he realized, Oh shit, he's
riding off of pure adrenaline.

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,940
And once that adrenaline kicks in,

55
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,840
you're superman and damn
does that feel good?

56
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:45,841
Cause acting's a pretty great high in
and of itself being out there and uh,

57
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,980
having the hype of that rock star moment,
it's on another level,

58
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,890
the adrenaline adrenaline coursing
through your body and it's,

59
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,230
it's like a drug. You realize what
they all want to go out afterwards,

60
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,900
not let the night of her end. It was
sort of funny, too sweet. Like, you know,

61
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,120
when we were doing this band rehearsals,
um,

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,180
Polly would have us do all
these like sort of theater.

63
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:12,940
He exercises that maybe felt a little
silly or a little foolish like we had to

64
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:15,520
touch in before we would
start stuff or whatever.

65
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:19,330
But then when we got to that moment
where it's literally the first shot is us

66
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:20,650
coming out onto that stage,

67
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,050
we were all like obsessively been
like no touch and touch them.

68
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:24,440
We've got to do all the things we started.

69
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,630
So it was funny how like it
translated and suddenly we needed,

70
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,890
we needed that feeling of the energy
coming together before going out on that

71
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:36,370
stage and feeling like we can, you know,
live up to what we were rehearsing.

72
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,700
Freddie had some outrageous
moves as well in that,

73
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,780
in that concert that happens
forbit theirs, it's a PG 13,

74
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:46,780
so we couldn't actually include
this move and film, but as a,

75
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:51,010
there's a bit where in front of 70,000
people, he takes his microphone standard,

76
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,750
essentially just jokes off.

77
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,480
And it's like the brazen confidence
of the man to do that in that moment.

78
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:01,870
It was just sums him up beautifully.
And then,

79
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,990
and then immediately
afterwards he just turns on,

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,930
shows his ass to the entire crowd.
Only Freddy can get away with that

81
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,020
just now.
Just

82
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,950
really a movement coach Paulie, she'd
be like, all right, five, six, seven,

83
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,770
eight and you to twist, twist. Um,

84
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,760
I dosey doe wink, wink, wink,

85
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,120
given the [inaudible] excuse me.

86
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,310
It was like, look at him. He's
performing a sexual act. He's done.

87
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,300
You just gave you his thing.
And now he turns around and says my turn.

88
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,480
Um, yeah. Wanted to ask
about [inaudible]. I know,

89
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,130
I know it's crazy to say this,
but only Freddy could get away with that.

90
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,910
Unfortunately,
we didn't,

91
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,530
you guys didn't have the benefit of
having Freddy around to, you know,

92
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,070
to use it as a source for
information. And, uh, I know

93
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,720
Brian May was a producer on the
film, Roger Taylor and two beach. Um,

94
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,090
how involved were they, uh, in
terms of the films creation,

95
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:08,180
but also working with you guys directly
and, you know, how much did you,

96
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,420
were you able to take from them and
their experiences? They were amazing,

97
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,600
so generous with their
time. Um, you know, they,

98
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:19,350
they shared stories with us and, and
uh, memories and things, but, um,

99
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,730
but equally they were quite
adamant that we should, uh,

100
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,610
tell the story a warts and all.

101
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,670
And so they often came on set during
the live performance sequences cause I

102
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:33,780
think that's their music
producers on the film.

103
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:37,280
So that's where they felt their
expertise as most useful. Uh,

104
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,500
but when it came to doing the
more intimate acted scenes,

105
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:44,530
I suppose the dramatic scenes that they
left us to our own devices to give us

106
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:48,120
space to explore that
properly. Um, but yeah,

107
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,760
I mean from my point of view, having,
being able to meet the man died,

108
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,210
playing to be able to spend time with
him intimately to get to know him is just

109
00:06:57,211 --> 00:07:01,170
the best. I mean, it sounds crass
to call it research, but you know,

110
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,440
you to spend time with someone
as a human being as an equal,

111
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:08,220
you really absorb something of their,
of their soul I think.

112
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,060
So that was the greatest opportunity
of all, I think for me. What,

113
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:18,020
what was one of the notes that Brian
May gave you on a limeade? Yeah, yeah,

114
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,740
yeah. So, so live aid, like we say, it was
the one moment being such an iconic gig.

115
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:23,574
It was the one,

116
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,930
the one part of the film that we really
wanted to capture in absolute detail. So,

117
00:07:27,931 --> 00:07:31,290
so we rehearsed for ages to
get this right. And, um, he,

118
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,150
Brian was on set when we did the
first rehearsal onset and source.

119
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,550
Do a run through. And, uh, he came up
to me afterwards and he was like, yes,

120
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,370
it was very good, very good, very
accurate if you've got that down,

121
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:46,650
but just don't forget all a Rockstar

122
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,770
[inaudible]

123
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,170
it comes a certain amount of ego.

124
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,540
I was a really good note because what
I understood that to me and it's like,

125
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,980
you know,
we can,

126
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,510
we can mimic things in absolute
detail as much as we want vocally,

127
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:03,610
physically and all that kind of stuff.

128
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:08,270
But ultimately we've got to fill that
with our own sense of adrenaline and our

129
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:11,390
own sense of kind of energy and
joy and all that kind of thing.

130
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:15,920
So it was a really useful thing to hear
early on and to take with us throughout

131
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:16,570
the film.

132
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,710
Yeah. I also wanted to ask, um,

133
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,120
not only obviously the members of
Queen and then the manager, but I'm,

134
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,260
Mike Myers has a very unique
role in queens history,

135
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:31,180
especially with generations that came up.
Uh, you know, after Freddy's death, um,

136
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,100
and Mike Myers was cameo in the film.

137
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:37,750
I wondered what it was like to meet Mike
Meyers in that context and talk to him

138
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:41,500
about his, his role in
Queens, kind of rock history.

139
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,020
Did you guys know it was Mike
Meyers in the foam? The Ray Foster,

140
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:50,220
the record were record executive.
That's Mike Myers. So my neighbor,

141
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,440
you know when he's talking about,
uh,

142
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,130
no one ever banging
their heads too rhapsody,

143
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,350
it's never going to work. No one
will ever bang their heads. Yeah,

144
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,220
he showed up like that too.

145
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,540
He showed up in character
fully in character and to
the pain, the fear, the week,

146
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,530
the whole thing. And so we also
had that same double take rook

147
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,730
and it was just, man, I'm working
with. That was awesome because there's,

148
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,890
there's like a line in the script,

149
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:24,530
it's not in the movie where he just
literally says, how is Japan? Right.

150
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,810
That's not funny.
Just how is Japan?

151
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,450
And when he delivered it
and we were all like crying,

152
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,950
there's like five months we were all going
to each other. So I'll just jump back,

153
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,560
just figure it out. It's just like, but
so it was the mix of like this like,

154
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,300
I dunno, this innate sense of comedy,
but at the same time he cared.

155
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:48,720
So like you can come on and do like a
little cameo in something and be like,

156
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,310
okay,
whatever paycheck at me out of here.

157
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,150
He cared so deeply about
getting it perfect.

158
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,370
He was such a pro, he ev every word
that he said he wanted it to be. Right.

159
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:03,060
And just to see that level
of professionalism and
care that he took with it,

160
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:07,200
it was one of the first things we
shot. It made us kind of go, well,

161
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,670
we definitely have to at least match that.

162
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,600
Yeah. And so it was, it was
awesome. Awesome for it with them.

163
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,520
It was one of the most enjoyable days,
a few days at work that the,

164
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,690
there's a bit at the end, uh, of uh,

165
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,230
one of his scenes where Freddy throws
a rock through the window and then, uh,

166
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,160
he goes to see who's throwing this walk
rock and sees us kind of giving them the

167
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:27,630
finger from dumb down below.

168
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,380
And we were filming this in a quite
well heeled part of north London,

169
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,730
not too far from where I live.

170
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:36,790
Like I've got a lot of friends in the
area and it turned into just this like

171
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,230
hurling abuse each other and
the camera's just kept rolling.

172
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,100
There was nothing scripted.

173
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:46,101
So it's just Mike Myers leaning out
of a window just being so abusive.

174
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,363
So horrific

175
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,620
to the point where like there
were some people in the street,

176
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:56,770
there was a mother and her child
just like shepherding her child away.

177
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,450
Don't miss to this horrible man.
But honestly like, you know,

178
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,590
sat behind the camera for an eyeline
for Mike Myers, just like giggling,

179
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,500
like Giddy with excitement that
we're in this moment with this. I, I,

180
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,990
he's a legend in my eyes. I've
always loved him. So yeah,

181
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:16,060
the opportunity to be working
with him was awesome. Yeah,

182
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:21,200
it was this room do bluebird calling
each other twice and where anchor and you

183
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:26,130
know, I have one point I go, you know,
to shove this up your ass. And he goes,

184
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,960
I want a meal,
not a snack.

185
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,430
And it's like,
you know,

186
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,350
you know on SNL when you watch everybody
break and you think, is that real?

187
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:40,200
Is it game with him? It's,
we're breaking the whole time.
It's a, sorry. So, so sorry.

188
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,740
So sorry. Um, yeah, it was
interesting Bohemian rhapsody. I

189
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,720
actually went back to number two on
the charts after Wayne's world. Um,

190
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,450
and I wouldn't be surprised if for some
where things happen happens after this

191
00:11:52,451 --> 00:11:54,190
phone is released.
I'm going to be cause

192
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,700
working with the, I just wanted
to hear more about, I guess your,

193
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,240
your guys' experience,
um,

194
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,420
how you came to queen and what it
was like coming into this film.

195
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:05,680
It was honoring these rock stars
because I think some bio pics, um,

196
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,150
can make it kind of cheesy,
the history and kind of superfluous.

197
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,910
And I think this film did a really good
job of honoring the music in a really

198
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,970
beautiful way.
Um,

199
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,160
uh, what it was like for like our first
experience with queen like a, yeah, yeah.

200
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:20,870
For that. Yeah. It sort of feel,

201
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:24,500
I mean like sort of growing up in the 90s
it was like listening to a lot of like

202
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,310
nirvana and Pearl Jam and like,
you know,

203
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,790
music serious and queen.

204
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:36,050
It's like so much fun and so
boisterous and like sort of crazy.

205
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:40,160
Like as a youth I felt like, oh it's
just like a gimmick or something or like,

206
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,040
you know, whatever. That's not my
kind of music mine, Mine's real.

207
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,430
They don't understand the struggle.
And then sort of like as I got older,

208
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:50,990
like into college I think is when I
really liked started listening to the,

209
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,680
to what they were really doing and
started seeing their genius and started

210
00:12:54,681 --> 00:12:58,370
seeing how they cross all
these Sharas and they,

211
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,450
their music is timeless and it just spans
decades for a reason and it's just so

212
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,920
intricate and,
and like,

213
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,510
and I think that sort of my love of
queen has just gone like this throw in my

214
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:13,340
life to the point where now like it's
off the charts because like learning how

215
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:16,820
to play the songs,
you get a deeper appreciation for it.

216
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,970
Learning why they were written,
learning how they collaborated.

217
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,290
It's so insane.
But like once we were done shooting,

218
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,670
like I went on a road trip and all I
listened to was queen. Like I was like,

219
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,520
what didn't we cover?
I want to know those now too.

220
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:35,390
And it's sort of wild how like we
didn't get sick of it and just be

221
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,230
the more the risk is cause
cause the music is so universal.

222
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:43,130
You hear everywhere on the
radio, TV, sports, stadiums.

223
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:46,940
Every time you go and see
a game, um, you kind of,

224
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:49,850
there's a risk of taking
it all for granted and use
it. Oh yeah, there's queen.

225
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,690
Okay cool.

226
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,740
But actually to really sit
down and consider what it
must've been like to write

227
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:58,580
a song like beaming rhapsody, which
is like, you know, it was so unique,

228
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,110
so revolutionary at the time to think
what imagination it took to come up with a

229
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:06,910
song like that is a, is
quite something. Um, and,

230
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,490
and you'd see that with all of
the songs and fill cause it's a,

231
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,810
it's an origins foam in that sense.

232
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:15,260
You see the origins and making of all
these songs, which we do take for granted.

233
00:14:15,261 --> 00:14:20,250
It's so Bohemian rhapsody, when you look
at the tape that they recorded it, it's,

234
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,470
it's clear that's how many
overdubs they put on it.

235
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,810
And at the risk of losing the entire song,
they kept going and kept going.

236
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,290
And if you go too far,
the whole thing will be raised.

237
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,220
But they just kept pushing the
limits. And, and in this movie,

238
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:41,100
the coolest thing is, you know,
we have archival, uh, you know,

239
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:45,470
obviously footage, but the art department
can show you stuff that you know,

240
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,510
that has a, you know, the original lyrics
on it and just just says Freddy's thing.

241
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,160
And the band members

242
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,160
just kept going. All right, we're
back to Freddy's thing today.

243
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,250
Galileo's again and whatnot. W w what
are we going to call it? Who knows?

244
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:05,640
It's Freddy's thing and its
insights to that. Making a,

245
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:09,470
all these songs. It's fascinating.
And this is one band where,

246
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:14,800
uh, you know, all four
members write song. Uh,

247
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,020
it's rare when that happens that the level
of collaboration that existed and you

248
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:22,400
know, some of the songs,
it's like you said,

249
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:26,520
they're iconic and they feel
poppy at times, you know,

250
00:15:26,521 --> 00:15:31,040
the very universal, but some of the
messages in, in these songs, I mean,

251
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:36,020
you can even look at the three stages
of man and we will rock you. And, uh,

252
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,351
you know,

253
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:40,850
Brian May walked us through how is the
writing process on that at Abbey road

254
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:44,510
studios before we shot kind
of mind blowing moment for us.

255
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,770
But the guy is such a deep thinker.
He's, he's Dr. Ryan May, uh,

256
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,760
an astrophysicist and you know,

257
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:56,180
he's a song called 39 that if you listen,

258
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,960
you'd think it was a folk song.
But if you dig deep into it,

259
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:04,460
it's about time travel and it will,
it's a very,

260
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:05,810
very complex thing.
I had to,

261
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,950
I had to listen to it about five
times before I was like, oh, no way.

262
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,490
Uh,

263
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,850
all of the songs do that. I
mean Radio Gaga, you know,

264
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:19,130
I sit alone and watch your,
how does that I,

265
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,990
the lyrics go I guess at two

266
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,420
teenage nights.
Yes.

267
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,783
But it

268
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,590
wasn't an angel. Just one
more question, but if I'm,

269
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,570
we're going to take audience questions
as well. So if everyone wants the lineup,

270
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,380
Kevin, over your eyes, a mic and you
guys can get going right over here.

271
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,680
Don't be bashful. Get in line.
Um, I also wanted to ask, uh,

272
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,550
you kind of mentioned like you had this
fear like maybe I'll get sick of queen

273
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:55,680
songs and of course like the
opposite in fact happened. Um,

274
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,480
you guys were in such tight quarters
filming all these scenes together,

275
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,020
so many locations.
You guys essentially became a band.

276
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,820
And now not only during the
process of filming the movie,

277
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:06,160
but now you're a press junket.
You guys are literally touring together.

278
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:09,370
So I wanted to ask you what that
experience has been like. Honestly,

279
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:12,880
can't stand the sight of these guys.
I'm just so sick of, no, no, no.

280
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,030
We became like a family.
We already did.

281
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,710
Like it was such an important part of
the story that we wanted to capture as

282
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:23,740
like that rapport that they had, that
queen referred to themselves as a family.

283
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,850
It's because of the mother,
the mother ship. And uh,

284
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,060
so it was really important for us
to catch that. And we just, part of,

285
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,070
part of that was six weeks of rehearsals
before we started filming and did like

286
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:40,160
doing this live aid sequence and just
spending every hour of every day with each

287
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:44,960
other and you know, where possible while
we were playing to backing tracks, uh,

288
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,000
on set when it came to the filming,
we try and plug in when we could and,

289
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,760
and like play together as a band to,

290
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,550
to have to know what it's like
to have to listen to each other,

291
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:56,650
tap to keep time and all that
kind of thing. And you know, we,

292
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:01,710
we went out and hung out purely as a
matter of research and development.

293
00:18:03,231 --> 00:18:04,810
Okay.
Um,

294
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,340
we went on vacation together
when we were done filming. Yeah.

295
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,190
That's what happened. Like when we
went to Scotland and then to Paris,

296
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,530
like it was just like we
didn't want it to end.

297
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,790
Um, and that's, I think kind of,
I've never done that before. Yeah.

298
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,690
We all came together since.
Okay.

299
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,420
It'll pay the other day,
two days ago in Miami.

300
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,200
Yeah. Yeah. This is
the craziest thing. Um,

301
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:33,840
I don't think we've any of
you done a press tour like
this before? Yeah. Sort of.

302
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,683
Yeah.
Yeah,

303
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,750
yeah.
This is the best one ever.

304
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,560
But you're, you know, you're in a
city, a different city every day,

305
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:47,480
sometimes two cities in a day.

306
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:52,570
And you realize when a rock star comes
out in a city like this and says,

307
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,800
uh, you know, thank you, Cleveland,

308
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,280
you get Y if they may have misspoke,

309
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,200
because if you lose all sense.

310
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,310
MMM.

311
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,460
But yeah, it's, it's the,
the, the thing with us,

312
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,970
I'm all over the place here,
but the thing was as usual,

313
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,840
the thing with us is we had
this deep and meaningful,

314
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,780
full goodbye at the end and it was,
you know,

315
00:19:20,781 --> 00:19:24,560
it was pretty heart wrenching
and emotional and then
we realized how ludicrous

316
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:29,561
it was because we spend so much
time together is this movie was,

317
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,190
uh,

318
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:36,000
it was one of the greatest joys of my
life and I think collectively hours to,

319
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,050
to get to portray this band and for me,

320
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:41,960
this man is everything to me now,

321
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:46,970
but the relationship that we got out
of it is, is just a special to me.

322
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,090
That's awesome. All right, cool. We're
going to take some ice questions. Um,

323
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:52,951
first of all,

324
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:55,680
these must be really long days for
you is you're promoting the movie.

325
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:57,810
So thank you for coming in.
Thank you.

326
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,430
I'm imagining the audition process
must've been kind of weird or different

327
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:06,270
because it's so physical and there's
the musical element to it. Um,

328
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,460
was it just a normal
addition where you just like,

329
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,540
I'm kind of curious like what the process
was like given all the things that

330
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,640
they would require of you
for making this movie?

331
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,640
It was slightly different for
all of us. I see. I mean, uh, I,

332
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:25,470
I a different way into it, but I was, I
was expecting to have like a guitar test.

333
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,620
That's the least. Right. That's
the least I should expect.

334
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,410
So light you for weeks leading up to what?

335
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,950
While all this was like in the,
in the balance,

336
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:39,951
I was just madly practicing guitar and I
paid for us some lessons just on my own

337
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:44,290
with a teacher and prepared myself
for a test that never came. Yeah.

338
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,053
MMM.

339
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,280
And then all of a sudden you
find yourself in a rehearsal

340
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,480
room going, okay, right.
Just get to work. So it was,

341
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,590
I think maybe, I don't know why
they didn't do that, but maybe they,

342
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,490
because we had hand doubles
on set everyday. So I think
maybe they thought, well,

343
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,140
if he can play it, great, if you can't,
we'll find a way around that. Um,

344
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,670
I didn't want him to get the right
actors for the park for anything,

345
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,560
but thankfully you've got to the end of
the shoot and never used those handles.

346
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,430
So, uh, there's quite a,

347
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,540
it became a point of pride for all
of us are real and we felt a sense of

348
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,470
achievement at the end of it.

349
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:21,550
When these poor guys who'd been on set
every day easiest job in the entire,

350
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:27,900
uh, didn't have to bring Brian
Mason know. Um, yeah, for me,

351
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,990
uh, I, I met the producers at one point,

352
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:35,160
they asked me if I could play guitar and
I was just like a not as good as queen.

353
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,910
And they were like, oh, okay. And then I
was like, well, that's not happening. Uh,

354
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,220
I sort of moved on with my life,

355
00:21:41,221 --> 00:21:44,800
but then like a month later I got a call
saying that like, you know, try this.

356
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,520
I think you really look like
John Deacon the bassist.

357
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,700
So I googled him and I was like,
oh no,

358
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,120
I have to ask my mom
some serious questions.

359
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:01,500
Were you in England in 1983? Yeah,
I mean just looks so much like me.

360
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,970
And so I the same thing.

361
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:05,850
I immediately like went to one of my
best friends was like gimme your Bass

362
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,610
Guitar. And I tried to learn how
to play a couple of the songs. Um,

363
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,130
but then all they wanted me to do,
they just,

364
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:14,340
they just showed me this interview
with John Deacon. They said, hey,

365
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:17,910
can you just like show us your
accent, English accent. Um,

366
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,460
and it's just like a little interview we
did where he's like riding around in a

367
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:23,460
bus. So I just looked at
it on my phone that day.

368
00:22:23,461 --> 00:22:26,610
I just went out and drove around a parking
lot and kind of match the light of it

369
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,650
and just like while I was driving,

370
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,880
so I just took a selfie video
of me like doing the interview,

371
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:38,610
like into like the phone and then just
watch and I'm just like, I should,

372
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:41,340
I was pretty good. I'm going to send
that and I just like send it off to them.

373
00:22:41,341 --> 00:22:44,280
And then before I knew what they were
like, we don't need anything else.

374
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,010
And it still took like a,

375
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:49,260
for like two months before I found out
I got the job queen was actually playing

376
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:51,540
in Brooklyn where I was living in.
I was like,

377
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:55,410
should I go to the concert and like hold
up a sign says put me in your movie.

378
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,770
And then the next day I
found out I got the job.

379
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,750
So it was one of those sort of fun,
fun way.

380
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:04,620
And it's bunk as how much you look like
in like one of the first times we all

381
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:09,450
were in costume and makeup was to do a
photo shoot to the props needed to make

382
00:23:09,451 --> 00:23:12,300
up a version of the greatest
hits with our faces on it

383
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,700
and sound like we all
turn up to me with a wig.

384
00:23:14,701 --> 00:23:17,850
You with the mustache and a wig
band with a wig. Joe just turned up

385
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,560
like this is pretty much maybe how a
shave well, yeah. And it's like, Oh,

386
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,020
it's John Deacon. Yeah. And um, they did
give me a perm. That was fun. Oh yeah.

387
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,630
I'm glad they did. That for me.
Really helped me get into character.

388
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,410
I still to wear six wigs.
He didn't realize it.

389
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:37,810
Prune was abbreviation for permanent.
I did not

390
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,950
send it 10 days. It's just kind of washes
out. They're like, oh no, six months.

391
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,520
I just like clown hair.
I loved it whenever we want.

392
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,220
Whenever we went out,
Joe would always have this,

393
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,660
the Yankees hat is new Yankees hat and
then like he'd be like chatting to a girl

394
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:58,840
or something, you know, a bar. And
then I just take off the hot guy.

395
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,380
True Story. So now you know his
character. I'm a good friend.

396
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,790
Loud wingman. But good friends.
Sorry, one more time for one more.

397
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,461
All right.

398
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:17,660
So obviously the relationship between
the members of the band was very core to

399
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:18,680
their creative process.

400
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:22,280
How did you develop and convey that
relationship between your characters on

401
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:23,114
screen?

402
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,740
We were lucky that we've
got to ad Lib so much. Um,

403
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,850
that was definitely one of the things.
Um,

404
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,380
basically every time we showed up on set,
we were just making up half the lines.

405
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:32,740
I mean,

406
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,850
I think the majority of my lines in the
movie are things that I just said on the

407
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,511
day.
Um,

408
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:40,270
and so that is kind of a thing where you
start riffing off of each other and you

409
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:42,430
know, your character. So we'll, you
know how to react to each other.

410
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,180
And that was part of the [inaudible]
and the editor did a really good job of

411
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:51,040
just picking candid moments in this. We
didn't even realize it was on camera then

412
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:58,090
us laughing. I mean, when you see
people, uh, laughter in a movie,

413
00:24:58,091 --> 00:25:01,930
it sometimes feels forced.
You can never predict chemistry.

414
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:03,130
And in film amaze people,

415
00:25:03,131 --> 00:25:07,030
two people can get along so well in life
and you don't know how it's going to

416
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:09,650
play in front of a camera.
Uh,

417
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,990
evolve between us was just
so purely genuine bent.

418
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,570
If you wanted to laugh,
you could really,

419
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:21,660
really sustain it and enjoy it because
it was so real that you never felt,

420
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,460
oh, this is, this is too
much. This feels canned. Uh,

421
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,270
everything was just so natural with us.
Uh,

422
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,770
since it's such a rare thing to
have and we had the freedom of,

423
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,380
because we got to know each other
and trusted each other so much,

424
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,080
we could ad Lib with one another.

425
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,810
And we knew where to pick
up and start so many.

426
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,830
There is not one scene in this movie
that probably doesn't have at least

427
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:50,920
something that was thrown in
on the day from one of us.

428
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,130
It was great having Mike
Myers, uh, all of her scenes,

429
00:25:54,131 --> 00:25:56,470
we were quite close to the
beginning of our shoot.

430
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:01,910
And so having a master like that set the
Preston but like throughout the shoot

431
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,890
would be like,
I'm not going like,

432
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:06,710
do I need to just try and
emulate is kind of naughtiness.

433
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,750
There's cheekiness and a lot of the things
that he used to say to himself on set

434
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,620
became catch phrases to us.

435
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:16,170
Like before I see any gun just
for cheeses is it gives us,

436
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,660
that would be his way. And just that
playfulness was like, okay, that's,

437
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,290
that's good. That's all we
need to do. That's incredible.

438
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,391
All right,
cool.

439
00:26:24,391 --> 00:26:27,750
We have to wrap up and I would be remiss
to leave this question out if we could

440
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:32,200
just go down the row and, uh, your
favorite queens sites. I'll, sorry,

441
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:36,000
I want to break free. Really
rarely. Why do you like that one?

442
00:26:36,001 --> 00:26:39,690
So that's such a cool rhythm. The baseline
is so fun. The precaution is just like,

443
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:43,800
it's Kinda got this bumpiness to it. It's
fun. I Dunno. Cool. We're of time. Thanks.

444
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:49,020
Score one for John Green. Turn
your chairs this way, but please,

445
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,300
I love under

446
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:57,380
pressure. Uh, I'm a massive
Bowie fan as well. Uh,

447
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,190
you know, they, they happen,

448
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,320
I think what works so well with
Queen and especially Freddy,

449
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:08,160
just love when things weren't planned
and they ran into Bowie one day in the

450
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:11,640
same city and same recording
studio. And he said, hey,

451
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,150
why don't we do something today? And, uh,

452
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,510
they began putting
something together and uh,

453
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:24,300
what did John Do? You came
up with some, some, uh, yeah,

454
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,090
yeah, I forgot it. And money forgot it.

455
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,010
They went and had a slice
of pizza and came back

456
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,960
and, uh, he couldn't remember if
the baseline, and then Roger goes,

457
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:38,770
no, when something like this on the
drums. And that was the evolution of that.

458
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:43,720
And then, uh, but we started writing
something down, went into record it.

459
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:48,280
And Freddy went to listen because
he was so competitive. He's like,

460
00:27:48,281 --> 00:27:52,340
whatever he's doing, I'm
going to do something. And uh,

461
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,510
he just went and you hear that,
you hear him hitting that,

462
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,650
some of the highest notes, uh,
he's probably ever hit in that.

463
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,350
Then you get to here is operatic
warmup, you know, the DDA,

464
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:06,700
all of that is in there. That's just
special. All the stories you get. Um,

465
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,010
you know,
the,

466
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:13,010
the of the making of these songs and
doing the research and in the film is what

467
00:28:13,381 --> 00:28:17,730
I find the most special about their music.
When he got

468
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,550
somebody to love us. My all time
favorite, I feel like, you know,

469
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,950
Bohemian Rhapsody's obviously
their masterpiece, you know,

470
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:27,160
but I feel like somebody,
it'll, it was equally so, um,

471
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,580
and it's a little more accessible and
it just like the lyrics kind of speak to

472
00:28:30,581 --> 00:28:33,310
you, you know, a bit
more. Um, so that was,

473
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,600
that's that one's always been my all time
favorite. Then like some deep tracks.

474
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:39,970
I like, like father to son and action
this day I've been singing all day today.

475
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:45,340
I always love exactly
the same songs as Joe.

476
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,070
So it's allowed me behaving rhapsody,

477
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,770
but this film now has given me like an
emotional connection to every song when

478
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:54,820
we play there and make songs that,
you know, so radio guard got,

479
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,420
when I have heard a recording of that,
I'm like, yes, this is a good song,

480
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,950
good song. When I hear it
live aid and like, oh my God,

481
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,760
it's incredible because that was the
moment when you just go Freddy's onto

482
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:11,050
something here like this there. This
is a special moment cause it's when he,

483
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,640
when he really captures the crowd and
you just see that engagement with 70,000

484
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:19,390
people and you kind of like,
I mean what's great with this film,

485
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:20,850
we saw it in a screen yesterday,

486
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,240
huge screen in Dallas with amazing sound
system and you have like the vibration

487
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:26,470
of the music going through your chest.

488
00:29:26,471 --> 00:29:30,800
Like you're at a concert and it's
that kind of like epic feel that,

489
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,230
that I love about that song performed
on that day in July and not, you know,

490
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,910
you're five. That's awesome. Cool.

491
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,980
Thank you guys so much for
the phone is incredibly, you
guys nailed it. Um, and I'm

492
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,950
so glad to have you here.
Uh, thank you guys so much.

493
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,590
If phone comes out in November 2nd so
if you didn't get to see it last night,

494
00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:49,120
even if you did go back and say it again

495
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:58,350
[inaudible].
