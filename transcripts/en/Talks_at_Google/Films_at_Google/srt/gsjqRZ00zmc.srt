00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,920
Hello,
it's nice to see all of your phones.

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,370
Hello everyone.
Welcome to talks at Google today.

3
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:20,490
It is my pleasure to welcome
Olivia Munn for x men apocalypse.

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,210
Thank you very much. Thank you for
the pronunciation. I tried very hard.

5
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:27,390
We practiced this. She said, uh,
it's a toxic Google. And I said,

6
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:30,870
why did you guys name it toxic Google.
We're Brittany fans.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,700
Um, so huge, huge nerd movie.

8
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,480
You are an awesome Geek nerd icon.

9
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:44,460
How does it feel to kind of add this
to your, your wall of badges? I,

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,010
I still feel, um, and I felt at the
time, I still feel like, I feel like a,

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,090
like a nerd mole. I feel like, I think
they've let me in and I'm like, Hey guys,

12
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:55,230
I've got some stuff to tell you.
I'm like,

13
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:59,550
I get in there and I don't really
feel like, like, uh, you know,

14
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:02,040
I think somebody asked me
the other day about like, oh,

15
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,620
like to be part of this community.
Like how did that feel? Like a,

16
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:09,210
well actually I think in my opinion, you
know, that the nerd community or the,

17
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:10,780
especially the expert
community, it's, it's,

18
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,550
it's not the movies or the
biggest platform because
that's what Hollywood is the

19
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:16,290
biggest platform for entertainment.

20
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:20,280
But the community started long
before the movies and, uh,

21
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:21,770
and so to me it just felt like,
uh,

22
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,830
it felt like I was able to get in and it
kind of see what they're doing from the

23
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:29,400
inside. So I kind of don't,
I don't, I still feel like
the outsider on the inside.

24
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,580
What, what was your sort of first
introduction to the world of x nine?

25
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:35,040
Was it the comics was,
it was a comic books. Uh,

26
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:38,610
I grew up in Japan and I'm one of five
kids and we didn't have a lot of money,

27
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,470
so we, my mom would let us buy wine
and we'd all share it. And, uh,

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,580
but we got into all different kinds of
comic books. We just kind of read and,

29
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,160
but oexman was way back then I think.
Did you have a favorite storyline? Uh,

30
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,350
no I don't. I don't think
I, it was, um, no, I,

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,960
I never know all of them. Do you
have a favorite storyline from it's,

32
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,000
it feels like there's just so many, like
how, just so many, it's a great question,

33
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:06,730
but it's a hard answer.
I enjoyed house of m. Oh,

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,120
so you do have an answer. I'm
so, I didn't have an answer.

35
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,460
Easier question than I thought.
So I, uh, you know, you,

36
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:16,550
you are joining this one.
There's a,

37
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,630
we're getting introduced to a
ton of new characters. What,

38
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:23,040
what can you tell us about that luck or
your interpretation of her? So I like, um,

39
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,050
well this is the introduction
of, of Silak. Well, she
was introduced once before.

40
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,280
Um, but that was like a, like a
little blip of her. Uh, I, when I,

41
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,190
I was excited because I've always
loved Psylocke when I loved,

42
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,040
what I loved about, sorry, I like was
that she was, and I was reading it,

43
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:42,900
that she was a villain who
didn't have a problem killing.

44
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,630
You know, a lot of times people like
they have, they hesitate when they, when,

45
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,060
when they have to kill. Like, if they
have the only killed, they have to.

46
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:49,600
But I liked that silent.

47
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,440
She can create anything with their mind
so she could create a boulder and just

48
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,670
kill everybody and be done.

49
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:56,370
But I always thought that she
felt that was all too boring.

50
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,240
So she liked to kill up close and
personal. I always liked that. I'm like,

51
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,410
that's like kind of a cool quality light.
Not only that,

52
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:06,400
she's one of the Mutans who not only
has kind of metaphysical powers,

53
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:10,210
but she's physically a bad ass.
But yeah, like she's, you know,

54
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:11,800
telekinetic and she's telepathic,

55
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:15,130
but she's also really skilled
and she's a really powerful,

56
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,610
and that's what when I said to
us, so Simon Kinberg, he had,

57
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,470
he wanted me to do another role in,
um, in Deadpool. Uh, but it just, uh,

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,860
I don't, wasn't a real, I
connected with like, you know,

59
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:30,280
thank you for the opportunity, but I just,
you know, uh, I don't connect with us.

60
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,960
And it was a little serendipitous because
not that long after he called me about

61
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:38,670
Psylocke. And, uh, when I met
with him, I did say, you know,

62
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,920
I know you guys introduced to once
before, but like, you know, it's,

63
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,200
I like was the last one
added to this whole,

64
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,170
to the whole x went apocalypse movie.
They were,

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,420
they had the horseman already with,

66
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,210
with apocalypse and then they felt like
they needed a fourth and then, oh yeah.

67
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:53,980
And then there's Psylocke and
then they thought of me for it.

68
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,150
So when I met with them, I
said, you know, he said, it's,

69
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,310
we're introducing this
character so there's, you know,

70
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,370
it builds up into the movies
after and there's more stuff,

71
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:07,280
but this one is not going to be, you
know, a ton of stuff. And I said,

72
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,560
you mean dialogue wise or
presence wise? He said, no,
no, she just dialogue. Why six?

73
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:15,740
She's there, she's a presence in the whole
movie. And I said, well, like I like,

74
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,640
I'm not one of those people,
I'm not counting lines and I don't,

75
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,910
it's dialogue doesn't matter. I go, but
if you give her a bad ass fight scene,

76
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,970
then I'm in. And he's like, fine,
we, we, we got the fight scenes.

77
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,940
So like to me that was the monologue.
So for,

78
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,500
to me it only made sense to do Psylocke
if they were going to make her a really

79
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:35,680
strong and lethal and they give it,
you know,

80
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:38,980
all these guys get that ass fight
scenes and as the girl you got to like,

81
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:43,300
you know, it's always like really
slow and then you're doing something,

82
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:45,700
then you got to come up on him and
then he take, you know, I'm like, no,

83
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:49,540
can we just like grapple and fight and,
and really get into it.

84
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,240
And like I want to get knocked around
and I want to knock somebody else around,

85
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:56,190
like actually like do a bad ass fight
scene. And thankfully they, they,

86
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,370
they were all down for that. So what
was the training process like? Um,

87
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:04,870
I started doing, uh, I started working
with stunts, like learning wire and um,

88
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,880
and how to flip and stuff.
And then I started working
with a martial arts couple.

89
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,000
They have their own gym
and the husband can,

90
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:17,020
he is an expert in martial
arts and also sword.

91
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,580
So I started doing sword with him
and then I would do taekwondo.

92
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,030
And so my training and it being six,
seven hours a day,

93
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,490
pretty much every day for about four,

94
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,900
four months leading up into the
fight scene. And so by the end,

95
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,120
um, uh, I was, you know,

96
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:37,180
I did all of my fight scenes and all
of my stunts and that wasn't planned,

97
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,810
but in the end, uh, I was
able to just do it all.

98
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,940
I do have a taekwondo background,
so, uh, it's not like, you know,

99
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:49,390
I was like able to learn everything like,
so I, but I had that background already.

100
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,320
And then just training again with
them. Uh, it just, it was just,

101
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:56,140
it was just so much fun and because
it was everything for me to do,

102
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,180
if I was going to decide,

103
00:05:57,181 --> 00:06:00,350
like I really wanted to do this fight
scene and so to get really strong and

104
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:02,510
powerful and to learn all these
things was very important to me.

105
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,950
And so then we took that time. Then by
the time the fight scene came around, um,

106
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,490
I was, you know, I felt, I mean, I
still feel like it's a weird thing.

107
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,260
You do martial arts. I do. You
do martial arts. Karate. Okay.

108
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,390
Um, do you know which, which kind of a
lot of, are you? Oh yeah. What is that?

109
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,090
The way of peace and harmony.
Really effective in a fight.

110
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:28,160
Just like someone comes at
you with a knife and you're
like, hey, chill out, chill,

111
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,610
dead. Um, uh, yeah. Taekwondo is,

112
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,240
it's like when you, when you do, do
people here, anybody do martial arts?

113
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,880
Oh my, my one security guy who's
been assigned to me. Thank you. Um,

114
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,330
you feel like really it's a different
feeling you feel capable of like there's

115
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,510
like, um, like a lot of
people get like, you know,

116
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:54,440
like they put on muscle and they know how
to like look lean or thin or booked up,

117
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,940
but there's a different kind of feeling.

118
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,280
It's like athletic strength
is what I feel like I have.

119
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:00,890
So I feel like really capable.
It's a good, it's a cool feeling.

120
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,650
I've heard it described as sort
of like a confidence, you know,

121
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:06,160
I think it's a little bit of
knowing that like, yeah, no,

122
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,140
that could maybe do something at a fight,
maybe. Yeah. If, yeah, I think not.

123
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:15,770
Maybe I like that's it is maybe
for me. Oh yeah. Well, no, no, no.

124
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,720
I'm saying probably not for your
peaceful fighting thing. I'm saying,

125
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,820
I'm going to say you have to call
me and I'll, I'll come. We should.

126
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:26,660
You should actually, have you ever
done your peaceful fighting technique?

127
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:31,940
It didn't work out very well, so
it's not, it's not the strong,

128
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,660
I mean it's a, it's a very nice choice.
Not the most protective choice. No,

129
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:38,030
not at all. Uh, but that's okay.

130
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,110
You seem like a very sweet person as you
mentioned before, you know, like is a,

131
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,770
I would say the whole x
meant universe is kind of a,

132
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,180
there's no good and evil necessarily.

133
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:49,040
Everyone just said who
has their own motivations,

134
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:54,041
but sidelocks maybe more willing to
engage in tactics that fall on evil.

135
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,083
But,
um,

136
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,290
how was it interacting with the other
kind of new folks coming in as a horseman?

137
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:03,620
And, um, the new cast of
characters. Yeah. It was really fun.

138
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,240
Uh, with, you know, everyone
is a, it's a, you know, we,

139
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,230
there were so many people in this movie
and we would all shoot different times,

140
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:15,630
but then at night we'd all
get together and we'd like,

141
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,890
basically like shut down a,
like a restaurant just for
us to hang out. I mean, not,

142
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,300
we wouldn't go in there and be like,
shut down because of us,

143
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:23,780
but with that we just take up so much
room that we have to like call ahead to a

144
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:27,140
restaurant and we all hung out. So it's
a really cool group of people. But yeah.

145
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,270
But I, it was speaking on the,
I'm the villain, the, you know,

146
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,450
good guys and been like, no
one's really like, you know,

147
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,530
most people want to do good.
Like, I think that's the, the, um,

148
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,810
do you guys know the backstory of
Psylocke? They people don't, you tell?

149
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,720
Well, well, okay, well,
back in third grade,

150
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,640
Psylocke was a she,

151
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,570
but she came from a good family and
she had twin brother and then she, uh,

152
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,350
and then when they were killed, you
know, she has these amazing powers.

153
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,010
And to me that when I was a kid,
that's what I love.

154
00:08:57,011 --> 00:08:59,600
She is like what I thought were the
two most coveted powers, you know,

155
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,800
to be telekinetic and telepathic.

156
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,850
And so she was like,
Wolverine,

157
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:09,390
how he was used by people for them
to, you know, use his power is to,

158
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,330
to do their bidding.
That's what, you know,

159
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:16,940
Psylocke is alone and she's
always different. Leaders
have always, uh, you know,

160
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,170
taken her in and, um, manipulated
her so that, you know,

161
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,230
they could use her powers. And I think
she's always trying to find her, you know,

162
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,890
like, uh, you know, a
righteous leader to, to follow.

163
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:32,610
And she just happened to get in with
the bad guys. So she's really good.

164
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:35,250
She's really strong. She's
really smart. She's very loyal.

165
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,160
She's always had the wrong leaders.
And so if, you know the stories I like,

166
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:42,300
she wasn't, she's not, you know,
I'm bad in this movie, you know,

167
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:44,760
but the hope is that in the next one,
I mean, I probably will still be bad,

168
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:45,594
but there will be,

169
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,780
there's a switch because Psylocke and
the comic books she does, you know,

170
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:49,231
become good,

171
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:52,800
but she just needs the right person
to the right leader to guide her,

172
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,440
the right group, the right family. And
that actually in the complex happens when,

173
00:09:55,441 --> 00:10:00,360
you know, the x men world brings her
in. Uh, but before that, it's hard.

174
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:01,010
I mean,
just in,

175
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,900
and that's what I think I always loved
about it as a kid was that, you know,

176
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:08,370
I grew up in a military family. We
moved around a lot and I'm half Chinese,

177
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:12,270
half white as are you. And, uh, and,

178
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,780
and being different, you know,
you're always in moving around a lot.

179
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,431
Always the new kid.

180
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:20,220
So I'm always the new kid and I
didn't look like everybody else.

181
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,270
That's what identified with the x
men universe. It's that it's the,

182
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:27,840
the people that don't always fit in with
everybody else that were ostracized and

183
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:29,550
that the people wanted to,
you know,

184
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:34,410
the majority of people want to like
put down or eradicate. So for me,

185
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,820
I identify with them because when,
when they, especially x and a lot,

186
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:41,070
that's all comic book world,
right? Where there's like the,

187
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,690
the guy who you know is different and
he's fighting against the rest of the

188
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:48,540
world, but an extra,
they all United together.

189
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,710
And because of that
unification, they, the,

190
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,560
their differences made them feel
special. And I felt like that's what, um,

191
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,340
you know, that's what I had in my
own family and that's, you know,

192
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:03,450
our differences made us closer and we
had this kind of United front against the

193
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:07,440
world. It's interesting in your book you
talk about sort of being a misfit and

194
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,320
identifying with nerds and nerd culture
and I think that's very much who the x

195
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:16,290
men are as well as the I as
you've said. Um, what, um,

196
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,140
now that you know,
you're at the forefront of that and it's,

197
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,600
it's cool to like these sort of things.
What's,

198
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:24,850
what's been your kind of
favorite revelation? Um,

199
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,590
now that geeks rule the
world and all that. Oh, uh,

200
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,380
what is my favorite revelation of
geeks ruling the world? Well, what's,

201
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:34,570
what's like the most fun thing for
you now that it's mainstream and it's,

202
00:11:34,571 --> 00:11:39,571
it's cool like the x men and it's cool
to go to comicon and it's cool then I

203
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:45,330
think, um, I think that's, it's a
good, it's a really good question.

204
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,870
It's a cool feeling. And if it's a
good feeling, as a strong feeling,

205
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:53,170
it's a confident feeling where there's
people that want to judge people by way

206
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,940
they look,
um,

207
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,740
and or by the their interests or by
their ethnicity or their religion.

208
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,920
All of a sudden those
people like the bullies,

209
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,630
they're the people who look down on you
there. They're no longer the cool ones.

210
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,700
And in fact, anybody who
looks down on somebody for
who they are, their interests,

211
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,110
uh, the rest of the rest of the
world, they just know it's just not,

212
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,320
it's not cool and they know it's not cool.
Usually like when people,

213
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:23,920
like I felt like growing up, like
that's what, you know, it kind of,

214
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,010
you get ostracized and people are
always afraid to stand up to the bullies

215
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:29,290
because you don't want
to get picked on next.

216
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:33,970
But I think the tides
have changed and it's,

217
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:36,160
um,
and it's,

218
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,400
it's everybody is free to
embrace their individuality.

219
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,820
And I think that's the change.
Like when now it being a geek is cool.

220
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,670
I just think that means that being
an individual is cool and excellent.

221
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,050
I think we'll be great and I
love it and I'm super excited,

222
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,680
but I know it's going to be a fantastic
movie and I know how hard everybody

223
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:56,020
would, but he works to make it an amazing
movie for the fans and make it really

224
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:56,890
exciting and fun.

225
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,640
We are all very excited to see x men and
thank you so much for joining us today.

226
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,493
Thank you.

227
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,320
Thanks for having me guys.
Hey, high five. All right.
