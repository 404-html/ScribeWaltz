1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,790
Hi everyone.
Welcome to toxic Google today.

2
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:09,720
It is my pleasure to welcome
the lonely island for Popstar.

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,770
Thank you guys for being here.
Thank you for having us. Uh,

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,890
could you tell us a
little bit about the film?

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,890
Keith, why don't you just like tell
them a little bit about the film? Yeah,

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,910
you do it.
Okay.

7
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,100
It's a movie a, it's a musical movie. Yes.

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,820
Say mockumentary. Yes. So far. Uh, yeah.

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,710
All the pop you mentorees like, um,
Katy Perry. Pardon me? Or Bieber?

10
00:00:39,711 --> 00:00:42,440
Never say never.
Classics one direction.

11
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:47,210
This is us going,
uh,

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,170
that's the John Written.
Do you want to get deeper?

13
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:56,210
It's up to you when you were looking
for an idea for a movie that we could do

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,840
our comedy songs inside
of and make feel natural.

15
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:02,720
So we were talking about maybe doing one
of those poppy mentorees as the genre.

16
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:07,930
Then a Kiva had a general meeting inside
term with Judd Apatow and Judd was

17
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:08,510
like,

18
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,040
I think it'd be really funny if you guys
did like one of those poppy mentorees

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,580
and he was like, I had the same idea.
We were just talking about that.

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,920
And Judd said, if you guys
write it, then I'll produce it.

21
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:20,900
So we started writing it two and a
half years later. The movie. Hey,

22
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,823
here we are.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,810
Yes.
So

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,690
question real quick is every but does,
does anyone here work at Google?

25
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,240
Do you all work at this campus? Like
this building? Not everybody does. Nope.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,030
Got It.
So Mountain View,

27
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,240
Boston present Beantown right.

28
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,190
Just kill.
That's the thing we say we say kill.

29
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,640
You guys can spread it around if you want.
No means to distribute information.

30
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,870
That's kind of a, it just means right on.
Essentially. I have a followup question.

31
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:58,390
Do you guys have any nicknames for Google?

32
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,110
Like do you call it like big
g or anything fun like that?

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,930
Papa goose.
Goose eggs.

34
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,750
Papa gigs. All right, good
to be here. Papa Roach. Yeah,

35
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,320
it's very slept better.
Alright.

36
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,430
Things we aspire to to
be like the approach.

37
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,610
And so how do you guys
feel about the Hooli thing?

38
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,670
Like do you feel like fuck those guys
or if you want to talk about like

39
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:31,890
mockumentary versus the most
accurate documentary there is.

40
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,740
Okay, fair enough. So
you think it's accurate?

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
I think it's pretty accurate there through
those guys at Pied Piper going to get

42
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:39,510
it together is what I want to know.

43
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,020
It's like they're right there on the
brink of greatness and that just can't get

44
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:46,710
out of their own way
anyway. Pop Stars. Great.

45
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,150
Yeah, that'll be on HBO eventually. Maybe

46
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,280
I'm speaking of Pop star
in terms of the process,

47
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:59,620
so how did you guys sort of find a
balance between writing the songs and the

48
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:00,070
plot?
Like

49
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,440
which was it a chicken
and the egg scenario or,

50
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,820
I was a little bit of both.
We,

51
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,970
once we decided that this was the
kind of movie we were going to make,

52
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,810
we started writing songs and brainstorming
the script at the same time pretty

53
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:12,890
much.
Um,

54
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:16,310
so we had a lot of ideas for songs that
were kind of free of the story that we

55
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:20,750
just thought were dumb and funny and
then we'd sort of shoe horn them into the

56
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:25,010
plot. But then as we started writing
and, and the story started taking shape,

57
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:27,890
we would then pinpoint moments
where we were like, oh, this should,

58
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:30,140
there should be this kind of
a song for this character.

59
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,580
Or like we knew there was a montage
sequence that was going to be about two

60
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,580
characters getting to know each other
and maybe if they made a song together it

61
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:39,920
would make more sense there.
Stuff like that. So kind of both.

62
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,500
Um, did you that's true. Yeah.
Accurate. I'll just fact check.

63
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,190
They say something. I'll fact
check it. You could do, um,

64
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,420
when you guys were writing,

65
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:52,240
did you take a different approach to the
writing the songs in this as opposed to

66
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:56,080
when you're writing like as properly the
lonely island? Like musical style wise?

67
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,453
Uh,

68
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,490
little of both, but a lot. Yeah. Cause
it was more specifically in character,

69
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,570
but yeah,

70
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,980
he could be ignorant in different
ways then maybe we could as ourselves.

71
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,340
But I mean,
similar to say like the Dick in a box,

72
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:15,341
dude's like there's an untrustworthy
narrator thing happening where my

73
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:21,380
character, especially in the movie is a
bit of a dumb ass. Uh, so his perspective,

74
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,590
like he was saying was able to
be inappropriate because you,

75
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,160
you don't forgive him it, but you're
able to laugh at it because you're like,

76
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:30,170
well, they don't think
that the people writing it.

77
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:32,690
Don't think some of both though.
Like so like throw it on the ground.

78
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:34,700
You're obviously a character in the past.

79
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,260
And then I'm on a boat where ourselves
but not for any real reason through it on

80
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:41,990
the ground.
I'm not a big fan.

81
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,680
Thanks for fact checking and I was
like fact checker. Just got fact check.

82
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:51,910
I keep a neuroma.

83
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,880
How was it being both behind the camera
and in front of the camera on this one?

84
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,340
Uh, it's exhausting. Yeah,
we wore so many hats.

85
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,470
Uh, let's talk about it. Um, no,
it was a, it was great. We, we uh,

86
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,270
we've kind of developed all three of us,
a real style over the many,

87
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:14,350
many years of working together. So we kind
of have a, our shorthand is very short.

88
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,280
Um, and then we would just get to trade
off who gets to say action, you know,

89
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,540
like we'd be like, okay, your turn.

90
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,170
And then he'd be like action and then
I'd be like Roshambo for it. Yeah.

91
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,250
We did a lot of really took a lot
of hours out of the day. Yeah.

92
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,260
And people will be like, you
guys were, and we were like,

93
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:33,340
we're concentrating on something shut
up and then one to do and then action.

94
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,220
Yeah. So it was a mess. It was a mess.
It came out well. So they weren't,

95
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,200
um,
is is this going to be like a weird,

96
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:44,140
healthy way for you guys to sort of live
out a parallel universe where you get

97
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:47,260
to get angry at each other and creatively?

98
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,210
Uh, yes. Yeah, sure.
Yeah. Sure. Yes. Sure.

99
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,160
Seems like a healthy
expensive form of therapy.

100
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,000
It's really, it's the most
expensive therapy there, I
guess. Making a big movie.

101
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,650
Uh, yeah. [inaudible] has been
describing it as the characters are us.

102
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:06,410
If we were not self aware,
so there's any,

103
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,490
any roadblocks in their
path that are challenging,

104
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:11,870
they kind of make the wrong decision,

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,740
whereas we make the right decision.
All three of them. Always.

106
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,380
Always. Yeah. You heard
it here. Oh, always. Yeah.

107
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:23,990
Always.

108
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,050
Yeah. Fact checked. Consensus.

109
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,790
It's important or they're like guys on
the roof that don't do anything here.

110
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,080
Yeah.
That there saying

111
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,650
that's awesome.
Sweet.

112
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,980
You guys probably had your choice of
guest actors and musicians for the film.

113
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,430
Who were some of the people you were
most excited to have and was there anyone

114
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:52,790
who was unfortunately unavailable for it?
I was,

115
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,290
we were all pretty excited
that Nas a nas the rapper,

116
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,730
he used to be called not Nasty Nas.
Now he's just not as uh, as your Jones.

117
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,560
He only changed it like 18 years ago. So
I know, you know, for the heads out there.

118
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,110
Um, but uh, yeah, no, like we were,

119
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:13,220
we grew up listening to him and so that
was a really cool person to have on set

120
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,270
talking about us and how he was a
fan of us growing up. It was great.

121
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:21,080
And then a Mariah Carey was another person
that I was really excited to have in

122
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,700
the movie. It wasn't us. You want to be
was our characters. Hold on a second.

123
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:27,860
You can see what were, we were acting
in pretending, so he wasn't a fan of us.

124
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,960
It was hard.
No,

125
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,960
I felt like he was deep down a fan of
us as I'll go out and go in it anyway.

126
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,423
Um,

127
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,040
who are you guys excited to have on set?

128
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,660
Ringo. Ringo Starr was pretty
crazy. That was, that was cool.

129
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,010
He was in this group called the Beatles.
Yeah, they had a couple hits. Yeah,

130
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:53,270
they were pretty cool boy band
back in the day. Uh, yeah.

131
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:57,440
Lots of cool people asap.
Rocky Dj call it. Yeah.

132
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,970
I mean you guys are clearly ridiculously
like media savvy or you're just going

133
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:07,080
to say ridiculous.
Why don't you go jump off the roof?

134
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,820
I think you guys use like social media
and the use of the Internet in the film

135
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:18,571
really,
really well.

136
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:21,840
But was there ever a concern that like
things would become passe by the time the

137
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:25,890
film actually came out because of
the editing process for this film?

138
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:28,830
Like we were kind of adding
to it while we were editing,

139
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,700
so that kind of changed as we went.
Honestly. Like a lot more snapchat stuff

140
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,260
added kind of as we went. What would
have happened if like TMZ went down?

141
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,490
Oh, it had to make some cuts. Um,

142
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:43,281
would,

143
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:46,410
would it be fair to say that like a lot
of your notoriety and success is because

144
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:47,460
of the Internet and how are you,

145
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,180
you guys sort of were discovered
that would be fair? Yeah,

146
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,253
I think so.

147
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:58,350
We always say we were incredibly fortunate
that we got on SNL kind of right when

148
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,100
streaming became actually
possible for video.

149
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:07,101
Like forever we had a website and it was
a big deal that we had videos posted or

150
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:11,220
you know, you'd have to submit your
video to a site that would host it. Um,

151
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,160
and even when we were first
getting it going in La,

152
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:18,060
we would tell like agencies and producers
and stuff we were meeting with like,

153
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,410
oh we have a website.
And they were like, cool,

154
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:22,980
send us a VHS tape because
they just didn't exist yet.

155
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:27,981
So like basically youtube became a thing
right around the time that we got on

156
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:32,040
SNL and did lazy Sunday.
So it was very good timing for us

157
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,090
when, when lazy Sunday came
out. Like what, at what point
did you realize like it,

158
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:38,080
it was something special
and it sort of like,

159
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:42,280
I feel like it changed the way that
traditional TV produced for the Internet.

160
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,490
Like suddenly it was cool to have web
shorts and it was cool to have extra

161
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:47,770
content that isn't like
for broadcast necessarily.

162
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,620
Well, we sat down before we wrote it
and we were like, let's change the way

163
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,240
you were just that. We were like, people
don't say the word viral enough. Yeah.

164
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:02,960
That is one of the negative
connotation for so many years.

165
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:03,890
We'll meet with people and they're like,

166
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:06,920
we want you guys to make us a viral video
where blah, blah, blah. And we're like,

167
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,570
you can't predict if it's going to,
you can't just so extremely popular.

168
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,400
We'll make a video and then maybe people
will watch it and we'll follow up.

169
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:20,530
Question, uh, to this. Um, do
you guys still have the, it's,

170
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,050
it's that are like organic, but then
they made them for you like the vanilla,

171
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:27,530
it's it ice cream. Oh yeah. But they're
like the ones that they made for Google.

172
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,590
There are some fancy, it's,
it's like that for you guys,

173
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:34,530
the ones that they made just for Google
that they made for papa good anymore.

174
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,260
You know what I'm talking about.

175
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:39,590
Some employees that were here
so they don't do that anymore.

176
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:44,420
Now it's no discontinued. You can get them
through. Those are the Nasty Nas heads.

177
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,041
They still exist,

178
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,070
but not the ones that have the Google
logo and are made with different organic

179
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:50,960
ingredients and stuff. No, no.

180
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,600
It was a big deal for us because
we used to get, it's it at school,

181
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:56,740
but they had them at our junior high.

182
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,650
You could buy them in the cafeteria and
we were like, whoa. Special edition.

183
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:05,030
It's it. I know. I was excited to come
here for that, but yeah, whatever.

184
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,700
Now we're just excited to see you guys.
But at first it was the insets thing.

185
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,840
Do you can't have, it's, it's, this is
this acceptable second edit model as well.

186
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,240
That's great to know. Um, it's,

187
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,690
speaking of sort of, uh,
earlier in your career,

188
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,840
it's been almost 10 years
since hot rod came up. Um,

189
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,670
what were some of the lessons that you
learned from that film that you applied

190
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:31,504
going into this one?

191
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,110
Has it been 10?
I'm just kidding.

192
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,490
No, it's not fine. It'll be
next summer, next summer.

193
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:43,470
What were some of the lessons?
Uh, just believe in yourself.

194
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,740
Yeah. It was a lot of that if that,

195
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:50,640
if you find something funny that
eventually a lot of people will tell you,

196
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:53,750
they also find it funny.
Yeah.

197
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,890
We know there they are very
different films obviously.

198
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:59,400
Like there's a ton of music and
this one there's less, you know,

199
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,310
motorcycles crashing, uh,
as well. Um, but it's,

200
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,910
it's a totally different format. So,
um, but I dunno, I guess you just learn,

201
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,940
you learned something from everything
that you make from even a small Internet

202
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:14,130
video or whatever. So I
wouldn't, I don't know.

203
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,350
Each thing presents its own challenges.
Even like a good snap, you know,

204
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:20,190
we learned like I learned so
much from a ground staff. Yeah,

205
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,650
no, no. Um, what, what were some of the,

206
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,620
what were some of the perks
of doing a longer form thing?

207
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:33,470
Because you guys have done well,
you've both done features before.

208
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:37,010
You're on your stick, not take on
but like television 30 minutes.

209
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,220
I'm sure. Yeah. It's like a good
Sitcom. It's a really good sick huh.

210
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,870
Award winning maybe once.
Um,

211
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,390
uh, but yeah. So what were,

212
00:12:50,391 --> 00:12:52,640
what were some of the sort
of the challenges of adapting
and what were some of

213
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:56,540
the perks? I assume like aside from maybe
a good part is that you get to play in

214
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,350
like at SNL we were just throwing them
together so much so quickly that, that we,

215
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,860
we would never get to even like
location scout or like plan ahead.

216
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,821
We would kind of go,

217
00:13:05,821 --> 00:13:08,100
it needs to be at an office and then you
would just show up with the camera crew

218
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:10,860
and the actors and go, okay, I
guess this is our office and we'll,

219
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,370
and we would just kind of make it up on
the fly. And on a movie it was, you know,

220
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,100
you get to take things a lot slower,
location scout,

221
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,400
then you got to go back to location a
few times before you actually shoot and

222
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,710
build sets.
And I dunno,

223
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,190
by the time you're shooting it's actually
very calm because you have planned it.

224
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,030
Right? Yeah. One of
the huge advantages is,

225
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:33,030
is to have turnaround of
just like that you can't,

226
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,890
like you have to give the actors 12
hours and the crew 12 hours in bed so you

227
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:40,620
can at least go home and sleep.
Whereas that SNL,

228
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,730
we would routinely make things and have
an hour to sleep at before we started

229
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:47,400
editing something cause it was
going to be on there. So that,

230
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,130
that was a big advantage. It's getting
to sleep is a, is a huge difference.

231
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,550
Not just in film. Just
in life. Yeah. Yeah.

232
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:58,170
It's really important you guys and drink
water to talk about a life hack. Yeah.

233
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,360
They don't let you have water at SNL.

234
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,780
Yeah.
To save a buck or two somehow.

235
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,910
The rumors about Lorne Michaels or
true that, no, he seems nice. Um,

236
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,670
so these are, imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery. Um, have,

237
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,800
has there been anybody that you've sort
of parodied or taking inspiration from

238
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:20,990
that has turned around in revealed
themselves to be a big fan?

239
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,720
Oh, what a nice version of that
question. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

240
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,700
I thought that was going to
go. It's like, here we go.

241
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:29,690
We got to talk about how much
we love Bieber again, uh,

242
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,700
which we do, uh, who so many,
uh, will nick cage for me,

243
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:37,590
it was a crazy one.

244
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,640
I was doing him on SNL lot on weekend
update and it basically came about that he

245
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:49,551
was enjoying the impression and liked how
like psychotic it was and got the joke

246
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:52,010
that it wasn't literally of him was just,
I found a weird

247
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,780
character and called it nic cage and he
came on and did it with me at updates.

248
00:14:56,781 --> 00:15:01,660
So we did like twin nick Cage's,
which is what SNL does. Um,

249
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,300
and he was really, really nice. It
was fun. And right after we did it,

250
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:09,650
the crowd cheered really loud and we
sort of walked off the update desk stage

251
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:12,530
and he turned around and he was like,
pleasure doing business with

252
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,470
and then just disappeared into the
darkness. Didn't come to the party. I,

253
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,800
no one saw him again after that moment.
I was just like, what's he ever there?

254
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,290
I like picturing that he
like threw a smoke bomb down.

255
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,163
Yeah it was awesome.

256
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,280
I'm sure he's like hunting treasure or
he's out there doing something good.

257
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,810
Something compelling to watch.
It's very important. Yes.

258
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,950
So, okay. Well speaking
of encounters like that,

259
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:43,370
you guys have clearly proven yourselves
capable of entertaining yourselves at

260
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:44,204
press junkets.

261
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,860
What's been aside from the Jimmy Fallon
thing that's been some of your favorite

262
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:53,440
sort of,
um,

263
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,710
well we went to Miami and went to
the Latin billboard awards this year,

264
00:15:58,711 --> 00:16:00,690
which was rad was a totally new,

265
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,700
the whole show isn't Spanish
and we speak Uhmm Poquito uh,

266
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,720
made for some awkward interview APP,
the whole red carpet.

267
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:14,070
And I presented and it was a,
it wasn't like us entertaining ourselves,

268
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:18,270
but that was certainly the coolest and
most different experience we had this

269
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:19,800
time doing press.
It was really fun.

270
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,810
What was it like sort of living out, cause
you know, you shot these huge concerts,

271
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,560
um,

272
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,200
what was it like sort of getting to live
out that pop star fantasy we got to is

273
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:34,380
fun, right? Fun. It's really fun.
Yeah, super drink preproduction.

274
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,590
Maroon five was nice enough to let
us go to one of their arena shows,

275
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:41,850
like a sold out arena show in like two
minutes before they would go on stage. Uh,

276
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,000
let us run up on stage and it was like
me and norm just with Mike's like,

277
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,810
it's like hi guys.
And we were like,

278
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,470
Andy's about to come out dressed
like this guy's name's Connor.

279
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,450
Someone literally booed when
they said that like already

280
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,050
they wanted him to be called Andy. I was
like so calm Conor. And he's like boom.

281
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,540
But uh, and then, uh,

282
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,510
we had cameras there and it was
kind of just almost a camera test.

283
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:08,250
But then a lot of the
footage we actually put in,

284
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,430
we just shot Andy and slow mo for like
two minutes just running around acting

285
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:12,360
like a superstar.

286
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,800
And it kind of gave us also like a true
image of what it should look like if

287
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,080
it's a full arena because it is.
And,

288
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,690
and the footage is like at the
trailers and stuff. And I don't know,

289
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:24,210
was that neat for you Andy, to run
out there and see what's super neat?

290
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,400
It was two minutes of pure heaven.

291
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,040
But, uh, there,

292
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,560
there are a lot of sort of absurd moments
within the film during the concerts

293
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:35,031
and like what,

294
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:38,670
what was sort of the level
of one upsmanship cause
some things that happened to

295
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:41,750
both your characters are, are, I don't,

296
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,760
I don't even know how to
describe comedically awful,

297
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,470
comedically awful.
That's the review the movie.

298
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,720
I was going to say like outrageous,
but I guess comedically awful. Um,

299
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,900
yeah. Uh, I think that we were,

300
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,520
we were pleasantly surprised when we
were screening the movie that a lot of,

301
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:06,660
some of the crazier jokes were
getting the reaction that we had.

302
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,620
Cause we obviously love sort of like
more over the top kind of bits and uh,

303
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:15,570
and so, uh, that was pleasantly
surprising. And there
are some things that, uh,

304
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:15,940
one,

305
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,670
one incident that you're referring to
that you're kindly not blowing the joke

306
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:24,900
for. Um, but yeah, it quite
outrageous and can't eat.

307
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,290
And Andy had to shave everything.

308
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,510
I shaved every inch of my body for this
part and it's like a kind of de Niro

309
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,740
Brando level of commitment,
I would say.

310
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:39,180
That's a fair comparison and if
you want to spread that around,

311
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:43,620
you can. Anybody could say that. It
doesn't matter who said it first,

312
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:48,650
whether it was like our camp or your camp
internet.

313
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,760
Nobody actually checks. Yeah, exactly.
That's just words. Just words.

314
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,230
Time to fact check for
while. But yeah, I don't,

315
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,850
don't highly recommend shaving
every part of your body. It's your,

316
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,160
your spouse doesn't like how it looks.

317
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,020
Where, were there ever any points where
you guys were just like, this is too much?

318
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:13,320
Or was it just sort of,
did you keep plussing all of it?

319
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,100
You just decided to editing?
Yeah, but no, like, no,

320
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:21,570
we didn't pull back at all really.
We back on one joke that is,

321
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,510
there's quite a few DVD
extras in this movie.

322
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:26,040
There's about an hour
and a half of extras.

323
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,690
It's maybe more than the actual movie, a
full feature of worth. That's April, May,

324
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,830
June. I'm going to ask this question just
because it's been in the news a bunch,

325
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:38,580
but, uh, there's, there's talk
of the junk in one of the shots.

326
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:40,230
I hope I'm not ruining this for everyone.
Oh,

327
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:45,210
that's what I thought you
were talking about earlier.

328
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,110
Yeah. That's why I brought up the
shares, a wardrobe malfunction,

329
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:52,230
seeing that she was referencing but
then there's also a limo scene with some

330
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:54,740
junk. Yeah. Junk. Is that,

331
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:00,170
well we are not going to say because
people have claimed that it's their junk.

332
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:05,630
Well we've heard that the got out that
it was Judd Apatow's and we're not really

333
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,840
like an [inaudible] should ask him and
ask him if he wants to kill with that.

334
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:16,320
It is a feeling he'll say yes.
But

335
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,390
to be fair though,
we do want to,

336
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,770
we should go on record saying that he
didn't want it to be nepotism or just

337
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:28,950
cause he's a producer.
He had been sending us the uh,

338
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,080
audition pictures or email for weeks
even before we had written the scene.

339
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:37,500
It was unclear. Yeah. Whether
or not it was like, yeah,

340
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:40,230
just be subject line would
just be like better lighting

341
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,180
might've just been a dick pics itch.
Yeah.

342
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,040
He just wanted us to see it in
different lighting, different scenarios,

343
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,240
um,

344
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,970
where you at different shirts and then
like what it would look like pressed on

345
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:55,420
glass, all kinds of things.
And uh, so he would,

346
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,280
he would just send us those and then he
said, just throw this in the mix, put it,

347
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,060
put it in, you know, take my name off it,

348
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:03,850
put it in with all the other picks you
guys are going to be looking through. I,

349
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,880
and he wanted to win the role naturally
based on talent and and you know,

350
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,070
not based on just cause he's a producer
and then he won the role he did. Yeah.

351
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,180
I think that shows a lot
of artistic integrity.

352
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,990
Exactly what on all of the great produce.
All of our parts on us especially. Yeah,

353
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:24,220
definitely on our part too.
Yeah. I'm glad it worked out. Um,

354
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,000
we'll take audience questions in a
minute if people want to line up. Um,

355
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,900
all right, so you guys are from the
bay, Hell's yells, correct? Yeah,

356
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,550
Berkeley about them.
Ooh.

357
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,430
If you could go back in time and tell
your Berkeley high sells when he's been

358
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,080
advice, what would it
be? Don't change a thing.

359
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,520
Don't change anything.

360
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:50,730
Your sense of humor at 12 we'll be your
sense of humor at Hecka old or like that

361
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:56,350
one time. Like you don't have
to take quite that many shrooms.

362
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,870
You're not going to go with it. It'll
still be fine without that extra few.

363
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,220
They'll kick in eventually. Yeah. It
just wait. Just wait. It's coming.

364
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,710
Stay the course.
Stay the course.

365
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,190
Hi,
I'm Courtney.

366
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,860
It's actually my 21st birthday and this
is probably like the best present I

367
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:18,310
could.
Yeah.

368
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:23,200
Oh, happy birthday. Hey today. Oh
right. You know you can drink now.

369
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,180
Yes.
That's so wild.

370
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,820
Yes, though I told my parents
that I probably be more, uh,

371
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,550
it'd be more likely that I pass out from
meeting you guys then drinking today,

372
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,460
but okay.

373
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,293
Do both

374
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,630
a drink responsibly that can
out for Courtney tonight.

375
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,380
Who's designated driver.
You what's driving cars or four?

376
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,780
Come on. Oh yeah, you can just
Uber it. Yeah, just do that.

377
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,750
Google stuff. The Google cars
I love. Those are safe. Right.

378
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,330
Unless there's a red light
that was ones do it.

379
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,100
There are ones just drive all over
the place, right? Yeah. Keith,

380
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,420
well do you want to tell it?
I they,

381
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,960
I have the Tesla and it
will just run a red light.

382
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:18,010
It's only what's in front of it. So it's
not like, yeah, check out the signage.

383
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:22,240
No. And you're just texting
and doing whatever you want.
Cause it buries driving.

384
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,480
That's what I call it. But to be
fair, he's got a real lead foot.

385
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,920
Very has a bit of a lead foot.
Yeah. And he'll just go fuck.

386
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,660
He'll float through that soccer.
Anyway, sorry, what was your question?

387
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,740
No, I love you guys and I
love Brooklyn. I nine Andy,

388
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,420
I see one show that I always bug
people to watch. Awesome. Thank you.

389
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,350
So I was wondering when is the rest of
the only on in going to be on Brooklyn?

390
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,190
Nine nine. Ooh, hard question. There

391
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,440
was talk of your and being on last season,

392
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:50,570
but he was so busy with this
movie that it didn't work out.

393
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:54,680
But I'm sure in the future he will and
Kieve doesn't really ever want to act,

394
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,570
so he could now that I'm in this movie
Guy, yeah, I have caught the bug.

395
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,170
Okay.

396
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:07,610
He's constantly doing like vocal
exercises and like body movement stuff.

397
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,990
Yeah. Very into movement. Very end
of movement. But yeah. Hopefully.

398
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:16,970
And uh, uh, since you, uh, Jake was
kind of based on you in the beginning,

399
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:20,660
how do you think Jake is kind of different
from you since he's kind of become

400
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:22,130
his own person at this point?

401
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:27,190
Um, well he's, aside from that, he's
a cop and you know, I ain't no pig.

402
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,283
MMM.

403
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,421
I Dunno.

404
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:36,770
I mean he's got like dysfunctional family
stuff that he's working through and

405
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:41,510
he's much smarter than me as well. Um,
he talks faster, he talks way faster.

406
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,090
The main difference, he's kind of like
the Cumberbatch of the comedy world,

407
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,990
I guess. I mean, you have noticed that
you guys usually have the same haircut.

408
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,090
Yeah. Me and Jay actually when
you guys are shooting. Yeah.

409
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,710
Jake and I usually have the same haircut.

410
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,420
What are you doing for
your birthday tonight?

411
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,330
Um, I don't really know yet.
I'm mostly working here.

412
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,280
Right.
So you guys,

413
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:08,281
let's get a towel every years for
one second and some cake cover yours.

414
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,160
Is there a secret cake?
Is it made of? It's it.

415
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,450
Okay.

416
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,470
Thank you so much for answering
my question. Yeah, happy
birthday. Happy Birthday.

417
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:23,880
Um, first of all, thank you guys for lazy
Sunday. I, this is my personal opinion,

418
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:27,360
but I think youtube is what it is because
of that video. So thank you. Thank you.

419
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:32,380
Thank you. Not on behalf of a
problem to root it out, but yeah. Um,

420
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,920
I've read that you guys
met in junior high or camp,

421
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,710
I'm not sure which one it is or
maybe both. Junior high for us.

422
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,130
Can you tell us your meat? Cute. Like
do you remember how you guys met?

423
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,020
Tell us some stories about
that. Well, yeah. Well,

424
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,490
me and Andy were like chatting up some
girls and then we saw your arm and he was

425
00:25:47,491 --> 00:25:48,324
being bullied

426
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,283
and

427
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,340
yeah, you guys don't laugh. And we were
like a real thing. You're like, ladies,

428
00:25:55,341 --> 00:26:00,020
hold on. Put It on ice for a second.
They were cool. They chilled. Yeah. Yeah.

429
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,900
And, and the sunglasses down we
went over. Yeah. We were like,

430
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:06,230
we got a problem here fellas. Yeah. Yeah.

431
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,610
Obviously they backed down and you'll
be like obvious Phyllis. Thank you.

432
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,690
Thanks guys. Where are you guys
going to get a Gig? You eat lunch.

433
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,490
Do you want to share a lunchables?
Yeah. And then we all had, uh, it's,

434
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:20,324
it's together.

435
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,580
So you should probably mention
we have been paid by its it to be

436
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,720
all right. We'll go with that. All
right. Thank you. Thank you. Hi Guys. Um,

437
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,350
thank you for the digital shorts.
They're brilliant. Thank you.

438
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,770
You've been on the sets of,
on the set of girls. Um,

439
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,570
does Lena Dunham ever
wearing your clothes?

440
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:47,280
Not In one of the scenes that I
like one of our longest scenes. Uh,

441
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,300
no, she was wearing just a
mesh top the whole time. Um,

442
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,360
and I was maybe more impressive seeing
her direct simultaneously and then act

443
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,900
and readjust your lines. I
like, so she's like rewriting,

444
00:27:00,901 --> 00:27:04,950
directing and also being nude at the
same time. And you're just like this.

445
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,160
She's incredible. She's really
incredible. Thank you. Um, yeah,

446
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,810
but she'd worked close the
rest of the time though.

447
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,880
Hey guys. Thanks for being here. Um,

448
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,630
I'm also a big fan of the digital
shorts and I was hoping you could talk a

449
00:27:17,631 --> 00:27:21,440
little about your writing process.
Like how do you go from, like,

450
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,980
we should write a song about being in
each other's moms to actually deciding

451
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:27,770
which ones to carry through.
Are there any you wish you'd done?

452
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,000
How do you go from like
idea to a full length video?

453
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:37,170
Any you wish you hadn't done right?
Right.

454
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,700
Yeah, most of them. Um,

455
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,940
well that one specifically it was
because it was mother's Day actually.

456
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,190
It was the mother's Day episode. Trying
to give a gift that kept on giving. Yeah.

457
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,790
Uh, it, it happens all kinds of ways.

458
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:57,940
I mean that was a rare case where it
was actually motivated by something. Um,

459
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:02,010
Dick in a box is the same.
It was the Christmas episode and then

460
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,240
specifically at SNL for those ones.

461
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:09,241
I mean we knew something had to be on
TV that Saturday and it would be Tuesday

462
00:28:09,281 --> 00:28:12,490
and then a lot of times we'd stay and
we'd stay up all night and if we were

463
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:14,620
really lucky we would have come to it.

464
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,490
But a lot of times we wouldn't really
like and we'd stay up all night Wednesday

465
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:22,600
and we would then stay up all night
Thursday until basically challenging

466
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,070
ourselves to think of something better.

467
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,320
And sometimes like for
instance with mother lover,

468
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,530
the idea was cracked on Tuesday and we
kept trying to make it better and oh no

469
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,590
it gets on that what we do is settle
down the gold settled on that on Tuesday.

470
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:35,930
Yeah. The golden rule of
that. And that's the third.

471
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,910
The third one we had the idea Tuesday but
didn't trust it and kept trying to top

472
00:28:39,911 --> 00:28:41,200
it until eventually.

473
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,610
And like on Wednesday night and
Timberland we gotta just kept saying like,

474
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:47,980
cause like you guys are great at it.
That's a great idea. Let's just do that.

475
00:28:47,981 --> 00:28:51,360
And we're like, no, no, we gotta be
sure was like no too. It's funny.

476
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,980
Uh, yeah, but that's our basic product.
And then once you say like, okay,

477
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:56,611
that's the premise,

478
00:28:56,611 --> 00:29:00,030
then we put the beat that we're going
to record on on a loop and we just sit

479
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:04,170
there with pads or on our computers and
write as many joke ideas as possible or

480
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:09,060
like little pieces of versus and like
read them to each other out loud and go

481
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:11,940
like help me finish this line.
I have the setup that I think is funny.

482
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,850
What's the punchline?
What rhymes with this? Um,

483
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,870
and sort of cobble it all together
together. Yeah. Then we kind of, yeah.

484
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:22,050
Then we do put it all together. Like,
Oh, who has the best first line? No,

485
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,780
actually your line would be good first
and then we should do this one of mine or,

486
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,110
yeah.

487
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,840
So we kind of group write it at that
point and it would just light a bunch of

488
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:32,600
candles and I just let the
harmony. Hello. All right,

489
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,610
well thank you. Thanks. Thank you, Margo.

490
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,700
Hi. Um, thanks again for being
here. I Love Brooklyn nine nine.

491
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,793
I also think,

492
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:46,240
yeah, also had, I think my
dad might be a captain Holt,

493
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:51,100
like long lost twin, but we can
chat about that later I guess. Yeah.

494
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,490
Um, I'm also wondering, um, really
my brother is wondering, uh,

495
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:00,320
when will there be a hot rod too?

496
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:09,780
1990 never when pigs fly.
I mean,

497
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,310
not like we'd be opposed to it,

498
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:14,520
but it's not like that made
a killing the box office.

499
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,120
Yeah.
Thanks for the question.

500
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:24,930
Yeah,
good answer.

501
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,323
Thanks for coming guys.

502
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,030
Could you tell us about how you were
able to stick together through your whole

503
00:30:29,031 --> 00:30:29,361
career?

504
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,360
Particularly like through auditioning
for SNL now you got something to take all

505
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:36,930
three. Just the money, right? Whoa.

506
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,670
No, we're, I mean, we got
very lucky at that Bowman.

507
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,270
That's probably the closest we've ever
come to having it be that we would have

508
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,680
really been on different paths.

509
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:53,950
Was when we were getting considered by
SNL and they had met all three of us.

510
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,370
But then Andy auditioned
and then there was a moment,

511
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,330
basically it was about it like
fog stories today was like,

512
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:05,540
he was tired where we kind of knew he was
hired and we weren't sure if they were

513
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:06,021
going to say,
hey,

514
00:31:06,021 --> 00:31:08,900
we have one writing position and
it can be one of the two of you.

515
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,830
There was no way for them to know we
turn in a writing packet but all three,

516
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,460
it was the three of us
together had written it.

517
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,970
They didn't know us well enough to be
like, oh we want that one or that one.

518
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:18,890
So it would have been kind of arbitrary.

519
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,180
So I think they knew they either had to
hire both of us or none of us. Um, yeah,

520
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:26,510
but that, I mean they didn't have to, and
then we had a little pact that was if,

521
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,700
if two guys got hired,

522
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,320
the second guy who was as a writer would
not take the job so that the two of us

523
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:36,220
could continue to what's it's the worst
would be for one guy to get left. Yeah.

524
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,340
So we made that pack,

525
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:41,180
but also we weren't going to like hold
Andy back if he got hired from going on

526
00:31:41,181 --> 00:31:42,500
his own.
And you never did.

527
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,453
Hey guys,

528
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,180
I actually took the day off to
be an extra in the movie. Oh No.

529
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,860
Have you seen it? Did you make
your cut? Was that the forum?

530
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,960
That's what my question is.
Did I make the cut?

531
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,310
What was it at the forum stuff?

532
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,230
So it was it the Inglewood Auditorium.

533
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,470
So I was in the bin Ladin one.
So it was like this up against the stage.

534
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,090
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

535
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,510
I love kid contact. Oh yeah, no,

536
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:28,344
that's not him.

537
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,040
That was the second part to the question
is I know that we filmed like a lot of

538
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:35,400
songs. Did all of them make it into
the movie or is there going to be just,

539
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,520
yeah, your odds are better and you
guys go the movie to support her.

540
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,000
Really important. I'm expecting
my check in the mail too. Yeah.

541
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,640
Uh, no, not all. Not all this hot.
All the songs are in the movie,

542
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,910
but they are all on this soundtrack,

543
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,860
which is like chock full of extras.

544
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,170
Uh, kind of circling back
to the earlier question,

545
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,610
we wrote many, many, many songs.
Then we whittled them down. Yes.

546
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,200
I think we wrote like 40 songs,
let's say. Okay. Or maybe 50.

547
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:13,580
Even then we widdled it down to like our
favorite 25 and then we probably shot

548
00:33:13,581 --> 00:33:18,200
15 of them. And then uh, those 15
well there's about 15 in the movie,

549
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:22,300
probably in one way or another. There's
been, the soundtrack has 25. There's a,

550
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:25,790
there's a song with a con that we shot
the whole thing and we loved and it just

551
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:26,151
didn't work.

552
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:31,151
Plot wise of that is not in the movie
or songs that it would be the strongest

553
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:34,280
songs that just couldn't
fit storywise yeah.

554
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,620
When it comes down to
cutting songs like that.

555
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:41,020
Do you guys tend to agree or is there
ever sort of like discord amongst our,

556
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:44,450
their tie breakers inside promotion
though? Third strong discussions. Yeah,

557
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:48,950
during discussions, but it generally it's
to do with what serves the story best.

558
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,270
Um, and there's something freeing about
knowing that there would be a soundtrack

559
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:56,960
where they would live so we wouldn't have
spent time on something that we really

560
00:33:56,961 --> 00:34:01,580
liked and know that it would, it
wouldn't just disappear. Usually if,

561
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,380
if one of us has a problem with an idea,

562
00:34:03,381 --> 00:34:07,970
there is something slightly flawed
about it and then like us all discussing

563
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:11,600
together and fixing whatever that problem
is, just makes it better at the end. So,

564
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,263
oh,

565
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,450
thanks.
Democracy rules you guys.

566
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:22,140
We'll take our last few
audience questions. Okay. Hi
Guys. Hi. Great to meet you.

567
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:27,060
And Goldie, uh, I've been a huge
fan of yours since. Awesome town,

568
00:34:27,061 --> 00:34:30,870
which had the best song intro ever.

569
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,260
Any plans for awesome town,
the movie or the musical?

570
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:40,590
No, that's the other question again, which
is very nice to people. Like, by the way,

571
00:34:40,591 --> 00:34:44,310
that song was completely ripped off
from fraggle rock. You're just like,

572
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,570
even though like clap,
clap, kind of thing. Uh,

573
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:51,450
but just changed enough so
we wouldn't get sued. Uh, no,

574
00:34:51,451 --> 00:34:54,840
there's no immediate plans for rosin.
Towe are kind of,

575
00:34:54,841 --> 00:34:59,340
banks are real lives are kind
of awesome town. Like, oh.

576
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:04,050
Uh Huh. Uh Huh. Fuck
you keep, that's fair.

577
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,820
Thanks for coming in today.
Aside from its,

578
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:10,760
it's are you guys excited about anything
else? Being back in the bay area

579
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,690
besides the warriors? I was
very, I was at the big one.

580
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:17,700
How was that game seven with my dad.
It was fucking awesome.

581
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:23,710
Uh, yeah, just coming home and
seeing our families and smelling,

582
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,030
smelling, smelling debt. Good air. We're,

583
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,500
we're uh, Gordo, Tuckeria guys, uh,

584
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,320
our nails in Berkeley. You're
talking about food, right?

585
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,700
Like other food that we like.
Yeah.

586
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,260
Thanks.
Um,

587
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,730
so are you guys ever attempted to,
uh, expand into other sort of mediums?

588
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:46,730
Because if you did a a Broadway play,

589
00:35:46,731 --> 00:35:50,600
you could theoretically be the first
people to Igor because of a song about a

590
00:35:50,601 --> 00:35:53,870
Dick in a box. That's true.
Is there a temptation there?

591
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,263
Well,

592
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,280
who should we get to do the Timberlake
part on Broadway because he'll never do

593
00:36:00,281 --> 00:36:03,910
it.
Stamos Stamos

594
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,640
done great. We'll make the
call. We look forward to it.

595
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,070
Um,

596
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:15,300
I think my last question for you guys is
if you had to each bring one album with

597
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:17,280
you to a deserted lonely island,
what would it be?

598
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,210
Mm hmm.
Hmm.

599
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,760
It's so hard to say without
sounding like a dick. Uh, for me,

600
00:36:25,761 --> 00:36:27,070
just like a sound effect CD,

601
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,660
just like goofy sound effects
just to make me giggle,

602
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,320
laugh part sounds and stuff and like
just city sounds or like, you know,

603
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:35,420
it'll be like, oh, that
sounded like a door slamming.

604
00:36:35,421 --> 00:36:37,220
That's actually kinda probably smart.
You know what I mean?

605
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:39,920
Cause he'll probably have missed
the foundation. Yeah, there you go.

606
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,610
That's what I was trying to say.
Just maybe like blood on the tracks.

607
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,670
I don't know.
Something I probably Yoyo Ma,

608
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:51,090
just best of outcomes.

609
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:56,540
Just best of Yoyo Ma.
I like what I liked the hits,

610
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:02,000
you know, the one that he does,
just the ones that get me hyped.

611
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:06,710
So basically just the crouching tiger,
Sandra. I mean, that'd be one of them.

612
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,740
Which just the number ones.

613
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,280
Well, thank you guys so
much for joining us today.

614
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,130
Had started [inaudible] everyone to go.
Thanks guys

615
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,030
for fun.
