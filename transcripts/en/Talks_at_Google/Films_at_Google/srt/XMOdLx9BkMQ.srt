1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,070
We are thrilled to have,
uh,

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:09,180
two folks really intimately involved
obviously by his face on the screen.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,940
Um,
with Richard Link ladders film boyhood.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,660
Uh, Matt Linkous is an
accomplished photographer,

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,690
local here to Austin and in 2002 he was
asked to take annual photographs of the

6
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:28,310
cast of boyhood to capture them throughout
the film process and he just released

7
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:33,311
his book boyhood 12 years of film
featuring his right his photos and some

8
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:35,180
writings from the cast and his time.

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,420
And then joining Matt
today is Ellar Coltrane,

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,110
so also an Austinite and a
star of the movie boyhood.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,730
We're so lucky to have them both as their
crazy schedules on the award circuit

12
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:49,370
have kept them pretty busy
over the fast few weeks.

13
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:51,650
So we're excited they could
stop here with us today.

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,660
They were nominated for six academy
awards and they just won several Golden

15
00:00:56,661 --> 00:00:59,720
Globes. Something that I think all
of us here in Austin are pretty,

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,741
pretty proud of.

17
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:05,741
So leading the conversation with Matt
and Ellora today is Chilay Nafis who's

18
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:08,630
director of programming at
the Austin film society.

19
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,980
Thanks so much for coming and without
further delay. Here are the guys.

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,490
I'm curious how many of you have seen,
boy,

21
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,830
if you haven't lie please.
Okay, no that's great.

22
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,510
I think then you're going to really
enjoy this and learn a lot. Um,

23
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,570
all of us have seen probably countless
films in which a main character grows up.

24
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,390
Often that character is played by a
person at six one at 12 one at 18 three

25
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:40,400
different actors,

26
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:44,630
but we're trying that particular character
and we've gotten accustomed to that.

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,080
What Richard Linklater has
done is completely unique,

28
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,090
taking Ellar Coltrane and filming him,
others over a 12 year period,

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,010
portions of each year.

30
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,210
So we literally see her grow up on state,
on screen.

31
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,420
So when he came through the door,
I didn't even recognize him today.

32
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,150
He continues to evolve.

33
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,360
So let's just start with a
question you're always asked.

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,450
How did you get involved with the project?

35
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,630
Richard is actually said that he thought
you had a very theorial mind and he was

36
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:21,110
fascinated with how you thought as a
young child. So tell us how that happened.

37
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,020
If I had to guess,

38
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,090
he saw a like mind that's a lot of,

39
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,710
I mean Richard has a really
hands on casting process and

40
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,060
no,
um,

41
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,400
he's much more interested in kind of
getting to know people than he is and like

42
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:48,240
how well you can memorize a
page and a half of dialogue. Um,

43
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,020
and so that's kind of what, you
know, I had been auditioning a lot.

44
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:59,021
I did a lot of theater when I was really
little and had gotten a with the talent

45
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,520
agency in town. Um, I was like five,

46
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:08,521
I guess I had one small part in a movie
called Lone Star State of mind that was

47
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:14,230
filmed here in when I was six. I got
the audition with Richard in that end.

48
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:17,770
It was very just, I mean I think they
were probably six or seven callbacks,

49
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,310
but he didn't have a script
for me to read or anything.

50
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:24,430
So it was just kind of a
conversation. Um, you know,

51
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,900
I think he had me bring in art that
I had made and talked to my parents

52
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:33,650
obviously, and we just kind of
bonded for a couple of weeks and,

53
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,170
and that's,
you know,

54
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,130
kind of everyone on the set is that's
kind of his relationship, you know,

55
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:43,870
it's very kind of about being friends
and being able to collaborate together

56
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,870
first before anything else.

57
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,053
Taking

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,610
courage you as soon cause they were
going to be part of this for 12 years.

59
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,310
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I,
you know, I think they,

60
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,030
my parents have always kind of struck
a good balance of supporting me but not

61
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:10,481
being like the dreaded stage parents that
are trying to live vicariously through

62
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:12,800
their child. So they
were definitely, I mean,

63
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:16,510
they love Richard's work and so
they were definitely excited. Um,

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,350
but also, you know, I, it was
definitely a long decision.

65
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:23,300
Does it is a great commitment
and they didn't want him.

66
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,790
No one wanted to push me into it.
So,

67
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,060
uh,

68
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,290
Matt came in at year two,
photographing on the south,

69
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,850
taking portraits and all that. Tell
us how that came to be. Sister,

70
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,170
Kathleen and Sutherland was the producer
and actually production coordinator on

71
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:44,920
the first year, second year. And
then she hired me. I'll do stills.

72
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,020
And early on I saw an
opportunity to do portraits,

73
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:53,860
which is one of my favorite things
to do, portraits of people. Um,

74
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,340
I do still once a year maybe
on a film or commercial.

75
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,780
So to have that opportunity present
itself and know that I was going to,

76
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,850
as long as Kathleen was on the movie,

77
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:08,620
I would be on his nepotism
is alive and well here. Um,

78
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,210
so yeah, so when I took the opportunity
to, to make these portraits,

79
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:15,880
this is actually one of the
first portraits I made, um,

80
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,980
was actually a Eller and I'm
just very simple, simplistic, um,

81
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,640
black and white on black background.
And um,

82
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,330
I just wanted to continue that every
year we're going to discuss the portraits

83
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,530
in greater detail in a
little while. Um, Eller,

84
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,540
there's a tendency for a lot of viewers
to almost think this is your life in one

85
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:41,470
way or another. Uh, so just
to, I have several questions.

86
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,600
Tried to distinguish our,

87
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:48,601
to show where there was some overlap
between you and the character mason.

88
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,700
It's a narrative film,
not a documentary,

89
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,780
but I think at times there must
have been elements of you, um,

90
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,060
the open,
the film opens with you looking at

91
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:04,130
the sky daydreaming where you a
daydreamer as a child. Absolutely. Good.

92
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,770
That's why you got,
there's this,

93
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:11,771
there's this interview from late year
one or two I think that we unearthed that

94
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,090
is probably mine. Maybe it maybe is
on the DVD, I don't know. But um,

95
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,681
and it,

96
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:22,790
when it opens there's a
good like 30 seconds where I
maybe I didn't know we were

97
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:27,440
filming and I'm just kind of like
muttering to myself and just like looking

98
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:31,460
around and just kind of like, and then
he's like Eller and I'm like, oh hey.

99
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,740
My niece stared out the window for 12
years of public school and she's an artist

100
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:41,730
also. So, um, your character,

101
00:06:41,731 --> 00:06:46,530
mason is very interested in
animals in nature. Is that
true view? Yes. Absolutely.

102
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,880
Okay, very good. We'll just go
through these quickly. We'll get,

103
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,770
have a check list. A, your older sister,
Samantha is played by Richard Linklater,

104
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:59,990
his daughter Laura lie. And for the
most part, you all have standards,

105
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,320
sibling animosity on screen in
many ways until you're older.

106
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,450
Do you have any siblings?

107
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,120
I mean, I have a nine year old sister, so
it's a very different relationship but,

108
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:18,000
but there'll be the Lorelei also has
younger sisters, so uh, you know,

109
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,080
anything that relationship formed pretty
naturally that we both kind of wanted a

110
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:29,430
sibling and we're able to sort of, you
know, obviously we didn't live together,

111
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:32,950
but we were able to sort of
fill that role and you know,

112
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,180
we're at each other's throats
instantly. Okay. Uh, when she's saying,

113
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,650
oops, I did it again, I wanted to throw
all the pillows at her and make her stop,

114
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,260
you know,
in lower lights defense though.

115
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,490
[inaudible] she wanted to stay and I
think was gentlemen prefer blondes. She's,

116
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,140
she's a little cooler than the
list. Correct. Alright. Uh,

117
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,430
Patricia Arquette,
you're fell model where you,

118
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,520
so Harry Potter to where you are Harry
Potter founders or trial and you know,

119
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:03,450
I actually wasn't,

120
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:08,030
that was one thing that I like go in,
go into the,

121
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:11,390
I never went to any of the book opening,
so it was right.

122
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,920
I was worried about you in that scene
and I thought there was no way that's

123
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:18,940
Eller. That is amazing
being able to do that. Okay.

124
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,690
Uh, Ethan Hawke is your dad tries to
get you interested in sports, football,

125
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:27,030
baseball, uh, bowling. Uh,

126
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,290
did you have to do about a
hundred shops to bowl so badly?

127
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,060
I don't think so. I think, I think
I'm just pretty bad at bowling a,

128
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:40,430
we did like a photo shoot recently where
we kind of recreated that scene and I

129
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,690
didn't do much better.

130
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,590
Um, finally on this part, um,

131
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,550
in the film Mason goes to 12 years of
public school and you were primarily

132
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,010
homeschool. Uh, how did
you feel? I think you

133
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,640
went to high school for a
while. I was at school. Yeah,

134
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:04,350
that's definitely the
biggest kind of difference.

135
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,070
Um, is that, cause I, you know, my,

136
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,000
my social dynamic was very
different growing up and,

137
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,340
and see,
I mean then I was really,

138
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:16,780
I mean that was one also one of the
most interesting parts of, you know,

139
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,690
having this sort of parallel,
you know, story tracing.

140
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:26,520
My, my own life is getting to kind of go
and like pretend to be in these schools

141
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:29,180
situations, which was
very foreign to me. So,

142
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,550
but obviously something that all the
most of my friends were in school,

143
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:36,210
so it was always this, you know, I
was very aware of this environment,

144
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:40,770
but get him to go kind of pretend for a
couple of days was pretty interesting.

145
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,730
So Matt, um, after you
started with your two,

146
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,200
did you go to the set every day of
filming or how did you decide when to go?

147
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,960
Yeah,
I was the onset photographer,

148
00:09:52,961 --> 00:09:56,560
so I was shooting stills of the action
of the film and then also behind the

149
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:59,740
scenes shots, which are going up
every now and again over there.

150
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,520
So it was basically documenting
the way the film was made.

151
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,390
Richard Directing Eller,
Richard Interacting with Patricia,

152
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,250
Laura Lion. And, uh, and Ethan
when Ethan was onset and um,

153
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,480
what I would do is each year I would pick
a day that I knew all the actors would

154
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:19,030
be onset.
Most of the time they were,

155
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:22,980
but sometimes it would overlap
by a day or two. And um,

156
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,760
I would choose a location nearby set
and make my portraits on the one day.

157
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,530
And once I got everybody
documented for that year,

158
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:32,980
I wouldn't necessarily do the portraits
on another day of shooting that

159
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:38,050
particular year. Does that make sense?
Everything you're saying makes sense. Uh,

160
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:42,550
how, how do you manage to be almost
invisible as a still photographer on set?

161
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,080
How do you manage to be almost
invisible, not obtrusive and all? Well,

162
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:51,130
you have to get a good relationship with
the first lady who's leading all the

163
00:10:51,131 --> 00:10:51,431
action,

164
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:56,020
which has vents and then also with the
other cameraman and the acs that work on

165
00:10:56,021 --> 00:11:01,021
the camera assistant camera because
you need to be right next to the camera

166
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,300
getting similar shots.
But sometimes I would float around and,

167
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,620
and just Eller got comfortable with
me real quick and that was great.

168
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,150
If I was in Patricia's
eyeline or Ethan's eyeline,

169
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,490
that would kind of disrupt things.

170
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:15,730
So you kind of have to do
the exactly what you said.

171
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:18,640
Try to be invisible as much
as you can and be low key.

172
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:23,630
And I'm kind of a low key person
so it wasn't too hard to do. Uh,

173
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,930
Rick Linklater is very famous for
the relaxed atmosphere on his saps.

174
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,270
Um,
did that help in some ways?

175
00:11:31,271 --> 00:11:34,810
Just the set atmosphere affect
your Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

176
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,210
I've worked on sets where the
director is not very nice like that.

177
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,940
Like Rick and Rick has, um, puts
everybody at ease on the, on the set.

178
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:46,690
I've never heard him raise his
voice wants, um, literally. And um,

179
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,230
Tyler might happen, you know, back when
rehearsals or something, I don't know,

180
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,250
but uh,
no,

181
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,200
Rick is very easy going and it makes else
at ease and everybody just does their

182
00:11:56,201 --> 00:12:00,430
work and everybody's professional and
everybody knows that they have all have a

183
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:03,010
job to do and that's what makes
it come together cohesively.

184
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,720
And that's what makes,
that's what the beauty of this picture is,

185
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:10,330
is that we put all this effort into it
and we have this beautiful body of work.

186
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:15,540
So, uh, the photo you took of
Mason getting his buzz cut,

187
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,930
he's actually smiling
or laughing in the film.

188
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:21,300
He's definitely not smiling at all.

189
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,440
So that in a sense that it gave me a
different reading of that scene. I mean,

190
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:30,060
obviously that was Eller, whereas in
the film it's Mason reacting that way.

191
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,250
Uh,
why'd you decide to print that one?

192
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,770
For that exact reason? I wanted to show
that Eller was actually quite happy kid.

193
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:40,430
It gets haircut during that scene, or
at least I can't speak for him directly,

194
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:45,050
but he seemed to be how
we hot here. Yeah. So,

195
00:12:45,051 --> 00:12:48,620
um, yeah, Eller was very happy
to have his hair cut and,

196
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,730
but he had to play the scene.

197
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:53,660
So I did a few takes where he was actually
smiling and that's one of the ones

198
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:56,390
that I wanted to put in the book
and having the book for sure.

199
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:02,840
And just a bit of technology. But describe
your, your equipment, your cameras,

200
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,700
lenses. Well. Um,

201
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,530
I started out shooting digital for the
production stills and behind the scenes,

202
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:12,650
which I knew it was just going
to change as far as pixels,

203
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:15,320
but that would always be the same
and what I wanted to do with,

204
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,650
so I use a digital camera,
a Nikon, Nikon, um,

205
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,040
now for the film stuff. I
originally started shooting
on film on a hostile blog,

206
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,150
which is this image here.

207
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,630
And then I had a Polaroid converted
from a land camera that shot pack film

208
00:13:32,091 --> 00:13:34,040
Polaroid that had a
positive and a negative.

209
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,700
So I could look at the positive picture
and know that I had the negative and

210
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:41,270
then I put it in the water and wash
it later and I have a negative.

211
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,370
And then as time wore on, Polaroid went
out of business by about year eight,

212
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:51,030
so I didn't shoot Polaroid anymore
and had to go back to film. Um,

213
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,730
just straight four by five film.

214
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,620
And the majority of the portraits are
shot on a four by five camera. That's, um,

215
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,860
a wooden field camera made in
Japan called the Tacho Hora with a,

216
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,280
just a basic normal lens.
And really at the end of the day,

217
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:09,281
it's extremely simple camera that gets
the subject involved with the process.

218
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:14,580
And Eller himself was great.
He, he loves posing. I mean, I,

219
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,340
I don't know if he loved it, but he was
very amicable to me and to to do it all.

220
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:23,750
And um, and then later on Ethan would,
after a couple of years of coming back,

221
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,160
you can go, oh, I love that camera.

222
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:29,750
And then he'd be more inclined to spend
a little more time with me posing.

223
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,340
Not that I would take them, you
know, for an hour at a time.

224
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,760
Literally I do the shoot
about three or four minutes.

225
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,310
So it was a very quick process.

226
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,000
Okay. I'll go back to acting. Um,

227
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:47,290
how did you and Rick actually work say
in your childhood and later on as far as

228
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:50,720
action line, delivery,
body language, facial,

229
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,130
all of that? Um, I mean there's,

230
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,800
there's kind of an amazing, and you know,
a lot of what Richard does it, I mean,

231
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,110
I assume for most of his movies,

232
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:08,060
but definitely with this one is a lot,
or for her soul, you know, the, the,

233
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,840
the, the script is kind of constantly
change. And you know what I mean?

234
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:16,430
He would come, he would
come to two s, you know,

235
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:21,410
maybe a week out before shooting and
have, you know, a basic script, you know,

236
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,450
scenes written for that year,
but,

237
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,140
and then we would spend the next two week
rehearsing and rewriting bits of that

238
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:30,350
and, you know, and taking things
from our own lives. And, you know,

239
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:33,120
like you were saying, there's a lot of,
not just me, but all of us, you know,

240
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:37,340
there's a lot of, all of, you know,
Patricia and Ethan as well in the,

241
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,170
in the characters and just in
the, the world in general. Um,

242
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,270
and that rehearsal process would, was
on going, you know, into, into filming.

243
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:52,180
So there was little,
there was little difference in,

244
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:55,700
in kind of the atmosphere between
rehearsing and filming. You know,

245
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:57,920
we kind of joke that it's like a
lot of time you don't even know.

246
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,730
It's like suddenly you're just
rehearsing and then he's like, okay,

247
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,580
we got it and you're done. And, and that
is kind of how it felt, you know? So,

248
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,340
and that's an art, you know,
that's something that has,

249
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,950
when I was young I wasn't really aware of,

250
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:13,890
but that's an amazing balance to be
able to strike, to make it toward you.

251
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,480
You know, there's no, there's no
pressure of like, oh I'm on camera.

252
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:20,790
And especially when I was young, you know,
it changed as I got older and you know,

253
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,520
kind of became more confident
and aware of myself as an actor.

254
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:29,470
But when, you know, when I was
seven and then when Laurel,

255
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:33,190
I was so young, it's, that's
really valuable, you know,

256
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:38,010
to just be able to not feel pressured
and not feel on the spot, you know,

257
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:40,850
cause they think all kids like to pretend,
you know,

258
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:45,230
when it comes really naturally,
it's really easy to act
when you're seven, eight,

259
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:49,760
nine. But the problem is that a lot
of kids are pressured, you know,

260
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:52,460
you feel like you have to
perform and be cute or you know,

261
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,590
try to please the people around you.
And,

262
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,530
and Richard did a really good
job of making it, you know,

263
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,810
making me feel like an equal.

264
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,380
Then also just making me feel comfortable
so that I was able to, you know,

265
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,510
do what I had been doing for years

266
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,740
and I don't, yeah, I
mean as, I don't know,

267
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:14,590
as far as like a direct direction,
it,

268
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,530
it never felt like,
I mean he would say little things,

269
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:23,340
but a lot of it was just kind of born
out of the rehearsal process, you know,

270
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:25,650
so that when we were actually filming,
he didn't,

271
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,550
we'd already kind of knew what
he wanted, you know. Great.

272
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,080
Um,

273
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,080
was the scene with your alcoholic
Stepdad scary or fine cause that glass or

274
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,870
whatever brakes right in front of
you on your plate that was, um,

275
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,270
both they think.
Do you know what I mean?

276
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:44,490
It was definitely a
decider and there's not,

277
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,710
there's not a lot of like real acting
in the movie. And then, you know,

278
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,180
something explosive like that is certainly
your site. I know, but I think it,

279
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:55,170
I mean I'm sure, I think
it was scary too. You know,

280
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:57,810
it's the kind of thing that you kind of,
it's easy to

281
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,580
ignore it when you're a kid,
but looking back it's like,

282
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:07,530
it definitely was an intense
experience, but, but they also,

283
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,170
you know, we like Patricia
with, you know, they would all,

284
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:14,640
everybody would start kind of joking in
between tapes to sort of distract us I

285
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:17,790
guess from the gravity of the content.

286
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,380
Um,
since we would get together every year.

287
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,760
How soon ahead of filming
did you know what was going,

288
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,640
what the basic actions
are big for that year?

289
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,160
Um,
I mean generally at the end of each year,

290
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:37,040
Rick would give me some kind
of idea of like, hey, you know,

291
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:41,120
next year you're going to
go on this camping trip or
you're going to meet a girl

292
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:45,590
or, you know, or whatever.
And, and then throughout the
year. And we would, you know,

293
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,510
he would call me and take me to lunch
two or three times and kind of just

294
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:51,231
compare,
you know,

295
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:56,120
his whatever ideas he would have and kind
of asked me about what had been going

296
00:18:56,121 --> 00:19:00,470
on in my life and, you know, see
where the two might overlap. Um,

297
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,290
so I generally had a pretty good idea,
you know,

298
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,770
I had a lot of time to kind of think
about that. Exactly. You know, what,

299
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,660
what Mason was doing and how I could
use my own experiences to kind of inform

300
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:15,560
that. Um, but then like I
said, the, you know, the,

301
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:17,750
a lot of times the final script,

302
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,460
the final dialogue wasn't printed
until the morning of the shoot,

303
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,550
which would be maddening for many actors.
But,

304
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,640
but if you're not a part of writing it,
I mean, it's, it, that's the thing that,

305
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,380
that's why is because we had been
rehashing it and rehearsing it for a week.

306
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,210
So it's,
it's not like we needed a memory.

307
00:19:35,211 --> 00:19:38,510
We already knew the lines because we
were there and when he wrote them.

308
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,431
So it was,
you know,

309
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:45,431
it was definitely constantly
evolving but also very long.

310
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:49,610
You know, law enforcement
was a very longterm kind of
process for each, you know,

311
00:19:49,611 --> 00:19:50,421
15 minutes.

312
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:55,421
We had a whole year to kind of rehash it
and figure out exactly the right tone.

313
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:02,030
Matt, going to your portraits
or four by five portraits,

314
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,160
which are really stunningly beautiful.

315
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,110
What was your method of,
did you direct that?

316
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:10,700
People are what?

317
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,480
Mostly I would just kind of have them
in character in front of my background,

318
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,230
just looking directly at the camera
and if you've ever seen a four by five

319
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:23,960
camera, it's a, it's a slow
process to say the least.

320
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,350
It's the old camera where you have to
put a hood on and look underneath on the

321
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,700
ground glass and focus.

322
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,680
So I would have elder stand there or
Patricia or whomever and I would say,

323
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:38,450
okay, hold on, let me get focused. They
would just kind of, you know, look at,

324
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,260
you know, look at the camera.
I'd say, okay, hold still,

325
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,110
I'm going to drop the film.
They're still looking still.

326
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:50,050
W I think what's captivating a lot of
these is that they really have an intense

327
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:54,760
look right into the camera.
As far as directing them.
I didn't do much direction.

328
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,450
Patricia's of wonderful professionals,
she didn't need any direction. I,

329
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:02,500
I would say maybe on after I did a
couple of frames of just a straight

330
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:05,200
expression, I would say let's
do one a little friendlier.

331
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,770
She might let us a little smile in there.
Lro I would do the same. Eller would,

332
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,580
you know,

333
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,050
we would go through a range of emotions
and expressions and mostly it was get

334
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,800
the,
the kind of the serious ones out of,

335
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,330
out of the way first and
then go into whatever,

336
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,310
you know, hanging out, whatever.
Looking at camera. Pretty simple.

337
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,230
I need to get through to teach me
how to smile for the camera. It's,

338
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,630
it's easy to do that in real life.
Uh,

339
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,200
so if you were doing a lot of
these three or four minutes,

340
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:37,840
what is your shooting ratio?
It's not very high.

341
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,820
I think you mean the number
of shots that you're taking?

342
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:45,460
The final choice.
So the for the fall

343
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,350
by five film,
so there's two sheets on a back,

344
00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:52,610
you turn it over and it's quite simple.
But for Ela I would probably do,

345
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,860
you know, for holders, eight sheets,

346
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,820
eight shots and then I would do all the
digital shots cause I'm also having to

347
00:21:58,821 --> 00:22:01,970
be wary of their time away from set.
So,

348
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,050
and placate when they want to actually
do the pictures. Like, you know,

349
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,290
some of them were a little more
reluctant on having their pictures taken.

350
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,170
Eller was never that way.
Um,

351
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,410
Patricia wouldn't want to spend more than
five minutes just because she wants to

352
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:17,960
do other things. Um, Ethan was okay. He,

353
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:21,260
he'd loved doing them and
Lorelei was fine as well. Um,

354
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,890
and I'm not trying to say Patricia was
doing anything unprofessional. She was,

355
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,100
she just wanted to get it done and out
of the way. She didn't want to linger.

356
00:22:28,101 --> 00:22:32,780
Like Ellery she Eller is interested
in the photographic process.

357
00:22:32,781 --> 00:22:36,020
So that was, you know, that was
nice to see and made my job easier.

358
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,380
So have you been tempted to
do any time lapse photos?

359
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,450
Showing them age very quickly?

360
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:47,050
Um, I did a very brief, I'm
not very good at video editing,

361
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:52,051
but I did a very brief little 32nd snip
of all of these shots before we had the

362
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:56,560
book before,
right as the film was releasing.

363
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,920
And I sent it to Rick and
Kathleen and showed it to the,

364
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,630
actually I sent it to other as
well. And it's just like, uh,

365
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,470
just that same thing that you've seen
on some of the programs that they show

366
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:07,750
before these guys go on
and do their interviews.

367
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:12,460
And I think it's fascinating to watch. The
face has changed for sure. Um, I'm just,

368
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,980
I don't, I'm not very good
at it. So, interesting.

369
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,270
Um,
discussing the improvisation in acting,

370
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:27,271
at what point did you and
Rick start feeling free
enough for you to improvise in

371
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:29,830
certain scenes and what
words some of those scenes?

372
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,440
It was never really, I mean,
there was definitely like,

373
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:39,160
I mean there was definitely an element
of improvisation to it because,

374
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,720
because of the fact that the district was
constantly changing and, and you know,

375
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:46,370
a lot of times we would be improvising

376
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,170
up until, you know, the morning
of the morning of the shoot.

377
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,400
But when we went on camera,

378
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:56,120
we definitely always had a
script that we follow it with.

379
00:23:56,121 --> 00:24:01,121
The one exception of the star wars scene,

380
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:07,180
when Ethan and I are sitting at the
campfire deaking added deeding out about

381
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:09,980
star wars,
that there's about 45 minutes of that.

382
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:14,810
I think today for day like 45.
I mean there's a 45 seconds in the movie,

383
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,610
but there's another half hour probably
of just us talking about star wars.

384
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,530
I don't know. But, um, but yeah, I
mean that's a common misconception.

385
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,710
I think we achieved a lot of realism,

386
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:32,711
just threw a lot of improv
improvisation just leading up to the,

387
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,170
you know, leading up to
the, um, to the shoots.

388
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:39,560
So there's a lot of it is our own words,
but you know, but it was always scripted.

389
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,880
Um,
the transition to teenager,

390
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:47,670
I love the scene in which you're
asking your dad are there,

391
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,870
there's no magic in the world,
really, like elves and stuff.

392
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,530
Had you already reached that point
in your life or was that a terrible

393
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:55,364
revelation?

394
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,400
I don't think my parents,

395
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,340
but I think the way Santa Claus
was presented to me was as a myth.

396
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:09,080
So, yeah, I mean, I definitely
believe in magic, but not,

397
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,183
not that kind.

398
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:15,270
Great. Um, when you're
at a party with a girl,

399
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:18,300
you tell her how you're unhappy
with people trying to control you,

400
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,990
which are a teenager, nothing
surprising about that. Uh,

401
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,240
how does that marry you at that time?

402
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,830
Um, I mean, that was one of the first
pieces of dialogue that I just wrote.

403
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:31,110
So is they're just actively,
I mean,

404
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:34,110
Richard had come to me the
previous year and said, you know,

405
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:39,111
the next time you're alone with a girl
for the first time to take notes and

406
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:43,770
like, um, so that,

407
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:45,690
it's definitely my own,
uh,

408
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,580
pseudo philosophy from 17.

409
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,740
Okay.
Great.

410
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,470
Good year for that to happen.

411
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:58,390
That takes care of the next
question about emotional trauma. Uh,

412
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,040
let's see, uh, by the end, you break
free, you go to, I can sit Saul,

413
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:06,950
Ross state university and Alpine,
and then you go to big band,

414
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,160
uh, is a perfect place for your
photography and love of nature and all.

415
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:16,450
Um, how well do you relate to
Mason's decision to do that?

416
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,940
Um, I mean, I, I love that place.

417
00:26:20,941 --> 00:26:24,000
I love that desert. It
definitely, I mean, I, I stayed,

418
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,930
I've spent a lot of time out there,
you know, it just in Big Ben, but I,

419
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:32,360
after we shot everybody else went home
and I stayed for another week or two. Um,

420
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,210
it's really special out there and I mean,

421
00:26:36,211 --> 00:26:39,450
photography isn't as big a part of my
life as it was. I mean, that's, you know,

422
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,560
that's an why mason is a photographer's
because I was really interested in it

423
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,150
kind of as a result of, you
know, following Matt around
on the set and, you know,

424
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:50,720
looking at all these cool toys.
Um,

425
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,460
but that's, you know, but I
definitely, I definitely do.

426
00:26:55,461 --> 00:27:00,220
I relate with the need to get
far away from home and the,
you know, the desert, um,

427
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:04,270
definitely calls to me.
So that,

428
00:27:04,271 --> 00:27:08,170
that last scene is, you
know, I've, you know,

429
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:13,030
more often I'm alone, but I've
definitely had that moment, you know,

430
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:17,050
many times in my life of just being out
there and how quiet it is and just kind

431
00:27:17,051 --> 00:27:20,260
of realizing how,
you know,

432
00:27:20,261 --> 00:27:22,390
how for granted I take everything.

433
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,480
Um, Matt, this is a big question.

434
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:32,540
How do you see the difference between
the art of cinematography and the art of

435
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:33,384
photography?

436
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,560
Okay.

437
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,400
That is a big question. I find myself,

438
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,690
that's hard one to answer.

439
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:46,080
I'm moving pictures versus still pictures.
It's,

440
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,180
Eh,

441
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,380
we remember things differently when we
see the moving picture as opposed to one

442
00:27:51,381 --> 00:27:54,170
still frame from that
picture or that movie.

443
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,380
So I was lucky enough to have Eller and
the whole cast to document during the 11

444
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:03,290
years that I was on the film.
And um,

445
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,690
I guess I think my
documentation is impactful,

446
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,410
but I think the film is way more
impactful when you see the moving images.

447
00:28:12,411 --> 00:28:17,090
But I think that's the beauty of the
book is that it pairs well with the film.

448
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,480
And you can go back after seeing the
movie and seeing everything and kind of

449
00:28:22,821 --> 00:28:27,821
land on a moment and land on a picture
and remember that soft face boy and then

450
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,060
see the chiseled man that he is now. You
know, it's like, you know, I mean he's,

451
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,180
he's a movie star and it's,
it's incredible to watch
the transformation and,

452
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,300
and I've loved that I was able
to do that photographically.

453
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,900
And Richard was able to do that
cinema cinema graphically. So

454
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,690
did you see a younger you and or when
he was interested in photography?

455
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,080
Um, actually yes. There was
one scene that we filmed, um,

456
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,990
at Austin high in the dark room scene
where the, he's getting the lecture from,

457
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:03,680
um, Mr whatever his name
is, Burlington, Burlington.

458
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,070
And he has that great line,
um, which is, you know,

459
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:09,710
any dip shit can take photographs, you
know, what are you going to bring to it?

460
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:11,870
And it's,
I love that scene.

461
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,670
That scene was really wonderful and
powerful to me because that dark room was

462
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:20,810
the actual dark room where I first learned
how to develop film and make prints.

463
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,430
So I was at Austin high.

464
00:29:22,431 --> 00:29:25,190
I was trying to tell her that right
before the scene and we were just having a

465
00:29:25,191 --> 00:29:28,490
little moment about it. But it was,
it was fun to be there and, and that,

466
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,460
that was a pretty powerful moment for me.
That dark room

467
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,820
from the very beginning we see
the true are interested in art.

468
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,920
You have your graffiti symbol, which I
still can't decide when were a child,

469
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:47,580
but then you take on the name because
Joe for your bedroom wall art in general,

470
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:52,590
graffiti in particular,
what are Your Art Tris?

471
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,873
I

472
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:01,090
that was actually a replica of a thing
I had on my wall and mine was maybe a

473
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:03,844
little more,

474
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,160
a little more decipherable but
burned. Maybe not, I don't know.

475
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:10,631
But yeah,

476
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:15,631
I mean that know that that's spray paint
art was definitely a big part of my

477
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:18,330
life at that point in time.
Um,

478
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:24,370
and photography is something I,
you know, I not as, I don't John,

479
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:26,560
I don't shoot constantly the
way I did when I was younger,

480
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:30,850
but it's definitely still something
I'm very interested in and you know,

481
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,640
Pencil and paper drawing
and painting and I don't,

482
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,490
I don't really know how to play music,
but I,

483
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,420
there's definitely a lot of it inside
of me. So I probably will someday.

484
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,003
Great.

485
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,740
Beautiful Book that has come out.
How did this come back about?

486
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:55,180
I noticed you wrote after a few years
I looked at the images collected so far

487
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:59,800
and became excited by it all looking
forward to the final volume of work.

488
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,340
So when did the idea for book come out?

489
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:04,923
Well,
I,

490
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,100
the idea originally for me was the
black and white portraits as a portfolio

491
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:10,960
piece. It's not as a book. It was really,

492
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,860
I was going to have this
nice body of work. Selfishly,

493
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,160
I was obviously going to give Richard
and Kathleen access to it so that,

494
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,010
you know, IFC can use, use this. But um,

495
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,690
that was the original intention with the
black and whites. However, year five,

496
00:31:25,691 --> 00:31:27,850
year six when I was counting
up, I've got, you know,

497
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:31,120
four thousand five thousand images.
And then by the year, by year 12,

498
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:35,800
I've got close to 18,000 images. It
was a no brainer. Early on to say,

499
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,600
we're going to do a book,
we have to,

500
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:41,260
we have too many images to
the cheek going on. And, um,

501
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:46,060
I think it was year nine, Ethan said,
I want to write the intro to your book.

502
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,290
And I was like, Oh, I have a
book. And I hadn't ever talked
to Ethan about this. So,

503
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,400
um,

504
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,380
that was my first little light bulb
moment that if Ethan's involved,

505
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,660
and I knew Rick and Kathleen
were kind of mulling the idea,

506
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,910
but if Ethan were involved in it,

507
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:04,930
would really have a lot more
chance of playing out. So, uh,

508
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:08,710
and that's what actually led into the
essays that each of the actors did was

509
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:13,270
Ethan talking about doing the intro. So
Rick has the pseudo intro, but you know,

510
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:16,690
Rick was talking about the passage of
time and then everybody kind of touches on

511
00:32:16,691 --> 00:32:18,290
that. And, um,

512
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,130
so the book actually
officially became tangible, uh,

513
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:26,230
as an idea of just this time last year.
And really,

514
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,850
and it was a very much a quick,

515
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,880
I mean we had 12 years to make the film
and we have like two months to make the

516
00:32:30,881 --> 00:32:33,190
book and was kind of a quick process.

517
00:32:33,191 --> 00:32:37,690
But Dj Stout at Pentagram and Stu
Taylor did an incredible job, um,

518
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,710
you know,
designing it and then

519
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:45,050
ut press, I've done a remarkable job of
marketing the book and distributing it.

520
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:46,160
So,
um,

521
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,970
I hope that answers the question kind
of long winded and I'm really happy it's

522
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:54,050
ut press, so it's another
product of Austin. That's great.

523
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:58,760
What has been the reception to the
book so far? As far as I can tell,

524
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:02,690
I mean my 10 friends like it, so,
you know, I don't know. I'm going to,

525
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,500
I'm kidding it, it, I think it's
doing very well and it's, it's hard.

526
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,460
Books in general are a hard
business as Brady will tell you.

527
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:15,230
It's anyway, it's, it's, it's
difficult, but I think it's doing well.

528
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:16,790
I just saw that it's at Costco now.

529
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:20,470
So I mean that might be a good thing
or bad thing. I don't know, you know,

530
00:33:20,471 --> 00:33:24,920
but I think a Walmart, okay,
sorry. No, draw the line.

531
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,690
A friend of mine at Barnes and noble
said it's selling very well too,

532
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:34,250
and it will be available here
today at a really nice discount.

533
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:38,210
So we'll mention that again in a minute.
So Eller of summing up,

534
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,003
uh,

535
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:45,040
many of Rick's films have to do with time
and you of course get the last line of

536
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:48,980
the film. It's always right now. Uh,

537
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,500
is that you as well as Rick?

538
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:58,110
Yeah, I mean in hindsight,

539
00:33:58,111 --> 00:34:02,460
I think it was kind of a message from
Richard to me because I definitely,

540
00:34:02,461 --> 00:34:05,720
I mean that definitely I had nothing
to do with writing any of, I mean I,

541
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:07,830
you know, in rehearsal we died, we know,

542
00:34:07,831 --> 00:34:11,490
helps to kind of tweak it
and put it in them, you know,

543
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:16,140
words that I had was comfortable
saying, but, but that
definitely, I mean, that was,

544
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:20,940
he knew, he knew what he wanted
to say and it definitely is,

545
00:34:20,941 --> 00:34:25,770
you know, I understand that. And feel
it in a, in a big way. And like I said,

546
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:27,340
you know, I mean, I think that Ma,

547
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:32,240
that moment that Mason's having of
kind of, you know, realizing the,

548
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,190
the fleeting nature of reality and,
you know,

549
00:34:35,191 --> 00:34:38,490
how kind of easy it is to,
you know,

550
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:43,380
forget the importance of family
and connection and just, you know,

551
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:47,130
how quickly everything's going by and
how easy it is to miss it, you know,

552
00:34:47,131 --> 00:34:50,640
and then just kind of get
wrapped up and bullshit. Um,

553
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,110
we were all kind of having that moment
out there, you know, I think not just me,

554
00:34:55,111 --> 00:34:56,520
but everyone on the set,
you know,

555
00:34:56,521 --> 00:35:01,260
we were all coming to the end of this
thing that had become so much more

556
00:35:01,261 --> 00:35:03,130
meaningful to us then I think to anyone,

557
00:35:03,131 --> 00:35:08,130
never aside from maybe Richard
had ever expected, you know, um,

558
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,360
and realizing that it was over and the,

559
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:15,180
and just kind of striving to
appreciate the last few moments of,

560
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:20,130
of the project and the last one, you
know, the last day of being together. Um,

561
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:26,550
so I got a little lost there.
But, but yeah, I definitely,

562
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,270
I definitely, that is, you
know, that is me in a big way.

563
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:36,230
Can you even imagine your life without
having this experience? So would you be

564
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,443
absolutely.

565
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,430
I don't know. I don't know. I
mean, I, I've, you know, I've been,

566
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,540
both of my parents are artists
and I've been around, you know,

567
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:52,080
projects, you know, in collaboration
my whole life. So I would, you know,

568
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,770
I would definitely be creating things,
but I would be a very,

569
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,260
in a very different way.
Had I not met Richard.

570
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,710
Um, do you miss being mason? Are you
ready to go on? What's your own life?

571
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:09,960
I mean, both. It's something of a relief,
but it's also incredibly bittersweet.

572
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,010
I mean, I just, just miss
being able to work on it, you
know, but also, but I mean,

573
00:36:14,011 --> 00:36:15,840
the blessing of all of this is,
you know,

574
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:20,400
that how well the film has been received
as just that we've gotten to spend the

575
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,110
last year together. Um, which had, you
know, no one cared about the movie,

576
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,010
but it probably,
you know,

577
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:30,480
we wouldn't have a thing every weekend
that we all get together for. Um, so,

578
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,330
so that's been nice. But definitely,
yeah, it's bittersweet, you know, hey,

579
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:40,220
I hope we get to work together again.
Okay.

580
00:36:40,221 --> 00:36:45,221
I want to open it up to the audience for
questions as or that it will lead you

581
00:36:47,261 --> 00:36:50,270
to this or you know, what's kind
of your reaction. But you know,

582
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:53,930
it started off with limited release and
then, you know, it's obviously taken off.

583
00:36:53,931 --> 00:36:56,870
So, um, I, I mean,

584
00:36:56,871 --> 00:37:00,260
I didn't expect this a year ago.
I mean,

585
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:05,261
I think we were kind of bracing
ourselves for no one to care.

586
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,500
That sounds funny, but it's true.
Entirely true. I mean, you know,

587
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,320
for the last 12 years trying to explain
this project to people, it's like, okay,

588
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,460
you know, Richard Linklater, like, oh,
I've heard of him. And then it's like,

589
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,790
it's like 12 years and like,
it's not really about anything.

590
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:24,140
And so people didn't care, you know,
it feels like, oh, that's cool.

591
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:27,740
But it's not like, oh, I'm so excited to
see that movie. It just like, okay, well,

592
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:31,280
you know, good. Tell me about
it when it comes out. Um,

593
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,330
so we really, we're kind of bracing
ourselves for the, you know,

594
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:38,820
for no one to really get it or to
connect with it the way cause we needed,

595
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,330
we know it's really important
to us and that makes it,
you know, all the, you know,

596
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,580
Stereo to kind of release
it to people who, you know,

597
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,560
may or may not understand it. Um,
but the way people have responded,

598
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,090
I mean much more than,
you know,

599
00:37:53,091 --> 00:37:56,420
I mean the awards and everything
that's really awesome to be recognized.

600
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:01,450
But what's more meaningful is just the
way people have responded personally and

601
00:38:01,521 --> 00:38:02,450
individually,
you know,

602
00:38:02,451 --> 00:38:07,190
and expressed such kind
of vulnerable emotions,

603
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:08,460
you know, about that, the,

604
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:13,180
that this movie has inspired
them to feel. And that, you know,

605
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,620
I think we all feel pretty
vulnerable, um, releasing, you know,

606
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:22,010
putting this out there because
it's so kind of personal to us.

607
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,140
But a lot of people, a lot of audiences
have really matched that vulnerability.

608
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,660
So that's, you know,
that's really inspiring.

609
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,800
I heard an interview with Laura Link
Linklater on Texas Standard and her to the

610
00:38:35,891 --> 00:38:40,150
film and seeing it after the,
the whole project was complete,

611
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:44,170
was quite strong. She described
crying, watching the movie,

612
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:46,120
and I'm feeling some,

613
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,440
I guess how strange it was to
see different parts of herself,

614
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,350
um, unscreened for the public in earlier
parts of her life. I wondered what,

615
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,070
what your reactions were to hers
and if you relate it to it at all

616
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:04,890
before Sundance, Richard,
Dave. But we had nothing,

617
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,510
we hadn't seen any of the footage
until, you know, until it was done. Um,

618
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,040
and Richard,
Dave,

619
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:16,041
both of us DVDs and kind of very wisely
advised that we watch it by ourselves.

620
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:19,020
The first, you know,
alone the first time. Um,

621
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:25,350
and I mean, obviously I was,
I, I don't think anybody
heard from me for a few days.

622
00:39:25,351 --> 00:39:30,330
It was pretty intense.
Definitely. Um, I don't know.

623
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,020
I cried a lot. It's hard to really
describe what it feels like. You know,

624
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:39,021
I think you spend your whole
life wondering how you're
changing from day to day,

625
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:41,370
much less over a decade.
Um,

626
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:47,440
and it's one thing to look at pictures,
but to see it like that is, you know,

627
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,950
mind blowing and tender.
You know what I mean?

628
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:53,040
To say painful but not
really in a negative way.

629
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:57,630
It's just a lot to take in all
at once. You know, I've seen it

630
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,250
like 10 or 11 times now and

631
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,560
it is finally getting easier.
Um,

632
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,740
but it's very emotional.
Definitely.

633
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,090
Please don't watch it
alone when you're my age.

634
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:19,720
My head might be the end of year
then between now and then, fine. I,

635
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:24,680
I'm very glad Laura light didn't succeed
in convincing her dad to have her

636
00:40:24,681 --> 00:40:26,570
character dive swine flu.

637
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,080
There was one year she just
didn't want me to do it anymore.

638
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,460
I think she just didn't want to dress
up for the Harry Potter thing. Right.

639
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,510
Oh, hey. I was just wondering,

640
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:42,110
did you get in front of the camera
at all over the 12 years and if not,

641
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:44,570
do you regret not having
that time lapse for yourself?

642
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:49,890
Uh, actually I was asked to be an extra
in one of the scenes, couple of scenes,

643
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:54,120
none of them made the cut. So thankfully
I'm not in front of the camera. Um,

644
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:59,200
in the book, however I did, my sister
took a portrait of me, so I'm in the,

645
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,040
if you happen to get the book, you'll
see a portrait of me in there. But, um,

646
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,560
as far as getting in front of the
camera, I just did that. You're four. Um,

647
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:11,070
I was a bartender or something and Rick
gave me this great line of what's your

648
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:13,980
motivation and all this stuff.
I was just the complete extra background,

649
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,360
fluff and clearly not important
enough to make the cut score.

650
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:22,790
And how do you see this experience in this
job affecting your work in the future?

651
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,600
It's funny.
Um,

652
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,560
I definitely take a look at
the longevity of projects now.

653
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:32,580
Like I've been shooting photographs of
kids at a Montessori School for about

654
00:41:32,581 --> 00:41:37,040
eight years and watching that same kind
of growth and watching them age and it's,

655
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:42,020
it's, it's, it's interesting, it really
plays on you when you have to have that.

656
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:47,000
And, um, thankfully Ella has
agreed to continue our project.

657
00:41:47,001 --> 00:41:51,950
We shot year 13 last year in May, so
a sometime coming up, if he allows me,

658
00:41:51,951 --> 00:41:54,650
I will do year 14 with him.
So.

659
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,003
Okay.

660
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:01,060
So the movie on the whole is kind of this
like wonderful measurement of what it

661
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:05,650
is to be human. That's that curious
probably a lot of weight, right.

662
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:07,060
For you and your professional life.

663
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:12,061
Do you feel a lot of pressure now to
keep moving forward to work on projects?

664
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:13,510
Kind of UB substance?

665
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,380
MMM,

666
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,040
and I think I would feel that regardless.
Sure.

667
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,750
But not, I don't, I mean almost people
kind of asked me that. It's like, oh,

668
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:29,010
how are you going to like top this?
And I don't think I need to. Um,

669
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,410
so in a way the pressure is off.
I guess.

670
00:42:31,411 --> 00:42:35,450
It's like the first movie I was in
just won best picture. So it's like

671
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,163
not,

672
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,400
there's not much like more
did I can strive to accomplish
as far as recognition,

673
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,550
you know, so I don't know.
But absolutely. I mean, I,

674
00:42:46,551 --> 00:42:49,940
I feel a lot of responsibility
and pressure to only be,

675
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:54,380
be a part of things that
have substance and, you know,

676
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,420
communicate genuine emotion. Um,
but I think I would feel that way,

677
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,790
you know,
even if I hadn't been a part of this.

678
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,080
So look for you and like Morticai
too, right? Yeah, exactly.

679
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,530
So you promise not to do Texas chainsaw
massacre 87. You know, I add though,

680
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,890
I like before,
like the year two or three of boyhood,

681
00:43:15,891 --> 00:43:20,300
I auditioned for that.
The Texas chainsaw remained in,

682
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:25,910
um, very wisely. I, uh, my parents
talked me out of it. I tend to,

683
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:30,360
I wanted to do it, but, um, I
have since I've heard that that's,

684
00:43:30,361 --> 00:43:34,170
that was like one of the
most hellish sets ever.

685
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,890
Kind of glad I wasn't party.

686
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:42,030
Um, and it has to do with a scene or
two scenes in the movie. There was, um,

687
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,980
uh, your mother and the movie,
um, she has an exchange with, uh,

688
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:50,490
an immigrant who's working at our
house, which tells me, you're smart,

689
00:43:50,491 --> 00:43:53,220
you should go to school. And then
there's a scene later on where he's like,

690
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:56,070
thank you for that. I went to
school and I managed her all that.

691
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:59,790
I'm just wondering why, why do
you think, from your perspective,

692
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:03,750
why was that included in the film
and what was the meaning behind it?

693
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,393
Oh yeah.

694
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,430
I mean I think,

695
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,180
I think because she,
you know,

696
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,810
it's kind of is underappreciated
and mom's kind of our, you know,

697
00:44:18,811 --> 00:44:23,670
and she's sort of spends the
whole movie trying to ease,

698
00:44:23,671 --> 00:44:28,670
you know, ease the suffering,

699
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:32,620
I guess, of all of these men
in her life. And, you know,

700
00:44:32,621 --> 00:44:34,710
it was sort of punished for it,
the whole movie.

701
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:35,983
MMM.

702
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,450
And I just, that's a role that
a lot of mothers fall into.

703
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:43,723
Oh.

704
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:47,080
And the, and, and to be, you know,

705
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:50,770
have better appreciation from someone
who's not trying to start a relationship

706
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:55,720
with her is powerful I think.
But I don't really know.

707
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,560
Do you think there's a reason? I, um,

708
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:03,010
they chose randomly to have at a Mexican
immigrant and working on our house. So,

709
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,210
I mean, I don't, we live in Texas,

710
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,150
I guess that's,
yeah.

711
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:17,250
I don't know the cause a lot of Mexican
immigrants do that kind of work and are,

712
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,100
you know, put in a place, you know,

713
00:45:21,101 --> 00:45:25,960
by whatever pre, uh,
preconceptions of society,

714
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:29,500
you know, that they can't
rise beyond, you know,

715
00:45:29,501 --> 00:45:34,360
this idea of what an
immigrant is in this country.

716
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,590
Um, and, but also a lot
of, a lot of people do.

717
00:45:38,591 --> 00:45:43,591
A lot of people come here and start
doing work like that and you know,

718
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:48,970
make fairy, um, I dunno,

719
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:55,000
uh, successful lives for
themselves. So yeah. Thank you.

720
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,910
So a lot of times as you know,

721
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,510
little kids weren't into one thing or
another and we make decisions off those

722
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,330
and change those really quickly.
You know, was there ever any time,

723
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:10,720
like you kind of were questioning your
role in the movie and being a part of it

724
00:46:10,721 --> 00:46:10,991
and like,

725
00:46:10,991 --> 00:46:15,280
guess what kinds of sacrifices and things
had you like or what happened you got

726
00:46:15,281 --> 00:46:16,930
to do that you kind of wanted
to do when you were a kid?

727
00:46:16,931 --> 00:46:20,020
Or how did that kind of overlap with work
balance for slight bounce some during

728
00:46:20,021 --> 00:46:21,850
the movie for so long?
With so many years.

729
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,540
I mean, I don't, nothing, never.
I, I never wanted, I never,

730
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,110
I never questioned my decision.
I mean, I, you know, I was,

731
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:35,180
I was never terribly rebellious.
I never had much of a reason to be,

732
00:46:35,181 --> 00:46:39,050
I wasn't in public school,
so I didn't have that,

733
00:46:39,051 --> 00:46:43,940
like inherent need to rebel against all
forms of authority. Um, they kind of,

734
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:46,670
you know, it was kind of fun to
have an obligation, you know,

735
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:49,370
something I was committed to
and, and it's in, you know,

736
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:53,180
I think you here 12 years and it sounds
like it's like taking up my whole life.

737
00:46:53,181 --> 00:46:56,570
But like I've said, it was like a
week and a half each year, you know,

738
00:46:56,571 --> 00:46:57,404
so it wasn't,

739
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,160
I don't think that ever kept me from doing
anything else, you know? I mean, yeah,

740
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,440
I stopped auditioning for other movies.
That's the only thing.

741
00:47:06,441 --> 00:47:10,370
But auditioning just sucks.
And that's why I did that. So

742
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:19,060
Bette Davis had to audition for the movie
in the fifties and she just took our

743
00:47:19,061 --> 00:47:22,930
two Oscars, put them on the
table and said nothing else.

744
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,640
So you're going to be able to take
some awards along with you. It's the,

745
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,300
it's different now they're
sending is different. Auditioning

746
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,600
for commercials sucks.

747
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:32,883
Yes.

748
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:38,530
During that week and a half, what would
a typical day of filming look like?

749
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,060
I mean,
during the week and a half,

750
00:47:41,061 --> 00:47:45,830
there was it about three or four
days of actual filming and you know,

751
00:47:45,831 --> 00:47:49,650
a lot of times in the morning
we would still be, you know,

752
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:54,200
working on tweaking bits of
dialog and rehearsing and

753
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:55,490
yeah.

754
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:59,160
You know, but other than that, I don't
just, I don't know, standard, I guess,

755
00:47:59,161 --> 00:48:02,550
you know. Um, I think
Richard, you know, he,

756
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:06,650
we did a lot of tapes when we first
started and I think Richard maybe had,

757
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:11,580
became more confident as we went along,
so things became more kind of efficient,

758
00:48:11,581 --> 00:48:13,230
I guess as the years went on.

759
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,220
But,
um,

760
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,700
I don't know. We would just shoot and,
well, like I said, you know, it was very,

761
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:20,830
like everyone has said it's
very relaxed and you know,

762
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:25,600
so it was like the rehearsal
was constantly going and
the difference between

763
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:29,620
rehearsing and shooting, you know, wasn't
that noticeable. It was just kind of

764
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,860
something we were all working on together.

765
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:35,263
And Matt,

766
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:40,400
what other projects do you have coming
up apart from the aforementioned shooting

767
00:48:40,401 --> 00:48:43,870
of the children, if that sounds
really bad? Photographing? Yeah,

768
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:46,810
children. Um, I,

769
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:52,400
I have a lot of different projects
besides shooting, shooting up children.

770
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:57,490
Amid that comment please.
Um,

771
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:01,640
aside from my annual portrait with Eller,
um,

772
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:06,410
I do a lot of different things. I do a lot
of head shots and, um, commercial work.

773
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:09,200
I shoot food, I do interiors,
I do a lot of different things.

774
00:49:09,201 --> 00:49:12,590
I'm working on movies is fun for me.
If I did it all the time,

775
00:49:12,591 --> 00:49:15,560
I probably would have a little bit more
of a different outlook about movies

776
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:17,420
because it's a really long day on set.

777
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:21,770
You shoot things from three
different angles. You have moves.

778
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:24,950
Like Eller was saying about the
typical day of filming on set.

779
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:30,110
It's actually quite grueling because it's
just so boring to be perfectly honest.

780
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:33,080
Like, I mean, it's exciting being
on a movie set, don't get me wrong,

781
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:37,640
but doing it day in, day out, day in,
day out, it's, it's, it's tough work.

782
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:41,930
It's really tough. Um, so that's
why I don't do very many films.

783
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:47,640
I just do it a few, you know, one or
so a year maybe, but, and with red fun,

784
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:51,290
you know, Ellen, I hope that answers
your question about shooting.

785
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:57,120
So you mentioned right now, what is
your reaction to like a huge, you know,

786
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:00,800
spike in attention in your life and,
uh, your projects moving forward?

787
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,010
Yeah,

788
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:05,700
figure out what my reaction is. I
guess it's really excited. No, I mean,

789
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:08,610
I like making art and you know,

790
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,640
there are a lot of amazing filmmakers out
there that I'd like to work with then,

791
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,940
you know, I might have the
opportunity to do that now.

792
00:50:16,941 --> 00:50:18,290
So that's definitely exciting.

793
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,500
Question for Eller.
Um,

794
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,870
are your memories of the film and
he experiences going through it,

795
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,250
it's still your memories or

796
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,490
do you feel that they
have been impacted by the,

797
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:34,880
by the positive reception of the world?
Like we look at your work,

798
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,100
I look at a picture and say,
oh, they're making history.

799
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,100
Do you look back like that now or is it
still the memory? It's always been, yeah,

800
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,710
that's the strange thing is,
you know, it's, it's being,

801
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:49,910
it's become so kind of hyperbolized
and you know, the hype,

802
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:53,880
the hype is pretty over the top.
Um,

803
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:57,590
but it definitely still feels like,
you know,

804
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:01,130
something very personal and it always,
it always has, you know, and it,

805
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:02,600
people ask me to change,

806
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:05,630
you can know you were a part of
something so important and it's like,

807
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,470
it's kind of absurd. I mean it's,
I don't know, it's just a movie.

808
00:51:09,471 --> 00:51:12,460
It's just an art project.
I think if,

809
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:16,760
if you set out to make something
important, you're kind of an asshole. So

810
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,580
I certainly try not, I don't think I, you
know, look back on it that way. I'm glad.

811
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:25,220
I'm glad that it's means
so much to so many people.

812
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:29,810
I mean that's the kind of the greatest
reaction you could possibly ask for.

813
00:51:29,811 --> 00:51:32,360
There is reward. You did ask for it
with a piece of art is, you know,

814
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:36,470
beyond people liking it, being moved
by it emotionally. It's really,

815
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:37,581
like I said,

816
00:51:37,581 --> 00:51:42,050
it's really inspiring to have people be
so honest and open about their feelings.

817
00:51:42,051 --> 00:51:44,120
But,
but no,

818
00:51:44,121 --> 00:51:48,710
it definitely still feels very small to
me and it's hard to communicate that,

819
00:51:48,711 --> 00:51:53,460
you know, when people are being
so kind of hyperbolic about it.

820
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:56,190
But,
but it is,

821
00:51:56,191 --> 00:51:58,740
it's very small and personal and you know,

822
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:01,650
it feels strange to be in the
middle of all this. You know,

823
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:05,130
it'd be in the midst of all these
awards and this is like ultra glamorous

824
00:52:05,131 --> 00:52:09,660
Hollywood stuff and it's like we
don't really belong there and it,

825
00:52:09,661 --> 00:52:13,890
it feels, you know, kind of like crashing
the party, but, but I think, you know,

826
00:52:13,891 --> 00:52:17,100
I think, I think that's straight.
I think hopefully, you know,

827
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:20,050
a movie like this that is small and is,
you know,

828
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,680
intimate and certainly,
you know,

829
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:27,700
was not made with any intention
of like any of this to be,

830
00:52:27,781 --> 00:52:31,420
you know, to be so recognized and so
kind of connected with and celebrated.

831
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,130
I hope,
you know,

832
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:37,130
it gives people more courage and
more opportunity to make smaller,

833
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,630
more intimate movies and,
you know, get them out there.

834
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,733
So,

835
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,590
okay,
that'll close our Q and a,

836
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:46,350
just a reminder that over in the corner,

837
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:51,150
they will be selling the
book boyhood. Uh, 40% off.

838
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,590
You can't beat that at all.

839
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,280
And I'm sure Matt will be signing them
and I bet Eller would autograph some of

840
00:52:58,651 --> 00:53:02,180
the portraits and my
committing. You aren't. Okay.

841
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,610
All right. It's been a real pleasure
visiting with you. Thank you.

842
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:10,440
You didn't break out in a sweat. I
did, but I enjoyed it. Thank you.

843
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:11,520
Thanks.
