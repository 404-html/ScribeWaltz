1
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,870
So thank you for taking the time
to come visit Google and, uh,

2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,060
we're all just going
to kick off with that.

3
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:18,820
You were returning from the first film,
Bad moms.

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,030
I'm not fitting and Christmas
is approaching in this film.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,640
So where do we find
each of your characters?

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,583
Okay,
wow.

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,610
Oh, I'll start. Well,

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,550
Kiki has much repaired her
relationship with Ken. I'll say that.

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,980
Uh, she stood up for herself, which a lot
of times when you stand up for yourself,

10
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:43,880
you sort of set new boundaries and new
dynamics in your life, which she's done.

11
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:46,790
Kent helps out a lot at home.
Uh,

12
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:50,210
he is no longer a never heard
if you know what I mean?

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,900
So she has a thriving sex life and uh,

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,670
she's still friends with both these girls.
But I think as life ebbs and flows,

15
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:00,050
you go through waves where,
you know,

16
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:02,720
the moms felt like they took
a part of their life back,

17
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:05,780
but Christmas and the holidays are
approaching and they feel like it's just

18
00:01:05,781 --> 00:01:07,940
slipping away.
All that control.

19
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,110
That's where, Yup. I love it.

20
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,600
So good. Amy, where's Amy? So,
hmm. She isn't a relationship.

21
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:21,310
Spoiler alert with, um, with the J.

22
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah, Jesse, that's his name. And uh,

23
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,540
that's right. Jay Hernandez. Slash Jesse.

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,510
Um, and, and is it a very happy place in
her life? She, it has filed for divorce.

25
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:38,370
Everything's great. And uh,
you know, her, her mother,

26
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,010
her mother comes into town and throws
her in for a loop of spiraling out of

27
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:50,070
control and feeling like she's never good
enough and that nothing she ever does

28
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:54,450
is good enough and a feeling the pressure
to be as perfect as her mother while

29
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,430
having these wonderful women, it
try to help themselves and her, uh,

30
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,180
be strong and powerful and go
against the system of Christmas.

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,473
Oh,

32
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,000
well, uh, I, uh, uh, Carla,

33
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:12,580
Carla and a Mimosa.

34
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,560
Um, uh, Carla is trying, you know,

35
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:19,780
I think if from the last movie,
I think his is,

36
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:24,460
is trying on a modicum of thank you.
Um, some responsibility in her life.

37
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:26,970
She has a job now, I think
she took, she works at,

38
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:31,480
she's an aesthetician and all
that that entails at a spa.

39
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,460
And so I think, you know,
she's trying to have some,

40
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:37,180
a little bit of responsibility. It's
just her and her boy. And then, yeah,

41
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:39,760
mom walks in who I haven't
seen in years and years.

42
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,370
I don't think Christmas in their
family was ever, uh, you know,

43
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,260
sell a really stolen,
really care. Um, yeah.

44
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:52,450
So I think that's where you see her.
I was trying to,

45
00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:55,960
I think she's trying to have a little
bit of responsibility and trying to enjoy

46
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:59,620
these last couple of years with her
boy before he goes away to school or

47
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:03,220
wherever or, you know, who is she
kidding? He's never leaving her home.

48
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,220
Well, this film was directed
by John Lucas and Scott Moore,

49
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,590
the duo best known for the hangover films.

50
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,650
How much were you able to influence
the script this time around?

51
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,263
Uh,

52
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,720
I would say yeah, a lot. Um, he
was a really nice collaboration.

53
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,520
Kind of hate the sound of my
voice. I'm sorry guys. Uh,

54
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:34,460
it was, uh, it was all
done very quickly. Uh,

55
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,740
between the time of, yes, let's do a
sequel to, let's shoot the sequence.

56
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:40,060
Who'd would coming out?
It's probably been nine months total.

57
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,070
And so the guys had a short period
of time to write the script in. Um,

58
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,880
I would say all in all a pretty good
amount of influence, as much as,

59
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:49,930
as they were willing to
listen to me talk and talking,

60
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,310
talking to rewrites and notes with them.

61
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:56,020
But they're so great and so inclusive
and I think they wanted it to be as good,

62
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,490
if not better as the first one.

63
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:01,220
And so they were more than willing to
sit down and talk to anybody who is

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,860
willing to,
to give them notes.

65
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,020
We were so excited when we heard the,

66
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,040
at least I was when I heard the idea of
like where the SQL would be sad or what

67
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,670
time of the year because there really
isn't another period where, you know,

68
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,150
Mama's in particular are so expected to
make magic happen for everybody else in

69
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:21,750
their, in their lives. And it's like,
you know, the current, you know,

70
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,180
behind the curtain,
she's sweating and miserable.

71
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:29,320
And then there's like an innate comedy
timeline of Christmas Eve. You know,

72
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:33,760
it's like inherently you have to try to
get to, there's a countdown. So like,

73
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,420
you know, comedy wise, we
knew and it, you know, it's,

74
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,890
it's such a crazy,

75
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,790
crazy pressure in for no reason where
it should just be, um, you know,

76
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,290
this magic time with everybody.

77
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:50,040
And of course it should be fun and
it should be fun. And it gets so,

78
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,000
and it's earlier and earlier,
clearly, I mean, it's October,

79
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,230
but it's so clearly earlier and
earlier in my Christmas list already,

80
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,860
and I've started shopping.
I know I start now.

81
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,793
Yeah,
I really do.

82
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,720
But then by thanksgiving I don't
have any Christmas shopping.

83
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,840
I'm done. Yeah. Well, your mother's
are played by award winning.

84
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:15,810
Susan Surandon,
Kristin brand ski and Cheryl Hines.

85
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,300
Did any of you have a role in
casting your onscreen moms? Yes. Yes.

86
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,200
Yeah. So you were just like, let
me think of who I want. And yes,

87
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,180
they were like, but that's, and
then they were like, yeah, sure.

88
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:30,800
Write them a letter and you're like,
okay.

89
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,170
And people respond. It's
kind of crazy. So smooth.

90
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,000
The directors are very confident,
but also like, they're resigned.

91
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:44,240
They're not like gigantic personalities,
the jump into a room,

92
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:49,241
but they're confident enough to know that
they take all advice and all ideas and

93
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:52,190
they use the ones they like and there's,

94
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,110
there's just something sort
of beautiful about that.

95
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:56,300
So they listened to all
of our Christmas stories,

96
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:58,790
thought about like what we would want our
characters doing and then they thought

97
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,380
about how they would
place that into the film.

98
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,300
And I think the same thing went
with the moms. They were like,

99
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:05,660
who do you connect to? You? Who would you
feel like you would want to work with?

100
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:08,330
Who are you friendly with?
Who Do you think is wonderful for this?

101
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:11,210
But there they're really,
really collaborative. Yeah.

102
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:14,590
It seems like it was a
perfect cast. So, uh,

103
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,410
one of my favorite lines is delivered
by Christine Baranski. She says,

104
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,630
you're a mom. Moms don't enjoy,
they give joy. That's how mom had,

105
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:24,800
that's how being a mom works.

106
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,910
And can you tell us more about each of
their characters and what we can expect?

107
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,250
Uh, there all, no, you go ahead.

108
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,280
Um, my mom is played by Cheryl
Hines, who weirdly enough has been a,

109
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,000
like a friend of mine for about a decade.
So I was like,

110
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:46,040
this is where would you
want to play my mom?

111
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,680
And we can just add a weird line that
you had me when you were like 10 or

112
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:53,250
something. And she was like, sure.
Um, so, but so we already had like a,

113
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,140
a very strong friendship on
going into it and we, uh,

114
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,850
we share a similar sense of humor and
I sort of idolized her and I was so

115
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:06,080
excited that she said yes and they,
the storyline with Kiki,

116
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,000
we pretty much wrote itself and that
of course Kiki has the issue she has

117
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:14,930
because she had an overbearing mother,
like an intensely overbearing mother,

118
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:19,760
a mother that were her face
on her sweatshirt often
and a mother that like cuts

119
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:21,920
and colors her hair exactly the same.

120
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:26,921
A mother that just like cannot stop
living through her daughter and how much

121
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:32,060
pressure Kiki feels and how that
makes her sort of neurotic and,

122
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,310
uh, unable to set a boundary because
she's fearful of hurting her mom.

123
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:41,060
Which, um, you know,
I've experienced and, uh,

124
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:44,240
it was wonderful to be
able to work in a safe,

125
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,120
fun environment with Cheryl
who's like one of the best,

126
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:50,810
also improv female comedians
we have out there. So she,

127
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:52,160
I feel like brought a ton to it.

128
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:54,650
And I was just really
grateful that she said yes.

129
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,780
Um, I had the pleasure of Christine
Baranski who came about of me going, hmm,

130
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,730
who makes me nervous. And I was
like, Christine Baranski, uh, my,

131
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,980
my character in the first one was
constantly trying to be perfect.

132
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,280
Um, and that was her whole spiral
of like, how do I, you know, uh,

133
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,390
beat the ideals of perfection.
So the mother that I get in the movie,

134
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:20,190
it's somebody who is,
uh,

135
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,640
who has to have everything be exactly
the way the public would want it to

136
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:25,530
perceive.
So everything has to visually be great.

137
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:27,060
Does it matter what's
happening behind closed doors?

138
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,820
But you don't air your dirty laundry
and everything has to be perfect and the

139
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:31,290
kids have to be happy and
it has to be the best.

140
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,500
This and everything has to be perfect and
wonderful and great. And so I was like,

141
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:36,900
who makes me nervous as a person?
And I literally went,

142
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:40,380
Christine Baranski kind of makes me
nervous. And um, and I was like, well,

143
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:42,540
let's see what happens. And like
literally that's how it went about.

144
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:46,320
And then I emailed her and was like,
hey, there's this little movie.

145
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:49,750
We did call it bad mom's like, I went
on a whole thing and she was like, yeah,

146
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:54,180
okay. And that was it. And I was
like, do you want to read the script?

147
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,640
Like did you, she's like, no, no,
that's fine. And then the directors,

148
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,180
John has got met with her and pitched
her the idea of this character that's a

149
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:04,450
very overbearing mother and you know,
all the moms ultimately have a,

150
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,530
a reason as to why they
are the way that they are,

151
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:10,140
which explains why our characters
became the way they became,

152
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:13,800
which is very reminiscent of if you,
you are who your parents are in your,

153
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:15,420
you know,
whether your parents were,

154
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,660
we're constantly driving you
and you fought against it
and you became a rebel or

155
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:20,100
you went into it and became,
you know,

156
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,520
Mark Zuckerberg or like whatever
version of that you became. It is true.

157
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,590
You are what your parents are.
And so in this case,

158
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:30,000
I think this gives an explanation as
to why we as mothers are so constantly

159
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,150
fighting for perfection.
And it also like,

160
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:38,151
I think what they did a great job of in
this movie is they give the moms enough

161
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,990
behind the curtain time and peel
away the onion time where you,

162
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,460
it does sort of resonate that like guys,

163
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,420
everybody's doing the best they can
with what they've got, you know?

164
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,630
And that like, it rings true
for our characters, but it also,

165
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,140
throughout the course of the movie you
see like, yeah, your mom is so annoying,

166
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:58,710
but she's doing the best she can
with what she got and explains why.

167
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:02,190
Like you no longer resent your parents.
Yeah. And let me take that back.

168
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,780
I met Larry Page,
not mark Zuckerberg.

169
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:08,270
Hey guys, I apologize. I
also mean Eric Schmidt.

170
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,480
Uh, we can go down the list.
I didn't meet that. Sorry.

171
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,773
No,

172
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:19,660
I gotta get on this Bob Game Too. You
guys. You got your hair looks so awesome.

173
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,710
Both of yours. I feel like I'm the
odd, odd woman out with this long.

174
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,830
Her fuck the hair guys. Yeah. Um,

175
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,870
Susan Surandon you guys,
it's not so, I mean,

176
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:35,200
I was so excited and similarly I was like,
who?

177
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,850
There's only one person in the world
that would make Carla feel small and that

178
00:10:39,851 --> 00:10:40,720
would be her mother.

179
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,860
And then I was so excited that at the
thought of it being Susan and I wrote her

180
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:49,780
as well, I did Spanish. I was like,
oh my God, I gotta I just knew it.

181
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:53,200
And then even just being in a
scene with her would be very,

182
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:54,850
it would take me a second
because I would just,

183
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,410
it would be all those movies would,

184
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,890
it was like film Lewis deadman
walking rocky horror picture show.

185
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:03,730
So it's like hard to like refocus into,
cause she's such a goddess. They all are.

186
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:07,510
We really lucked out with these women.
And so yeah, I think in their dynamic,

187
00:11:07,511 --> 00:11:09,940
Carla and her mom,
it's more,

188
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,750
I think they were more like kind
of siblings and mother daughter.

189
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,650
You know what I mean? There was not a lot
of boundaries. Friendship. Yeah, exactly.

190
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,840
Well we were thinking about

191
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,650
how you celebrate the holidays
since it is a holiday film.

192
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:25,830
Can you share what some of your favorite
traditions are and if you are sharing

193
00:11:25,831 --> 00:11:28,470
this with your children?
Oh my God. Well when I

194
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,680
grew up, we used to have to sing happy
birthday baby Jesus on Christmas Eve.

195
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,320
I'm not kidding you. My mom would get a
case and we would be like happy birthday.

196
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,060
And I had so many questions.
I was like, how many candles?

197
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:43,180
Like it was so confusing.
I have not,

198
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,510
I've not pass that on,
but that was something we had to do.

199
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,350
I don't really sing.
Happy Birthday Baby Jesus.

200
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,250
Be Birthday

201
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,630
Baby Jesus. And we're all
like, just did it. So weird.

202
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,440
Baskin Robbins Santa Claus cake.
So it was confusing at all.

203
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,740
A lot of levels. Even better. Yeah.

204
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,170
I got nothing you got,

205
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,670
I know that we can top that
tradition that I've passed down.

206
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,800
I don't really happen and done. I mean
no, cause you know, I'm Jewish you guys,

207
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,350
so not to be like mom didn't
really celebrate Christmas,

208
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,230
but I'm sorry.

209
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,200
I also grew up in communist Russia
where you don't really sell it,

210
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,090
but I do now. So yay. Um,

211
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,340
I think like we're creating traditions
is the best way that I can explain it.

212
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:40,270
So you know, uh, our kid doesn't,

213
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,850
I explain this, she's having a
hard time grasping why a man,

214
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,650
it's coming into our house through
a chimney. So spoiler alert,

215
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,320
we're not teaching her about Santa Claus,

216
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,291
not teaching her,

217
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,410
but we try to explain to her that there's
a man that's coming into the house and

218
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,930
she was like,
Ooh,

219
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,960
is okay. But if you're a kid
believes in it, it's great.

220
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,650
Oh he's got a bunch of
exotic cars on the roof.

221
00:13:10,651 --> 00:13:12,240
He's in a jumpsuit and combat boots.

222
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:15,210
But like don't worry kids in a
Hyatt because mine is not buying it.

223
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:19,110
Should it does one of them
doesn't Harley or Jay Hernandez?

224
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,860
Maybe that would be okay.
That's where my daughter Mary though,

225
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:26,250
because do I get it?
Try to be so honest about everything else.

226
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:30,990
And even like during Easter I was like
bunny too far. It's too far. I was like,

227
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,680
we play a game where we
pretend and imagine this giant
bunny brings us an Easter

228
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,500
basket, but mommy went to the store and
got this for you. But around Christmas,

229
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:40,200
everyone talks about it and you don't
ever want to say it in front of another

230
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:43,230
kid because you don't want to insult
another parent and like take over.

231
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,710
That's their domain, but like I'm
having a hard timeline to them.

232
00:13:46,711 --> 00:13:49,620
If I tried lying, I'm
really trying. I'm like,

233
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:53,970
see it as totally isin tooth fairy.
You name it,

234
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,420
but also so like, but then when
they find out they're going to go,

235
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:01,530
what else have you lied to me about it?
That's what's confusing. It's like, shit,

236
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:04,620
I shouldn't have your right.
It lost it.

237
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,920
It's when your kids have questions
about God, but then you're like,

238
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:10,950
but with definitively like,
but there's a tooth fairy.

239
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,400
People believe this here.
It's confusing.

240
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:16,780
I was babysitting yesterday
and extra kid in my house here.

241
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,640
Some of the questions that I fielded
throughout the day is Santa Claus real and

242
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:23,760
I couldn't say anything in front
of the other kid who may dogs.

243
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,220
Why is the earth

244
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,450
literally, I was like,
no, that was the question,

245
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:36,160
and they're just like painting and
they're like dogs and I was like,

246
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,510
oh my God,
where's my husband?

247
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,830
Sounds like an awesome play date. I'm
on Kiki in real life. It's so sad.

248
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,480
It's a planet. Well,
you're all working moms.

249
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,130
And the pressures of being a perfect
parent is something that we all relate to.

250
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,720
So is there a secret to your
work life integration? Uh,

251
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:58,030
and then what do you do

252
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,080
to recharge?
I love my,

253
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,550
my girlfriends,

254
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,580
like my tribe of other mamas and humans
than that I love and that we share the

255
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:14,560
same kind of philosophy. You know,
you just find your group and um,

256
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,450
I cherish that. And then I think
the balance, it's really hard.

257
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,550
It's hard. Oh yeah. Yeah.

258
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:26,330
I try not to say balance anymore because
I can't balance exists. No, it doesn't.

259
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:29,980
It doesn't, it's just, it just, it is
really like it. I've always thought like,

260
00:15:29,981 --> 00:15:32,110
it really does suck that biologically.

261
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:36,550
Like our chief moneymaking years are
lined up with our, like fertility.

262
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,570
Like it just blows, you know what
I mean? It's just what it is.

263
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:42,010
But it really sucks for us.

264
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,310
I'm going to have some more of a mess
that let's drink some more and just make

265
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:49,144
the most out.

266
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:57,060
Any secrets to just recharging,
signing off. I mean self care is huge.

267
00:15:57,061 --> 00:16:01,400
I think like just knowing when you're
feeling frustrated and knowing when you

268
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:06,110
need to call a girlfriend or when you
need to even like just tag team with your,

269
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,030
like we in our household will be like,
I'd be like, I got to switch kids.

270
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,900
I don't want this one anymore but doing
this one right now because like one of

271
00:16:12,901 --> 00:16:15,090
them will be particular. I'm not,
I don't want, I want to switch.

272
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,860
And then he's like, got
it. Totally, totally.

273
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:19,520
And then we switch because
sometimes you just need,

274
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:23,280
you just need to know when
you're getting higher,

275
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:27,270
your thermometer is getting higher and
whether that goes for like, oh it's been,

276
00:16:27,271 --> 00:16:30,540
you know, four months since I've had like
a girl's dinner, I'm going to do that.

277
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:34,200
Any amount of self care
and never, ever, ever,

278
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,510
ever beating yourself up
for needing self care.

279
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,340
I used to do that all the
time and I was like, no,

280
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:40,320
I should be of service and my
family. And I was like, no,

281
00:16:40,321 --> 00:16:44,460
I can get a manicure like once
every six months. Like, that's okay.

282
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,920
Do you know what I mean?
And not killing myself for it.

283
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:50,040
And also surrendering to the
fact that there is no balance.

284
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,700
It is only had just have a mantra
like just be where you are.

285
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:56,100
Like when I'm at home, I focus
on my family. When I'm at work,

286
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,140
I focused on work and scroll through
pictures of my family. But you,

287
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:04,190
you just have to be where you are. It's
really just mindfulness. Like there's no,

288
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:09,300
the balance is such a
sad joke, you know? Yeah.

289
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,910
I mean I can just talk for
the sake of talking, but I
actually have to this, yeah,

290
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:18,130
everything that you said. I agree with
those. There's no, there's no balance it,

291
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,790
but I also don't want it to be like a
woman thing. There's just no balance.

292
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,470
If you're a working parent,
there is a balance.

293
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,790
It doesn't matter if
you're a man or a woman.

294
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,360
I am incredibly fortunate and I've
said this before and I'll say it again.

295
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,170
I do have an amazing partner
in life. I do who? Just, yeah.

296
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,150
Ooh, that's right. Who? My partner,

297
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,880
he's fucking awesome and I'm
not going to shit on him because

298
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,571
he's great.

299
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:40,670
And guess who was home with the kids
today at five in the morning when I was

300
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:45,410
getting ready, he was, he
was awesome and I, you know,

301
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,200
I had to go away for five months to to
shoot something and he took the time off

302
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,010
from work. He was like, um,

303
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,920
you know, we travel as a tribe
as I know you do where one goes,

304
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:56,970
the other one follows with the kids
and for five months he was on a flip

305
00:17:56,971 --> 00:17:58,230
schedule. So I, you know,

306
00:17:58,231 --> 00:18:02,250
we were in Europe so he would work from
9:00 PM to like five in the morning and

307
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:03,510
then be with the kids all day.

308
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,460
Never once did he complain and all
the time he would go, you know what,

309
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,610
I'm so blessed that I get to spend
this much time with the kids.

310
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,040
And it's the most great, like it's you
take it for granted. Having a partner,

311
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,070
whether it's you know, hired help
or a husband or a wife or whatever,

312
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,450
anyone that allows you to just be like,
I can't do this anymore. To your point,

313
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,670
don't take them for granted.
Don't.

314
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:26,280
Because I think it's the one thing that
I sometimes forget to do is just simply

315
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:29,010
say thank you. Because as much as
I'm like, I'm about to explode,

316
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:32,640
I need to go and lock myself up in the
closet for a minute. He's like, Babe,

317
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:34,370
you got this. Go. And I'm like,

318
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,153
okay.

319
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,241
But like you just,

320
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:41,170
I think that we should just be grateful
for whatever help it is that you're able

321
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:44,230
to can see whether it's your friends,
your girlfriends, your village, your mom,

322
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:48,490
your dad. I feel guilty for relying
on hell, never feel guilty about it.

323
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:52,480
And that's the one thing that I think
both of you helped me with two years ago

324
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,980
because I had the hardest time
asking for help two years ago when I,

325
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,120
when I did bad moms,

326
00:18:58,121 --> 00:19:00,220
the first one was the first time
I'm back to work after having kids.

327
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:04,000
And I literally was like, you
know, as Daniel Tiger says,

328
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:06,250
like when you're feeling frustrated,
step back and ask for help,

329
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:09,220
y'all fucking step back and ask for help.
It's okay.

330
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,930
And it took me for ever to be okay with
it and you and you were the biggest

331
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:15,790
champions of that.
So I think you,

332
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,500
it's true. Well cheers to our
girlfriends and our partners.

333
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,840
We'll go ahead and start taking
questions if you want to line up and uh,

334
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:30,120
I guess to wrap up. Yeah. Where would each
of you like to see your characters go?

335
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:32,940
If there was a third film to Hawaii

336
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,600
on vacation destination.
Actually vacation takes a lot of work.

337
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,040
No, the bad moms. I feel you
planning a family vacation.

338
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,770
Yeah. Having everything
you need a plane ride. Yup.

339
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,870
And I forgot seeing is like a lock up our
kids in their car seats once. Oh yeah.

340
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,710
Car seat. Strap them on that airplane
in the car that you have to run. Yeah,

341
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,890
we could go on and on. Great. So we'll go
ahead and start with the first question.

342
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,800
Hi, thanks so much for coming to Google.
It's great to see all of you. Um,

343
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:10,820
my question is how was working on this
set of bad moms different than other sets

344
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:12,690
you worked done in the past?

345
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,750
Well it does a Christmas movie and we
shot it in Atlanta in May and June.

346
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,360
So that was relaxing

347
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,610
of sweat in places I didn't know could,
could gather.

348
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,110
I think we were also kind of like,

349
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,850
whereas the last movie we had a lot of
peers and like we were all very friendly.

350
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:36,571
This movie,

351
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:41,571
we were all sort of like in awe of like
the things that Christine and Susan and

352
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:44,160
Sheryl warp sort of bringing and we fell.

353
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,010
I feel like I felt a little bit more
like a fan girl on this. Not that I'm

354
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,930
not in love with the other
women that we worked with,

355
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:52,840
but this just felt a little bit more like,
I don't know,

356
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:55,000
like why are they doing our movie?
This is so exciting.

357
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,430
Thank you so much.
Hi,

358
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,900
I'll second that. Thank you so
much for coming to Google tag. Um,

359
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,870
one of my favorite parts of the
first movie, which was amazing,

360
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,780
but the very end where each of you
were interviewed with your moms.

361
00:21:11,781 --> 00:21:15,800
I thought it was incredibly touching
and so I'm transparent of view is

362
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,490
especially in the public light
to have your moms be there. Um,

363
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,700
so with your new stage
moms in the second one,

364
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,430
did your moms get to meet
any of your screen moms? No,

365
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,000
my mom did.
She got,

366
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:33,780
she happened to be there while we were
doing like a gallery shoot or so remember

367
00:21:33,781 --> 00:21:36,450
we were doing the publicity and so
she got to meet her and shoot that,

368
00:21:36,451 --> 00:21:38,490
which was very, very exciting. Yeah.

369
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,740
But those first interviews
were so dear and remember like,

370
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,250
do you remember they ended up
being like incredible interviewers.

371
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,460
John and Scott are directors and writers
actually did the interviews for all of

372
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:48,460
us as a couple, you know, the,

373
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,010
the mothers and daughters and it was there
pretty revealing. It got real deep in.

374
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,100
They're very,
Barbara Walters was really well done.

375
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,531
Yeah,
no,

376
00:21:56,531 --> 00:22:00,310
my mom has not met Christine brandscaping
but their historic mom's five feet on

377
00:22:00,311 --> 00:22:04,240
a good day. Like if she stands up royally
tall, she's maybe five feet though.

378
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,360
And like she's tiny. She's just
a tiny little thing and you know,

379
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,550
because nobody's the tall and beautiful.
My Mom's like,

380
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,740
that's what I imagined myself as

381
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,330
and it's very cute. So they
will meet, I mean, yeah, for
sure. They're both awesome.

382
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,800
Yeah.
Thank you.

383
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,460
I think we have one last question.

384
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,560
Great.
Hi.

385
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,900
Um, so thank you. First
off for doing the movie,

386
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:32,901
giving us a reason to go get drunk and
get all the like weird kind of awkward

387
00:22:33,271 --> 00:22:38,190
moms from preschool together
represent body moms. Thank you.

388
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:43,080
Get some girl and erotic. Really
organized. Um, I loved it.

389
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,260
I was just curious which pieces really
resonated the most with you? Like,

390
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,260
if you could have chosen the characters,

391
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,540
like would you have chosen the
character that you got to sign? Yeah.

392
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,430
Yes, yes. Without, AH, yeah. Yes. I
cannot, I can go on a very lengthy,

393
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,440
lengthy explanation as to why.
But uh, with the first bad moms,

394
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:06,420
that was me. I literally was like, I had
so much pressure that I put on myself,

395
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,430
not anybody else of like, everything has
to be perfect for my kid, for my life,

396
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,790
everything organize
and to figure this out.

397
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:17,400
And I literally was going crazy
cause I was like, what's a shower?

398
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:22,020
Like I forgot to take care of myself
so much so that I need, like I,

399
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:25,260
it was the most perfect um,
therapy session was doing this movie.

400
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,930
They like both of these films have
been like giant therapies for me.

401
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,690
I'd say Carlos is more
as my s my spirit animal.

402
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:35,920
Like I wish that's actually
reassuring. Yeah. Yeah. I wish,

403
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,150
I think we all wish we got a little inner
inner, oh yeah. We all have some of her.

404
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,720
When I first read that Mila had this
script and she called me and she was like,

405
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:46,100
read this script. You Ha you
should do this with me. And

406
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,460
I read it and I was like, this
is so good. And I was like,

407
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,390
maybe I should play the bitchy one. Like
I wanted to play Chris, remember this,

408
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:54,590
I want to play Christina's role.
I was like,

409
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,280
she's so funny and that would be so
cool cause like I can be super bitchy.

410
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:02,990
And she was like, no, no, no, you're
Kiki Kiki. That's it. And I was like,

411
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,130
okay, cool. And then I realized
like that's such a Kiki thing to do,

412
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:12,470
to be like, Ooh man, I completed
a vixen and everyone be like, no,

413
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,880
that's not your essence.

414
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,180
Okay,

415
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,590
thanks for being true to yourself.

416
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,600
Well in closing on behalf of
all the bad moms like Google,

417
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:28,770
I want to thank you for portraying the
realities of being a mom and giving us a

418
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:30,720
reason to have a mom's night out.

419
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:35,790
So be sure to watch a bad moms Christmas
out in theaters on November 1st I want

420
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,540
a micro kitchen 400 feet from where I am.

421
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,470
That's the best idea.

422
00:24:41,471 --> 00:24:46,471
[inaudible].
