1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,340
Right.
So far

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,150
stop. I'd like to bring out Mr.
Jason Mitchell from the CAS.

3
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,810
All right, daisy, come on in. Alright.

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,710
Mr Osei Jackson Jr.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,470
Oh,
say Jackson Jr

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,250
I'm going to sit on the farm.
The farm. Yeah. Yup, Yup.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,890
All right. Mr Corey Hawkins. Come on up.

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,803
Sorry.

9
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,070
Uh, steam director of the film.
F Gary Gray. Ladies and gentlemen

10
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,143
that Gary Gray

11
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,860
and producer of the film with no
introduction needed. Mr Ice Cube.

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,860
Yay.

13
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,760
Hey now. Hey now. All Right, welcome
gentlemen. Thank you guys for coming.

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,000
So we're going to have a nice
little moderate a discussion.

15
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,020
I'm going to open up to
Q and a for the audience,

16
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:25,010
so we'll have a nice little about
one hour or so conversation.

17
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,580
So hope you don't mind with that. Um,
and my first question to the group,

18
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,810
whoever wants to go first,

19
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,710
why did you say yes to the
story of straight Outta Compton?

20
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,860
Um, to me, you know,

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,790
it was just the perfect
time to tell this story.

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,100
So many people have,
uh,

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,880
been entertained off the Nwa
family tree for the last 25 years,

24
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,770
sir. And, uh, you know,
it was just like, yeah,

25
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,780
there's some people that that don't
even know I rap. You know what I mean?

26
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:02,840
As that's out in the world. And, uh,

27
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:07,790
so we want to show him the
origin where it all started,

28
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,630
what we went through and what we,
uh,

29
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,550
had to kind of endure,
uh, just to be ourselves.

30
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,860
And, uh, you know, to me it's a great
American story. It's a slice of life.

31
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:25,040
We want to show people the,
you know,

32
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,450
people know the when and the where
we wanted to show people why, like,

33
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:31,550
why do we make this kind of music?

34
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,930
And it was all because of the
environment that we grew up in. Compton,

35
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,330
south central La Watts, long
beach. And, uh, you know,

36
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:44,530
to me it was like the perfect story is,

37
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,580
is juicy enough to be a movie.
Uh,

38
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,530
so it had all the ingredients for a great,
great film.

39
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,200
Same question to a director.

40
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,250
Oh, well, for me, um, I
love a challenge. This movie

41
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,420
is something that, you know, kind of
fits in that category very easily.

42
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:09,040
I've never done a bio pic
before. Um, and it's, you know,

43
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,870
kind of one of those things where when
you get a chance to kind of take off your

44
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,250
world building hat in a world of fiction
and put on your journalist hat and

45
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:22,960
historian hat, um, this is an
amazing story. If you break it down,

46
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,000
uh,
this rags to riches,

47
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,730
there's triumph and tragedy as a lot
of the universal things that people can

48
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,120
really kind of tap into and no matter
where you're from. And so as a filmmaker,

49
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,290
I gravitated towards this.
And, um, even beyond that,

50
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,980
I felt like it was personal to me and I
feel like it's personal to me because I

51
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:43,960
grew up in this environment at that time,

52
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:48,961
not too far from ice cube and was involved
with their careers once they left Nwa

53
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:50,890
and direct and our music
videos and things like that.

54
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:53,970
So it was the perfect time for me.
Um,

55
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,830
and it's arguably the most
important film of my career.

56
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,620
Awesome. Thank you so much
for that. I have a question
about casting for the film.

57
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:05,010
Obviously we have these great gentlemen
here who played that we rose to the film.

58
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,440
Um,
and I had a question about casting.

59
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:10,890
So I read somewhere that you said that
this was a full circle moment for you in

60
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:14,190
this filming and authenticity
was key to the casting process.

61
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,060
What made you say Yes to these three
gentlemen for these roles that they were

62
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:19,110
able to play for this film?

63
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,430
Just hands down their performances,
you know, for, um, Jason,

64
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,550
you know, he has a lot of
experience, you know, in New Orleans,

65
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:33,750
but you know, in, in, in, in
the streets and, um, you know,

66
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:36,210
he brought a great performance,
but it also,

67
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,310
I could tell that he really
had a lot of, um, experience,

68
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,490
a lot of experience that I could
use and help to help create easy e.

69
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,170
One of the biggest things about casting
that role is not only his performance

70
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:56,820
but as a street credibility. And
so with Jason, he has, you know,

71
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,570
a lot of street credibility and
also he's a great actor. Um,

72
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,270
with Corey, you know, he has a
different background, you know,

73
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,680
went to Julliard and, and, um,

74
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:10,140
was doing Broadway and
Shakespeare and things like that.

75
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:13,560
And he came and completely
transformed into Dr Dre.

76
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,220
And so that was, um, a thing that was,

77
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:18,980
so it's just,

78
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,740
he just jumped off the screen in a way
that no one ever had regarding these

79
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:27,540
auditions. And it was great. And for Shea,
you know, he worked the hardest, you know,

80
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,660
he worked the hardest to get the role
and I'll let them tell you about their

81
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:34,470
journey. But authenticity was
the key and they brought it.

82
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,870
And to the cast. Actually, I
wanted to ask that question.

83
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:38,980
What was that journey like?

84
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:42,610
How did you guys become these characters
that we are so happy to get a chance to

85
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:43,540
see you pretty soon here?

86
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,293
Well,

87
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,140
I will say the hardest part about this
entire project was the prep. You know,

88
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:56,970
we put so much, so much
time in the prep, uh,

89
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,760
audition for this role for over two years,
uh,

90
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,090
before, you know, getting
called bags, different acting
coaches and Erin's Speiser.

91
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,990
He works with Wellsmith. Susan Batson
works with Nicole Kidman. And, uh,

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,780
once I got selected, even work with
Dustin Felder who works with will's kids.

93
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:18,710
So I've had a collective effort,
three different teachers,

94
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:23,630
three different techniques to really
form one project. And uh, you know, I,

95
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,260
I definitely couldn't do
this without them. Uh,

96
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:32,290
and they led to a chemistry test
where I meet these two right here and,

97
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:36,620
uh, you know, I had never done a
chemistry test. I never, you know,

98
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:41,180
this is my first go around and I
walk in there and a, I go to meet,

99
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,600
uh, the people that aren't, that
are around, I see a Jheri curl.

100
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,550
I'm going to go say what's up.
So I had over to do and I ask him,

101
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:52,540
you know, how I introduce myself?
How you doing? I'm going to say, uh,

102
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,320
you go for easy. And he says, no, I'm
going for cube. And then, you know,

103
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:00,800
after further,
after further review,

104
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,100
I see what kind of, you know, what kind
of a soup I am. And you know, it's just,

105
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:08,750
it's a,
it's a different kind of set up.

106
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,880
The competition look Gumbo with the same
ingredients. Exactly what I'm saying. So,

107
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:16,190
you know, there's, there's
two other cubes there. So the,

108
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:20,630
the pressure was always
there. And you know, once I,

109
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,440
once I booked the role, it was, it
was a weight lifted off my shoulders.

110
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:27,830
But even then, I knew the
real work had to start. Uh,

111
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:31,680
I had to look 17,
I went on a strict diet of,

112
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,470
of dirt and

113
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,430
grass and diet water and you know,
uh,

114
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,910
I lost 15 pounds in 24 days
of crossfit training and,

115
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:48,560
you know, shout out to PJ stall.
And we recorded the entire album.

116
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:51,830
It when we all went through
our own separate boot camps.

117
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:55,010
These guys can attest to their,
their hard work, but you know,

118
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:56,990
nothing about this film was easy,

119
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,240
but great morale makes great movies and
they chemistry I have with these guys

120
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:06,910
and the rest of the cast, it shows
in our film. And you know, it's,

121
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,570
it's all a test to the techniques
that we had to go through during prep.

122
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,450
Uh, for me, I'm, I'm like Gary
said, I was a at Julliard,

123
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,370
um, just doing Broadway
Shakespeare in New York and um,

124
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,280
I had heard about it and you know,
my agent was like, you know, this,

125
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,710
this movie straight Outta Compton.
I'm like, dope. Like, that's cool.

126
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:34,580
Like how can I get in there? Like, what
role can I play? He's like, go in for dre.

127
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:38,600
I said, oh wait, wait,
wait, wait. Come on.

128
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,610
Come on Dr Dre.
And uh,

129
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:47,060
so he was like, um, yeah, yeah. You know,
we got the audition set up and everything.

130
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,600
I say, listen, I'm not going
in for it because first of
all, I don't look like him.

131
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:52,790
I don't sound like him. I don't
think I, you know what I mean?

132
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,440
I just don't think I can do that.

133
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,590
It's same things that get in your head as
an actor, um, you getting your own way.

134
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,310
Right. So he, he was like,
okay, okay, okay, but I'm
gonna set up the appointment.

135
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:06,090
I said, no, call me back eight
o'clock that night. And he's like,

136
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:08,190
the casting director called and
said, you didn't come in. And I said,

137
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:13,020
I told you I wasn't going broke
because, um, but you know,

138
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:13,950
I knew,

139
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,360
I knew that this project was going to
be special because of who was involved

140
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:22,920
because Gary was involved
in cute was involved and dre
was involved in the other,

141
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,770
you know, members of Nwa and
easiest widow and, you know, and,

142
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,770
and so one thing led to another, I
skyped with Gary. Um, and then ended up,

143
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,880
you know, thank you man. Uh,

144
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,390
flying out to La to do the studio test
and he don't run studio tests like normal

145
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,350
people run studio test.
Like he had about five,

146
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:48,210
six cameras rolling on for one set up.
All, you know, and it was, it was crazy.

147
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:52,500
It was, it was wild, but it was surreal.
And all I remember thinking was, you know,

148
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,590
looking back at a time when I was doubting
myself then while I was in it and I

149
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:58,260
was like, Oh yeah, I'm about to,
I'm about, I'm about to go on this,

150
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:02,310
you know what I mean? I'm, I'm, I'm ready
now. I'm hungry. I want it. Um, and then,

151
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,880
yeah, we, we linked up and the work began,

152
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
but there was so much work before we
could even start the prep work before we

153
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:13,770
could even start principal photography.
So we'll talk about that. But, you know,

154
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,260
love me.

155
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,480
I was Kinda like in a situation
where I felt like, um,

156
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,560
you know why I had done a couple of
active projects here and there, you know,

157
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:28,210
but I was like Kinda day plan,
you know,

158
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,870
cause I'm from New Orleans and I'd never
even been to California and nothing

159
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:36,560
like that. But, um, it kind of
started the pickup, you know,

160
00:10:36,561 --> 00:10:39,720
what my acting career and I've done two
movies with Mark Wahlberg. I did, um,

161
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,850
broken city and contraband. So I was
kind of like on the radar for universal.

162
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,870
There was like this kid, just a good
dude. Like he, you know, he worked hard,

163
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:50,410
he'd come, he'd do his work and he just,
he chill, you know, so there was like,

164
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:52,900
maybe we should read them
for a lead. So, you know,

165
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,920
they sent it to me and I
was like, easy, Eh, Ooh,

166
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,920
Ooh. So, you know, needless
to say, you know, I,

167
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,780
I took the opportunity serious, I did my
homework, you know, did what I could and,

168
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:11,380
um, I really just went in, like
put my foot in it, you know,

169
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:15,520
and the lady I read with,
she's a lady named Megan Lewis
from New Orleans and, um,

170
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,080
she's normally like really,
really like straight forward.

171
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:23,740
It really serious, you know, she's
really Boston if anybody from Boston,

172
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,010
she's really, really Boston,
something like, alright, you know,

173
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,230
and I went and read with her and,
um,

174
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,200
we had this, this, this different
kind of vibe in the room that day.

175
00:11:35,201 --> 00:11:37,620
I remember her giving me like the
double high five and all that,

176
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,120
and she walked me to the car. I
was like, this is no, you know,

177
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:42,640
so I was already feeling good about it,

178
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:46,210
but then it took them like almost a
month to call me back. So I was like, ah,

179
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,370
maybe I didn't get it, you know. Then when
they did call me back, they were like,

180
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,340
Gary wants you to out, you
know, for, for, um, a car back.
And I'd be like, wait, wait,

181
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,250
can't you still like not get the road
when you get a call back? They was like,

182
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:03,340
yeah, that was like, ah, well you
know the way my bank account set up,

183
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,980
oh no, y'all might got to get back at
me, you know? And it was like, well,

184
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,780
you know, we'll call you back, you
know, see what we could do about it.

185
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,840
So they called me back like 30 minutes
later. It was like, man, Gary loves you.

186
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,100
He wants to Skype with you. I'll
be like for him. Ah, you know,

187
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:24,880
so I went down and did it
and we skyped for like,

188
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,220
I was 17 minutes and probably
some seconds, you know,
but I was like, you know,

189
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:33,550
whatever, you know. So I
just remember, you know,

190
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:36,550
cause I had to do this scene where I'm
like breaking down something like crying

191
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,470
and he's like, breathe, breathe.

192
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,260
When I'm like finally like
I'm not nervous no more. Well,

193
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,590
the audition is over now,
so I feel our breath and I'm like,

194
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,940
I just bust out laughing.

195
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:48,850
So I all these other voices busts out
laughing and I can't really see his face

196
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:53,110
on the Skype, like, what's
happening, what's happening?

197
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,750
So I never heard the words I booked,
you know,

198
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,520
so like later on they
called me and they're like,

199
00:12:57,521 --> 00:12:59,950
we're going to fly you out for a studio
test. And that's where I meet these guys.

200
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,600
But unlike them, I was the only easy
e. But in my mind, I'm thinking, man,

201
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:07,640
maybe they too big, they have to come
to a studio test like this. You know,

202
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:10,990
I'm like, you know, so I'm like,
I'm on full pit mentality. I'm like,

203
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:14,890
I never thought I got the role. So we're,
we're going through like days of it,

204
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:18,610
you know. But through that I could like
feel this chemistry going on between us.

205
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:22,090
It was like Gary could throw something
in the mix of wedges. We was like,

206
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:25,930
Paul Ryan, is that it? You know what I
mean? It was, it was crazy. And you know,

207
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:30,430
shout out to the guys who didn't get it,
but we already knew what was that

208
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,820
we already knew, you know? And, um,
yeah, we went into a boot camp that was,

209
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:39,410
that was some crazy, cause
I like this guy, you know,

210
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:41,980
I like to the dirt and lemon
grass that he was eating.

211
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,360
We had to eat 4,000 calories a day,
boxing training,

212
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,840
then weight training. Then I had
to go learn how to do, you know,

213
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:54,430
walk and talk like easy e and perform
and do our ladder and record it,

214
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:58,270
then rehearsal and then do it
again the next day for two months.

215
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,330
So yeah,
it was for real.

216
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,920
Okay. So this next question is
for Cube, obviously in a Gary,

217
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,780
what was it like having Nwa on set
with you guys during this process?

218
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:15,010
Like how was that experience reliving
this story with your, with your team,

219
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:16,790
with the crew and with
the whole production cat?

220
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:22,390
I think that was, you know, the, one of
the funnest parts was to see them perform.

221
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,253
Uh,

222
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,240
and we got this big arena full of people
and they was actually going to get up

223
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:32,640
there and do it for real.
And I've never been to an NW,

224
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,650
it's kind of cool. You know, I was
like, damn, you know, it is, you know,

225
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:44,100
it was impactful. It was
powerful. And I'm like, man,

226
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:48,210
this is powerful for for 2015,
you know,

227
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:52,080
I can imagine how it was for 1989.
Uh,

228
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,100
it was just a treat to see
it from afar and Kinda and,

229
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,670
and look, be looking at
us, but, but you know,

230
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:06,650
actually be an audience or bottom
monitors with Gary. And it was just,

231
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:09,260
uh, you know, I wanted them, you know,

232
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,400
some of them most amazing giddy feelings
that we've had with each other for as

233
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:21,350
me ran yella tray, you know,
seeing them up there, you know,

234
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:24,740
we were just like kids, man. And it
was like we were just like old times,

235
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:27,590
so it was so fun.
Um,

236
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,840
but I did feel like we was in a back
to the future movie. I see. You know,

237
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,890
I felt like we was going to
change history if, uh, if,

238
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:39,050
if O'Shea water wrong hat and shit,

239
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,990
everybody started disappearing
and Shit, you know, so,

240
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,590
so, you know, we just,
just, it was just a great,

241
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:52,820
great experience that I'll never forget
that we all went through the fire

242
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:54,740
together and we bonded.

243
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,120
I'm bonded with these guys just like
I'm bonded with Nwa because they are Nwa

244
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,460
now for everybody who looks on the screen,

245
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,530
who don't pick up a documentary,
you know, when they see Nwa,

246
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,720
they got to see these guys. So they are
as they, they're an extension of, of us.

247
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:16,180
So it's a beautiful thing.

248
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:23,140
Do you, so was the question, how was it
having the real Nwa on the set? Yeah,

249
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,010
well, you know, for me it
helped out a lot. For me,

250
00:16:27,011 --> 00:16:30,010
the best film making is,
you know, uh, you know,

251
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,850
when you have someone at the helm who
just gives you details and really pays

252
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:38,140
attention to detail and just does all the
research and the homework to transport

253
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:43,141
you to another time and another world
and make you feel like you're there.

254
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,310
And so to have Nwa on the set.

255
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,810
For me it was great because I'm getting
firsthand accounts of all these moments

256
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:54,250
in the studio, all the fights, all
the great moments, all of the pottery,

257
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:59,350
all of the stuff that was going on. And
so when you watch the movie, you, you,

258
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:03,940
you, you really get a sense that,
wow, these guys were brothers. Um,

259
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,810
you got a sense of the anger when they
were angry and it wasn't something that

260
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:12,790
you just, um, I was at Google
and you know what I mean?

261
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:17,650
Like I don't wanna say it like that, but
I'm just saying like, you can go beyond,

262
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,580
you know, Google's though, don't
get me wrong. Nope, of course.

263
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:25,300
Google is Hashtag Google's dope.
No, but I'm saying you get,

264
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:29,890
you get details from the guys that you
can't get on Wikipedia or online and

265
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,490
those details really help
the movie feel authentic.

266
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,600
We did Google a lot too.
Right.

267
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,610
And funny you should ask that.
So we are in a technology company,

268
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:46,330
we are at Google. Right. What
would make in this process,

269
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,880
what would making this film in like 1995
91 have been like with the ad says a

270
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:54,450
social media and how do you compare
that today to what we have today?

271
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:58,260
Like what do you think Nwa in the story
would have been like with technology and

272
00:17:58,261 --> 00:18:02,190
with social media? The way it
was day back in the Nwa is days.

273
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,210
Oh man, you know, everything would have
just happened a lot faster than I can.

274
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,830
I can't imagine that because you
know, it, it happened fast for us.

275
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,050
So we thought we was
just going to be local.

276
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:18,051
So we thought our music was so rough and
so underground that we would just be,

277
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,540
you know, underground artists and
never really get to this level and a,

278
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:28,860
so everything would have happened at a,
at a breakneck speed.

279
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,890
Uh, so, you know, it's, it's,
it's interesting to think about,

280
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,760
I'm kind of glad it happened the way it
did. You know, because you never know.

281
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:42,270
One little change,
one little thing in history and you know,

282
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:46,770
might not turn out like this. Uh,
and you know, this is a story.

283
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,300
And Ana and I kept mentioning that
the reason we want to tell this story,

284
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:56,301
cause we all been entertained
by Nwa for over 25 years.

285
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,730
Uh, you know, know Nwa. There's
no poison. The hood movie,

286
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,540
No boys in the hood movie,
No Friday movie,

287
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,580
which Gary Directed, uh, and we did
together, you know what I'm saying?

288
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,850
And so these things,
uh,

289
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:20,570
these things all coincide with each other
and it's a great origin story because,

290
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:27,090
you know, people love snoop and them and
them and all these things and you know,

291
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:29,160
they bumping they beats and all that.

292
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:32,490
And we wouldn't have
none of that without Nwa.

293
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,760
We might not even have
shea junior without Nwa.

294
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:43,290
So, you know, everybody
world is that, you know, so,

295
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,060
uh,
you know,

296
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,570
is really all about showing
people where it came from and,

297
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:54,180
and celebrating it in and making people
a part. You know, the way Gary shot it,

298
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,110
you feel like you were in the studio with,
you feel like you rolling with us.

299
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,100
You feel like you're being produced
by doctor dre. So, you know,

300
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:05,400
these are experiences that we understand,

301
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:09,690
we felt and we want the audience to
experience what we experienced. And, uh,

302
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:15,110
you know, Gary did a magnificent
job in capturing, you know,

303
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,610
everything that we want to show.
Thank you.

304
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,720
And this question is for you Gary.
Yeah.

305
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:25,170
It felt like La and south central Los
Angeles and Compton or actually the sixth

306
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,730
member of Nwa and this film,

307
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,550
it felt like that was actually a
character of the film and the way that you

308
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:33,100
really took care of filming
and doing those things there.

309
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:36,180
What was that process like
actually filming most of the movie,

310
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,950
particularly in the Los Angeles area,
home, southern California earlier?

311
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,920
Well, it was crucial, you know, like
you said, it I, Los Angeles, Compton,

312
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:48,070
south central, you know, they,
they do feel like the sixth member

313
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,720
of Nwa and it's because all of the
things that happen in that area,

314
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:56,980
in that era really forging Nwa, all
the good stuff, all the bad stuff,

315
00:20:56,981 --> 00:21:00,910
all of the things that they went through
and you hear it and their raps you

316
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:04,000
hearing in their poetry. And so, um,

317
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:09,270
being able to open up and show not only
wide shots of Los Angeles with the palm

318
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:15,790
trees and you know, and um, how kind
of beautiful but dangerous it is.

319
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,090
Um, being able to tap into the
street culture with the car,

320
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:22,060
custom cars and even our atmosphere,
our extras,

321
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,650
all these things lend itself to making
it feel like Los Angeles and the 80s.

322
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,870
And it's just about authenticity.
You know,

323
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:33,700
when you watch the Scorsese movie
and he does a casino, Vegas is the,

324
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,640
a character in a movie.
And um,

325
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,150
all of the different things that you
get the nuances from Los Angeles really

326
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:43,090
helps serve the story.
And that's why it was important.

327
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,400
So this question is for the task mates.
What were your favorite moments from set?

328
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:55,940
I'm glad you said favorites with
the NAS babies. With the nurse.

329
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,600
Yeah. That's so dope. But um, they met
me. Has So, so, so many good moments,

330
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,380
you know? But, um, that cube said like,

331
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,300
he never been to an Nwa
concert and I'm not a rapper,

332
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:14,060
so I lived with della because her before,
you know,

333
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,790
but I went through this
process of kind of like,

334
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,220
yeah,

335
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,210
being like y'all on TV,
you know, to be in like

336
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,880
super confident when I'm
around these guys. You know,

337
00:22:25,881 --> 00:22:28,610
they was the same people who were like,
y'all are the dues for the job.

338
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,880
You know what I mean?
But until you see somebody come out,

339
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:36,320
the character that you normally see
them in, it don't really feel like that,

340
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:40,910
you know? But when we did those concerts,
you can see them like, yeah, you know,

341
00:22:40,911 --> 00:22:44,120
you could see him in that zone, like
their eyes light up and you're like, wow,

342
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,240
that's what's up. You know? So
like, it was good. You know,

343
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,800
it's like that type of
feeling that you have,

344
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:52,460
you get to like really do that rock star
life for a minute. You know what I mean?

345
00:22:52,461 --> 00:22:55,940
It was just, it was a famous
moment. It was super dope. Yeah.

346
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,770
Uh, who's, who's seen the film.

347
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,260
Okay.

348
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,840
All right. Ooh, y'all
in for a surprise. All

349
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:10,450
right, well then, uh, you
know, that, that, that, that
changes things a little bit. Um,

350
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,980
I, one of my favorite times on said,
uh, it's in the trailer. Uh, you know,

351
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,690
I, I'm pretty upset at a, at
a man in an office, you know,

352
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:23,540
kind of,
I kind of take it out a little bit,

353
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,760
but one of the highlights of us film
and the movie was Paul Giamatti bouncin

354
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:38,290
with a BB and some gold ropes on
to why g hitting the switches that,

355
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:44,140
uh, you know, Paul Paul Giamatti was the,

356
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,520
the veteran and the rookie locker room.
You know,

357
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:51,340
he had things to say to all of us
that build confidence in us. His,

358
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:55,380
uh, yeah, Tom Brady, uh, his,
uh, he ain't Cheetah. He, uh,

359
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,050
he told me,
you know,

360
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,230
he would tell me,
he would tell me about his father,

361
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:06,460
who was a famous baseball player. Like
is if you, if you look him up, you know,

362
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:11,460
Mr Giamatti has a huge role in baseball,
but he was, he was telling me, uh,

363
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,940
the amount of pressure he would feel if
he had to play his father and in a role.

364
00:24:15,941 --> 00:24:18,520
So, you know, it would, he,
he told us all things that,

365
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,540
that built up something and then say, you
know, I appreciate everything. Football.

366
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,960
Yeah. Give it, um,

367
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:32,000
it was uh, it was probably, I mean it
was, I think it was definitely the,

368
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,560
the concert scenes. You know, it just had
to be the concert scenes because again,

369
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:41,130
I'm not a rapper either, so no, I'm saying
to be up there. But the thing about dre,

370
00:24:41,131 --> 00:24:43,280
he was Sorta, you know, on
the tables back in the day.

371
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:47,270
So it was just cool to be up there
really like spinning and like,

372
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:52,070
cause I had to actually go through that
and learn how to Dj literally learn

373
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:56,510
every single thing, every
single producing, you know,
everything about it. But um,

374
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,830
those were the moments that we really
felt like Nwa. And then to have,

375
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:04,700
like you said, La is, is like a competent,
it's like a six character in a movie.

376
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,130
You know,
we had people bring in as plates,

377
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:11,360
onset of food and sitting on
the rooftops and you know,

378
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,440
hold my baby,
you know,

379
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:19,310
stealing easy east
chairs come back though.

380
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:22,370
I'm thinking most people would take the
chip back. They take the whole chair.

381
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:25,110
I'm like, whoa. Really? Was it was,

382
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:29,420
it was positivity though. You know,
it was just a lot of positive energy.

383
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,350
And it's funny because in the news and
the media, everybody tries to say, Oh,

384
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:37,130
you know all this,
you know hootenanny is that a word?

385
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,100
You know,
Hashtag [inaudible]

386
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,770
movie, you know, all
this craziness around it.

387
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,840
Ooh Man.
Craziness around surrounding the movie.

388
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:54,270
But every day we got a new nickname.
Now you're officially

389
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,730
stop this right now.

390
00:25:57,731 --> 00:26:02,731
I'll give you a man who here
what they call me like you have,

391
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,290
you have a nickname. Oh Gee, doctor.

392
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:10,060
Who'd Nan who?

393
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,240
I think I heard that since
like the dukes of Hazzard, 1983

394
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:22,660
Oh man,
I'm going to know inside job forever.

395
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,130
I can't even go on it. It was
just, it was real positive,

396
00:26:27,131 --> 00:26:29,910
real path causing.
Awesome

397
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,270
for you cube. Um, Compton, that's
where you're from. That's your city,

398
00:26:37,271 --> 00:26:40,090
that's your hometown.
What does straight out of Compton,

399
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:43,500
what does this movie mean for your
philanthropic efforts that you're for the

400
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:48,450
city and how can this film success tied
to those programs that you're running

401
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:49,284
out there?

402
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,050
Well, you know, it's like, you know,

403
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:55,390
Compton and south central Long Beach,

404
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:59,960
it was like we was trying to really put
the west coast on the map, you know,

405
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,460
before Nwa,
uh,

406
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:08,490
it was only one real west coast rapper
getting any light and that was ice t and.

407
00:27:09,401 --> 00:27:11,710
M.
So we was trying to,

408
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,580
to inject some kind of
pride into the city, uh,

409
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,160
before easy. He really
pushed for Compton. You know,

410
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:25,240
people was, people didn't even want to
admit they was from Compton, you know,

411
00:27:25,241 --> 00:27:25,780
it was like,

412
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:30,780
it was so bad and everybody knew that
it was such a raw area that people

413
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:34,360
wouldn't even say they was from there.
They were saying it was from Carson.

414
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,210
You know what I'm saying? Which
is right by Compton. And, um,

415
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,970
so he injected pride and
you know, by, you know,

416
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:48,520
other people, Sam Brooklyn's in the house,
Queens in the house. And we was like,

417
00:27:48,521 --> 00:27:52,150
Yo,
now Compton's in the house and you know,

418
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,870
people were Compton with pride. Now I
see my man with the Compton on his hat.

419
00:27:55,871 --> 00:27:56,950
So it's a,

420
00:27:56,951 --> 00:28:01,660
it's a badge of honor and people know that
there's talent there and uh, you know,

421
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:05,650
it's just really about, given
that talent, inspiration,

422
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,460
showing people that we come
off the same streets you do,

423
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,450
and it ain't just comped and it can be
anywhere and ain't gotta beat your hood.

424
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:16,210
It could be the suburbs,
just do it, you know,

425
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:20,050
just have passion and a,
have a drive,

426
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,560
have a commitment and have some discipline
and you can get a lot of great things

427
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:30,130
done. So that's what we're really
trying to push. And, um, you know,

428
00:28:30,131 --> 00:28:34,930
dre has really stepped up for
the city of Compton as well.

429
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:39,190
You know, he's, uh, you know,
donate in a lot of, is, uh,

430
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:43,030
I guess money from this new
album to Compton. And, you know,

431
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:47,500
we're figuring things to, to do
for the city as well as, you know,

432
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,770
easies uh, kids, you know,

433
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,830
his kids are left behind
and all when he passed away.

434
00:28:53,831 --> 00:28:58,180
So we just trying to hold the
legacy up. That's all. That's great.

435
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,043
That's beautiful.

436
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,860
Yeah. Um, for me, um,

437
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:07,480
I've worked with dre over the last four
years or so. Um, it, give it back to,

438
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,340
to Compton specifically.
Um,

439
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,130
but I have a youth center actually called
the Tom Bradley Youth Center on Pico

440
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,870
that I've adopted and over the last
decade have been instrumental in keeping

441
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:22,920
that place up and going and running
and working with a lot of, uh,

442
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,750
kids without parents. And, um,

443
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:30,640
there's a elementary school and watch
called a hundred clustery elementary

444
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:34,680
school and also Verbum dei high school
where I put a film program and, and,

445
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:39,380
and those places in order to show kids
that they can do other things, um,

446
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,010
that's creative like they did,
they picked a pen and pad

447
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,480
in a microphone. So, you know,

448
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:47,350
we sent cameras and editing equipment
and stuff there and been doing that for

449
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,340
quite a long time.

450
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:53,450
No, it's crazy. I feel like all you gotta
do is touch one life man. Like in, in

451
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:59,170
what they're doing is, um, it's,
it's powerful because they have a,

452
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:03,250
it's a family tree, you know,
that they create it. So, you know,

453
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:07,450
we're an extension of that, you know, of
their legacy and, and hopefully this film,

454
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,540
you know, continues that too,
but like just what they've done,

455
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,090
you know what I mean? In terms of
giving back and just showing up.

456
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,860
You touch one person,
that person gets touched millions that,

457
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,500
you know what I mean? So I
just think that's huge. Okay.

458
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,530
Well we can keep down on a hootenanny.

459
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,980
Good luck Cory.
Good luck Corey.

460
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:40,260
So it's been about 25 plus years
since the release of f the police.

461
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,383
And um,

462
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,190
this movie did such a brilliant job of
depicting a police brutality and what

463
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:50,690
that element did to people
in the cities of Compton,

464
00:30:50,691 --> 00:30:54,970
in Los Angeles and to people all over
the country. What, what has changed?

465
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,850
What do you think has
changed between then and now,

466
00:30:57,851 --> 00:31:02,020
and what can we do to really elevate
this conversation and to support projects

467
00:31:02,021 --> 00:31:03,850
like straight outta Compton
that are doing this as well?

468
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,160
Well, not enough has changed, you know,
and this movie really highlights that,

469
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:13,390
that uh, uh, the more things
change, the more they stay the same.

470
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:17,290
Um, I think what, what insights you,

471
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:22,450
when you see it in our movie
is the fact that you know,

472
00:31:22,451 --> 00:31:25,690
that these guys are trying
to do the right thing.

473
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:31,090
So the humiliation is that much more,

474
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,380
you know, and I think
it's more humiliation, uh,

475
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,390
is really the,

476
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:42,290
the type of abuse that we highlighted.
Uh,

477
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:47,650
um, so, you know, I just think
we got a weed it out. Um,

478
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,330
and it's,

479
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:54,331
it's very funny and I just
don't understand it that
a guy can go into a church

480
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:57,184
or whatever,

481
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,990
kill all these people and they walk him
out like he's the president, you know,

482
00:32:02,991 --> 00:32:07,960
and bulletproof vests and shit.
And you know, I was like, whoa.

483
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,440
And then the little 18 year old kid,
the mouse off at the cop,

484
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,050
he's the one with the black
eye and a busted nose.

485
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,560
So I just think they need to refocus
the anger on real criminals that do real

486
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:26,050
crime. You know, if you want to beat up
on somebody beat up on a child molester,

487
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:30,490
you know what I mean? Not The kid that's
a little drunk coming from is, you know,

488
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:35,470
uh, coming from the party or whatever.
So you know, these things, you know,

489
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:40,400
it's just uh, uh, a mentality
that we got to correct.

490
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,090
Okay. Now I think the solutions are, uh,

491
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,940
more body cameras, Dash
Cams, all this stuff,

492
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:53,150
just to be able to hold
people accountable,

493
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,530
be able to see the real picture of
what went down and it just hold people

494
00:32:57,531 --> 00:33:01,610
accountable. You know, everybody
crossed the line every now and then,

495
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,560
even regular citizens cross the line.
So when they cross the line,

496
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:10,100
you just hold them accountable
and it's starting to happen.
And, you know, I don't,

497
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:15,101
I don't think no cop want to go out in
the day and then end up on CNN and later

498
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:20,600
that night. I don't think nobody
wants to do that. So I just think,

499
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,651
you know,

500
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:26,420
those kind of things are
helping officers think twice.

501
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,490
And I hope our movie helps people to
think twice that, you know, you can't,

502
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,420
you can't, uh, pain our
community with a broad brush.

503
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,370
I think there were all the same,
you know,

504
00:33:38,371 --> 00:33:42,710
for all the statistics that they show
about the crime in our community,

505
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,120
40%,

506
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:49,121
this 30% that just know that
there's 60% that don't do it,

507
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,000
there's 70% that don't do it.

508
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:58,030
So it's more law abiding citizens
in the hood and criminals and,

509
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:03,920
and um, that's really what we just
trying to show is that, you know,

510
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:08,950
don't paint us all with the same brush
and a treat us fair like human beings.

511
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,363
That's all.

512
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:23,490
Well, I think you, you're really, he
really hit the mark, you know. Um,

513
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:27,210
you know, we've done a lot of talking.
We've done a lot of protesting.

514
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,050
I think we should start focusing on a
solutions. You know, I'm cautiously,

515
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,010
cautiously optimistic that a lot of the
headlines are going to put pressure on

516
00:34:35,011 --> 00:34:38,490
our leaders and our leaders in law
enforcement to make change in the culture.

517
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,910
This is not just one cop at a time is a,
you know,

518
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:45,450
you wouldn't do it if you didn't feel
like it was okay to do it, you know.

519
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:48,510
So we have to change the culture.
You know, you come to Google,

520
00:34:48,511 --> 00:34:49,560
it's not just about a job,

521
00:34:49,561 --> 00:34:54,090
it's a culture and that's why you guys
are who you are. And so successful.

522
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,840
So in police and law enforcement culture,
there has to be a shift. And that style,

523
00:34:57,841 --> 00:35:00,690
it starts at the top, not just what
the guy who's having a bad day.

524
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,670
And so I think that if we consider putting
pressure on our lawmakers to change

525
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:10,671
federal law and make it a felony to
tamper with audio recordings and video

526
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:14,580
recordings and things like that.
And so if you're caught up in that,

527
00:35:14,581 --> 00:35:18,510
you go to jail and you'll spend time with
those criminals that you're trying to,

528
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,210
um, um, you know, keep behind bars,

529
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:26,340
make it a real penalty, not
just, you know, uh, you know,

530
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,310
consequences of an invisible
investigation and make it a real penalty.

531
00:35:29,311 --> 00:35:32,610
And I think if we start,
stop burning down our cities,

532
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,690
stop just talking about it.
I mean the conversation is good,

533
00:35:36,691 --> 00:35:38,370
but let's on solutions.

534
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,470
Um,
I believe there was a study in Rialto,

535
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:45,471
California where they put body cams and
dash cams on every officer they are in,

536
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,800
basically they'll
complaints went down by 88%,

537
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,220
and the incidents went down by 60% over
the course of actually just eating a

538
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:56,850
year, I believe, or something like that.

539
00:35:56,851 --> 00:36:00,600
And so let's start focusing on
solutions less, not just, you know,

540
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:04,560
channel our anger and, and, and,
and, and conversation on protesting.

541
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,740
Let's look at real solutions. And
I think that's part of it. Um,

542
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,880
my mother is a police officer and,
uh,

543
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,460
it was one when I got to sit and she
came to visit set, they were like,

544
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,810
you might have to recast.
Okay.

545
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:18,923
Right.

546
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:25,210
She, she, so she's a cop,
but, uh, she's a fan of their,

547
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,080
their music. She's a fan of them,
you know, she's a fan of the culture.

548
00:36:29,081 --> 00:36:32,840
She's a fan of, uh, of,
of Sam positivity, um,

549
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,590
in which she does in the community.

550
00:36:35,591 --> 00:36:39,500
And I think a lot of departments can
take a lesson from it is, is, you know,

551
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,010
her and her partner, they started this
thing in DC. I'm from DC, um, and,

552
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,850
and it's called Friday nights out.

553
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,750
And basically they set up these stages
around different parts. You know,

554
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:52,150
th th the trouble areas in DC,
you know,

555
00:36:52,151 --> 00:36:56,650
where I grew up and they allow kids
to come out and like if you wrap,

556
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,770
you can get on stage and you have a
place to do it. You know what I'm saying?

557
00:36:59,771 --> 00:37:03,020
If you seeing you, you know, whatever,
if you, you know what I mean? If you,

558
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,120
if you'd like to do art,

559
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:07,510
they bring out artists and they
work with the kids on Friday nights,

560
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:10,540
the nights where people, you know, can
get in a little bit of trouble. You know,

561
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:13,780
they like to do that. And it's the
police officers who are down there. So,

562
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:16,690
you know, she likes the art. So she
gets up there and does it with them.

563
00:37:16,691 --> 00:37:21,250
And you know, it's little
things like that. They're
really change, you know, the,

564
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:24,340
the, the, the community and
because they're supposed to be,

565
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,550
to protect the community, they supposed
to know when they walked the beat,

566
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,660
they supposed to know who live in this
house and who live in that house and

567
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,850
understand what you can understand and
have that dialogue with the community.

568
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,790
Then you can, you can, you can
open it up, you know what I mean?

569
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:41,560
The possibilities are endless and the
possibilities for negativity that stop,

570
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:45,190
you know what I mean? Um, but I think
that's just one little, you know,

571
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,610
the one thing I like to add too is just,
let's not mistake,

572
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,430
I don't want anyone to be
mistaken about our story.

573
00:37:51,431 --> 00:37:54,970
And the message within a story. This
is not an anti cop movie, right?

574
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,950
It's an anti criminal movie. You know,
excessive force is a crime. All right?

575
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:00,641
And,
um,

576
00:38:00,641 --> 00:38:04,570
ultimately we know there's a lot of
peaceful warriors out there that put on a

577
00:38:04,571 --> 00:38:06,970
badge,
but on a gun and that will help us.

578
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,700
And I think most of them
fit into that category.

579
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:12,850
So for other cook good cops that are
out there, we're not talking about,

580
00:38:12,851 --> 00:38:17,290
you were talking about that people who
have the propensity to go overboard and,

581
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:20,310
um, do what they're doing.
That's what we're complaining
about. Yeah. Yeah. Let's,

582
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,680
let's not get it twisted.
Yeah.

583
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,710
Somebody break in my house.
I'm calling the cops.

584
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:34,740
I'm not calling the homeys,
not calling Gary.

585
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,130
I'm

586
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,540
calling the cops. So you know what I
mean? It don't, don't get it twisted.

587
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,990
We just want to clean up a couple of,
couple of missteps,

588
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:48,820
a couple of little over aggression, you
know, uh, it's just want to clean that up.

589
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:53,410
But you know, we were not anti
law enforcement by no means,

590
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,690
no means.

591
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:57,770
So we're going to start lining up
people in the audience for Q and. A.

592
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,060
So if you have some questions,
please start lining up now.

593
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:03,720
And I wanted to wrap this up today you
guys, thank you so much for coming.

594
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,410
Thank you.

595
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,490
You guys are having,
it's definitely doable,

596
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:09,943
right?

597
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,390
My last question is a quick rapid fire.
You're going to start with,

598
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:22,170
I start with straight out of, and you're
going to tell me your answer. So ready.

599
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,570
And I'll go around.
So straight out of Long Beach,

600
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:28,020
Compton,
south central Washington,

601
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:31,260
DC answers and I'm
straight out of the water.

602
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,470
Thank you guys so much

603
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,303
for the audience.

604
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,710
Hey guys. Hey, where I come
from? Hootenanny's a real word,

605
00:39:43,711 --> 00:39:48,420
just hey and hats off to Julliard.

606
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:52,110
Major accomplishment. Love
that. You did that and see,

607
00:39:52,111 --> 00:39:53,160
and you hear what these guys,

608
00:39:53,161 --> 00:39:56,520
it's absolutely amazing to see if y'all
didn't hear the first Hootenanny's a

609
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:57,354
real word, right? Okay.

610
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go. We're
going to use it every day.

611
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,850
Um, Mister Cube, your highness.

612
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,483
I love it.

613
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,470
No, it's like when I saw this coming
today, I heard you guys, I'm Jason Ellis.

614
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:15,310
A couple of days ago,

615
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:18,820
which fascinating interview the
child did with him on Sirius.

616
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:22,370
But everybody was stunned that I was
coming over here to talk to you all,

617
00:40:22,371 --> 00:40:23,201
at least on my team.

618
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:26,890
So is there any tangent that could
get a picture with y'all too?

619
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:31,720
Prove I was actually here.
We only taken one picture is yours.

620
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,610
Come on up. We'll take yours. Have it.

621
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,800
She's lap collab.
Google is,

622
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:46,020
hey, can't believe you up here because it
all it is hootenanny everybody say who?

623
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:51,050
Nanny Hashtag

624
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,573
[inaudible]

625
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,730
so maybe you'll take two people,
not just young and just, uh,

626
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:03,470
so this question actually is for a
doctor. Hootenanny no, I'm just kidding.

627
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,190
Keep Rolling.

628
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,180
No, it's not going to end for a log time.
You got out of the side that, yeah. Uh,

629
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,620
first of all,
I just want to say a raider nation.

630
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,180
We are always in forever. Yeah.
So I'm from southern California,

631
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:24,181
born and raised in Barstow and grew
up really truly with a hip hop is as

632
00:41:24,311 --> 00:41:28,390
everything that pretty much got me to
the place where I am now. And music,

633
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:32,500
like express yourself and lethal injection
and all these incredible albums that

634
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:35,600
you created, um, had so much
to do with where I am today.

635
00:41:35,601 --> 00:41:38,870
So I just wanted to hear a little bit
about all of your musical influences and

636
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,290
what really inspires you and
inspired you in your role.

637
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:48,280
Uh, I'm completely
inspired by him. You know,

638
00:41:48,281 --> 00:41:52,540
it was all about, you know, a lot of
people didn't want me to get the role,

639
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:57,160
but he wanted me to get the Bra and
that's really what I needed. Um, he, uh,

640
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,470
he's had my back forever.
You know,

641
00:41:59,471 --> 00:42:04,060
I just wanted to make sure I had his
back on something and in everything,

642
00:42:04,061 --> 00:42:04,894
you know,

643
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:10,450
as far as what I'm doing in my career
in film and whatever I choose to do

644
00:42:10,451 --> 00:42:15,451
further and music is to further
build on this empire that he started,

645
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:21,670
you know, and, uh, I'm just thankful
that I'm given the opportunity to do so.

646
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,800
And, uh, you know, I'm
gonna make it rock. Okay.

647
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:29,680
Well, I'm a music dude, man. I'm a
really, really, really good fat to have,

648
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,180
you know? And I'm like, I kill
it in the shower. Awesome.

649
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:38,170
I'm one of them dudes. You
know what I mean? Like, like
music is a part of my life,

650
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,040
you know? And they just, it make
everything go together for me, you know?

651
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:46,480
And as far as like straight outta Compton
goes by US rerecording the whole album,

652
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:50,800
I think he put me in a different mind
frame of where I am today, you know,

653
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:55,830
because I kind of view
us as like the old Nwa,

654
00:42:56,651 --> 00:42:57,251
like,
you know,

655
00:42:57,251 --> 00:43:01,270
the situation they were in because it's
so much controversy that surrounded this

656
00:43:01,271 --> 00:43:02,110
movie and all that.

657
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:06,310
But it's still like a super positive
thing that we're doing no matter what may

658
00:43:06,311 --> 00:43:10,030
come out of it. It's still words and
it's still art that we'd given them,

659
00:43:10,031 --> 00:43:13,030
you know? And it's like, it's, she
mentioned in that forever, you know?

660
00:43:13,031 --> 00:43:15,040
So for me to be a part of that is like,

661
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:20,170
it's the best to say that these,
you know, so yeah, that's what's up.

662
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:26,320
Yeah. Same here, man. I'm, I'm,
uh, I'm just a fan of music,
so for sound good. If it's,

663
00:43:26,321 --> 00:43:30,490
if it's honest, if it's, you know, coming
from where you come from, then, then it's,

664
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:33,150
it's good. I rock with it.
But, um, in terms of like,

665
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:37,810
just inspiration and in
playing this character, I just
look up to these guys now,

666
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,380
you know,

667
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:43,000
it's like I really see where they came
from and I see what they're doing now.

668
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:46,030
And I'm like, I want to do that. I want
to be a movie mogul. You know what I mean?

669
00:43:46,031 --> 00:43:48,510
I want wanna,
I want to own a business.

670
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:53,430
I want to be a billion.
They're so freaking bad.

671
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,070
It's so crazy. Like to see the
possibilities, you can do it,

672
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:03,510
you know? And, uh, it's, it's just great
to be a part of this, this family tree.

673
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,473
So that was great.

674
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:07,160
Musical influences.
Uh,

675
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,760
George Clinton and parliament Funkadelic,

676
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:13,660
you know,

677
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:18,340
they really showed us how
to not care and be yourself,

678
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:22,390
you know, and just do what you
feel. And, you know, they so,

679
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:27,520
you know, light years ahead of a time. Um,

680
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:32,160
still, you know, that music
is still intricate in,

681
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:33,600
you know,

682
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,600
complex and free of any kind of,

683
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:43,860
uh, chains or musical, um, I guess,

684
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,650
uh, parameters, you know, they just
do what they feel. And, uh, so,

685
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:53,910
you know, George Clinton,
parliament funkadelic,

686
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,500
Rogers App, uh, James Brown,

687
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,380
you know, uh, these guys are,

688
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,710
they are a blueprint and you know,

689
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:09,990
we are an extension of what
they have done. You know,

690
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:13,830
you got P funk, you got g
funk, you know, so there it is.

691
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:15,693
For me,

692
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,260
I always kind of just loved the artists
that just stood up and had the courage

693
00:45:20,261 --> 00:45:22,810
to go against the grain.
And Marvin Gaye, me,

694
00:45:22,811 --> 00:45:26,950
the album called what's going on when he
was making balance and he just stood up

695
00:45:26,951 --> 00:45:30,250
and said, you know what, there's
so many things going on around me.

696
00:45:30,251 --> 00:45:33,250
I can't just talk about love
stories and things like that.

697
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:37,000
And that's an album that he
got a lot of problems, um,

698
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,900
and a lot of flak for, um, for,

699
00:45:40,901 --> 00:45:44,980
for creating and then, you know, then
putting it out. But it's a classic,

700
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,140
and I'm not just saying
this cause cube is here,

701
00:45:47,141 --> 00:45:50,470
but he made an album like that called
death certificate where he talked about

702
00:45:50,471 --> 00:45:52,900
the social ills around,
um,

703
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:57,760
where we grew up and just stood up and
with all the controversy and all the

704
00:45:57,761 --> 00:45:59,800
judgment that came,
um,

705
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:04,870
I just like I'm inspired by artists that
stand up and even in the midst of all

706
00:46:04,871 --> 00:46:09,871
of the pushback and the criticism and
controversy and speaks to what we go

707
00:46:10,211 --> 00:46:13,990
through. And I'm Marvin Gaye's, you
know, my number one and you know,

708
00:46:13,991 --> 00:46:17,860
Cube doesn't notice, but you know,
he definitely inspired me as well.

709
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,293
Now we know.

710
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:26,630
So I am just so excited that you guys are
here like presenting to this audience.

711
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:31,690
I'm just so glad that we
had this opportunity to see
you and listen to you and

712
00:46:32,181 --> 00:46:36,240
your actual like perspectives.
And to that end, um,

713
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,800
just real quick queue.
I cannot believe I'm addressing you.

714
00:46:39,801 --> 00:46:43,130
The person who wrote no
Vaseline cause that was insane

715
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,710
as an eighth grader.
Like it was crazy.

716
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:51,870
But the question that I
do have is for Cuban Gary,

717
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,140
how do you feel about
people taking your work?

718
00:46:55,141 --> 00:47:00,141
Kind of out of the context that it's in
and enjoying it like mainstream America

719
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:04,200
enjoying it but not really understanding
what it's about or where it's from.

720
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:07,590
Like the example with um bye Felicia.

721
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,130
How that's become like a great phrase
for everyone to use and then they don't

722
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:13,170
really know that it's
from Friday or who Felicia

723
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:18,120
[inaudible].

724
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,230
That's ridiculous to me.

725
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:26,250
So how do you feel about things that
when they happens like that when it's co

726
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:28,630
opted by,
like the main stream culture,

727
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:34,910
you know, I don't mind as much,
you know, cause I figure to

728
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:40,400
the cool people in know what
I'm talking about, you know,

729
00:47:40,401 --> 00:47:43,990
and everybody else and everybody
else need to catch up. You know,

730
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:46,840
that's how I feel.
It's like a paint and you know,

731
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:51,841
once you put it on the wall everybody's
going to have a different kind of

732
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:57,370
interpretation of what you were
trying to say or do. And that's fine.

733
00:47:57,371 --> 00:47:59,110
That's what it's all about.
You know,

734
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:02,260
I can't tell you what to
think about my song, you know,

735
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:07,240
you gotta tell me what you think about my
song. You know, all I could do is do it,

736
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,480
do it how I feel it.
And you know, when Nwa,

737
00:48:10,481 --> 00:48:13,240
I don't want to say that we was,
you know,

738
00:48:13,241 --> 00:48:18,241
this super positive political group
that went to go politically changed the

739
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:20,800
world. No, we,

740
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:25,180
we had a lot of records that
was just straight raw, uh,

741
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,450
and probably wasn't positive at all,

742
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:34,840
but they was honest. And I think that's
why people love us because we was honest.

743
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:36,640
We wasn't worried about that part.

744
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:40,060
We wasn't worried about the people
that didn't like us. You know,

745
00:48:40,061 --> 00:48:43,120
we were just worried about
what we liked. And, you know,

746
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:47,220
a lot of more people was on our
side than against us. And, uh,

747
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,630
that's why we still here. So, you know,

748
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:54,631
it doesn't bother me at all that
people misinterpret anything that I do.

749
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,530
You know, it's all are like he said,
you're just expressing yourself. So, um,

750
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,980
I couldn't put it any better than cute.
Put It,

751
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:06,610
you just express yourself and let it be
what it's going to be. And that's it.

752
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:13,670
The people who don't know that by Felicia
is Friday or the same people who are

753
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:19,440
Twitter say, aw man, Kanye is going
to blow this Paul Mccartney dude up.

754
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:20,611
Or Man,

755
00:49:20,611 --> 00:49:24,450
thank God Katy Perry found new artists
like missy Elliot for the Superbowl

756
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,640
halftime. They probably, you know,

757
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:30,330
those people will probably watched
straight outta Compton and be like, oh,

758
00:49:30,331 --> 00:49:34,770
this should be a real group. You
know, so, you know, that's, that's,

759
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:35,970
that's my piece on that.

760
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,710
So real quick, I just want to
thank you guys for coming by. Yeah,

761
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:49,540
I'm striped from comp to actually I grew
up on Maple Avenue, east elementary,

762
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:53,100
Roosevelt middle, all that
stuff. Um, so they're kind of,

763
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:58,080
I have a question specifically for a
Cuban for Gary. Um, when I was growing up,

764
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:02,550
a lot of like my friends and staff really
bought into Gangsta rap and they kind

765
00:50:02,551 --> 00:50:04,770
of figured that there were
really only two options, right?

766
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,370
It was either going to be music or I was
going to be sports and like I've tried

767
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:10,980
to go back to the community just
to tell them about, well, you know,

768
00:50:10,981 --> 00:50:14,250
you could do programming, you could do,
you know, other kinds of arts, you know,

769
00:50:14,251 --> 00:50:15,990
you go on to Madison and
all that kind of stuff.

770
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:21,180
Like what would you guys say to maybe
those youth in Compton Long Beach,

771
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:26,000
you know, you know from where we're
from that think that music and um,

772
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:27,860
in sports their only option.

773
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:31,670
Well, I like to speak to
that just because, um,

774
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,130
I grew up in south central
La and I don't have a degree.

775
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:38,960
I didn't go to college and I went into
film, you know, I didn't, you know,

776
00:50:38,961 --> 00:50:43,100
do all the things that, or, or at least
I didn't feel like I had limited options.

777
00:50:43,101 --> 00:50:47,210
You know, I just found something I
liked and I just stuck with it. And um,

778
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,540
you know, you can get in the
program or whatever you, you know,

779
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:52,310
you want to get into. And I
was on the streets. You know,

780
00:50:52,311 --> 00:50:54,590
part of the reason why a lot of
the work we've done together,

781
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:59,270
it feels authentic cause
cause I was really there and
either witnessed it or um,

782
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,600
you know, was involved in it.
So you can make a transition.

783
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,430
It's about what you create.
You can create your own universe.

784
00:51:05,431 --> 00:51:10,130
And I know it sounds Cliche, but
it's real and I've, you know,

785
00:51:10,131 --> 00:51:14,210
like right now I'm super nerding
out on model airplanes, you know,

786
00:51:14,211 --> 00:51:19,160
and I'm building seriously.
And it was telescopes down.

787
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,800
No, it was, I mean I, I've gone through
a few phases, you know, studying the,

788
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:26,630
the surface of the moon
and things like that.

789
00:51:26,631 --> 00:51:31,340
And then I w I build my planes
and drones and cameras and,

790
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:35,330
and, and I just started flying
airplanes so you can, you know,

791
00:51:35,331 --> 00:51:39,080
be wherever you from and then just have
the courage to make the transition.

792
00:51:39,081 --> 00:51:41,710
I love with cubes done where
he's gone from, you know,

793
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,420
gangster rap to political rap and
back and to movies into, you know,

794
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:47,510
giving people opportunities.
And he's a family man,

795
00:51:47,511 --> 00:51:49,400
and he's not afraid to stand up and say,

796
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:53,540
I'm going to make the
transition regardless of what
you think. You can judge me.

797
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:56,570
It doesn't matter. So from people
from Compton or wherever you from,

798
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,910
just don't be afraid to be judged.
It's okay.

799
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,900
And there's all kind of,
it's all kind of,

800
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:06,890
here's what I tried to stress that it's,
you know, whatever industry you love,

801
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:10,760
there's a thousand jobs around
that industry. You know,

802
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:14,030
you don't have to be in front
of the camera. Matter of fact,

803
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:17,500
that Karen man had told me when I was
shooting Boyz in the hood, he said,

804
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:21,440
I've been sitting behind this
camera 35 years. I shot everybody.

805
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:24,770
I see him come and go in front of me.
I'm still here.

806
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:30,040
So sometimes the jobs that are the
real jobs is behind the scenes.

807
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:35,060
So we got to just encourage, you
know, everybody's not gonna go on,

808
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:39,200
uh, you know, be the player
or be on stage. But man,

809
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:44,180
everybody needs a light man and
engineer a, a coach, uh, agent,

810
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:49,190
uh, you know, so there's a
million different jobs, um,

811
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:53,630
that's surrounded around the dreams
that they should start. You know,

812
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:58,340
a lot of guys start at the bottom and
then ended up at the top. Uh, you know,

813
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:02,330
it's one coach, uh, used to
coach. The heat's still do.

814
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,440
He started off doing the video
play back now he, the head coach,

815
00:53:06,441 --> 00:53:10,580
so olster yeah.
So it's a thing where you got a,

816
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:15,910
use your talents wherever they may lie
to get you in the door and they not,

817
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:20,570
you know, everybody's not going to
be, you know, in front of the camera.

818
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,780
It's all about finding
where you can fit in,

819
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:29,010
in the industry that you love and, and,
uh, how you going to be happy at that.

820
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,300
So, you know, it's,

821
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:34,590
it's really encouraging people
to look at all aspects of a,

822
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:39,230
of an industry that they want to get in.
All right.

823
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:41,040
Thank you gentlemen so much for your time.

824
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:46,440
[inaudible]

825
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:56,180
yeah.
