1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,150
Well,
thanks again for everyone coming today.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,440
I just want to thank our guests in our
panel here is the first we have Andy

3
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:16,280
hidden our VP and chief ethics and
compliance officer at Google who will be

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,140
hosting the panel next to him.

5
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:20,780
We have Jeffrey Brown who an
Academy Award winning director,

6
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:22,100
film producer and screenwriter.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,820
So Jeffrey's dedicated his life to working
with organizations and an effort to

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,830
help stop trafficking and helping victims.

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,960
And one of those organizations
who works closely,

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,080
closely with is courageous girls and on
a project that is called the India and

11
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:38,120
Nepal project, which we'll be
talking more about today. Uh,

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,000
next to him we have near
Jet Nick who, um, uh,

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,650
graduated from Cambridge University
before training at the drama center in

14
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:47,030
London and sold,

15
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:51,740
she played Anita a survivor of trafficking
and as a result of her work unsold,

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,640
she's become an ambassador for children's
international international and

17
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:58,760
they're taught not traffic campaign.
And to our far right,

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,540
we have Sylvia Vasquez Lovato.
She is the founder of courageous girls.

19
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:05,900
The organization Jeffrey is
working closely with on the
India and Nepal project.

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,190
They worked to help survivors of sexual
violence and find their inner voice in

21
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:13,940
the strength. And in addition, she's
a technologist working for paypal,

22
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,370
helping to re humanize money
for those who need it most.

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,800
And she's an avid mountain year,
uh,

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,740
who was the first female
Peruvian to summit Mount Everest.

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,420
So thank you all for being here today. We
appreciate it. Uh, well can it to Andy.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,220
Thank you. Thank you. Thank
you all for your part in the,

27
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,620
in the movie and in their response to the,
the,

28
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,280
the horrible situation that
it portrays. Um, Jeffrey,

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,600
I guess it's a broad question,

30
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,860
but how did you end up making a
movie like this? I mean, it is,

31
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,150
it's not obvious to me how you,
how, how these things can, how you,

32
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,970
and this came back. Can you talk a
little bit about that? Yeah, so my,

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,680
my dad is a pediatric epidemiologist who,
uh,

34
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,260
worked all over the world for
care, save the children, UNESCO.

35
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,470
So I grew up in many
different countries and uh,

36
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,250
saw children who were at risk.

37
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,410
And so I'd always wanted
to make a film and I,

38
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:13,411
I became a specialist that's a director
in getting young performers to do

39
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:17,500
incredible things. And so, uh,
you know, when I read this book,

40
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:22,150
I felt like this would be a really
powerful entry point for people to learn

41
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:26,680
about a terrible thing that's happening
to the world's children and that I could

42
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:30,040
bring people in with a
film to help address this.

43
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,040
And can you talk a little bit
about bringing people in? How many,

44
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,920
how'd you pull people together
to make this a reality?

45
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,520
So we, uh, we had many, uh,

46
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,900
investors who became part of this and uh,

47
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,800
a large group of them live in
Seattle and they actually formed a,

48
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:52,240
they came with us to India.
They went to meet the survivors.

49
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:53,540
I knew right away that the,

50
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:57,400
the way to make a true film is to
immerse everyone in the reality,

51
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,930
our, our crew, even on investors,

52
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,810
we introduced them to
children who are survivors.

53
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:09,811
And really nothing has ever changed my
life as dramatically as meeting 2000 of

54
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:14,320
these kids who had been brutalized
in brothels, in Kolkata.

55
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:19,270
And in India, in Mumbai, and,
and, uh, Kathmandu and they,

56
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:23,000
Paul and meeting these children.
I,

57
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,020
I, I walked in, for instance, in
sunlight into a rescue facility.

58
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,100
And I,
you walk by a very old guard,

59
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,160
tiny old guard with a
very old gun, a rifle, uh,

60
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,840
which is older than the guard.
And,

61
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,850
and then you look to your right and
you see this cage attached to a room.

62
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,760
And in that cage where two girls,

63
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,560
one was about 13 years old,
the same age as Lakshmi in the film.

64
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,210
And she was terrified.

65
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,010
The look on her face was like a wild
animal with her back against the wall,

66
00:03:57,011 --> 00:04:01,630
looking for a way out. The girl sitting
next to her with slightly older,

67
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:03,730
she was maybe 15 or 16.

68
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,620
She had been at sunlight for a while and
she was tenderly talking to this girl.

69
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:13,390
She was saying, my name is so and so.
These are clothes that you can have.

70
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,460
And uh, I am, you can just call me Dee
Dee, Dee Dee and Hindi means sister.

71
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,320
And what she was really saying is, I'm
your family now and you can count on me.

72
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:26,080
I'm there for you and I'm
going to help you through this.

73
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,650
The girl who had was the young girl had
been rescued half an hour before she had

74
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,570
just come out of a brothel.

75
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,500
And I will never forget the
look on this child's face.

76
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,450
And I realized in that moment,
these were my kids.

77
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,580
I have to do something to help them.
And uh, across India, their price,

78
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:53,581
350,000 children who've been
rescued from sexual slavery.

79
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,990
And so the two things that I realized
after going to many of these nonprofits

80
00:04:58,991 --> 00:04:59,860
that they need,

81
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,480
because the problem is these kids
are not going to be able to go home.

82
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:08,320
Their families won't accept them. They're
villages one except except them back.

83
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,180
The shame and stigma, um,
makes these kids orphans.

84
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,500
They are alone in the world.
And when they age out of the NGO at 18,

85
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,390
they have to have vocational skills and
they have to have some inner healing so

86
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:24,520
that they can have real
relationships again.

87
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,810
And it's almost like they die in
this process. They become numb,

88
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,940
they get PTSD, they don't trust
anyone. They shut down. And,

89
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,750
and I arrest is an amazing way
to bring them back. It's a,

90
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:41,800
it's trauma informed Yoga, new
drug. It actually comes from India.

91
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:47,250
It's an Indian yogic practice that
is being widely used in the Va.

92
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,690
There are now a hundred veterans who
are trained in Irs Yoga Nedra who are

93
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,200
deployed and training hundreds of
thousands of returning vets and they're

94
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:59,120
getting off their meds,
they're sleeping.

95
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,420
And we're beginning this process now
in Nepal and India with amazing women.

96
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,850
There are 10 women in Nepal
who are trained in art,

97
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,240
art therapy and these are survivors and
we're training 25 in Kolkata and Mumbai.

98
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,320
And these are trained,
uh,

99
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,690
survivors who are trained as
dance movement therapy teachers.

100
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,410
And so with IRS as well
as those other modalities,

101
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,820
they're going to reach
hundreds of thousands of these
children and young women

102
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,990
to help them come back from the dead,
recover their lives,

103
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:36,950
be able to sleep at night, get out
of that low self esteem, depression.

104
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,130
And we're also doing
vocational training work. Uh,

105
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,850
we're bringing vocational
training to the NGOs and we're,

106
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,520
and we're bringing, um, work to helping
businesses that employ survivors expand.

107
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:50,354
So those are the,

108
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,230
those are the two programs that I'm really
passionate about because I feel like

109
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,420
without the inner freedom from fear that
these kids can get from IRS and without

110
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:02,480
vocational training,
then they're not going to remain free.

111
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,720
They're going to remain in this
trap that they've fallen into.

112
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,540
Thank you. Thank you. Sophia. Can you talk
a little bit more about your role and,

113
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,260
and healing some of the victims?
Yes. And thank you very much.

114
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,370
Thank you.
Um,

115
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,210
so I'm a survivor of sexual violence and
I have found my healing through nature

116
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:23,810
climbing and um, you know,
sometimes things are,

117
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,840
it's perfect timing and I
started my organization to
try to help young survivors

118
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,193
on that end.

119
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,280
And then I had the opportunity of
meeting Jeffrey and I saw sold and I was

120
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:38,660
completely moved. So I decided to
connect traffick survivors say Nepal.

121
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,720
And I was there actually
the first time we screened,

122
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:46,721
sold in Nepal until like late 2014
and there was a group of about 10,

123
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:51,590
15 survivors sitting behind me and
the imagery through the whole movie,

124
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:55,340
they were crying. And when they
finish just in managing them,

125
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:59,510
they all started embracing
themselves. Um, and you know,

126
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,020
several of them reach out to Jeff and
told that, thank you for sharing my story.

127
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,000
It was really, really powerful. And so I
had the opportunity of working with them,

128
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,840
bringing them to base camp of Mount
Everest and actually through iris,

129
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,170
give them that opportunity for
them to reconnect that strength.

130
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,360
And I was very fortunate of seeing how
this worked for some of these young women.

131
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:25,180
Whenever dusk will be coming into light,
you would see them starting to shiver,

132
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,610
feeling uncomfortable. They
couldn't close her eyes. I mean,

133
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:31,730
just even the imagery of them, you
know, having a good night's sleep.

134
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,800
And that's what I really
started introducing to them
and he was so powerful to

135
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:39,380
see the impact that he could have.
Um,

136
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,240
I don't think we have the chance
to show a couple of photos,

137
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:42,440
but we were able to see,

138
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:45,440
I mean after we started working
with a small group of young women,

139
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,090
some of them were able to take them into
some of the shelters and that was just

140
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:53,810
really powerful. We had, but it um,

141
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,220
a German I risk practitioner who
was living in Kathmandu at the time.

142
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:03,900
So she was able to kind of start doing
a very basic entry level and yes,

143
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:08,901
to see the effect of what the entry
level of virus date on that just gave us

144
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:13,920
that hope. Just imagining being able
to bring these at a much larger scale,

145
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,060
which is exactly what we're going to
do. I mean, what we're doing right now,

146
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:23,250
I'm trying to get these three sessions
where we're bringing actually the train

147
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,570
the trainer of old trainers of virus.

148
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,750
We're bringing in a woman
who is extremely specialized.

149
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,060
It's going to be spending a lot of time
in Nepal and in India and just being

150
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,940
able to empower this.
And this is some,

151
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,040
it's an amazing modality that he's
got to make such a huge difference.

152
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,700
Thank you. So your jet, uh, first off,

153
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,140
an amazing data.
Thank you.

154
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,320
So I,

155
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,850
I can't imagine how you can make them
movie like this and not be affected by it.

156
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,780
Tell us what was the effect of
doing a film like this for you?

157
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,830
Yeah, well, um, I met Jeffrey, I'm
totally by chance in New York and um,

158
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,980
I didn't know that trafficking existed
in the way that it does and I didn't know

159
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:12,460
that modern slavery existed in the
numbers that it did. So first of all,

160
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,470
just meeting Jeffrey really opened my
eyes to that. And then, um, you know,

161
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:21,030
as an actor you really need
to embody characters, um,

162
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,900
who a lot of their time,

163
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:27,370
their experience in life is completely
different to what you've experienced. Um,

164
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,310
and so you have to empathize.

165
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,710
So when we started shooting,
before we started shooting the movie,

166
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,000
we actually met with survivors and um,

167
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,600
I met with two women who are in their
thirties and they had been trafficked when

168
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:48,040
they were 13 and 14 and they were one
of the lucky ones who actually got out

169
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,840
because it's such a, it's
actually a, you know,

170
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,110
it's a very rare story for
these girls to get out.

171
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,290
But I couldn't believe the
difference between them. Um,

172
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,870
one of them when I met her,

173
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,960
she was in her thirties but you
could still see the suffering.

174
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:06,580
It was just written all over her face.
And she had,

175
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:12,270
she had had children but she had gone
into sex work in order to support them

176
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:14,350
because she didn't have
any other opportunities.

177
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,220
Now the other woman was just
completely different. She,

178
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,980
I've never seen anyone shine so bright,

179
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,360
like I didn't know like 10 times what you
would think of movie star shines. Like,

180
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:28,660
like her eyes were sparkly. She
was smiling, she was joyous.

181
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:33,661
She was so happy to be talking to us
as actors because she knew what we were

182
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:35,140
going to be doing with this movie.

183
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:38,890
She knew that it was going to be powerful
and she did like a dance for us in a

184
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:42,430
song for us. And what they both
had in common was their strength.

185
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,950
Both of them were incredibly strong.

186
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,620
But I think what this
second woman had found,

187
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:51,550
she had married a taxi driver
who she was in love with and um,

188
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,090
she had had kids and I think through
life somehow she had found heating.

189
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,960
And that is where I
think I rest is really,

190
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:03,880
really powerful and that it can help
these girls actually find that heating so

191
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:07,660
that they can go and so that they can
flourish and to go from that level of

192
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:11,230
suffering to that much
light and brightness. I,

193
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,140
I just found her amazing.
Um,

194
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,590
but it was the strength that they
had that sort of really struck me.

195
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:19,300
And I thought that's what I
want to bring to an eater.

196
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:23,380
Like I want to bring that kind
of strength to her. So, um,

197
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,080
there was one day on set and
it's a really simple scene.

198
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,930
Like I put on makeup every day, like,
you know, like I put on clothes, like,

199
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:33,880
you know, it's just something that I do
every day. Um, and in this scene we, um,

200
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:39,030
I was forced to put up makeup on a 13
year old Lakshmi and it was the first day

201
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:42,610
that she'd been in the brothel
and I knew where she was going.

202
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,370
I knew what was going to happen to,
I knew where she was headed,

203
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:47,380
I knew why I was putting
this makeup on her.

204
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,040
And I have never ever felt so much
rage on a film set in my life.

205
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,330
I was incensed. It was, it's
this tiny thing. I was just
putting lipstick on a go,

206
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:02,700
but I was so angry and in that moment
the penny dropped and I was like, oh,

207
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,570
that's her strength.
I was like,

208
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:07,540
that is what we need to strength as
she has that fire, she has the anger,

209
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,620
she has that defiance and she stands
defiant until the end. You know,

210
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:14,560
even her last line in the movie,
I've always wanted to travel.

211
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,760
She is defined and she's sort of like
cracking and very darkly humorous joke at

212
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:23,020
the end. And, um, and I
absolutely love that about her.

213
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:27,760
So I really learned that I think that's
exactly the way we should all be in this

214
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:30,610
fight.
We should stand defiant and we should,

215
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:35,020
we should be angry and we should be
incensed by what we've seen and what you

216
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:37,540
guys have seen today.
Um,

217
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,660
and we should use that anger and we
should use it to really do something about

218
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:44,770
this because this can't go on.
Um,

219
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,990
so yeah, I think, um,

220
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,280
meeting Jeffrey's sort of really
changed my life and gave me some sort of

221
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:54,940
purpose, um, um, in within this cause.

222
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:00,550
And um, yeah, I've never met anyone who
works so tired to sleep against those.

223
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,110
So I really hope that you will all join
us in it as well and that you will feel

224
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:05,441
that way.

225
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:09,880
I can see from your eyes that you have
been affected so much by seeing the movie.

226
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,050
Um, so yeah, thank you for coming on a
Monday afternoon in your lunch break.

227
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,090
We really appreciate it.

228
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,860
Thank you. And it's these, the
resilience that you spoke up,

229
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,800
that's really what we
saw across the board.

230
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:27,160
These children and women are,
are very,

231
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,430
very strong and given a chance.
Uh,

232
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:35,110
they are the fearless ones that
will go forward and make change.

233
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:40,060
They will get the laws enforced. They
will become the survivor advocate leaders.

234
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:45,040
Uh, that's what's happened in the
U S and, uh, in the nonprofits.

235
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,350
The staff are often survivors themselves
and they're the ones helping to rescue

236
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,500
others and helping to heal
others and empower them.

237
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:59,501
And so it's just about really helping
them get empowered and I rest,

238
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:00,771
we'll do that.

239
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:05,771
It will liberate them insight to
step up to their full strength,

240
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,920
their full power.
For those of us who aren't familiar,

241
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:13,100
I rest a little bit about
what that is. So it is, um,

242
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,650
it is a yogic breathing
modality where you,

243
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:22,580
you breathe and you focus on different
parts of your body and it works on the

244
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:24,140
two hemispheres of the brain.

245
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,280
And they've done studies with the
veterans that have been using it.

246
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,870
And literally what happens with Traumas,
it stores in many areas of the brain,

247
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,050
but the brain thankfully is very elastic.

248
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,450
When people have PTSD,
their brain actually shrinks.

249
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:45,330
It changes shape physically and after IRS.

250
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,910
It relaxes and goes back to the normal,
full shape.

251
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,210
It, it, the contraction releases.

252
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,440
And what happens with Traumas,
people get stuck in fight or flight mode.

253
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,320
They get stuck in being hypervigilant,

254
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,160
always having their adrenaline on
getting triggered by all kinds of strange

255
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:06,290
things because of the
trauma that they had,

256
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,050
like a door closing that
might just set them off. Uh,

257
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,520
and IRS is a way of welcoming fear
and facing it and in a really tender,

258
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:19,940
loving way and breathing into it.

259
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:24,941
And the first instinct of all of
us is to avoid fear and avoid,

260
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,670
uh,
the feelings.

261
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,640
But what happens with
IRS is you go into them,

262
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,930
you let them come up and you
let them dissolve like clouds.

263
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:40,670
They just pass through ultimately.
And it's a really powerful,

264
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,240
simple,
tender way of healing people.

265
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,990
Thank you.
Any questions from the audience?

266
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:53,260
What role do you see for corporations
in supporting this cause?

267
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:57,830
What can corporations do and what can
employees do to potentially support that

268
00:16:57,831 --> 00:17:02,630
too?
So there are two levels of slavery.

269
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:06,080
There are two types of slavery on
the planet. There's sex trafficking,

270
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,990
which happens to very young kids.

271
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:12,500
And you just saw a movie about that and
that's what we're, we're addressing.

272
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:15,770
And then there's labor trafficking.
Both need to be addressed.

273
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,000
Jeff and his team are working
on corporate responsibility,

274
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:24,590
making sure that slavery is not in any
of the supply chains that are bringing

275
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:28,670
products and equipment into Google.

276
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,480
Uh, all corporations need
to do that going forward.

277
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,550
They need to make sure that
their suppliers are free
of slavery in the supply

278
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:40,970
chain. So that's one very powerful
thing. The other powerful thing,

279
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:45,950
it's giving it a voice. Uh, if we can
get this, for instance, to Twitter,

280
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,380
Facebook,
other companies can,

281
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,940
that can amplify the message of modern
day slavery. That's a very powerful thing.

282
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,310
People mostly walking on the street do
not know that there are now 21 million or

283
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,580
45 million slaves on the planet earth.
Most people don't know that.

284
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,020
I didn't know that before.

285
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:08,520
I read this book and an option that the
next day and started getting involved in

286
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,310
this issue.
Now I'm very educated in this issue,

287
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:14,130
but previously I was largely ignorant.

288
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:17,190
I thought it happened to a number
of people in other countries.

289
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:20,640
I didn't know it was so prevalent in
my own country, in my own backyard.

290
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,040
And it's about sort of learning,

291
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:28,041
teaching yourself what it is and then
finding ways where your heart feels called

292
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:29,514
to address it.

293
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,990
My heart feels really called to helping
these children survivors because I feel

294
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:37,950
like they're going to be the change
makers. And we've seen that, uh,

295
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,080
10 survivors testified to Congress in the
u s and we have something called the t

296
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,830
visa, which, uh,

297
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:50,060
is a way for survivors not to be sent
back to their countries of origin.

298
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,850
They can remain in the u
s because of the TVS that,

299
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:56,940
because 10 survivors
testified to Congress.

300
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,320
So that's an example of survivor
voices making real change that,

301
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:04,850
did that answer your question
there? They're more, you know,

302
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,010
there are a lot of organizations,
a lot of our partners on our website,

303
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:13,011
so@themovie.com you can see they're
wonderful organizations doing great things

304
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,900
both domestically and in other countries.

305
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,250
So you just have to find out where your
heart fields called to to take action

306
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:23,220
and serve. Thanks. Um, I was curious,

307
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:25,830
what's the reaction in
India and Nepal to the film?

308
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,660
So you heard a little bit about Nepal.
Uh,

309
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,290
we showed it to about 500 people in Nepal.
Uh,

310
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,110
ministers of government survivors.
Uh,

311
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,730
the laws changed after
the showing of the film.

312
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,550
It's much more difficult now for someone
under age to cross from Nepal and to

313
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:48,330
India. Uh, you're required
now to be with a relative, uh,

314
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,930
an immediate relative of your family if
you're crossing and you're under age,

315
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,220
but they're still government officials
that are rubber stamping a certificate

316
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:58,200
saying that this is not a 14 year old.

317
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:01,440
This is an 18 year old who is free
of her own volition to go to India.

318
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:06,030
So there's still loopholes, uh,
but it's gotten better. India,

319
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:09,050
we haven't actually brought
the film to yet. Uh,

320
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,730
we hope to air it on television in India.

321
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,760
We're translating it
into Hindi and Bengali.

322
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:19,080
We just received a grant from
a philanthropist to do that.

323
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,840
And we have organizations
on the ground in Nepal,

324
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,130
India and the western Bangol who
will take it into rural villages,

325
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:31,131
the most prevalent areas where children
are traffic from and show this film

326
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:35,100
there. And part of what we're doing
with the vocational work that we're,

327
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:40,130
that we're beginning to do as well is to
reach out into the rural villages where

328
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:44,790
the children are traffic from and do some
of the vocational work there as well.

329
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,040
Because the issue is,
is poverty.

330
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,410
And another part of it
is the inequality of,

331
00:20:51,411 --> 00:20:55,770
of women to men. Um, those
two things are very much, uh,

332
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,180
what can make trafficking very prevalent.

333
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,180
And I just quickly want to add that,
you know,

334
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,360
one of the problems or one
of the challenges is that
for many of these girls,

335
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,300
the shame that happens
after they feed rescue,

336
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:09,190
sometimes they can get
back to the vintages.

337
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,810
So what iris is going to be able to
bring is cutting through that shame

338
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,030
internally through that trauma healing,

339
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:19,860
there'll be able to gather that as
strength in order to be the more stronger

340
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,710
advocates of what's happening. I
mean, the words coming from survivors,

341
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,620
it's incredibly more powerful and
the passionate that they will have.

342
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,120
So that's one of the abilities.

343
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:31,570
That's one of the advantages as well
that they feel has created in at least a

344
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:35,410
little bit in the fall. And we'll
have a, but in India, um, I did,

345
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,590
I went to a really small screening
of sold that we did as part of a film

346
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:42,970
festival in India. And, um,
uh, we're, we haven't yet,

347
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:47,380
um, translated into Hindi or
Nepali, although, and goalie,

348
00:21:47,381 --> 00:21:48,670
although we're planning on doing that.

349
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,420
And so I went there with the English
version of the film and, uh, we had, um,

350
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,300
maybe around 50 to 100 women come from
the local villages in this very rural

351
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:01,290
part of India. I remember freaking
out and I was like, oh gosh,

352
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,470
are they getting time to stand it?
Yeah,

353
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,550
I was worried about how they would relate
to it because of the language barrier.

354
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,300
And I was sitting and I could see the
audience when I started paying the movie

355
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,680
and they just went boom. And um, these,

356
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:17,980
these women from these rural villages
just kind of locked into the movie.

357
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:21,340
They understood the story and at
the end of them, at the end of it,

358
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:25,450
so many of them came to me just with tears
in their eyes and they understood the

359
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:26,171
message of it.

360
00:22:26,171 --> 00:22:31,171
And so in terms of raising awareness about
the issue in these rural areas where,

361
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,760
where girls do just get picked off,

362
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,690
I thought the film played really well
there and it was really powerful in the

363
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:41,470
message, reached them regardless
of the fact that it was an English.

364
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:43,330
So I think once we do get it translated,

365
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,610
it'll be that much more powerful as well.

366
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,670
And we've opened up quite a few Indian
film festivals all over the world. And uh,

367
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,130
the response from the Indian audience
has been really embracing. We,

368
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,650
we've won quite a few awards and Indian
film festivals. It's been wonderful.

369
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,430
Audience awards and things like that.
Uh,

370
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:06,230
we have to wrap it up because of a
livestream. So Jeffrey Nicha. Sylvia,

371
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,960
thank you so much. Thank you. Very
powerful brand. Amiable. Yeah.

372
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:09,930
Thank you very much.
