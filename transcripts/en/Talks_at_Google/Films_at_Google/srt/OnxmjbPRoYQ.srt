1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,963
Hmm.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,710
The black men of the community
could not play hall. He was away.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,600
Hockey teams in the area,
they were just segregated.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,110
We've got some season ticket holders that
are complaining about bringing you here

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,960
at to answer everything. All the name
calling the n word. I heard it all.

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,590
He got death threats.
You're playing the white man's game.

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,470
No, you can compete with the
best gear. The wrong college.

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,150
For 12 years we've been coming to hockey
and he's only the second one we've ever

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,960
seen.

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,430
Was there a discrimination issue or was
it simply a fact that he was too proud

11
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:51,030
to go to the minor leagues and you
can find good arguments on both sides.

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,373
There was racial slurs

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,953
every corner.

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,370
Only way to get back at him when

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,221
race,

16
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:11,270
like so many other things serve as a
distraction and the minute you allow it to

17
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,370
distract to,
you'll never reach your destination.

18
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,910
It doesn't matter what color you are.
If you want to do something,

19
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,420
you're going to do it and don't let
anybody tell you you can't do that.

20
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,080
Why wouldn't you play basketball or
while you play football? And I'm like,

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,120
why can't I play hockey?
What's wrong with it?

22
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,620
Cause when the,

23
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,000
I didn't realize this at that time at
that I have to have real barriers and

24
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,750
open doors.
Big tried to get rid of us.

25
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,000
Our job is to keep building.

26
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,150
You got guys like Wayne Simmons
and Chris Stewards and Dk,

27
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,010
my soul on at Snyder,

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,060
you got a dream to be a hockey player
and he wasn't going to let anybody take

29
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:06,894
that away from him.

30
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,910
They made it so much easier for us to
come up and enter play and to know to not

31
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:16,570
think about color as as
a, as a factor. You know,

32
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,320
it's just based on our
steel amount on our college

33
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,810
is just given me so many opportunities
and the only reason why I even have that

34
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,170
opportunity is because of that.

35
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,723
Nice.

36
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,080
You owe it to yourself and you're
playing a sport to know your history,

37
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,740
especially if you're black.

38
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,570
Wow.
All right.

39
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,380
I can't begin to tell you how excited
I am to be moderating this panel today.

40
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:53,310
We've got a, an esteemed group
of panelists on the stage today.

41
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,670
And I'd like to briefly
introduce each of them to you.

42
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:58,740
And I'm sure each of them have
the opportunity to give them,

43
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,510
give you all a little bit more
color I into who they are.

44
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,870
But on the very far end we've got Kwame
mason who is the director and producer

45
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:07,930
of soul on ice.

46
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,453
Yeah,

47
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,320
we have living history right
next to him. Mr Willy. Oh sorry.

48
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,420
It was the first black player in the NHL.

49
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,810
We have Anson Carter who
is a former NHL player,

50
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,820
including many teams like the
capitals, Bruins, rangers, local.

51
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,310
Yes. Yup, Yup. And last but not least,

52
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:38,311
we have Jessica Berman who is the
VP of special projects and uh,

53
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,960
corporate social
responsibility for the NHL.

54
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,630
So amongst other things, certainly we're
going to talk about soul on ice today,

55
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:50,720
but we're also going to talk about
the evolution of, of the NHL,

56
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,240
particularly as it relates
to, uh, to black folks.

57
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:55,940
And I will tell you in full
transparency and honesty,

58
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,390
I am not the biggest hockey fan
that sits in front of you. Uh,

59
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,570
I'm a fan of sports overall.
Um,

60
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,950
and I will tell you without
hesitation that, uh, this documentary,

61
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:11,951
this film opened up an entire new world
for me in not only understanding the

62
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:17,000
sport, uh, but understanding the evolution
of the sport and understanding, um,

63
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,500
the culture within the sport, but
a even more so than things, uh,

64
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:26,210
the many things that the NHL is doing
in terms of diversity and continuing to

65
00:04:26,211 --> 00:04:30,410
grow the sport. Uh, overall. So let's go
ahead and start with you upon me and, uh,

66
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,410
talk about a little bit about
more about your background,

67
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:36,320
but what was the inspiration
for creating this film?

68
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,910
All right, well first of all, it's wanted
to thank Google for having us here.

69
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,960
It's a real honor and I'm really pleased
to be here with these great people who

70
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,370
I've gotten to know,
uh,

71
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,380
over the last couple of years to just
talk about a hockey and, uh, we're,

72
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:53,500
we're trying to do, to grow
the game. Uh, for myself,

73
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:58,501
I was a radio announcer for
14 years and I'm in 2005.

74
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,350
I ended up working in
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada,

75
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,900
and a over there over there. It's, it's,

76
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,260
it's like that's just a bed
of hockey. And, um, you know,

77
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:16,261
I was really fortunate to meet and hang
out with a lot of the Edmonton Oilers

78
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:20,620
and they would send me to a lot of
games and sitting in the audience,

79
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,100
they're just how beautiful that game
is for those who haven't been to a live

80
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:25,210
hockey game.
You got to,

81
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,720
you have to go and see one man
because it's just incredible.

82
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,530
And I'm looking at that and looking at
the speed, the athleticism and all that,

83
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:35,230
and getting to know a
lot of the guys off eyes.

84
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,100
The first thing that came to my mind
was something that I used to think about

85
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:40,390
when I was a child,
which was,

86
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:45,160
how come there's still not a lot of
black athletes played hockey. And, um,

87
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,420
you know, in that thinking, I've
thought to myself, you know,

88
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,810
there are, or I was seeing a
lot of young guys coming up.

89
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,320
I was watching answer
Carter. I mean, you know,

90
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,270
I remember sitting in my room watching,
um,

91
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,830
uh, an Olympic game. Uh, and answer
and scoring the winning goal.

92
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:07,970
I remember how long it took
to get that, that, uh, the,

93
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:09,230
the referee to call the goal.

94
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:14,000
And I was just sitting there by myself
and just so happy for him. And, um,

95
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,900
you know,

96
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,900
I would go on my computer and I would
Google a black hockey players and I would

97
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:23,480
get this list of guys and
I'd be reading these stories.

98
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,040
And then one day I found out about the
colored hockey league of Nova Scotia and

99
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,630
I was at my,
in my thirties at this time,

100
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:34,631
not really bothered me because here I
am a black Canadian and hockey is our

101
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,720
second language and nobody
taught me about this.

102
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:43,040
So I started to gather a
lot of information and I
put it aside and I said to

103
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:47,360
myself, you know, this would be a really
cool documentary one day to talk about,

104
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,280
you know,
black history and hockey.

105
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:54,790
And so we fast forward to
a 2011 and something really
tragic in my life happened

106
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,380
where my mom had cancer. And I, um,

107
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:03,110
I remember sitting on her
bed in the hospital and
talking about what I was going

108
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:06,530
to do in the future because as a mother,
she was very conservative. And I said,

109
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:06,711
you know,

110
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:11,360
I got this idea to do this documentary
about hockey players and she just told me

111
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:16,250
the best advice ever, and she said,
just go for it. So after she passed,

112
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,510
I,
um,

113
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,640
I just cut my head and I put my head
down and I started gathering information,

114
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,310
making some phone calls,
uh,

115
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,380
and trying to do the best I could to
kind of put something like this together.

116
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,250
And so,
you know,

117
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:33,251
fast forward to 2011 I saw my first
interview and from then on it just kinda

118
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,710
snowballed and it was a loan. Let's talk
about that a little bit more, right?

119
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,970
I mean, first time filmmaker, yes,

120
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:46,210
I watched the documentary and you're fine
to a bunch and you must have been in a

121
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:50,450
number of different cities to have
gotten all this done. Um, you know,

122
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,410
was there a funding behind this? Like
how, how did you make this happen?

123
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,690
Well funding was me selling
my condominium, which

124
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,280
in the case, yeah, I would advise that for
any filmmakers out there. But you know,

125
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:07,160
I was,
I'm so passionate about the sport,

126
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,450
I'm so passionate about black
history and it just was a great mesh.

127
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,090
And you know,
if no one was going to invest in me,

128
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:18,320
I figured out how to invest in myself
because I thought like nobody was telling

129
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:22,250
that story. So if I just said,
well, I don't have money right now,

130
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,690
might as well just wait. I Dunno how
long I was going to have to wait. So,

131
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,940
um, and I had already quit my
job, so I had to do something.

132
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:33,710
So, uh, I had,

133
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,890
I had some capital and I had two great
family back in Toronto and they just

134
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:42,530
said, do what you gotta do. So I sold my
condominium and then use that money to,

135
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,420
to just kind of help fund going
to different places and uh, yeah.

136
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,550
And again, you know, being
a first time filmmaker,

137
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,410
not necessarily having a name
that's a household name, right.

138
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,100
Getting the likes of Mr
O'ree and some others

139
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,180
to participate. Um, you know,
tell us an easy, it wasn't easy.

140
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,050
I think at the end of the day for me
it was, you know, trust, you know,

141
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:06,450
I remember talking to Anson on the phone,
you know,

142
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:10,680
in the early stages and telling him what
I was, what I wanted to do. And you know,

143
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,720
um, George La rock was a great guy that
I had known in Edmonton. So, you know,

144
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,380
he was the first person, one of the
first NHL guys that I was able to shoot.

145
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,320
And then I already shot Mr Herb Carnegie.

146
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,550
And from there I think guys started
to trust and I answer the past man,

147
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,620
I just pestered, I just called
and I called, I called and I,

148
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:32,850
I mean the first time I met Willie

149
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,780
I just passed it. That's a good
Italian man. I just Kinda, hey listen,

150
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:41,490
can I interview you?
Hey, can I interview you?

151
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:44,010
Where are you going to be all
interviewed? And you know, I just,

152
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,900
I literally rolled up on Mr Orion. I
said, I'm going to come to San Diego.

153
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:51,120
And I went interviewed and the day I
went to San Diego to interview him,

154
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:52,050
he wasn't even at home.

155
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,720
His wife was at home and she didn't
answer the door and she's calling to some

156
00:09:57,721 --> 00:10:01,340
young guy with the camera equipment
outside and he came home and uh,

157
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,280
we did the film, we did the interview. But
uh, it's just perseverance, which is the,

158
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:08,640
to me, the theme of the film, which
is perseverance through adversity.

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,120
The adversity for me was as a
first time filmmaker, you know,

160
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,920
nobody was going to
give me money for this.

161
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,350
Nobody who is going to just
let me into their homes.

162
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:20,120
I had to keep persevering and
I had to keep telling them
that, you know, you know,

163
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,740
this is something very
important and I think, you know,

164
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:24,870
answering those guys can
probably say that. You know,

165
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,240
they saw how serious I was
so they let me have there

166
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,520
to stay on the theme of
perseverance for a moment.

167
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:32,980
And we're going to go deep dive
with Mr v and just a moment,

168
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:35,590
but can you give a little
bit of color around,

169
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,560
there was many narratives
in the documentary,

170
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:43,480
but talk a little bit more about Jane
Lindo and kind of how that was kind of a

171
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:47,710
bit of an anchor in the, in the uh, he,
he went through some things clearly.

172
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,070
Yeah. Well, you know, I,

173
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:54,071
I wanted to show our young man that was
going through his last year of the Ohl,

174
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:56,850
you know, just, you know,

175
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,590
his draft year and there's a couple
of the guys that could have, you know,

176
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,130
really got Josh Hill sang was a
slave to go in the first round.

177
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,890
So that was a big name.
That would be a great story.

178
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,750
But I really wanted to show somebody
that I felt was kind of like an underdog

179
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,140
that was kind of under the radar and
just to see what would happen with them.

180
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,770
And you know, Jaden comes from a
really well established family.

181
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:23,880
And one of the things I wanted to do was
I wanted to show the black family unit,

182
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,901
you know,
mother,

183
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:29,250
father and supporting a young kid
because so many times when we see film

184
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:31,170
narratives,
you always have the broken home.

185
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:35,490
I wanted to show a complete home and I
wanted to show that hockey is something

186
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:39,810
that is a very family oriented sport
and you need your family there.

187
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:43,500
So I thought that their family was a
great unit, had a great story to tell.

188
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:46,890
And you know, Jason was a great kid
that when I first met up with him,

189
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:50,090
he was this shy kid and just
throughout the, you know,

190
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:53,560
the year that I kind of worked with them,
his confidence grew and,

191
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,430
and unfortunately

192
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,970
he had a knee injury but it didn't stop
him from getting drafted at the end.

193
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:01,420
And he was able to just, you
know, hear his name being called.

194
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,480
And I thought that was very important
to show these young kids that, you know,

195
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,410
you don't have to be the superstar guy,
but as long as you work hard,

196
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:12,100
somebody is going to recognize that.
That's right. That's right. Perseverance,

197
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,500
perseverance through
adversity. So let's, uh,

198
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:18,390
let's stay on that theme and we're going
to transition a bit over and speak to a,

199
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,280
uh, a living legend. Mr O'ree, uh,

200
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,280
who in 1958 became the
first black NHL player.

201
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,830
Um, Miss Story, clearly you
were featured in the film. Um,

202
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,850
tell us a little bit about your journey,

203
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,240
your largely and widely recognized
as being the Jackie Robinson of,

204
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,510
of ice hockey, if you will. Um,

205
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,090
tell us a bit about your journey and
then talk a little bit about that

206
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:43,930
comparison and what,

207
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,040
what that kind of means to you and whether
or not you are in agreement with that

208
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,090
or not.
Well,

209
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,670
well,
I met Jackie Robinson and two occasions.

210
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,960
I met him in 1949 and then
I met him again in 1962.

211
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,780
But, uh, again, um, I was the
youngest of 13 children and, um,

212
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,980
uh, I was, uh, born in Fredericton,
New Brunswick, and, uh,

213
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,100
there were only my older brother
and myself that played hockey. My,

214
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,870
my sister were into basketball and,
um, some other sports. But, uh,

215
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,150
uh, at the age of three,
I started skating, uh, uh,

216
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,850
in my backyard and I started playing
organized hockey at the age of five.

217
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:26,300
And like all Canadian, uh, boys
and girls, you know, there's,

218
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,420
there's ice all over the place
and I had a rink in my backyard.

219
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,550
I used to escape the school.
Um, then my life was when I was,

220
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:36,710
um,
when I was 14 years of age,

221
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:40,760
I decided I wanted to become
a professional hockey player
and thanks to my older

222
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:45,590
brother who was not only my brother and
my friend, but he, he was my mentor. And,

223
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,000
uh,
when he found out that a,

224
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:51,650
I wanted to play hockey and hopefully
play professional and then hopefully one

225
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:56,120
day playing in the national hockey league,
um, he gave me all the support that a,

226
00:13:56,121 --> 00:14:00,530
that a brother could give. So, um,
I left my hometown at a, at 17,

227
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:03,540
went up to Quebec to play
my first year junior, uh,

228
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,220
with the Quebec Front neck
coach Phil Watson. Um,

229
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,650
was the instructor who played with the
New York Rangers back in the forties. Uh,

230
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,490
that was my first year. My second
year I spent in Kitchener, Ontario,

231
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:20,320
Canada, um, coach, uh, uh,

232
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,400
Black Jack Stewart. Um, what's the second
coaching then? You know, back then,

233
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:28,610
none of the players weren't helmets,
no face shields, no face guards.

234
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:30,980
Goldie's didn't wear any mass
though. You're, you know,

235
00:14:30,981 --> 00:14:34,340
you're facing head was exposed to pucks
and sticks and everything else that was

236
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:38,030
flying around on the ace. And,
um, when unfortunate accident, uh,

237
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,990
I'm in front of the net,

238
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,250
slapshot a ricocheted the puck come up
and struck me in the right. I hit me flat,

239
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:47,410
broke my nose, a proud of my cheek, and
I remember dropping down to the ice.

240
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,410
And the next thing I know I'm being
placed in an ambulance and taken to the

241
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:55,170
hospital. Uh, I'm in my hospital bed.

242
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,530
Dr. Henderson was the surgeon,
uh,

243
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,060
come in and stood by my bedside
in my recovery. Roman said,

244
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:05,540
Mr [inaudible] says, I'm sorry
to inform you. He says the, uh,

245
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,380
the impact of the puck
complete d shattered the retina
and your right eye and he

246
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:12,740
says, you're going to be blind and you
will never play hockey again. Well,

247
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:16,600
I'm 19 years of age and the goals and
dreams that I had set for myself of

248
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,700
playing professional and hopefully
playing in the national hockey league were

249
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:23,170
gone.
So I laid in my hospital bed and um,

250
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,930
I get out of the hospital and then the
next three days, within the next 10 days,

251
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:31,040
I'm back on the ice. Um,
practicing and a, and playing.

252
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,850
The only difference I felt about myself,
uh,

253
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,540
I just couldn't see it on my right eye.

254
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,430
Now imagine being a left hand shot and
to playing left wing. So to compensate,

255
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:43,160
I had to turn my head all the way around
to the right to pick the puck up with

256
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:46,790
my left thigh. And I was overskating the
puck and missing the net. And I said,

257
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,860
Willie, what's wrong? So I just said,

258
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:52,100
forget about what you can't see and
concentrate on, but you can see.

259
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,000
So my game started to pick up,

260
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:58,580
but it started scoring some goals
and now the season's over and uh,

261
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:02,150
I either have to turn pro the next
and the next season or play amateur.

262
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,350
And I was keeping my
fingers crossed that I,

263
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,410
it would be contacted
by professional team.

264
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,400
So I returned home to my
hometown and punch him luck,

265
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:13,540
who was the coach and general
manager of the Quebec cases.

266
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,890
The professional team up in Quebec
contacted me and said, well, he says, uh,

267
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,970
I watched you play the last
couple of years. He says,

268
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:23,950
I'd like to invite you to training camp.
So I went to training camp and uh,

269
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,930
I made the team, but I didn't disclose
the fact that I couldn't see it.

270
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:30,020
I'm a writer. I never took
an eye exam. So I said,

271
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:32,030
if you're good enough to make the
team with one eye, he said, don't,

272
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:36,650
don't worry about it. So I made the team,
uh, we won the championship that year.

273
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:39,770
That, that's what gave me the extra
confidence that I needed to, um,

274
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,770
to go on and a and play pro hockey.

275
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,150
That is incredible. So, so let me,
not only were you the, he had the,

276
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,630
the kind of weight of being,
you know,

277
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,980
being pulled up with the Bruins. Right,
right after they had some injuries, right.

278
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,730
Being the first black player in the NHL,

279
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,120
you had site only in one
eye this entire time,

280
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:07,110
which was an additional load on
top of you. A at the same time.

281
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,560
Yes.
I went to the Bruins,

282
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:13,561
a training camp in two occasions in
1957 and 58 and they didn't take any eye

283
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:17,390
exams. They were more concerned about
your physical condition. And I always,

284
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,160
I always kept myself in good shape.

285
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:21,440
I worked out in the summertime
and worked in the gym.

286
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,270
So when I went to training camp,

287
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:28,100
I was probably one or two pounds a
away from my playing weight. So a,

288
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:30,170
when they called me up
on January the 18th,

289
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:34,490
1958 to play two games against
the Montreal Canadians. Um,

290
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,620
when I stepped on the ice that
Saturday night in Montreal, uh,

291
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,280
against the Montreal Canadians,
uh,

292
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,640
and became the first black player to play
in the, in the national hockey league.

293
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:47,030
It was, it was just a
thrill for me. I had a,

294
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,180
I was no stranger to the Montreal fans
because I had played against a Montreal

295
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,020
junior Canadians in the forum and
played against the Montreal royals,

296
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:57,980
the professional team in the form.
Um,

297
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,050
when I skated on the ice that
evening, I was just, well,

298
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:05,040
you'll read what the Bruins Jersey on
and I could see fans pointing it in my

299
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:09,850
direction and uh, uh, wondering, oh,
we just a black player. You know what,

300
00:18:09,851 --> 00:18:11,760
put the Bruins with number 22.

301
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,410
I can tell you it's hard enough to
play with two good eyes. The national

302
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,620
one is impressive. Listen, I'm, I'm,

303
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,370
I'm trying to put it all together in
my head about how that worked out.

304
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:28,500
You almost have to like take a day and
just walk around like this and see how

305
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:29,131
hard that is.

306
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:34,131
And then the magic day and an hour
with flying projectiles at a 60 miles,

307
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:39,740
some odd miles an hour. Can we look
back on your professional career,

308
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,250
Mr [inaudible]? Like, can you,

309
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,360
can you recall one particular moment
that was a highlight and maybe one

310
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:48,240
particular moment that was a low
light for whatever reason? Well,

311
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,340
the highlight was when I first
scored my goal in the, uh,

312
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,930
in the national hockey
league, it was, uh, January,

313
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:58,790
the first new year's night in Boston
against the Montreal Canadians. Uh,

314
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,320
we're warming up, one of my teammates,
a Bronco Horvath's. I said, well,

315
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:07,550
if you ever get in on Hodge, uh, keep
the puck Mo. He's weak on low shots,

316
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:12,170
keep it away from his club. Uh, Jacques
Pont, who was the number one goal?

317
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,880
He was out, uh, and Charlie Hodge
was the backup goalie. So we're,

318
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:21,070
uh, we're skating around and um, he
says, remember now if you get in low,

319
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,750
low on him.
So it was the third period.

320
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:26,900
And I remember I had just broken
away from my check and I'm,

321
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,730
I'm busting down the left wing and a
little boy been one of my defenseman just

322
00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:35,900
hit me with a perfect pass. I didn't have
to break stride. So I'm going in on a,

323
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:40,490
on the defenseman and I go, uh,
get the defensemen out of position.

324
00:19:40,491 --> 00:19:43,880
Now I'm going in on Hodge and I got my
head up and all of a sudden I could hear

325
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:47,360
this loan,
Willie low wind and shoot the puck.

326
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:51,200
And it either was right along the ice or
just was off the ice and hit the inside

327
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:53,630
of the post and went in.
That made it three to one for the Bruins.

328
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,850
And then about seven minutes later,

329
00:19:55,851 --> 00:20:00,851
the honoree the pocket rocket
scored the second goal and uh,

330
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,020
made it three to two. But the goal that
I scored a was the winning goal. And, um,

331
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,500
the Bruins fans gave me a two minute
standing ovation. I'll never forget it.

332
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,740
It was quite an evening. That's
phenomenal. And traps one low,

333
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:16,680
late if there is one, a low
life. Uh, uh, yes, a little life.

334
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,410
It was my first trip in Chicago.
Um,

335
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,390
one of the, one of the original
teams in the original six.

336
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,790
Um, there was, um, I was warming
up and I won't mention his name,

337
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:36,030
but one of the players I'm
big right hander came around
and gave me a two hander

338
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,040
rate across the ankles as we're warming
up and he looks up and he's John and

339
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,670
they made a racial remark, but that
didn't bother me. So anyway, the,

340
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,150
the warm ups over,
we come out,

341
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,500
the first period's about minutes
into the first period. There's, um,

342
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,450
I'm in behind the net and I got
the puck and I'd dump it out to a,

343
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:56,890
my winger and I'm this player come
in and he caught me on my blind side.

344
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:57,551
I couldn't see him.

345
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:02,230
And he stuck about six inches out in
his stick and he hit me a split my nose,

346
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:04,250
not per two front teeth out. And, uh,

347
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,560
my teeth just dropped down in the ice and
now he's just standing there and these

348
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:12,910
kind of, he made a racial remark, but
that isn't what set me off. He, uh,

349
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,590
he just stood there and smiling. Now he
was about six, three and I was five, five,

350
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:19,630
eight, five, nine. So I took a,

351
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,520
I took my stick and I hit him
right over the head with it

352
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,830
and I cut in for a number of
stitches and then my, my stick broke.

353
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,420
Now I know we're going to fight.

354
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:32,680
So I dropped my gloves and he grabbed
the much bigger and he hit me a couple of

355
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:35,770
times and we'd go back up against the
screen. And the first thing I said,

356
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:39,460
just hold on when he just hold onto
him so he can hit. Meanwhile the bolts,

357
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:42,580
benches emptied all the Chicago
Black Hawks come out of their bench.

358
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,470
All the Bruins come out of their bench.
And there was,

359
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:49,550
there was 92 minutes and penalties
assessed on the players. Now, uh,

360
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,020
I go into the room and they stitched me
up and plug my nose and at least I want

361
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:57,100
to come back and sit on the bench with
the, with the team. But the coach,

362
00:21:57,101 --> 00:22:02,000
Milt Schmidt, said, Willie,
he says, these, these fans
became so violent that I, I'm,

363
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,120
I'm worried about you
getting Bartling harm.

364
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:07,650
So I had to stay in the dressing room.
Um,

365
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,910
and they had two police officers
outside the dresses and the whole,

366
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,940
the entire game. Now this was six
minutes into the first period. And, uh,

367
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,180
I stayed in there and
at the first thing I,

368
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,650
I did is I just turned the lights out
and I sat there and I kind of meditated

369
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:24,640
for a couple of minutes and then I
turned the lights back on and I said, no,

370
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,390
Wiliam says, uh, if you're going to leave
the league, uh, it stopped because some,

371
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,350
some jokers is trying to get you out of,
um,

372
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:35,530
you have the skills and the ability to
play in the league at that time. So, um,

373
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,650
basically that was opposed the worst one,
the next, the next trip. And it was a,

374
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,170
I'm not as bad,

375
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:46,270
but I finally gained the respect of not
only in the players on the opposition,

376
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:50,200
but fans in the stands. That's right.
But you did meet him later on in life.

377
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,190
I met him 30 years later. Um, well

378
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,950
many, but it's the, um, the NHL.
All Star game was in Chicago.

379
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,220
I got an invitation through
the hockey club and uh,

380
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,860
and then they call me on
the phone and I said, well,

381
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:08,290
why are you inviting me 30
years after I left the league?

382
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:11,170
Why didn't you invite me five
years or 10 years? They said, well,

383
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,450
we realize that you,

384
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,160
you broke the color barrier and we'd
like you to come to Chicago. So the, um,

385
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,470
my wife and I went to Chicago and I
had a reunited with the players that I

386
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:25,780
hadn't seen in 30 years. So we're
sitting in, sitting at a table,

387
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:30,100
she did for 10 and my wife wanted to a
glass of wine and there wasn't any on the

388
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:32,650
table. So I said, well, I'll
go to the bar and get one.

389
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,350
So I walk out to the
bar and the buyer was,

390
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,860
it was about 30 feet long and I walk up
and I asked the bartender a glass of red

391
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:43,660
wine, please. Now who comes beside me?

392
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:48,661
Is this a gentlemen I had
just about to say his name?

393
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:52,640
But this gentleman I had the
altercation with, and, uh, he, you know,

394
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:55,460
he's tall and he looks down and he
says, hello, are you, what's going on?

395
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:57,620
And I look not too bad. And I said, well,

396
00:23:57,621 --> 00:24:00,920
let's get it on because I was
ready to go after 30 years.

397
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,330
I had his number and I said,
let's get it on here. But he, uh,

398
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,860
he went this way and I, and
I went that way. We never,
we never met again, but that,

399
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,630
that was about the only one.
The only time,

400
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,110
well that's good to hear,

401
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,250
cause under the circumstances I can
imagine that over the course of time, uh,

402
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,370
you could have had a number of different
incidents like that. And so, you know,

403
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:25,500
this is a story certainly of perseverance,
patience and evolution.

404
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,910
Uh, and as a function of that, let's,

405
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,010
let's kind of move on and speak to the
answer and for a little bit. Uh, you know,

406
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,020
interestingly enough,

407
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,960
there wasn't another black hockey
player after Mr [inaudible] until 1974.

408
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,060
That's quite a bit of time.
Right.

409
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:43,790
And certainly you didn't start playing
in 1974 but was born in 74 [inaudible]

410
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,230
want to get your perspective right.
Um,

411
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,840
as a black hockey player who had a
successful career, uh, you know, what,

412
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,150
in listening to those types of stories,

413
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,770
how the league from your eyes may
have kind of evolved over time and,

414
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,460
and what your experience in the league
was like in, in juxtaposition to that.

415
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,500
And maybe some of the things
you've noticed as it's,

416
00:25:04,501 --> 00:25:07,050
as it's evolved over time
and it's definitely evolved.

417
00:25:07,051 --> 00:25:11,580
I mean I know from when Willie played
too, when I played, it's come a long way.

418
00:25:11,581 --> 00:25:15,000
Like society in general has come a long
way and I will say that Sports Mirror

419
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:16,350
society and vice versa.

420
00:25:16,351 --> 00:25:19,800
But when I was coming up and
playing the national hockey league,

421
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,600
there wasn't very many of us playing.
I mean it's,

422
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,080
fortunately Kwame is talk about Evanston.
Our team at Edmonton,

423
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,680
we had a lot of black players in our team.
It happened to him.

424
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:28,920
Good Shawn Brown walking gauge myself,
George will rack.

425
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:33,630
And that's kind of how I was used to
playing hockey in Toronto because,

426
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,140
and I'm from Toronto and
everyone plays hockey as a kid.

427
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,600
It doesn't matter what color you are,
what your background is.

428
00:25:39,601 --> 00:25:41,340
My parents were Beijing from Barbados,

429
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:44,700
so it was hard enough to convince them
to let me play hockey. My parents,

430
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:48,210
you know, ice, what you find ice in your
drinks. Like that's where you find nice.

431
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,940
So that's what I had to
overcome to allow them to allow,

432
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,900
let them let me play hockey.

433
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,020
But I was in another black player
playing on my team and of hockey,

434
00:25:58,021 --> 00:25:58,801
so it wasn't a big deal.

435
00:25:58,801 --> 00:26:02,160
And so I went to high school and then I
went to high school and hockey became a

436
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:06,900
quote unquote white sport, which blew
my mind cause I played basketball,

437
00:26:06,901 --> 00:26:09,030
I played baseball,
I played every other sport under the sun,

438
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:11,160
actually went to Michigan State
to play hockey and baseball.

439
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,740
And I played everything under the sun.

440
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:17,400
But I got to high school and the hockey
wasn't cool again with my black friends

441
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,320
and it didn't really register with me
because I guess my parents said I'm

442
00:26:22,321 --> 00:26:25,110
stubborn and I don't really care.
People say people think so.

443
00:26:25,111 --> 00:26:25,980
I just kept it moving.

444
00:26:25,981 --> 00:26:28,770
I didn't really listen to my friends
were saying and I went to Michigan State

445
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,420
and reporters said to me one time,
he was like,

446
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,410
ants and how does it feel being a black
hockey player? I sat and looked at him.

447
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:37,860
I was like, well, I don't know how
it feel to be a white hockey player,

448
00:26:37,861 --> 00:26:39,540
so I couldn't tell like that's who I am.

449
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,690
That's me and I've never thought
about it any differently.

450
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,380
But coming to the league,
the really wasn't for myself personally.

451
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:49,940
There wasn't any situations where I had
any differences with my fellow teammates

452
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,860
because I was black and there were white.
Like when my best friends,

453
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:57,660
Johnny Nina [inaudible] finished guy
could look toy more different than myself.

454
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,020
Okay. Finish. She's from the north. My
parents are Caribbean or from Toronto.

455
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:05,010
I'm black, he's white and he loves
heavy metal. I Love Dance Hall.

456
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:08,730
Reggae music and hip hop and we'd always
arguing with the drive to the rink all

457
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:11,910
the time and Evans him because he'd have
his Metallica blaring and I come in,

458
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:14,130
I try to change the station
and he come into my truck,

459
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:19,131
I've got Buju Banton played or Jay z
or or or or Tupac or someone playing.

460
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,560
But eventually as we
developed our friendship,

461
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,710
we became to appreciate
each other's differences.

462
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,400
So there's times now there's
like Metallica playing in
my car and I'll turn it

463
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:33,030
up. My kids like what in the
world? He listened to Dan,
I was like, that's a ghost.

464
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:33,631
He said,
listen to.

465
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:36,420
So I listened to it now
too and I appreciate it and
he sends me text messages

466
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,760
all the time saying, well hey, listen
to us, listen to a reggae song.

467
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:40,360
It was like we're in Finland,
they play Reagan.

468
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,800
But that was the cool
thing about playing hockey.

469
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:45,450
Like we all had our differences.

470
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,960
We might not have interacted with each
other on that level or we might not have,

471
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:50,280
if we never played the game of hockey.

472
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,340
You have to be able to come together
and play at the highest level.

473
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:54,160
I mean this is a beautiful thing.

474
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,780
Let's talk about that a little bit
more for a second. Right? So you know,

475
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,350
having played in the league,
right,

476
00:27:58,351 --> 00:28:01,920
but somebody who was clearly
talented in other sports, right.

477
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:05,820
And we see a lot of times these days
are athletes that could easily play a

478
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:06,481
number of different,

479
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:11,481
what would be your pitch for a young
brother coming up who was trying to figure

480
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:17,100
out whether he wanted to
go baseball, football, just
making it up, right? Or hockey.

481
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,690
I'm like,
well what would your pitch to say?

482
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,340
I think Kwame said it best and he
was like, you have to come to a game.

483
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:27,000
You need to go there and
experience it live to see the
size, the speed, the skill,

484
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:30,780
the athleticism, the hand eye
coordination that players need to play,

485
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,070
the reflexes to play the game at that
level. That's what will draw you in.

486
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,600
Like I love playing basketball.

487
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:39,690
Like there was no better feeling than
Dunkin on somebody when I play basketball.

488
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,500
Like I've loved it. But scoring a
goal had that same exact emotion.

489
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:45,690
That same feeling though brought energy,
you know,

490
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,690
hitting a baseball out of the park. I
love that feeling. But you score a goal,

491
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:52,020
same exact thing, jumping into
the glass. That's pure emotion.

492
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,700
I couldn't find that in any other sport.
So I would tell people,

493
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,190
and I tell kids in particular,
go to a game or watch a game.

494
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,120
Once you go to a hockey game, like you're
hooked. I mean, now you've got HDTV.

495
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,810
So it's way better than standard def.
So you could find out where the puck is.

496
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,180
And I tell if hockey fans
will atomic don't fall.

497
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:12,690
The puck fall the fall of the game.
When you follow the flow of the game,

498
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,410
the puck's gonna find you. Absolutely.
And that's a great answer. Um,

499
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,970
and a question for the,
for the three of you and then we'll,

500
00:29:18,971 --> 00:29:21,900
we'll transition to Jessica here.
But um,

501
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,830
having been most recently in the league,
it's,

502
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:29,670
and can you please explain to folks what
a line is and beyond that kind of your

503
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:33,120
prediction on when there may
be a first all black pop.

504
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,290
So we almost came close to them and
say, no, it was myself, Lake George.

505
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:41,620
We'd always petition our coach and Craig
McTavish is our coaching wanna say Mac

506
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:43,900
let us play together and we have
Brownie Shawn Brown defense,

507
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,460
let Brownie play forward.
This one shifts.

508
00:29:45,461 --> 00:29:48,550
We could down like the old
brother live speaking in brother.

509
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:52,540
When I was in Vancouver a few years ago
when I played my call my last couple of

510
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,600
years in the league and I had myself
from the sateen twins and that was our

511
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:59,500
nickname, the bro the line because
Dan and Hanks, the Dean and myself,

512
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,170
I think you're gonna see it eventually.

513
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,670
I mean there's just gonna be a time
when you're going to see enough players

514
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,790
playing on a team where they're going
to come together and form an all black

515
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:10,031
line.

516
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:13,090
Like I think it's one of the amount of
time when you see that coming once the

517
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,580
number of years, five years,
I would say five years or so.

518
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,970
I mean it has to start more
at the grassroots level
that we're seeing that right

519
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:22,720
now you're seeing kids coming up now
playing grass talky and once those numbers

520
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:26,080
start to increase your base increases
because when you're playing in the NHL

521
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:29,350
levels, it's a pyramid. So you
have the best of the best playing.

522
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,280
But if your base is a lot wider than that
pyramid up top gets a little wider as

523
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:33,700
well.

524
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,110
Right. Well that's a great segue
actually to talking with Jessica and,

525
00:30:37,111 --> 00:30:40,900
and finding out a little bit more about
what the NHL is doing as it relates to

526
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:45,490
this. Um, NHL, full
transparency, one of the,

527
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,480
one of the later professional
leagues to integrate. Um,

528
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:54,570
but doing some of the research for this,
I was, I was pleasantly surprised, um,

529
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,560
at just the amount of kind of operational
work that has gone into diversity

530
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:04,000
within the league and continues. I
mean, I, I read a little bit about, uh,

531
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:07,360
they're being kind of a
mandatory diversity training
pre seasoned for folks that

532
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:10,550
come into the league. Uh, and certainly
the work that you're doing with, um,

533
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,910
hockey is for everyone. Um, and you know,

534
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,440
having been from growing up in Flatbush
Brooklyn, I'm sure that you've been,

535
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,380
you've grown up in,

536
00:31:18,381 --> 00:31:22,210
in are aware of very diverse places
and have been in diverse situations and

537
00:31:22,211 --> 00:31:25,870
clearly your job at the national hockey
league continues to perpetuate that.

538
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,450
Can you tell us a little bit about um,

539
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:32,290
the why you guys are doing the things
that you're doing and give us a sense of,

540
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,400
of, of how, by the way, yes.
Black history month is a, is a,

541
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,220
is a time of frame that we can shine the
light on the things that you're doing,

542
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:41,590
but uh,
how these things are happening year round.

543
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,890
Sure. Thank you. And on behalf of
the NHL, thank you for hosting this.

544
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:50,090
We talk a lot about reaching new audiences
and so this is a great opportunity

545
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:53,000
for us and really appreciate it.
Um, before I answer your question,

546
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:57,290
I just have to say I'm
hearing Anson Story, um,

547
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:00,980
really hits home for me.
It's the reason that I do what I do.

548
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:03,530
It's the reason that I always
wanted to work in sports.

549
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,990
The idea and the platform that sports
brings people together is what inspired me

550
00:32:08,991 --> 00:32:13,640
to want to work in sports.
From my 16 year old,

551
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,730
uh, birthday, my family
took me to a hockey game.

552
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,760
I had never been to a hockey game.
My brother was a football player. Um,

553
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,070
I was a cheerleader and had for basketball
and football games and grew up in a

554
00:32:25,071 --> 00:32:27,020
very diverse community.

555
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:32,330
I went to public school and there was a
moment at this game where the magic of

556
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:38,081
the game really took over
and the energy in the stands,

557
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:43,120
but also on the, and the
islander scored. And, uh,

558
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,310
we were sitting right
behind a two gentlemen.

559
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,640
It was a kind of the story you were just
saying. A black and a white person, um,

560
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,690
who seem to not know each other and the
islander scored and they embraced and

561
00:32:56,031 --> 00:33:00,720
they embraced enthusiastically. And I, um,

562
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:05,660
for those who know me know
I'm quite inquisitive, so,
and I'm not shy. So I, uh,

563
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,810
I tapped them on the shoulder
after the moment passed and I said,

564
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:13,850
do you guys know each other? And they
said, no. Are you season ticket holders?

565
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,380
Nope,
please help me understand this moment.

566
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:23,381
Like why I watched you embrace and cheer
and hug and high five and each other's

567
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:24,561
families.

568
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:29,030
And they said the moment of
that goal brought us together.

569
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:33,740
And at that moment I turned to my parents
or with me and said I need to work in

570
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:38,450
hockey. And that could have
probably happened in other
venues and other contexts.

571
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:43,450
But having grown up in a place that
was challenged with racial issues,

572
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,940
I was always very interested in how to
bridge gaps in our community in Brooklyn.

573
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,000
Um, and that moment was like,
well this is the path to do that.

574
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:54,860
This creates that unification,

575
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:59,810
that platform where all of the differences
strip away and the pure passion that

576
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:02,270
exists just brings them
together instantly.

577
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:07,660
And what I was always wondering is if
those two people saw each other outside of

578
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:09,630
that venue,
is there carry over that.

579
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:12,110
That was the thing that always sort of
fascinated me and still fascinates me

580
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:16,130
when I work on diversity initiatives and
the idea that sports is a place where

581
00:34:16,131 --> 00:34:17,450
we can model that behavior.

582
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:21,200
And your story with your teammate
really hits home for me. Um,

583
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,430
and is there a carry over beyond
that person? So do you look at,

584
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:29,660
and does he look at people who are
different from him in a different way,

585
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:33,650
through a different lens after having
that experience where your mind was opened

586
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,050
to his world in his mind
was open to your world.

587
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:40,460
So that's just a had to share that
because I'd never heard that story.

588
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,350
And um, that's really what draws me to
what I do. But to answer your question,

589
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,430
the Nhl has been,
um,

590
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,110
and probably a lot of people don't
know it has been working on diversity

591
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:53,840
initiatives for more than 20 years.
Um,

592
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,860
we hired Willie in 1998 as
our diversity ambassador.

593
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:03,440
He has been traveling from city to city,
market to market,

594
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,190
inspiring the next generation of people,

595
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,250
but also hockey players to give our sport,

596
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:14,540
to try whether you're a
fan or a player. And, um,

597
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,920
when we think about why we do that and
we challenge ourselves as to the why,

598
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,210
um, I think there's really three
reasons. The first is that,

599
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,420
and the commissioner always says
this, it's the right thing to do. Um,

600
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,280
we believe in equality and we believe
that everybody should have access to our

601
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:35,450
sport. And um, so we always do it
because it's the right thing to do.

602
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,480
And the values of sport really
perpetuate that and make that authentic.

603
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,510
And when you see it in the people who
have played our sport and you hear her

604
00:35:44,511 --> 00:35:47,880
aunt's in and you hear Willie, and
really if you know, hockey players,

605
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:51,960
whether they're playing at the highest
level or even in a grassroots program,

606
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:56,961
hockey players are unique in that they
have these values that are all about

607
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:04,881
teamwork and humility and resilience and
hard work and sacrifice and dedication.

608
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:10,161
And it really creates
an environment where we,

609
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:15,000
we say with our partners, if you
can play, you can play, you know,

610
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:19,590
if you can contribute as a member of
our team, we want you on our team.

611
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,410
And, uh, we were actually
talking earlier and,

612
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:25,200
and both Willie and ants
and have both said, um,

613
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:29,610
although they experienced racial slurs
from fans and definitely from posing

614
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:34,300
players among their teammates,
they didn't experience that. Um,

615
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,980
and that's because our sport is really
all about what you bring to the table.

616
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:39,540
So the culture of our sport.

617
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:45,230
The second thing is that
we know particularly today
more than ever before and

618
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:48,360
even for the last five or 10 years,

619
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,800
there's a demographic shift happening
in North America and we want to be

620
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:56,880
relevant. We want to bring
new audiences into our game.

621
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,430
And so from a hockey is
where everyone perspective,

622
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:01,680
this is in addition to
being black history month,

623
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:03,000
also hockey's for everyone month,

624
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:08,001
which is a month where we shine a
light on all of the diversity inclusion

625
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,330
activities, initiatives, partnerships,
community engagement, um,

626
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:17,360
that all of our teams and the League
do of course they do that year round

627
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,400
through grassroots programming and boys
and girls club support and all kinds of

628
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,460
other outreach into diverse communities.
But February is a time where we,

629
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,980
where we celebrate that. So, um, again,

630
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:32,850
the second reason is really just to
introduce our game to new audiences.

631
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:37,770
And then the third is kind of going
back to what everyone was just talking

632
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:38,041
about,

633
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:43,041
which is we need to increase the
diversity and the pipeline into our game.

634
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:48,350
And so we have 26 hockey's for everyone
programs across north North America,

635
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,750
um, that bring tens of
thousands of kids into our game.

636
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:55,070
We're working on strategies to help them,
um,

637
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,940
to transition into competitive hockey
because playing the game at a recreational

638
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:02,330
level is really important.
Um,

639
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,220
and we want people to be able
to do it on a casual basis,

640
00:38:05,221 --> 00:38:09,000
but if we want to change the demographic
of who's playing on the NHL on our

641
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:14,000
stage, and we all know the saying, you
have to see it to want to be it true.

642
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:18,780
Um, we need to find ways to help people
to transition to elite hockey who looked

643
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:22,080
different from our traditional
population of players. So, um,

644
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,530
I would say those are kind of the
three for the reasons of the why.

645
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,750
That's great reasons,
great reasons.

646
00:38:28,751 --> 00:38:32,830
And it really shines a light
on the uniqueness of the
sport and what you all are

647
00:38:32,831 --> 00:38:37,570
doing in, in these stories
really give context, uh,

648
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,310
around, around all of it and, and make
it, make it real. And for me personally,

649
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,760
um, you know, call me the
work that you've done, uh,

650
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,420
has really opened up my world to,

651
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:52,020
to the sport in a way that I
could have never imagined. Um,

652
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,910
and has gotten me interested. I
mean, I've been to one hockey game.

653
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:56,110
I will tell you the truth.

654
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:58,480
I've been the one professional hockey
game and this everything you said it was,

655
00:38:58,481 --> 00:38:59,314
I mean it's

656
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:05,430
very large individuals who have grace
and talent and there's a lot of beauty in

657
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,380
the sport when you really get the
opportunity to, um, to view it live.

658
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:16,450
Um, and now to really kind of understand
the framework and the tapestry that is

659
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:20,830
behind it all really makes it so more,
so much more meaning, so meaningful.

660
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:25,030
So I thank you for bringing that to
light and please like kind of in our last

661
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,100
minute or so before we open it
up to questions on the floor,

662
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,980
very interested in understanding
what might be next from you.

663
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,530
Oh, in this world. You know, I
really, uh, it's, it's weird. I don't,

664
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,570
I don't know what's next,

665
00:39:36,571 --> 00:39:41,571
but I know my passion lies
in hockey and seeing it grow.

666
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:48,030
Um, you know, I've been very
fortunate. Like you got to understand,

667
00:39:48,031 --> 00:39:52,320
like when I left my job in radio,
I didn't know what I was going to do.

668
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,810
I had no source of income.

669
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:59,130
I just felt like I need
to be with these people.

670
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:04,190
I need to be with this group of people
from the Ahl to help grow the game.

671
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,740
And I kind of use, I
figured I was like, okay,

672
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:11,280
well how do you put in a resume?
Why don't you make a film?

673
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,520
Why don't you show them that you want to
be a part of this and you want to help

674
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:15,990
it grow.
And you know,

675
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,520
I just been fortunate to work with
Jessica like last year they had me on the

676
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:25,370
road showing the film and, and, and,
and, uh, talking about it. And I want to,

677
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:30,480
what I want to do next is I want to help
grow the game by telling stories and

678
00:40:30,481 --> 00:40:34,860
doing whatever I can to get people in the
stands. Because I, you know, like I said,

679
00:40:34,861 --> 00:40:38,130
like we say, you know, get
them into the arena. You know,

680
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:42,900
I always sit back and think, what if
Shaquille Neil's parents that play hockey,

681
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,750
what of Coby Brian's parents said,
play hockey?

682
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,720
What of Lebron James'
parents to play hockey?

683
00:40:48,721 --> 00:40:50,790
And there's those kids
are out there right now.

684
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,920
And for the black community I feel
we sometimes put ourselves in a box.

685
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,910
We say, this is what we do and this
is what we don't do. When I grew up,

686
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:04,290
hockey was the white boy sport and I was
one of those kids who put myself in a

687
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:09,030
box. And because my friends were
black and they listen to hip hop,

688
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:12,750
I just did what they did. But I loved
this game of hockey, but I felt like,

689
00:41:12,751 --> 00:41:15,150
oh well, you know, I guess that's
what the white boys to play.

690
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,530
Then the white friends that I had said,
well blacks don't play,

691
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:20,370
it's too cold or your ankles
are too short or small.

692
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:25,170
All these idiotic uh, stereotypes.
And I just like, okay.

693
00:41:25,171 --> 00:41:29,520
And then you have to argue with them. I
like, but I did had no context, you know,

694
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:33,640
I didn't have that ammunition to say no.
There's a Willie ovary, this Carnegie,

695
00:41:33,641 --> 00:41:36,440
right there was a colored hockey league
of Nova Scotia that was around in the

696
00:41:36,441 --> 00:41:37,041
1800 [inaudible].

697
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:40,970
The first professional sports
organization for blacks was hockey.

698
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,370
It wasn't basketball, it
wasn't football, it was hockey.

699
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,990
Why are we not celebrating that?

700
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:50,170
And so putting that film together is
because of people like you that thought

701
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,840
didn't think twice of the game.
But if I showed it to you,

702
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:57,550
put some nice little hip hop in there
and he's got a lid, did not go unnoticed.

703
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,010
You know, I thought that it would
make someone go, oh wait a second.

704
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:08,350
Yeah, so you caught me, you caught
me, you know? Well listen folks,

705
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:11,020
we've got about eight or so minutes left.

706
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,640
I want to make sure that we open this up
to Googlers who are in the audience who

707
00:42:15,641 --> 00:42:19,750
would like to ask some
questions to the esteemed panel.

708
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:24,760
We've got Mike's on, on both sides.
Uh, so if folks have questions,

709
00:42:24,761 --> 00:42:26,590
please, let's, uh, let's get into it.

710
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,480
Okay.

711
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,730
Uh, we'll start on this side and then
we'll, we'll just go back and forth.

712
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:32,680
Okay.

713
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,970
Everyone, uh, my name is Chris.

714
00:42:33,971 --> 00:42:36,970
Thanks so much for coming out
and speaking to us all today.

715
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,920
It's been a really awesome to hear.
So one of my questions is around, um,

716
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:44,620
kind of like the grassroots and ants and
like you were talking about Kinda like

717
00:42:44,621 --> 00:42:47,310
the triangle and expanding that base.
Um,

718
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,970
it's great to hear about the grassroots
efforts, but I'm playing hockey myself.

719
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,380
A massive part of trying to go pro is
kind of facing that point when you were

720
00:42:56,381 --> 00:42:59,620
maybe 15, 16, 17 years old,
you're going to leave home,

721
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:03,280
you're going to go to a city play for a
team where you don't really know anyone,

722
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:04,720
you maybe don't have a support system.

723
00:43:04,721 --> 00:43:07,670
You've got to go play juniors to
try to get to that next level, um,

724
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,040
or private school for that matter.

725
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,280
So my thought is what is being done at
those areas to kind of offer that support

726
00:43:15,341 --> 00:43:17,090
system for maybe,
you know,

727
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:21,630
the one kid of color who is
now out of, out of his, uh,

728
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:26,310
you know, comfort zone for the first
time and maybe facing some adversity. Um,

729
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,340
when it comes to that,
are there,

730
00:43:27,341 --> 00:43:31,360
are there thoughts of support in the
junior ranks to try to progress people?

731
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:37,510
I take that back so I'm not sure,
but the junior ranks,

732
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,260
um, I just know with myself
what I do on a day to day basis,

733
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:45,490
a lot of times people reach out to me
when they hear there's a black hockey

734
00:43:45,491 --> 00:43:47,530
player playing somewhere and they say,
Hey Anson,

735
00:43:47,531 --> 00:43:52,510
do you mind talking to him or her and
give them a words of wisdom because kind

736
00:43:52,511 --> 00:43:54,220
of like let them know exactly
what you went through.

737
00:43:54,221 --> 00:43:57,400
Because a lot of times what I went through
is probably similar to what they are

738
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,530
going through or they're
going to probably, you know,

739
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:01,510
deal with at some point in their career.

740
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:05,500
So I'm not afraid to reach out to the
different players and it doesn't really

741
00:44:05,501 --> 00:44:07,800
matter like a Kwame for example,
past me,

742
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:11,410
Joshua Ahow sangs number when he played
for the New York islanders and he's been

743
00:44:11,411 --> 00:44:12,970
in the minors back and forth right now.

744
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:15,400
And Josh was a professional
at of junior kid,

745
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:18,310
but he went through some tough things
during training camp there with the

746
00:44:18,311 --> 00:44:22,090
islanders and he slept in a,
he was getting this bad rap.

747
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,580
I think part of it was because
he was a black player, you know,

748
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:25,690
you looked at a little bit differently.

749
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,500
So I picked up the phone and I made
a phone call. It's like, Hey Josh,

750
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:33,720
we never met before but you're messing up.
And I didn't use that exact language.

751
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,480
But because we're here and
we appreciate that,

752
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:42,140
mess it up and I'll tell you why I didn't
go through what I went through or will,

753
00:44:42,141 --> 00:44:45,630
he didn't go through what he went through
for you to come next and set us all

754
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:47,250
back.
You know what I mean?

755
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:50,670
So we're not to the point now where you
could screw up in everyone's gonna think

756
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:51,504
it's okay,

757
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:54,780
you're still black hockey player and
there were still the minority in the sport

758
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:55,890
and there isn't that many of us playing.

759
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:00,890
So you're going to make you do things
properly to set the next guy up the right

760
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:05,520
way. And I thought it went through
one year, one or the other.

761
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:08,100
I didn't hear from the
kid at all for four year.

762
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,210
And then I'm with Kwame and Willie at
a hockey in Harlem event last year and

763
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:17,160
this lady walks up to me and she
starts crying and you know, Brunette,

764
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:20,970
she's white just to let you know,
just put it in context for you.

765
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,990
And she's like crying and she's bawling.
I was like, what's up? And she's like,

766
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,020
I want to thank you. I said,
thank me for what she goes,

767
00:45:28,021 --> 00:45:31,860
because you change someone's
life will change someone's life.

768
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:34,140
And I'm there with the deputy commissioner
of Bill Daley and build it and it's

769
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:39,030
like this lady lake, which handles
lady. And I was like, I have,

770
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:42,650
we met before and she's like, we haven't
met before. I was like, so what's,

771
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:46,230
how do like put this together for me?
And she's like, I'm Joshua his mother.

772
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,970
And I was like, oh, okay. And she's
like, he didn't call you back.

773
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,081
I know that.

774
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:55,020
But what you said to him really made a
huge impact and you didn't have to reach

775
00:45:55,021 --> 00:45:58,020
out to him, but we appreciate
you reaching out and you know,

776
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:00,360
passing on what you had to
say to him and now he gets it.

777
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,470
So I think it's responsibility for people
like myself and people that are still

778
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:07,890
involved with the game that we see
Willy doing on a day to day basis with

779
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,220
hockey's for everybody travels around,
he reaches out and touches,

780
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:10,831
leads these kids.

781
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:15,540
But I think it's my responsibility as a
former pro now on national TV with NBC

782
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:19,140
or Msg to reach out to these people in
these kids as well and letting them know

783
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,320
what I see to make their
life a little bit easier.

784
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,790
And Jessica, do you have any,
oh, so just to piggyback on
what he said, um, you know,

785
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:30,870
one of the things like with
um, with Jayden, um, you know,

786
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:33,540
when he was in that draft year,

787
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:36,120
I would take him when I was doing
interviews and stuff like that,

788
00:46:36,121 --> 00:46:39,240
I would take him to meet these guys
because I always thought that that's what

789
00:46:39,241 --> 00:46:41,460
they need, that support
system. Mike Morrison,

790
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:45,900
who was the second black athlete to play
in the NHL got in there and he was 18

791
00:46:45,901 --> 00:46:48,010
years old and he was told it to be the,

792
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,820
that black superstar that was going to
come out there playing Washington DC

793
00:46:51,821 --> 00:46:54,060
because Washington DC at that
time was predominantly black,

794
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:58,050
but it didn't go the way we all wanted it.

795
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,670
And he just kept going down
and going down Gannaway angels.

796
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:04,560
And the one thing he used to tell me
was there was no support system for me.

797
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,920
So if he had other black athletes
that he could talk to, Lena,

798
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:10,710
you only had one other black player
that played within bill Riley,

799
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:13,710
but it was just the two of them.
But if he had that support system,

800
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:16,980
things would have changed for them.
So I think that's one of the things that,

801
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:21,720
you know, Anson and Kevin Weeks do.
And I, I hope that, you know, the,

802
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:24,480
the league will encourage
more of them to do is,

803
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:28,680
which is to reach out to these young
guys and just say, hello, how you doing?

804
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:32,050
How's your game going? You know, what
are you going through? What do you need?

805
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:34,960
Let's talk.
Because that's the way it's going to grow.

806
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:38,500
Because sometimes these young
black players in these small areas,

807
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:42,550
they feel alone. And one lastly, when
I, when the film debuted on the, uh,

808
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:46,620
the NHL Network, I got
messages, text messages, um,

809
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,860
tweets from parents saying that they
sat down with the kids to watch the film

810
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:54,130
and their kid wanted to get back out
there and play because they thought they

811
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:57,010
were alone. They thought they were
going through this on their own.

812
00:47:57,011 --> 00:48:00,400
But when they saw the film and they saw
what ants in and William all these guys

813
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:03,010
went through, they said, oh,
okay. They persevere. It,

814
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,120
I can persevere through
adversity and quickly, uh,

815
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,630
Jessica from an NHL
institutional perspective.

816
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,480
Yeah, no, I'll take a couple
more questions. I think. Yeah,
I have a little bit more.

817
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:11,800
I'll be,
I'll be brief.

818
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,840
I think there's extra challenges
for minority groups for sure.

819
00:48:16,841 --> 00:48:20,650
But the challenges that you're identifying
are challenges for everyone, right?

820
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:22,750
I mean,
it's hard for everybody to leave home.

821
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:26,130
Definitely more so when you're
from a minority population and you,

822
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,150
you feel that extra pressure.
Um,

823
00:48:28,151 --> 00:48:30,460
I'll just say from an NHL
institutional perspective,

824
00:48:30,461 --> 00:48:33,970
we've been meeting for the last three
years with all the governing bodies to

825
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:37,900
talk about ways to open up
pathways to the NHL. Um,

826
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:39,880
so hopefully there'll be more to come.

827
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:44,350
We actually announced in September our
declaration of principles as a product of

828
00:48:44,351 --> 00:48:45,220
those conversations,

829
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:49,510
which is a stake in the ground value
statement that 17 leading hockey

830
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:53,710
organizations signed on to.
It's kind of like our mission statement,

831
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,520
which is that hockey is
more than a game and hot,

832
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:00,730
the benefit that hockey gives you is to
build character or life skills and all

833
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:02,740
about breaking down barriers. So, um,

834
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,670
those discussions kind of range from
grassroots all the way up through juniors

835
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:10,720
all the way up to minors,
NHL, international. So, um,

836
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:14,320
hopefully there'll be more to come on
ways that we can increase all those

837
00:49:14,321 --> 00:49:15,550
pathways to the NHL.

838
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,960
Fantastic.
I want to get everybody in a,

839
00:49:17,961 --> 00:49:21,260
I think we started just a little bit
late so maybe they'll grant us a couple

840
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,100
more minutes to,
to get through.

841
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,710
But we'll go over here and then we'll
come back over here and then we'll,

842
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:25,663
we'll wrap up.

843
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,080
Hi. Thank you all so much
for coming again. Um,

844
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:30,900
in addition to growing our player base,
in terms of diversity,

845
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:34,740
I think we also as hockey fans want to
grow our fan base in terms of diversity.

846
00:49:34,741 --> 00:49:38,610
And so I'd be interested in hearing the
panel's opinion on what things we should

847
00:49:38,611 --> 00:49:42,570
be doing is hockey fans and as the hockey
community to make ourselves, you know,

848
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,270
I'm, I'm more open
environment, uh, for that.

849
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:50,110
I think if you know somebody in the
minority community that's never been to

850
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:52,540
encourage them to go to a
game, I would, you know,

851
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:54,940
I think that's one of the best
thing to do is to say, Hey,

852
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:57,880
come to a game with me and just give
it a try. They might be like, ah,

853
00:49:57,881 --> 00:50:01,360
it's too cold. Just be like,
listen, put on a jacket,

854
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:05,500
let's go and just get them into an
arena and just expose them to the game.

855
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:07,210
And it doesn't even have
to be a professional game.

856
00:50:07,211 --> 00:50:09,320
It could be a minor league
game cause you know,

857
00:50:09,321 --> 00:50:11,080
Games are games and
they're just fun to watch.

858
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:14,130
I'll say from a policy perspective,

859
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,090
we talk a lot at the league level about
creating an inclusive environment. So, um,

860
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,130
I think part of that is us making sure
we have proper fan code of conduct and

861
00:50:23,131 --> 00:50:26,220
that everybody's on board as to what
is and isn't appropriate behavior.

862
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:31,310
But I always say it's also the fans
job to create in it peer to peer

863
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:33,620
accountability.
So when I'm in the stands,

864
00:50:33,621 --> 00:50:36,710
even with my family and I
hear inappropriate language,

865
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,340
I'll say something to them like,
we don't want that in our arena.

866
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:44,450
And um, you can even see NHL
teams during hockey's for Vermont.

867
00:50:44,451 --> 00:50:49,451
Actually yesterday the Pittsburgh Penguins
responded to some negative on social

868
00:50:50,151 --> 00:50:54,380
and said, you know, we don't, we don't
want that in our game. And so, um,

869
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:58,280
the louder and more engaged
the positive message is,

870
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:02,990
the more those people who are negative
and creating and not inclusive

871
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:05,450
environment will quiet down and go away.

872
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:10,810
And that'll open up the pathways for
more nontraditional audience to enjoy our

873
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:11,924
game.

874
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:15,530
Thank you.
So

875
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:19,990
I think it's really outrageous that
willy is not in the hockey hall of fame.

876
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,240
What can we do to change that?

877
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:27,170
Be Late to the flight right
now cause we've already, we're,

878
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,260
we're kind of working behind the scenes.

879
00:51:29,261 --> 00:51:31,840
I know several different
guys that are on the, the,

880
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,760
the panel that decides who gets in,

881
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:37,990
oh I've put the bug in Luke robotize zero
bottle Kenzie David poile like I'm all

882
00:51:37,991 --> 00:51:39,790
over these guys nonstop because yeah,

883
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:44,770
you know Willie is a living legend and
I know not only what he's done for my

884
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:46,090
crew to allow me to put
the national hockey league,

885
00:51:46,091 --> 00:51:48,700
but also other points like you see these
other superstars from around the world.

886
00:51:48,701 --> 00:51:53,020
Alex Ovechkin will embrace Willy O'ree
and we talk about hockey's for everyone.

887
00:51:53,021 --> 00:51:56,150
It's not just minority players, it's
European floors, finished player,

888
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,670
Swedish players,
Russian players.

889
00:51:57,671 --> 00:52:01,300
There was a time when European players
weren't accepted in the national hockey

890
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:04,180
league. You heard terms like
chicken, Swede or Russians,

891
00:52:04,181 --> 00:52:05,170
you can't count in the more.

892
00:52:05,171 --> 00:52:07,300
Finns have no clue what they're
doing over there on the ice.

893
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:11,470
But part of what willy does and breaking
down barriers is letting people know

894
00:52:11,471 --> 00:52:12,730
that we could all play this game.

895
00:52:12,731 --> 00:52:17,731
So absolutely he can be a builder since
1998 one over 120,000 kids Willie's

896
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:22,380
been, you know, engage with and
had conversations with them,

897
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,420
encouraging them to play hockey and life
lessons that come around and playing

898
00:52:25,421 --> 00:52:29,560
hockey. If that's not a builder. Yeah.
I don't know what it is. Yeah. I'm sold.

899
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:33,913
We'll take a

900
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,530
take one more question and then we'll,
we'll wrap up.

901
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:41,160
Thank you all so much for
coming to speak here. Um,

902
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:46,190
so this Wednesday I went to a talk on
the future of skating in New York and

903
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,610
someone there asked a question, um, um,

904
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,710
about why in in New York City,

905
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:57,420
the home of three NHL franchises and
the NHL itself that the state of,

906
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:01,680
of skating and playing hockey in
general is so dismal. Hmm. Um, you know,

907
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:06,300
part of why it's so hard
to get into hockey is that
it's hideously expensive and

908
00:53:06,301 --> 00:53:10,460
it's hard to get ice time. And,
uh, people in New York who, um,

909
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,110
want to play hockey, um, if they get
serious about it, they leave. Um,

910
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,440
I was just wondering what you
all had to say about that.

911
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:22,500
Basketball is a New York is a
basketball state. Uh, I think,

912
00:53:22,501 --> 00:53:26,190
um, you know, I not sure
what different communities

913
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:26,761
are doing,

914
00:53:26,761 --> 00:53:31,590
but I think you have to look at it as
stages and I think you have to go into

915
00:53:31,591 --> 00:53:36,140
these communities, get them interested
in, you know, something else. Yeah.

916
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,910
It's basically a street
hockey and ball hockey.

917
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:42,060
And once you start to attract kids and,
and,

918
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,110
and the communities and to
see how much fun that is,

919
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:48,450
it will transition to wanting to skate.

920
00:53:48,451 --> 00:53:52,470
And then parents and families in these
communities are going to try to position

921
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:57,060
a petition to get these arenas going.
So I think that's one way of doing it,

922
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,310
you know, and hopefully
that, you know, it will grow.

923
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:04,060
You're seeing a lot of organizations
now to building arenas on the respective

924
00:54:04,061 --> 00:54:07,840
cities. That's important that I'll come
with lowering the cost of playing hockey.

925
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,060
Uh, being from Toronto, there's a rink
every block like Starbucks here basically.

926
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,620
It's not that expensive,
but I hear what you're saying about um,

927
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:19,360
unlimited ice time here in New York City.

928
00:54:19,361 --> 00:54:21,430
I think everything in New York in
general is just expensive period.

929
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:23,770
But having additional rinks in,

930
00:54:23,771 --> 00:54:26,140
a lot of these organizations
are doing that right now.

931
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,280
And you're asking about trying to get
nontraditional fans to get engaged.

932
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,740
Kwame is talking about maybe
have them come to games,

933
00:54:32,741 --> 00:54:34,060
but also just getting to try skating,

934
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,660
just try skating and seeing how difficult
it is to get up and down the ice.

935
00:54:37,661 --> 00:54:40,360
And I've got two daughters, nine
11, and they could skate now,

936
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:43,390
but the first time they figured out how
to skate and not actually fall on their

937
00:54:43,391 --> 00:54:45,790
butts, they're like, wow,
this is amazing. Yeah.

938
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,190
And then I brought him to a hockey game
that took of the whole different level

939
00:54:48,191 --> 00:54:49,810
because they're like, well,
okay, skating is tough,

940
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:52,900
but now these guys are
doing this on the ice. Well,

941
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:56,140
someone's going to take their head off
at the same time, like out of control.

942
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,630
So I think the combination of
all those things, I mean you're,

943
00:54:59,631 --> 00:55:02,460
you're seeing Adidas now, they're, they're
getting involved with Columbia's talk.

944
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,380
Most street hockey.
I think that's probably the lowest level.

945
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:08,260
And we start looking at trying to
get the stick in kids' hands. Yeah.

946
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:09,143
Stick sticking a ball.

947
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:13,390
And once you have that
feeling of playing the game,

948
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,470
then you want to take it the next level.

949
00:55:14,471 --> 00:55:16,720
Because I didn't start playing
hockey is as an ice skater,

950
00:55:16,721 --> 00:55:17,890
I started ball hockey player.

951
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,530
I played street hockey and try
like I was a street hockey wizard.

952
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:24,130
One of my friends were like, oh you
can't skate. And I had no come back.

953
00:55:24,131 --> 00:55:25,390
Then I was like,
you're right.

954
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:29,560
But then I figured out how to
skate and then I could, you know,

955
00:55:29,561 --> 00:55:33,340
start chirping back. Yeah. So I learned
from a young age how important skating it.

956
00:55:33,341 --> 00:55:37,870
So I think skating and just playing ball
hockey or probably one of the keys to

957
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,880
that entry level way into figuring out
if you want to play the game of hockey or

958
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:43,610
not.

959
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,410
I'll just share two things.

960
00:55:45,411 --> 00:55:49,880
First you'd be surprised at how many NHL
players didn't start playing ice hockey.

961
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:53,000
They played street hockey,
roller hockey. Um, it,

962
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,360
it's actually quite staggering
when you, when you look at it. Um,

963
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:01,370
I think in addition to providing
access to alternative forms of game,

964
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,720
there needs to be a culture shift in terms
of allowing those players who are not

965
00:56:05,721 --> 00:56:09,200
playing ice hockey and not playing a lead
hockey to define themselves as hockey

966
00:56:09,201 --> 00:56:12,770
players. So if you play street hockey
and someone says, do you play hockey?

967
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:16,220
I want those people to say, yeah, I
play hockey because hockey is hockey.

968
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,260
And so I think we're trying to do a lot
more in terms of inclusive messaging on

969
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:24,430
everyone who plays hockey is
part of the hockey family.

970
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,600
So that those people who are asked like,
do you play hockey? Are you a hockey fan?

971
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,500
And they play in their, in their garage
or in their driveway can say, yeah,

972
00:56:32,501 --> 00:56:35,470
I'm a hockey player. I think the
second thing is in terms of, um,

973
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:40,650
access to ice is that the nhls invested
a lot of resources in intro to the game,

974
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:44,980
learn to play programs for ages five
to nine with the idea that there was a

975
00:56:44,981 --> 00:56:48,310
little bit of a chicken and an egg
scenario where if you do, we need,

976
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:50,800
we were just talking about it up
there about building rinks. Well,

977
00:56:50,801 --> 00:56:52,790
who's gonna play in them?
Because our,

978
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:57,310
our programs oversubscribed supply and
demand from an economic perspective.

979
00:56:57,311 --> 00:56:59,920
And you're talking about
public private partnerships.

980
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,260
What are they going to invest in there?
They want to,

981
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:03,690
they want to benefit their communities.

982
00:57:03,691 --> 00:57:06,850
So we need to show the demand and in
order to show the demand we need to,

983
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:09,310
we need to expand the
funnel at the bottom.

984
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:14,580
And so we're really doubling down on that
five to nine age range so that we can

985
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:18,700
show that demand in the
community at a young age.

986
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:22,810
And that hopefully will spur
more investment in facilities,

987
00:57:22,811 --> 00:57:26,200
which will help break down barriers from
an infrastructure perspective. Awesome.

988
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,710
Uh, well, listen folks, I hope that, uh,

989
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:34,070
all of you are as enlightened as I am
after today's discussion and certainly

990
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:38,300
after having seen the documentary, if you
haven't seen it, make sure that you do.

991
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:41,780
It's been great to have
you all take the time that,

992
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,760
so that we could share
in your experiences,

993
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:47,420
which have been very meaningful and
heartfelt to me and certainly from an NHL

994
00:57:47,421 --> 00:57:47,901
standpoint,

995
00:57:47,901 --> 00:57:50,930
really giving us a window and transparency
into all the great things that you

996
00:57:50,931 --> 00:57:53,320
guys are doing that continue to
grow and diversify the sport.

997
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:54,350
Are you a hockey fan now?

998
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:58,620
I'm a hockey fan. I promise. I
will thank all of our panelists.

999
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,030
Thank you all very much.
Thank you.

1000
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:05,850
Thanks everyone for coming.
