1
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,370
Welcome to toss to Google,
I'm highly not. And then today

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,950
half the well known actor,
but now director,

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,250
writer and Songwriter Bradley Cooper
in our myths to discuss his directorial

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,970
debut film, a star is born,
which he also co wrote,

5
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:24,230
produced and stars in

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,430
along with the Fabulous Lady Gaga who
herself was here, wants to move forward.

7
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:33,200
Dave Chappelle, Sam Elliott
and other stars. So, but uh,
you've just seen his story.

8
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,900
So I think we're going to
invite Bradley on stage list.

9
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,320
Hey,

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,920
one of the nicest, hardest working
people in Hollywood. You're very real.

11
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:51,940
You keep it real.

12
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,510
You've had an arc as an actor that has
been impressive both on in theater and,

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,990
uh, numbers, uh, for
Academy award nominations,

14
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:06,880
I believe Baptist and so forth. But you've
entered this new realm of directing.

15
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,940
So you've kind of gone from
what we would call around here,

16
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,380
an individual contributor
role, the act, wow.

17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,920
Two leader where you have to have a
vision and you need to fire people.

18
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:20,710
And then you have budgets
and you've got technology.

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,100
So were you at little bit scared going
into all this or how did it all roll out?

20
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,910
You're, you're absolutely right. The
first of all, thank you for having me.

21
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,350
It's such a pleasure to
be, oh, it's hardship

22
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,283
to how you can really,

23
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,160
no, it's Kinda, it's, it's insane.
Insane. And I was able to get,

24
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,550
you were kind enough to invite me this
lead to the Google camp when we showed

25
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:43,540
the movie,
which was really cool.

26
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,820
Everyone was buzzing about it. That was
very great. Not a dry I heard. Yeah.

27
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,470
My daughter loved it.
She is not the movie, but

28
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,840
it's a big pool there. Um, uh, um,

29
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,010
you're so right about budgetary
issues and timing and all and all,

30
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:04,200
all of that stuff. But I
actually loved all of that. Um,

31
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,280
I love to actually having a,
you know,

32
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,500
dipping my toe in all
of those aspects of it.

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,200
And I think that's because you're right,
when you,

34
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,840
when you have a vision and
you want to see it through,

35
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,490
I would feel very odd if I didn't,
if I didn't have a part of the,

36
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,310
it's cause that's part of the road.
And how wide it is and how,

37
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,440
how you know where the velocity picks up.

38
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:27,340
You want to have a say in
everything because it winds
up the finished product is

39
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:29,080
right now,
now belongs to you.

40
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,270
So I very much was a part of all of
that and I couldn't imagine not doing it

41
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:35,104
that way.

42
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,920
Anything really surprise you
about that process and journey?

43
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:44,330
I've seen so many interviews of the type
cast coming together and saying we had

44
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,760
a magic experience working as a team
working as a collaborative creative group.

45
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:55,270
It wasn't so much scripted as enabled
by a clear vision of the story and your

46
00:02:56,571 --> 00:03:00,220
just freeing up lady Gaga,

47
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,080
Dave Chappelle to play their parts in
ways they said they'd never experienced

48
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:09,850
before and of course it's lady Gaga,
his first film debut.

49
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,790
So I think it has,
I think that's,

50
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,690
I've heard them say that that makes me
so happy because that's what the goal to

51
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:18,760
create an environment
where as you all know,

52
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,600
when you feel safe and you feel motivated
and you also know that you're called

53
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:24,340
upon to bring all of yourselves,

54
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,550
that that's the environment that you can
really thrive and you go home at night

55
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:30,520
and think, oh wow, that was
a really fruitful day. Um,

56
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:34,210
I think because I've been in
this business for 20 years, um,

57
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,150
and um,

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,520
I've been in brown all different types
of environments in the same setting.

59
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,500
Uh, I just, you know, I'm a
good listener and observer,

60
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:47,290
so I just watched and picked up
everything that works for me.

61
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,640
And I just wanted to create an environment
which was the culmination of all of

62
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,980
the good parts and take all
the bad parts out of it,

63
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:56,170
and then hope that in that respect,

64
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:59,320
I could get the best out of the people
that are entrusted themselves to me,

65
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:03,720
quite frankly, because that was, I mean,
I just couldn't believe that lady Gaga,

66
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
it took such a huge risk
because it's a big risk.

67
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,740
This isn't one of those projects
where you're like, well, you know,

68
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:12,730
if it doesn't work out, it'll, you'll
be okay. Like, not really. He's not,

69
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,520
it's not really this. It's like
actually if it doesn't work out, it's,

70
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:19,900
you're going to take a big hit. So,
so there was a lot at stake and I'm,

71
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:22,900
and even for Dave Chappelle, that took
me like two and a half years to get him.

72
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,130
And, um, because he just doesn't do this
kind of thing. And, but he was so willing,

73
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:28,480
and Sam Elliott,
you know,

74
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:32,290
I've never seen him play a character that
was so filled with resentment the way

75
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,630
that character was. And he just threw
all of themselves into that. And,

76
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,770
and then my hope is that it's because
they felt that there was that kind of

77
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,210
inspiring environment, which by
the way, I sort of set the tone,

78
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:46,900
but everybody else has to help create
that, you know, every single crew member,

79
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:50,230
everybody has to be on the same page and
everybody dictates, I mean, you know,

80
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,190
in your work environment,

81
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,130
if there's one person that has
an energy that's off the whole,

82
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:55,870
it contaminates the rest of the team.

83
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,080
So everybody really has
to be on the same page.

84
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,740
And you pursued this script for years.

85
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,860
I've seen various reports,
six years.

86
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,130
He said you proceed Dave
Chappelle for over two years.

87
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,410
So when did you get the burning idea to
do the fourth incarnation of a star is

88
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:18,700
born? It was, it was sort of like a
coming together of two different things.

89
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:21,640
I always knew I wanted to
direct, um, and I would,

90
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,520
I'd worked with great directors like
David O. Russell or Clint Eastwood,

91
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,740
who really allowed me to
be a part of their process.

92
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:30,790
I was in the editing room almost every
day for silver linings playbook and Jay

93
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,690
Cassidy, who was David said, or he, he
and I worked together on this movie. Um,

94
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:35,590
so I'd,
I'd,

95
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,210
I'd always knew that eventually I'm going
to have to stop just saying I'm going

96
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,680
to try to do and actually do it.

97
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,740
And because I knew that all these sort
of compositions cinematically would

98
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,880
always fly around in my head. And
I was at a Metallica concert, um,

99
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,510
and I was an, I had met Lars Olrick and,
uh, like the night before, and I said,

100
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:58,790
well man, I'm a huge Metallica fan
and a, and he said, well, come to the,

101
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,140
come to the concert tomorrow night.

102
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:04,700
So I found myself 12 hours later standing
behind his drum kit or Yankee stadium,

103
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,810
and I can see the sweat on his back and
I could also see the scope of the crowd.

104
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:12,170
And I thought, this is an incredible
composition that people don't get to see.

105
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,740
And that was the, that was
the, the, the birth of the eye,

106
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:19,280
the subjective idea of always being
on the stage four in the movie.

107
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:22,640
So in the movie were never in the crowd.
Um,

108
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,270
so it was just like little ideas
like that. I thinking about fame,

109
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,410
like what fame can be, um, you
know, Paparazzi and you know,

110
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,390
you can watch TMZ, but what is
it? What's the experience like in,

111
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,040
to me it's so it's sonic and it stayed
this cacophony of noise where it's like,

112
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,860
and then silence and that's the
opening of the movie is your, your,

113
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:46,010
your thrust onto this,
into this thunder dome with this guy.

114
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:50,810
And then all of a sudden you're into
this very small, almost like coffin,

115
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:55,280
like environment. And that, that's
an emotional juggernaut for people.

116
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,370
Uh, so that was something
I thought of early on.

117
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:01,340
And then there was just this property
and Warner brothers had and it,

118
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,970
and I thought, oh, I can explore
all of these things. Family Trauma.

119
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:08,300
What happens if two people actually
love each other? There's no infidelity.

120
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,630
It's actually true love. And
even with that, it's hard.

121
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,730
So these are things I wanted to explore.

122
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:17,870
And then this property was perfect because
it had music and you can't hide when

123
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:21,290
you sing. And I thought, well this is,
this would be the great way to do it.

124
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,010
So really was, it was really a
combination. I didn't think, I never,

125
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,340
I never ever thought like, you know,
it's a thing people should do the fourth,

126
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,420
the remake of a stars

127
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,480
definitely didn't do that.

128
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,330
And this is one like none other. So we're
all going to pay money to see it. Um,

129
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,310
you can't hide if you sing,
you just said that you didn't hide.

130
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,940
You studied boy,
you took voice lessons for 18 months.

131
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,380
You learn guitar and uh,

132
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,290
Lady Gaga required that
you take all of the,

133
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,910
do all of the singing live that
you weren't doubling it. Yeah.

134
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,600
So what was that all like?

135
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,510
Well, the music is a character
in the movie, you know,

136
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,240
it's not like with the movie takes a
break and then all of a sudden there's a

137
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:13,050
song, it actually has everything
to do with the, with what's
going on. It's almost,

138
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:13,920
it is a scene.

139
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:18,500
My favorite scene of Lady Gaga is actually
acting wise is the final song because

140
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,500
you, we watched this character go through
the grieving process through the song,

141
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,880
which I just, that's what a, what
a feat. Acting feet. She did.

142
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,410
So it would have been,

143
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,990
we had no choice but to sing live and
that's much easier for her. And I thought,

144
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:37,230
how the heck am I going to do
that? And you know, cause she,

145
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,850
and the other thing is
she's the real deal.

146
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,390
I know I had the nuclear
power of the movie. It's like,
well at least I have this.

147
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,710
I can,
if the movie sucks,

148
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:46,500
at least there'll be like 10 moments
where she's singing and it won't be

149
00:08:46,501 --> 00:08:50,760
horrendous. But I knew I had to lift
the rest of the movie up to her level.

150
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:53,790
So you believe it. Otherwise, if you
don't believe me as this character,

151
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,160
you don't believe we're really on
stage seeing in front of people.

152
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,960
If you don't believe
that Saturday night live,

153
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,320
then there's no way I'm going to be able
to allow you to enter into this world

154
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:04,650
and learn about her. So there was really
no question that that had to happen.

155
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,150
It was great that she felt so
strongly about it as well. Um,

156
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,780
but it added,
I mean it's part of the DNA of the film.

157
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,730
It's a beautiful story of Jackson main
of Fading Country Music Star with the

158
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:23,210
alcohol problem and Allie who you discover
and encouraged and you see her rise

159
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:24,990
through the film.
So

160
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,940
20 when you say country stars. So
when we started, uh, writing it,

161
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,690
I was trying to figure out where he was
from and I quite honestly thought like

162
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:36,710
maybe it's country cause I could kind of
like kind of fake saying and like maybe

163
00:09:36,711 --> 00:09:37,544
get away with it.

164
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,580
And then as I kept working and starting
to like fall in love and create this

165
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,460
character,
I swear if we had like six more months,

166
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:45,100
he would have been like
completely heavy metal,

167
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,230
like a cat guy.

168
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,980
Harder and harder and harder.

169
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,090
We've talked about this actually what
Genre Jack's music is because it's

170
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:55,680
definitely not country, right? Yeah.

171
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,510
Twain when you speak and
kind that ruddy red face,

172
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:01,830
that looks like you had too much.

173
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,640
But even with the twine scotch. That's a
good question. So in terms of his voice,

174
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,570
that was the hardest thing actually was
lowering my voice just about an octave.

175
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,190
And I wanted to pick an act, a voice that,
that you couldn't place geographically.

176
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:17,250
And Sam Elliott wound up being the,

177
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:21,970
before I even thought about writing the
role for him, the voice that I studied.

178
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:24,840
So I would get all of these tapes
of Sam Elliott and abuse was,

179
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,790
and then it got him and then, and then
I was doing it and it, cause he's,

180
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:31,000
he's born in Sacramento, which you never
know he's from, he's from California,

181
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,470
but his mother was from Texas,

182
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:35,020
so he's got this odd accent
that you can't really place.

183
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,110
And then I was reading Bruce Springsteen's
autobiography and he was talking

184
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:40,600
about stealing his father's voice.
That's what he did as a kid.

185
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:42,910
Nice to always want to be
my dad. And I thought, oh,

186
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:46,900
what if Sam Elliott is his older brother?
And he stole his voice.

187
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,670
And so that's how that
whole thing happened.

188
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,310
Wow.

189
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:54,310
You're so you both visualize and you
have auditory things going through your

190
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,270
creative process. Yeah. It
sounds like speaking about,

191
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,620
um,
auditory,

192
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:05,390
there's someone in the audience who
gradually lost her hearing as a child and

193
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:10,160
has, is impressed by how accurately you
portrayed the frustration and denial.

194
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:14,660
Many people experience when losing
their hearing. So her question is,

195
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:18,800
do you have any personal experience with
hearing loss and how did you study to

196
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,250
portray that aspect of the
role so authentically? Yeah.

197
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:26,560
Hmm. Oh, well, I'm glad that you
thought that it was the person here. Hi

198
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:32,210
Bradley. Nice one. Yeah. Um,

199
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,330
I'm glad you felt that way.
I was born and here's the other thing.

200
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:36,350
When you get to write the movie,

201
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:39,380
you can just cheat all the time because
you just do everything that's real to

202
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:43,460
you. Like his choice of drink
is crazy personal for me.

203
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,150
That's my dog, Charlie.
That's my real dog. Um,

204
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,410
a bunch of my friends are in the movie,
um,

205
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,220
who I went to Grad school
with and the hearing loss,

206
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,590
I wanted him to be like a prize fighter
because in the other versions of the

207
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:00,190
movies, he's so obsessed with fame and
this fames dwindling. And I didn't want,

208
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:05,110
I had no interest in, in investigating
that. And also people today,

209
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,730
everybody makes money touring.

210
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:10,270
And a lot of these bands that have
been maybe huge back 20 years ago,

211
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,140
it was still making a lot of money
touring. So the reality was he's fine.

212
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,760
Um,
so it was more about what's,

213
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,390
what's the wear and tear and
it takes a toll on your body.

214
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:22,840
And I interviewed and spend time with
tons of musicians and the thing that

215
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:26,950
happens is hearing loss. That's the number
one thing that goes, which makes sense.

216
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,263
Um,

217
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,650
but I was born with a clause to youtome
in my ear drum and it was removed.

218
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:36,040
And then I was kind of a car. I would
always jump off a high places as a kid.

219
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,780
Don't ask me why. And I kept puncturing
it. And so I had all these operations,

220
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:43,150
like five operations.
I have a hole in my right ear.

221
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,600
So when he's telling her that story in
the bar, that's me. That's all real.

222
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,980
That's like, so, yeah. Um, and so
I have, I don't have hearing loss,

223
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:54,610
but I that when I have ear infections,
I hear that tonight is sound,

224
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,530
so I know it very well. Um, and then
it was all about in the mixing stage,

225
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:02,740
creating, recreating that sound
sonically for the audience.

226
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,410
So I'm glad you felt that way.
Thank you.

227
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,551
Beautiful.

228
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:11,551
You talked about in one of the interviews
I saw you just want it to be in this

229
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,900
to create and make it real. So the
backstory, you bring a bunch of friends,

230
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:21,600
some graduate school friends from uh,
New York City city. Yeah. There's the,

231
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,750
I just studio the studio.

232
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,000
And you've been collecting people
like Sam Elliott and Gaga over it,

233
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,361
period.

234
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:31,660
I did a TV show alias and two of those
actors are in the movie run Rifkin and

235
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:32,450
Greg Rumberger.

236
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,920
Wow. Yeah. So that can
just be happenstance.

237
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:40,730
So you've been collecting
talent and ideas. Yes. Um,

238
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,630
what was the moment you
knew you could make it real?

239
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:48,680
Was it when Warner greenlit it or was
it just when you knew you had enough

240
00:13:48,681 --> 00:13:53,681
conviction about envision for this
film that you could pull it off?

241
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:58,130
I think it was working with directors who
were allowed me to be so collaborative

242
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:00,290
with them. I think if it
wasn't for David O. Russell,

243
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,900
there's no way I wouldn't have
had the confidence. But he really,

244
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:05,390
it was like going to film
school doing those three movies,

245
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:09,770
particularly the two movies,
a silver linings playbook
and American hospital. Um,

246
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,210
and I really got it and, but,
but even when I did alias,
I would, I hated La and I,

247
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:16,280
and I like knew no one so,

248
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:19,670
and I only worked three days a week
and I just moved there for the tea,

249
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:20,570
this television show.

250
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:25,190
So I would just spend all my time on
set and in the editing rooms and I would

251
00:14:25,191 --> 00:14:27,500
get everybody's dailies back.
I would take them home.

252
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:29,060
And that was when they were on VHS tapes.

253
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:32,260
So I was always fascinated
by the process. Got It. Um,

254
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,370
so I think it was just a constant, you
know, just sort of, um, uh, you know,

255
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,550
listening and observing.

256
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,450
It's once Ferrell Williams came
to visit us and he said, you know,

257
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,930
you people are creatives,
you just do it with your mice,

258
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,890
which is actually a
cinnamon for coding I guess.

259
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:54,060
But there is some analogy editing and uh,

260
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,290
knowing what the end
product you're looking for.

261
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:01,250
And it's a very technical
process from just the

262
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,860
according to sponsors to color.
Oh yeah.

263
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,180
Are you expert at that at this point or
is that something that is also in its

264
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:10,710
own way,
a collaborative effort?

265
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,350
I mean, everything's a
collaborative effort, but um, no, I,

266
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:18,300
we spent months and months, I mixed every
single car exhaust in this movie. Yeah.

267
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:20,910
Because the, the, the film
itself is one musical element.

268
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:24,220
That's how it's all rhythm. Everything
is rhythm and joy in life and, and,

269
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,720
and especially a film. It has to be one
musical elements so that you're not,

270
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,840
you know, you're not bumping up against
the guard rails while you're watching it.

271
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:32,400
You feel like you're in good hands.

272
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,550
Those are the best movies that I like
to watch. This I just, Oh right. I,

273
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,710
the rhythm is very, is very set. Um,
and you create that in the editing room.

274
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:41,850
That is where you create it.

275
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,080
And then you had the bold move of actually
filming at Glastonbury and Coachella,

276
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,250
which at Glastonbury in the UK,

277
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:54,080
the biggest festival music festival
needs every summer. What was that like?

278
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,090
That's a real,
that's a real deal.

279
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,320
And that really came out of necessity,
which I'm sure you're all aware of it,

280
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,450
you know, sometimes, you know,

281
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,960
an idea comes out of what you can't do
and that we had a limited budget and

282
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:06,150
limited time and I thought,
well, it has to be real.

283
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:10,170
And I watched so many movies that had
recreated live performances and you can

284
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:13,290
really smell when it's not
working. And uh, I thought,

285
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,130
and actually Terrence Malick had just
done a movie about songwriters and I had

286
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:20,340
happened to see the trailer and
I thought, and I said, oh, he's,

287
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,940
so I called him and he was having, he was
kind of to talk to me and he said, yeah,

288
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,560
I've jumped on.
But it's very difficult.

289
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:28,050
But so that gave me the
confidence that it's doable.

290
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:31,230
And I go to Glastonbury every year cause
I'm a huge music fan and that's how I

291
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,870
knew them and they were, they
let me go on. But that was crazy.

292
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,340
We had four minutes in front of 80,000
people in the pyramid stage and it was a,

293
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:40,170
it was, yeah, it was really something

294
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,110
looking at it this way out onto the crowd.
Yeah,

295
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,020
but just getting real,

296
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,650
just getting back for a second to
what you were talking about earlier.

297
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,890
That's one of the things that I really
do love about the movie is when he,

298
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,250
when Jackson says to him, the boy in a
talent comes everywhere, but you know,

299
00:16:53,251 --> 00:16:54,120
everybody's got talent,

300
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:56,700
but having something to say in a way
to say it so people listen to it.

301
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:58,830
That's a whole other bag that,

302
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:01,170
that's something that we
all have the ability to do.

303
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,620
You know that if there's one thing that
I hope people take from the movie is

304
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:05,550
that they go, yeah, fine,

305
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:09,810
what is it that you want to say
and how do I want to say it? Um,

306
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,800
and the Metta that I think is that lady
Gaga did that in this movie and I was

307
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:16,770
able to do that, that we helped
each other do that in this movie.

308
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,310
Very cool.
Um,

309
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:23,730
there's something about determination
and grit that has to go into pulling off

310
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:24,630
something that's epic,

311
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:29,631
but also you kind of jumped
out of your actors skin and,

312
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,770
or the place that you were fans for these
past 20 years have had you as an actor

313
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:38,760
and theater performer into this surprise.

314
00:17:38,761 --> 00:17:43,680
He's also a great director.
There's a lot of press around you,

315
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,030
just the shots close in shots,
lingering shots,

316
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,360
like just intense visual experience.

317
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,690
That is all of a sudden you are
on in your first go at this.

318
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,580
Of course you've been in film for a while,

319
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,470
but talk to us a little bit
about that journey that it,

320
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,780
did it require grit,
self-belief.

321
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:11,930
Did you ever doubt yourself and are you
surprised now at the reaction of the

322
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:17,010
critics and the press around wow.
Like it's a new Bradley.

323
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,173
I figured it,

324
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,481
you know Ellie,

325
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:22,570
because van said if you're going to
audition to play a cowboy show up with the

326
00:18:22,571 --> 00:18:25,450
horse because people only
know what they see. So,

327
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,500
so for me it wasn't a shock because I've
been thinking about shots since I was a

328
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:33,730
kid, you know, and observing movies and
seeing like, and the movies that I love,

329
00:18:33,731 --> 00:18:36,820
his form always follows function
and arbitrary cool shot.

330
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,200
If I'm watching a movie and then I'm
aware as I'm watching the movie, Oh,

331
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,170
that's a cool shot. I'm, to
me that's not enjoyable. As a,

332
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:45,580
as a viewer of a film,
I want to,

333
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:49,140
I want to sort of afterwards when I'm
thinking about how I felt emotionally,

334
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:50,440
I said,
oh well Martin Scorsese,

335
00:18:50,441 --> 00:18:54,730
that was one shot as they
went into the Copacabana. Oh
Wow. Right. You know, that's,

336
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,200
that's the, that's the goal. So
there's no, so I, you know, it's,

337
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:01,210
and it's all character
based for this movie.

338
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,140
Jackson takes his hat off when he's on
stage, he wants to avoid the camera.

339
00:19:05,141 --> 00:19:07,270
She doesn't even,
she's not even aware of her talent,

340
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,770
but the movie's telling
you in the beginning,

341
00:19:08,771 --> 00:19:11,660
she comes out of the bathroom and
she's in the center of the procedure.

342
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,600
She's on the stage already, even
though she's in the bowels of a, of a,

343
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:17,320
of a building in the bathroom.

344
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,310
So you could do things like
that cinematically with shots,

345
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:24,040
but it's all based on story.
And then by the end of the movie,

346
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,920
he can't avoid the camera anymore.
So when he's in the bed with her,

347
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:29,980
the cameras right on top of
him that he can't escape it.

348
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,250
So the hope is that you're feeling these
things, but you're not quite sure why,

349
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:37,030
but it's because I'm
manipulating it through the
choice of the shot. And that's,

350
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:39,790
that to me is what's fun about
telling a story cinematically.

351
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,530
That's the whole point.
Otherwise,

352
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:45,340
I never would have tried to direct a
movie if I didn't have a point of view of

353
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:46,420
how I wanted to shoot it.

354
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,520
I asked you earlier in what
we called the green room, um,

355
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,160
whether you're still playing to sing,
uh,

356
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,630
play the guitar and you said there's
one song you want to go finish in the

357
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:58,081
studio.

358
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:03,081
So talk to us a little bit about that
journey and whether you do it in the

359
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:06,270
shower or you're gonna get

360
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,340
you come to the studio permanent.
I did sing shallow in the shower,

361
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,670
the hotel the other night. I was
like, can I still sing that song?

362
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,800
It was okay. I think when in the
shower, it all sounds good, doesn't it?

363
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,150
Um, no, I don't think, I mean,

364
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:25,510
here's the thing I love about what I
get to do for a living is I get to enter

365
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:29,980
into a world like, like a
sociologist, you know, and,

366
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:31,650
and learn about everything and,

367
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:36,520
and soak it and not just cerebrally but
also since Suriya Lee and then then then

368
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:40,300
get to transferred into some
sort of ritualistic performance.

369
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,850
So it's a wonderful way of learning.
And this was incredible.

370
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,410
It took four years,
six years when I thought it,

371
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:49,360
that's when I was at the
concert with Metallica.

372
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,310
And the truth is I've been lucky enough.

373
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:55,390
There's something else that I feel
that obsessed by now. So I'm Kinda my,

374
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,350
my head and my heart is
somewhere else now. And the,

375
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,870
and I only know how to do this if I am
completely in love with it because as you

376
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:05,500
said, it's true. It takes a
tremendous amount of work. I mean,

377
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,970
I edited the movie in My house,

378
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:11,500
thank God because we were pulling 16 hour
days for like six months. Wow. And um,

379
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,510
and I just had a kid
so there was that too.

380
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,370
I'm always wondering if she's going to
like grow up in like, oh cause of the,

381
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,470
cause we, we edit, it's loud. It was
right below her bedroom and I thought, oh,

382
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,160
she's going to hear this music for like
the first six months of her life and

383
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:28,100
what her, she's going to like
hate our music or love it.
Yeah. Um, so, so I don't,

384
00:21:28,101 --> 00:21:32,080
I don't know how to do anything to this
degree unless I completely love it.

385
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,220
That said, um, I
absolutely enjoyed singing,

386
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:40,000
but I hope that what I want to do
at least for the next decade or two,

387
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:44,260
is to make movies. Um, but there was
that song too far gone. That's in the,

388
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,100
the cop far. And I only wrote
the first verse and Chorus.

389
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:51,220
And I had the other day I had this
thought of the second verse and a bridge.

390
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:52,054
So I'm going to go,

391
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,640
he's a songwriter.
Multitalented you,

392
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:59,860
you just said you are a bit obsessive.
So what are you obsessing about now?

393
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,870
I don't want to say because
if it doesn't happen,

394
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,820
all right, but hopefully you'll
like it in five years. You know,

395
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,790
a number of us have watched your career
and know your characters so well.

396
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:17,791
And I remember a wedding crashes you
played so effectively it despicable guy.

397
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,330
It was

398
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,030
that football game.
Yeah.

399
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,830
And it's like put his tie over when he
would beat somebody up, it made no sense.

400
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:34,180
Just like sweat messaged Ohio.
Well,

401
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:41,530
what's your favorite character
that I played as a Jack Jackson

402
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,490
to say, I think it's still a Joseph
Merrick when I did the elephant man. Yeah,

403
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,230
that makes sense. Yeah. That
was a year long run on Broadway.

404
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,720
Broadway in London.
Yeah.

405
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,630
That's a lot of effort because
sometimes two shoes day.

406
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,700
So you made a specific choice and making
Jack Jackson's character and alcoholic

407
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:06,080
and a drug addict who's more rows and
verbally cruel, but he's not violent.

408
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,630
So someone has asked this question,

409
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,990
it seemed to me you were
pointing to the power of words.

410
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:17,270
Could you talk about the development and
nuance of building that character? Yeah,

411
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:17,910
absolutely.

412
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,450
To me, he's a, I mean it's for you
now, but to me, he's a character who's,

413
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,710
who's stuck at 13,

414
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:27,090
14 years old when that
traumatic experience happen
to them and everything comes

415
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:27,481
from that.

416
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:32,190
And he hasn't cultivated any other
aspect of his life except for his music

417
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:35,370
because the world was telling
him this is what is important.

418
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,040
That this is what we want from you.
And he was able to share that.

419
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:42,270
Now he's 43 and we meet him and he could
tell his body is starting to take a

420
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:43,380
toll,
has hearing,

421
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,560
and this gets old if you don't
cultivate the rest of your life. Um,

422
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,690
but he, to me, he's somebody that,

423
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,540
that's what he loves and he still has
an interest in people and music and,

424
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,090
and love of the work.
Um,

425
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,410
and that's why he's the sort of blown
away by her, but he's nothing. He's an I,

426
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,830
you know, I don't seem
as cruel at all. In fact,

427
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:06,620
the only really cruel thing he says
is that horrible thing he says in the

428
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:11,300
bathtub, but she doesn't even remember
cause he's so he's intoxicated. Um,

429
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,330
but even the way he says
that it's almost in this,

430
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,090
it's not an ad. It's not in an
aggressive way. It's, you know, so,

431
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,410
so I never saw him as, as he, first
of all, he's also not a word Smith.

432
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,440
He's not somebody who talks a lot,
you know, he chooses his moments,

433
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,240
you know what I mean? Um, I
just, I, I feel a lot of, um,

434
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:37,310
I care about him a lot. I just wish that
he was taking care of more, you know,

435
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:38,390
by his older brother,

436
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,900
you know, by himself too. I think
that's an important lesson to us all.

437
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,630
Once Allie is discovered,
um,

438
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,650
we do see Jack's hesitant
reaction to her transformation.

439
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,940
What should we understand about alleys
reaction and also like lady Gaga,

440
00:24:56,191 --> 00:24:59,190
his own experience in that
character transformation,

441
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:04,430
which doesn't really parallel
her own. No, not at all. Yeah,

442
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,293
yeah.
Yeah.

443
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,910
The main difference with the other movies
I think are these two characters that

444
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,830
that's where we're sort of circling
around and the other movies,

445
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,870
the male character is,

446
00:25:13,871 --> 00:25:18,871
I'm jealous of her fame and doesn't like
that he's losing the spotlight and she

447
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:23,170
is a character who sort of an
ingenue and looks at the world.

448
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:26,140
The world is my oyster. I Dunno what's
going to happen, but this is all great.

449
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:30,640
These two characters, it's a guy
who doesn't even think about fame.

450
00:25:30,641 --> 00:25:34,690
It's a byproduct that he's had to deal
with. Um, he just cares about sort of,

451
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:37,750
I'm trying to find a
pure moment to fuel him.

452
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:43,260
She's somebody who's 31 years old and has
been told by the world or by corporate

453
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:48,220
music driven by men that her physical
appearance does not merit her song writing

454
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:49,510
ability.
So she won't shoot.

455
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,940
They don't want her to sing the
very songs that she's written.

456
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,320
And so she's relegated to singing in a,
in a,

457
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:59,710
in a bar and a dark bar and singing
a cover, not even her own music.

458
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,630
So that's a totally different character.

459
00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:04,660
That's a character who's just about
given up, but she can't quite give up.

460
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:08,800
She still has that need to perform,
but it's, it's, it's in this,

461
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,630
it's tucked away in this little corner.

462
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:16,110
And so that's what I loved about this
story is these two characters meet and

463
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,760
when she's thrust into this world,
that is the, the con, you know, the,

464
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:24,820
the mechanized world of
music in a way. Um, she's,

465
00:26:24,821 --> 00:26:27,550
she's taken a different direction,
but we were,

466
00:26:27,551 --> 00:26:30,790
I was always conscious that she
still had a voice in it. You know,

467
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:33,610
when they have that fight in
the bath though, she says,
yeah, those are my lyrics.

468
00:26:33,611 --> 00:26:35,380
You have a problem with my lyrics.
You know,

469
00:26:35,381 --> 00:26:38,580
her manager wanted her to go blind
and she moved, went red. You know,

470
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,910
she still had a choice, but she did
sort of lose her weight as one does,

471
00:26:42,911 --> 00:26:47,410
but a wayward road, a career. And I always
thought thought that was a shortcoming,

472
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,061
you know,

473
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:51,600
is that just because she's doing something
else doesn't mean that it's not as

474
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:53,790
truthful.
It's just the road is very winding.

475
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,990
Our target's going to be aired on Youtube,

476
00:26:56,991 --> 00:27:00,710
which has on any day more
than a billion and a half, uh,

477
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,620
viewers around the world and the big hair
and big plot point in our movie. Yeah,

478
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,493
yeah,
yeah.

479
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:09,850
So I'd love to just ask
you what you think this,

480
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,040
the platforms that we have now,
these technical platforms,

481
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:17,840
but youtube in specific,
how has it enabled to creativity?

482
00:27:17,841 --> 00:27:19,970
How,
how do you view it?

483
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:24,440
Do you spend time consuming content on,

484
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,970
I mean, [inaudible] they're a
device. The, in its best form, what,

485
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,580
what these platforms and technology
has given us is the, the,

486
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:37,120
the means by which we can, uh,
create story in, in various forms,

487
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:41,590
which is incredible. Um, I was talking
to somebody a yesterday in Dallas about,

488
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,251
you know,

489
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:46,300
what took Stanley Kubrick six years to
develop because he wanted to have some

490
00:27:46,301 --> 00:27:50,400
sort of flowing shot you could do with
your iPhone now. Um, and then the,

491
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:51,640
and then you could post it.

492
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,740
And the fact that that you can get
content out there is, is this incredible.

493
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:57,940
So it kind of goes back again.

494
00:27:57,941 --> 00:28:00,620
You just have to figure out what it is
you want to say and how to say it because

495
00:28:00,621 --> 00:28:04,630
of the means by which you can tell that
story are at our disposal. You know,

496
00:28:04,631 --> 00:28:07,920
it's almost too easy. That's the
other thing about shots. It's like,

497
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,290
but form to me at least form
still has to follow function.

498
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,440
It all still has to do with what is it
that you want to say and how do you want

499
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:18,410
to say it? And then use technology in
order to help you know, convey that.

500
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,140
Well, Bradley, thank you so much for
having something beautiful to say.

501
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:25,560
And the way in which you say
it in a star is born is, uh,

502
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:31,110
is people are reacting in rapture.
It opens October 5th.

503
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,730
Uh, we can't wait. Those of us weren't
here to see the preview, to see it live,

504
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,150
and I just want to thank you for coming
to Google and thank you. Thanks. Right?

505
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,010
Yeah.
