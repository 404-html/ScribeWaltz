1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,470
Awesome. So my name's Kelly shoemaker.
I'm the head distiller for hanger one. Um,

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,230
we're up in Alameda, California
on the formal naval air station.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,360
So just up the way,

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,810
I'm actually relatively new to California.
Um,

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,610
I moved here to join hangar one about
three years ago from Denver, Colorado.

6
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:24,810
I actually started distilling it.

7
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:28,440
Stranahan's Colorado whiskey and
Denver go Broncos. I like that shirt.

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,533
Um,

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,020
so I started my career in whiskey and
the time that I spent making whiskey

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,240
really had an opportunity to learn
pretty much every aspect of distillation,

11
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:44,241
everything from tours and tastings
to grain selection to mashing,

12
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:48,090
fermenting, distilling, barrel
maturation, bottling. Um,

13
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:51,930
there's so many awesome aspects
that go into making delicious,

14
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:53,490
delicious beverages.
Um,

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,760
but what I have the opportunity to come
join hangar one here in the bay area.

16
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:57,690
I was really excited.

17
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:01,470
Hangar one is a brand that's really well
known for using fresh ingredients and

18
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:04,200
partnering with local farmers to
source those ingredients. And that was,

19
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,590
that was something that,
uh,

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,060
I found really exciting and trigging
and that would be a great challenge.

21
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:12,600
So here at hanger one where I am now,
um,

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,400
we working with our local communities
and local farmers is pretty much at the

23
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:22,200
center of everything we do.
We source grain and wine from local folks.

24
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,500
We work with farmers throughout California
to source the fruits in botanicals

25
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:30,140
for our flavored vodka and we even get
some water from our friendly neighborhood

26
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,440
fog for fog point. But you
know, we'll talk a little
bit more about that in a bit.

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,290
Um, part of this collaboration
with local suppliers, uh,

28
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,330
leads to partnerships with
like minded individuals.

29
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:46,400
So Chris is with me here today.
I'm Chris from fog quest and uh,

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,550
he'll talk a little bit about fog and fog
water and how we use fog to make vodka.

31
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,130
But what, what we're going to
touch on today is a few things.

32
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:56,010
We're going to talk a little bit
about innovation and Vodka, um,

33
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,420
innovation and distilling.

34
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,280
And our most recent innovation at hanger
one fog point thought go. All right.

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,740
So before I get too crazy
talking about fog point,

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,740
you guys probably would like to
know how vodka is made, right?

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,350
A lot of people have this perception of
a VOD could be in a spirit that's vodka

38
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:16,800
because it comes from potatoes.
This is not actually the case.

39
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,140
Vodka can be made from
just about anything.

40
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,710
If it can be fermented to create alcohol,
it can be made into vodka.

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,300
So their grain vodkas out there,
there's corn vodka, there's fruit vodka,

42
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:31,410
there's even a guy making vodka from milk,
so people get really creative with it.

43
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,360
Um, basically the way to make vodka is
you start with your fermented material and

44
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:41,040
then you need to distill it to 190 proof
hundred 90 [inaudible], 95% alcohol.

45
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,840
It's pretty spicy stuff, right? Um,
the idea is to reach towards a clean,

46
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:49,650
odorless, flavorless profile. That's
actually in the federal definition. Um,

47
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,950
we don't want it to be 100% odorless
and flavorless what have a nod to our

48
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:56,010
starting ingredients and put a lot of
work into sourcing really good stuff.

49
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,570
We want you to be able to taste it.

50
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,020
So the 5% that sneaks through
it with that 95% alcohol,

51
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,060
it's going to carry through a little
bit of character from our starting

52
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:07,870
ingredients and it hangar one that's
mid western grains and California wine

53
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:11,110
grapes. Um, so you guys just saw
a picture of this still behind me.

54
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:13,270
We've also got a photo right here.

55
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,780
Distilling in a nutshell is the act
of boiling are fermented material,

56
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:20,650
so we're using California wine grapes.

57
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:24,370
In our case that's wine and
as we boil that material,

58
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,790
the alcohol portion of it has a
lower boiling point than the water,

59
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,390
which means that the alcohol steam is
going to rise up off that solution before

60
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:35,830
the water allowing us to collect it and
condense it back down into more pure

61
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:38,560
liquid alcohol.
Now you see this still behind me.

62
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,910
It's got a lot of little windows and
things on it. We have to get to 190 proof.

63
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,050
It's pretty important part of being vodka,

64
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,580
so that doesn't look like a whiskey still.
That's specifically a vodka still.

65
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,330
The reason it is specifically a VOD
Casteel is because the towers next to the

66
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:55,270
pot eat contain a series
of small chambers.

67
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,720
That's what those windows representatives,
small chambers and an Asian,

68
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:58,361
those chambers,

69
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:02,530
the vodkas forced to go from a liquid
to a gas to a liquid to a gas each time

70
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:03,730
leaving behind more water,

71
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,510
leaving behind impurities and making its
way to the collection tanks at the end,

72
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:08,590
at 190 proof.

73
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,580
Now distilling is what people think
about when they think about making vodka,

74
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:15,230
right? Distilling is the
most important part. Um,

75
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,830
crazy thing is if we're
distilling up to 190 crew,

76
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:20,580
if you guys want to drink it at
that high of approved, right, it's,

77
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:23,860
we have to have water.
Water is actually 60% of vodka.

78
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,100
We're going to have water back into our
body to bring it down to that bottle

79
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,490
strength. So there's actually more water
in your alcohol than there is alcohol.

80
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:32,910
A lot of the times,
another fund fund,

81
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:36,840
the party fact you can
share with your friends. Um,

82
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,000
so for most of our vodkas are straight
vodka on all of our fruit bod coast.

83
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,650
We're using reverse osmosis water.

84
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,090
Reverse osmosis water is so clean that
it allows our ingredients to shine.

85
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:50,110
It allows all of the different nuances
and the flavor profile of these awesome

86
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:54,520
ingredients we're using to shine and
uh, through using our oh, water, that,

87
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,380
that was one of those
things that started to, uh,

88
00:04:56,381 --> 00:05:00,400
inspire me to look at our water usage
and uh, make something like fog point.

89
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,870
I'll get there in a few though.

90
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,250
I was talking about our fruit and our
wine and that's been one of my favorite

91
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:09,760
parts of moving from whiskey and moving
from Colorado to California is our

92
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,860
collaboration with our local farmers.

93
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,360
When I first got here and I saw all of
the really interesting produce that's at

94
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:17,740
the farmer's market year round,

95
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,330
it inspires us to continue
to make new vodkas and our,

96
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:25,330
our partnership with those farmers as
we do this is so integral to everything

97
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:30,160
that we do. And the drought has had
a huge, huge impact on our farmers.

98
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,750
So this is a really important time for
us to talk about water and drought and

99
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,360
the water cycle and its impact on
everything we do in California.

100
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,220
So the drought officially ended in March.

101
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,920
I know the rain was terrible
and we're all very tired of it,

102
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,060
but it helped us to get out of this six
year drought cycle that over the course

103
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:50,320
of the last six years has caused a lot
of impact on California. For example,

104
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,560
last year the drought caused California
$3 million and 102 million trees died

105
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,240
over the course of that
six year drought periods.

106
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,620
So that's a little bit
of the impact globally,

107
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:04,620
but the farmers are really paying a
heavy price. Um, on this drought it's,

108
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,010
it's important to remember that California
is an agricultural center for the US

109
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,190
and it's our biggest
agricultural producer.

110
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,470
There's more than 200
crops grown in California.

111
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,650
So drought and farmers
definitely go hand in hand.

112
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,220
The thing that I kept hearing as we
were talking with our farmers is we're

113
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:22,550
sourcing our fruits for our VOD cause
it's how the drought is impacting all of

114
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:24,920
our fruit quality.
And our fruit availability.

115
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,600
Plus it's impacting me because I need
water to make my pocket. Like I said,

116
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:34,400
they're 60% water and vodka water adds
to the overall character of what we're

117
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:37,530
making. So the final package
of a vodka is that distillate.

118
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,480
We've distilled up to 190 proof.
Any process that we do.

119
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,590
So any infusion or mass aeration of our
fruits are botanicals if we're making a

120
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:48,020
flavored expression.
And then of course water.

121
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,440
The characteristic of the water is going
to have a huge impact on the final,

122
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,783
final product.

123
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,270
So the good news is we're talking about
water and these water issues is that

124
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:58,640
here in California as a community,

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,930
we like to all innovate as a group
to find solutions to these problems.

126
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:04,250
So individuals,
businesses,

127
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:08,720
we're all committed to chipping in and
making our state a better place and

128
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,450
helping sustainability. So would you tried
to do the same thing at hanger one? Um,

129
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,700
as a group we started looking for a new,
more sustainable source of water.

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,460
What's a way that we could
talk about this issue?

131
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,660
Raise awareness for the water crisis we
were having during the drought and make

132
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:26,000
a really tasty vodka at the same time.
That was our end goal.

133
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,860
So we searched for all kinds of different
processes and in that search, uh,

134
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:34,000
someone from our team came
across fog quest. Now Fuck,

135
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,970
this is a nonprofit that works worldwide
to collect fog for agricultural and

136
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:42,080
drinking water use. Uh, they work
in countries like Gla, Nepal,

137
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,333
Guatemala.

138
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,060
It sounds really cool and we realize that
fog is so iconic here in the bay area.

139
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,300
The solution for our water issue was
actually right in front of us this whole

140
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:57,140
time. Right? The question is, could
we actually use fog to make vodka?

141
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,170
Sounds like a really cool idea.
Is it actually something we can do?

142
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,930
So we decided to reach out
to the experts at fog quest.

143
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,620
So Chris here is that a local thug expert?

144
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,830
Chris has been volunteering with fog
quest for the last four years and he has

145
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:13,920
been instrumental in this project for
us. We've actually learned so much, um,

146
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,900
visiting the fog collectors with Chris
and learning about how fog is graded in

147
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:22,430
California. And, uh, how's a way that we
might be able to collect it? So Chris,

148
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:25,100
tell us a little bit about
fog please. Excellent. Oh, hi.

149
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,880
Like Katie said,
I'm a volunteer with the charity fog,

150
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:31,020
west sustainable water solutions.

151
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,820
And a fuck [inaudible]
mission is to provide water
to people in remote locations

152
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,550
using fog. And right
now fog quest has, uh,

153
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,250
projects in eight countries supplying
significant amount of water. Nope.

154
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,061
Like Hailey said,

155
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:47,890
they brought me here to explain a
little bit about the fog because it's,

156
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,820
it's kind of bewildering and,
uh,

157
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,900
want to try to explain how this
mechanism works. And the first thing,

158
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,540
first question I want to answer
is, you know, what is the fog?

159
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,430
And out here in the bay area,

160
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:02,370
the most prolific kind of fog that
we see as the fog from the ocean,

161
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,170
that puck comes off the ocean and that
is technically called a advection fog.

162
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,050
And advection means movement.

163
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,560
And so the way the fog is generated from
the ocean is warm air moves across the

164
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:19,170
cool ocean.
And as that air is cool,

165
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,200
it Ho it cannot hold as much water.

166
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,740
So the air becomes super saturated
and then as you're cools,

167
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:27,930
even further water droplets are forming.

168
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,380
So that's the mechanism for generating
fog, for generating ocean fog.

169
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,160
That's, and this ocean fog is the
starting point for fog collection. Uh,

170
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,050
in most areas.

171
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,970
And in one area we're fond quest has
the largest network of fog collectors.

172
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:50,340
It's in a remote village in Guatemala.

173
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,580
The advection fog is the starting point
in this village of fuck quest has around

174
00:09:55,891 --> 00:10:00,891
35 large fog collectors and that occupies
a collection surface of around 15,000

175
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:02,964
square feet.

176
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:08,090
So that's about a third of a football
field vertically posted like billboards.

177
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,460
And those collectors produced around 1800
gallons of water a day during the dry

178
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:18,830
season. Uh, this subnetwork
by fog, fog quest,

179
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,490
it's a minimalist network.
It's designed to be rather inexpensive.

180
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,050
And also it's a passive technology
and so it doesn't require any energy.

181
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,480
And so for the people,
this one village,

182
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,410
the fog is a very positive
aspect in their life.

183
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,510
Now out here in the bay area,

184
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,000
people have a little more
mixed feelings about the fog.

185
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,770
Sometimes the fog will cause
traffic delays or airport delays.

186
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,780
But also during the summertime,

187
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,500
the fog can cool off an entire
city or an entire county.

188
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,970
And so if you think about it,

189
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,650
for the fog to have an
impact over a square miles,

190
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:58,230
there's a lot of energy in the fog.
There's a lot of cold water.

191
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,750
It's just difficult to acquire that water.

192
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,070
So hope that helps a little bit.
Now the pro,

193
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,640
the process for fog collection
is pretty straight forward.

194
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,880
What has to happen is fog
has to be blown through a,

195
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,300
through a mesh for several hours and then,

196
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,220
and then water is trapped on the Mesh
and it's eventually collected in a tank.

197
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,910
So how does,

198
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:27,510
I want to explain a little bit
more about why this works and uh,

199
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:29,940
the starting point to
understanding why this,

200
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:33,510
why this system works is I can
explain a little bit more about fog.

201
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:38,130
And the most important aspect of fog is
that the droplets and fog or microscopic,

202
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,960
there are about 100 times smaller
than a raindrop. So raindrops,

203
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,420
their trajectory usually is vertical.
They're falling,

204
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,720
they're falling from the cloud to the
ground. Fog droplets tend to float,

205
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,950
they move horizontally.

206
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,310
So any fog collectors will be posted in
a vertical fashion to try and maximize

207
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,660
the fog going through the material.

208
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,930
So the process, like I said, is
it's pretty straight forward. Uh,

209
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,620
fog droplets impact the mesh then may
get trapped and they stopped moving and

210
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:17,310
over time the mesh becomes waterlogged
and then larger droplets fall from the

211
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:20,220
Mesh into a trough and then
into a collection tank.

212
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,570
So basically what these fog collectors
are doing is they're converting the small

213
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:28,800
microscopic droplets and fog and the
larger droplets, which weekend down,

214
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,760
plumb into a tank.

215
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,800
Okay.

216
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,800
And one tool that fog researchers use
is called the standard fog collector.

217
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,750
A standard fog collector is,
uh,

218
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:44,580
can measure the fog collection
efficiency in a particular area. Uh,

219
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:48,840
and last year, uh, with, for s
for the fog, Bob could project,

220
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:52,260
we mainly use the standard fog collectors.
Also,

221
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:54,600
the researchers are commonly used them.

222
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,020
And from June through September,
this one,

223
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:03,830
small fog collector average,
uh, over a gallon a day,

224
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,860
pretty stove or a gallon a day.
During the fog season at Sutro tower?

225
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,810
No. Um, these standard fog collectors,
because researchers use them,

226
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:16,780
they're made to standard
specifications and standards sizes.

227
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,180
The main component on the fog collector
is one square meter metal frame.

228
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,610
And then that metal frame is wrapped
in a specific type of shade cloth.

229
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:31,150
There's two layers of shade cloth that
goes to the metal frame that makes up the

230
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:32,410
fog collection panel.

231
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,190
Then the fog collection panel was
lifted two meters off the ground.

232
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,650
It's also anchored in
place with Guidewire's.

233
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,670
The shade cloth that we use for
the standard fog collectors.

234
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:50,170
A was studied for around 10 years and
it was this particular shade cloth with

235
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,490
Rochelle.

236
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:58,440
We've and a 35% shade coefficient was
determined to be the most optimal material

237
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:02,390
for fog collection to high elevations.
Um,

238
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,500
and if you look at the shade cloth,
a little hard to see right here.

239
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,401
But there were shell,

240
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:13,200
we formed the triangle
and that facilitates water
shedding off the material.

241
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,440
And also that triangle pattern is similar
to the branch and needle structure on

242
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:21,330
redwood trees.
It's very similar.

243
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:24,510
So there's a lot of bio mimicry
going on in fog collection.

244
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,470
And a big topic of research is a lot of,

245
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,250
a lot of researchers and schools are
trying to develop materials which are more

246
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:35,010
efficient than the standard
fog collection material.

247
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,430
And for this project,
for this upcoming year,

248
00:14:38,431 --> 00:14:42,600
we have several standard fog collectors
that we're using and we're also using a

249
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:45,810
larger fog collector with one
of these more exotic materials.

250
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:47,310
So it'll be interesting
to see what happens.

251
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,820
So we learned a ton from working fog crest
quest and Chris and it turns out that

252
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,860
fog collection is actually like the
perfect bay area solution to our bay area

253
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,730
water problem.

254
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,200
So we worked with Chris and fog quest to
build in strategically placed these fog

255
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,340
collectors throughout the bay.

256
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,120
Now Chris is monitoring three
fog collectors at Sutro tower.

257
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:10,500
This is actually a photo
of one of our collectors,

258
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:12,460
so you can see at the base of the tower.
Um,

259
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:16,760
and then we have the fog farm that was
recently installed at a farm in half Moon

260
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,780
Bay. Um, Chris, can you tell us why it
fog collectors at Sutro Tower? Make sense?

261
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,170
Sure, um, well to do fog
collection successfully,

262
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:30,090
it does require a very specific set
of geographic characteristics be met.

263
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,830
And one thing that's a little
counterintuitive is we're
using the advection fog,

264
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:35,730
the ocean fog.

265
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But one the main criteria that fog post
requires requires is the fog collectors

266
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:45,450
should be placed at around two
thirds the height of the fog bank.

267
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,000
So in the bay area, that means generally
around a thousand feet up. And uh,

268
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,890
this is because,
because the fog collection is passive,

269
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,970
the fog an additional is
condensation step is required.

270
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,100
And as the fog from the ocean travels
up the hill co more condensation occurs

271
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:06,810
and the fog because more water depths.
So that's one requirement.

272
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,930
Another requirement is a
proximity to the ocean.

273
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,280
It's generally recommended that the fog
collectors should be installed within

274
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:15,600
five miles of the ocean.

275
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:20,190
And another requirement is generally
a free path for the fog to go from the

276
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:21,024
ocean to the net.

277
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,500
Now these characteristics in the bay area
are very difficult to reach because we

278
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:29,010
have a real estate and vegetation that's,

279
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,150
that's always occupying space. So it's,
it's really a matter of compromises.

280
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,310
Other important factors that we look
at when we're seeing if something,

281
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,180
if fuck collectible will work
is if there's a change in the,

282
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,770
in the plant and ecology.

283
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:47,670
If there's really lush green ferns
or a lot of moss on a tree during the

284
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:52,410
summertime, it's pretty likely there's
going to be fog in that area. Also,

285
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:56,910
you can use just physical examples like
if you're driving through an area and

286
00:16:56,911 --> 00:17:00,240
you have to try on your windshield wipers,
that's an area that is,

287
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,900
has a lot of fog. And another,
another cue is from nature.

288
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:07,470
We can study the fog drip that comes off
the trees and if there's a significant

289
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:10,890
amount of water under a tree, that's a
good clue that fog collection will work.

290
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,110
And uh, to really, uh, to, to
combine all these characteristics.

291
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,360
I noticed that it,

292
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,030
the one tool the researchers uses
Google earth cause it can pull up the

293
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:24,780
elevation, the proximity to the
ocean and you can see the obstacles.

294
00:17:24,781 --> 00:17:26,220
So that's pretty interesting.

295
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,220
Awesome.
So last summer suit,

296
00:17:29,221 --> 00:17:32,960
your towers fog collectors were able
to collect about 350 gallons during the

297
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:35,750
high fog season. So just a little
idea of how much water we can get.

298
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,620
So it's now time for a little bit
of audience participation. Um,

299
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:42,230
you guys have all got a vial with you.
Um,

300
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,130
this is a sample of the water collected
at Sutro tower over the last couple of

301
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,430
days.

302
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,880
So I'd like to take this opportunity to
taste this fog so we can understand how

303
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:54,690
the flavor of this waters impacts the
final flavor profile of the vodka.

304
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:56,790
And we'll taste the vodka
in just a moment. Um,

305
00:17:56,791 --> 00:18:00,390
so go ahead and get this water a sip.
So the water's collected,

306
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,140
it's brought to the hangar in
tanks. Um, we then carbon filter it,

307
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,720
boil it and carbon filtered a second time.

308
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,470
Now the filtration steps really important
because we are collecting fog and

309
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:10,951
these nice,

310
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:14,670
beautiful nature areas that have things
like leaves and dust that might be able

311
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:18,300
to fall into the fog tanks. So we want
to remove any of those particulates. Um,

312
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:21,750
we then boil to ensure the water sanitary
and just filter one more time to make

313
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:24,930
sure it's nice and clean. Um, once
we've been through these steps,

314
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:28,500
we send the water out to a laboratory for
analysis and it turns out that the fog

315
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:31,590
water is actually cleaner. And then
the average tap water in the bay area.

316
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,660
However,
as you guys are tasting it,

317
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,240
you'll notice it does have
its own character to it.

318
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,630
So the thing that I really like about
the water is that mineral note that you

319
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:43,170
get there. It reminds me a lot of
hiking. I'm really into hiking.

320
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:47,400
And when you're outside on a nice warm
day after a damp morning or a rainstorm

321
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,630
and you can smell the warm wet stones
of like river or something as you're

322
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,360
crossing by, that's exactly what
the fog water reminds me of.

323
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,020
It also is a slight salty
mineral characteristic to it.

324
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:02,250
I don't know if that comes from the ocean.
I like to think that it does. Awesome.

325
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,770
So we've talked a lot about the water.

326
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,800
What are we just dealing to make
this vodka? We're using wine.

327
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,210
We decided to partner with Bonny doon
vineyards cause we decided if we're gonna

328
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,410
make this a sustainable vodka,
we're going to do this.

329
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,870
We want to really do it now.

330
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:19,770
Randall Graham and the Bonny Doon team
really inspired me with their wine making

331
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:22,950
techniques. They're huge into
sustainable biodynamic farming.

332
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,230
And when I'm talking
about biodynamic farming,

333
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:29,790
I'm talking about synchronizing
the viticultural process
with the natural cycles

334
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,940
of the plants and of nature so
that that's, it's a low impact,

335
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,140
natural way to farm things like bringing
in symbiotic plants and animals to

336
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,990
augment the growing conditions of the
grapes instead of using artificial

337
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:42,270
elements,
things like fertilizers and pesticides.

338
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,820
So we have these really great sustainable,

339
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:49,110
delicious grapes that are turned into
a wine as Randall puts it with minimal

340
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:50,100
human intervention.

341
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,950
So we worked with the entire 2012 vintage
of Bonnie Dunes, Lyssa garb, long Klein.

342
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:58,560
This is a white wine blend
that's made of Piquepoul,

343
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,940
Roussanne and Grenache Blanc.

344
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,770
We brought all of the
wine to the distillery and
distilled it up to 190 proof

345
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,110
and then used nothing but pure California
cop fog water to cut that bod come

346
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,610
back down to 80 proof and poof, thug
point vodka, this delicious stuff,

347
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:16,440
which you guys all happened
to have a taste of.

348
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:19,620
So now the moment you've been waiting for,
we've been talking all morning,

349
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,000
you're here to taste vodka. Um,
so when I'm tasting of vodka,

350
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,520
I like to start with
nosing it. Okay? It gives,

351
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,910
it gives my mind in my palette a
preview of what's about to happen.

352
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,740
You guys don't need the swirl. This, I
know we're all very used to wine tasting,

353
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,820
but there's a lot more alcohol in here.
Then there isn't a wine and swirling.

354
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,580
It is going to make that volatile
alcohol rise up off the surface.

355
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:45,240
When you knows it, you'll get less of
the lovely notes and a lot more alcohol.

356
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:47,650
So no swirling,
but go ahead and take a nose.

357
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,350
Breathe in through your nose
and mouth at the same time.

358
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:53,260
That error rates that alcohol sent a
little bit so you can start to notice the

359
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:55,060
characteristics coming off of the vodka.

360
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,060
Now you can smell that mineral
Enos you get from the water,

361
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,490
but there's also a little
bit of floral characteristic.

362
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,770
Also a little bit of sweetness.
Next,

363
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:04,540
go ahead and take a small
step from your vodka.

364
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,210
This is going to prime your palate
and cleanse it. It's awesome.

365
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:10,120
You guys eaten salads back there. Don't
want your body, it tastes like salad.

366
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:13,990
So this step we'll go ahead and and
cleanse and get you ready and on the next

367
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:17,410
sip and takes slightly larger sip and
allow yourself to really experience the

368
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:18,550
texture of the vodka.

369
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,180
The nice rounded mouthfeel and all of
those flavor notes will start to come out.

370
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,980
Floral notes,
sweetness,

371
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,960
making a vodka from 100% wine was
something I was really excited to do.

372
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,950
Our straight vodka combines a grain
and great profile to make a really

373
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,660
interesting complex expression,

374
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,630
but so much of that sweetness and
that softness comes from the grape.

375
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,570
So to have 100% great fod can make spray.

376
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:45,250
Really dare I say robust flavored vodka.
I'll right

377
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,090
after vodka tasting. A little bit
of fun factoids about fog points.

378
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,200
So we used a vintage of wine and all
the fog water we could collect for six

379
00:21:56,201 --> 00:22:00,510
months. And then doing that we were
able to make 2,472 bottles of fog point.

380
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,560
So this is a really limited edition vodka.
Um,

381
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,180
we released it here in California and
then a couple select areas throughout the

382
00:22:07,181 --> 00:22:09,280
country and the response was awesome.

383
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:14,410
It was really exciting to see spirits
nerds and people that are really into the,

384
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:15,790
uh,
the distilling industry like it.

385
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,770
But to see average people
really getting into it,

386
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:21,580
to everyone across the board thought this
was a really cool idea and I think it

387
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:25,390
really brought forth the conversation
about water conservation and collecting

388
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:26,224
fog.

389
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,530
We created bark pro program to different
bartenders throughout the country to

390
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,450
make fog point Martinis on.

391
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:34,440
We actually just enjoyed one right by
the bay bridge over there at epic State

392
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,930
Council yesterday.
Really delicious way to taste the vodka.

393
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,600
And that salted characteristic makes
a pair really well with seafood,

394
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:43,780
which is perfect because we have a
lot of that here in the bay area. Um,

395
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,940
the last fun note is that we donated
the profits from fog point sales, uh,

396
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,820
back to fog quest and to what other
water conservation organizations to push

397
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:55,810
this conversation forward and help
facilitate more research into how fog

398
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:59,290
collection could become a viable solution
for some of this water crisis that

399
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,130
we've been experiencing.

400
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:02,620
And I understand that it really has
pushed the conversation forward.

401
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,080
Yes, there's are, because of this project,

402
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:09,980
I've been introduced to numerous groups
of researchers and they're interested

403
00:23:09,981 --> 00:23:12,620
more in talking with hangar one because
there are still supportive of that

404
00:23:12,621 --> 00:23:17,400
community. We've also met some
businesses that are using fog. Um,

405
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,960
I'll talk about them in a bit, but
some of the researchers that I've been,

406
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,710
we've hang, hang on. One is now
been associated with our, uh,

407
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,130
out of the U S gs.
They at least your toward side.

408
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,790
She works in the restaurant
regional science center,

409
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:36,530
got a down the street at Menlo Park and
which one aspect of her research is to

410
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:41,240
compile satellite data during this over
several years during the summertime.

411
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,960
And she overlays those satellite
images and I was able to get,

412
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:50,961
get an estimate of the approximate fog
and low coastal cloud concentrations in

413
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:55,220
an area. This is a real good tool, a
good starting point for fog researchers.

414
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:57,890
And this,
this map is of the uh,

415
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,970
point Ray's area and if you're
familiar with kind of the North Bay,

416
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:05,240
you can see that the, that
the, the higher the white parts

417
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,190
are kind of in the Marin headlands
and then upper up by point race.

418
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,020
And once again, if we were to cross
this map with the other characteristics,

419
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:18,200
especially using Google earth,
uh, it becomes, you're able,

420
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:20,240
we're able to pinpoint
locations much better.

421
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,350
Other researchers that we've met a
include ecologists and Botanists,

422
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,330
some this is,

423
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:34,331
some ecologists are studying the fog drip
off the trees and they found that it's

424
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,560
in some locations, especially on
the ridge line above half Moon Bay,

425
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:44,390
that the fog drip off the trees can
account for twice as much water as comes

426
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:45,380
during the rainy season.

427
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:49,680
This image here is another is an
image from Alicia toward neurosis,

428
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,730
a standard fog collectors up in
the mid peninsula research area.

429
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,230
And what she has there is,
like I said,

430
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,920
researchers are trying to study
different Mesh to see which ones are more

431
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:01,754
effective.

432
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,720
And so she has an array up and there's
going to be a journal article out shortly,

433
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:06,320
uh,

434
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,910
combining this evaluation along with
several other evaluations along the coast

435
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:11,744
of California.

436
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:16,990
But what's really fascinating is we met
a botanist who was doing research out of

437
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,240
Santa Barbara and she focused,

438
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:24,980
she set up some standard fog collectors
at a strawberry farm and other biology

439
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:25,640
type equipment.

440
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,640
And she was able to measure
how efficiently plants
were transporting water and

441
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:32,330
doing photosynthesis.

442
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:36,770
And she was able to prove that after a
fog event at these particular strawberry

443
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:41,510
farms, the w the strawberries
required less water to thrive.

444
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,310
And that's really interesting,

445
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:47,360
especially if you combine that fact
with Alicia tour grosses maps where they

446
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:50,690
show that Salinas valley where there's
a lot of these farm lettuce and

447
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:54,610
strawberry farms, that's
prime fog area. So, um,

448
00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:00,290
there's a lot of interesting, uh, studies
of fog not really related to collecting,

449
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,310
collecting the water,

450
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:06,170
but ecologist or studying and botanists
are studying it and also toxicologists

451
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:10,520
are studying it. Um, so now, uh,
some of the businesses we've met,

452
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,420
uh, with this project include, uh,

453
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,310
a guy who sold us who sold hangar one,

454
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:21,440
the first ever fog collector of
this style in the United States.

455
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:21,740
Uh,

456
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,740
we met Michael Donahue with this company
for two h two o and he is a distributor

457
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,490
of these German engineered
style fog collector,

458
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,580
which has been trademarked and branded.

459
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,810
The Cloud Fisher fog collectors,
uh, they use, like I say,

460
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:41,150
a more exotic mesh and they're also,

461
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:45,040
they have an aspect of German engineering
where there they're more robust than

462
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,580
the fog quest fog collectors.
But there's also, um,

463
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,650
more money involved in this,
in the materials.

464
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:56,651
So it's interesting to see the
different charities compete for once.

465
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,830
One's a highly engineered device and one's
more of a minimalist device. Now this,

466
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,490
those fog collectors that we saw,
um,

467
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,560
have been installed successfully and
Morocco and in 2018 with the support of a

468
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:14,730
couple of Moroccan charities
and the support of a Ger,
German government, these,

469
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,760
these Claude Fisher style fog collectors
are estimated to be the new largest fog

470
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:21,751
collector network.

471
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:25,770
There's supposed to be larger than the
one block west has up in Guatemala.

472
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,120
So it'll be interesting to see if
they can accomplish that by 2018.

473
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:37,320
So through talking with these
researchers and these businesses,

474
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,480
I really think that fog point has,

475
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,080
has established a dialogue and we can,

476
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,260
it'll be interesting to see where
we go forward from here with water

477
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:50,470
conservation and fog studies
and the work on the farms. Yeah.

478
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,863
Very cool.

479
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,370
Awesome. So a little bit in closing, um,

480
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,110
I hope you guys didn't see that innovation
and fresh thinking are at the center

481
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:00,940
of pretty much everything
we do at hanger one.

482
00:28:00,941 --> 00:28:04,410
So we were so excited to be
invited to Google. You know,

483
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,810
Google is thought of as a
really progressive company
that's on the forefront of,

484
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,320
of human ingenuity, I
would say. And so it's,

485
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,270
it's really exciting to be able to come
here and talk to you guys about fog

486
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:16,840
point. Um, I hope I've changed your
perception of what you're drinking.

487
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:18,160
So next time you're out at happy hour,

488
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:22,270
you can think about how much water is in
this vodka and where did it come from.

489
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,570
Um, we do welcome your thoughts
though. We're always innovating.

490
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:29,740
We're always looking for new ways to
make vodka and new things to make vodka

491
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:30,041
from.

492
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,550
So please feel free to reach out with to
me if you guys have any ideas about any,

493
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:36,340
it's sort of fun projects
we could go forth on,

494
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:39,500
any issues we could address in
the vodka making worlds. Um,

495
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:43,240
and also lastly like to invite all
of you, um, we pass a little car,

496
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:45,400
but please come visit
us at the distillery.

497
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:48,760
We're located just up the way at the
Alameda Naval Air Station and we'd love to

498
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:52,900
have you so you can see our
equipment, learn about our
process, tastes, fog point,

499
00:28:52,901 --> 00:28:56,200
hangar one, and some of our
limited edition Bod Vodkas. So, uh,

500
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,460
thank you guys very much.

501
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:00,460
I'd like to open it up for questions
if anyone has any questions. Yes,

502
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,140
it's a great question.

503
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,550
Well,
like I said,

504
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:07,940
the researchers from Stanford or studying
or trying to study the characteristics

505
00:29:07,941 --> 00:29:12,830
which produce a lot of fog
drip. And so there, there,

506
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:17,540
there were at that stage in 2015 I
know the research is ongoing now.

507
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:22,750
I'm not sure what you mean by what
the impact on the ecosystem is.

508
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,370
They won what they're,

509
00:29:25,371 --> 00:29:28,370
what the researchers are able to do
other than study the fog drip is they're

510
00:29:28,371 --> 00:29:32,660
able to do an isotope analysis of the
water of the water table from well water

511
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,010
and they can identify how much of the
water recently came from fog and how much

512
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:39,560
of the water came from rain.
And there has been,

513
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:42,130
once again a surprising
in some watersheds,

514
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:46,360
especially along the coast are talking
about like the crystal springs watershed,

515
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:50,260
uh, just, uh, east of half
Moon Bay. That they're, the,

516
00:29:50,261 --> 00:29:54,880
I still analysis of that water table
shows that the fog has a very significant

517
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:59,530
impact on that watershed. Yeah. Well,

518
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,250
um, that's, that's a good question. The,

519
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:07,660
of course if you were to layer fog
nets everywhere, it would probably,

520
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:12,240
it could have an impact, but generally
the fog is so spread out and it's,

521
00:30:12,241 --> 00:30:13,520
it does encompass such a,

522
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,900
such a high and wide area
that it would be difficult to,

523
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,680
to remove a large amount of water.

524
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:24,880
But an obvious thing to do with the
reason I think that the u s gs is involved

525
00:30:24,881 --> 00:30:28,480
in mapping this out is they
could potentially regulate
it and set up the permit

526
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:32,350
system. So people were removing the
water in a sustainable manner. Isn't the,

527
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,440
the fog that you get near the bay,
wouldn't it have salt in it?

528
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:39,843
Well,
um,

529
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,680
certainly there's an impact on the fog
from the waves breaking action and that

530
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:50,550
that does introduce different,
um, chemicals into the fog.

531
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:55,110
Now as the, as the fog
travels up a hill, like I say,

532
00:30:55,111 --> 00:30:57,370
far quest recommends,
uh,

533
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,050
installing the fog nets at a
high elevation. Most of your,

534
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,400
most of the impurities in
the fog dropout. And, uh,

535
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,150
in order to provide water
to these remote communities,

536
00:31:09,151 --> 00:31:14,151
the fog water had to be tested
and it's been tested for decades.

537
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,760
And it is most generally it meets the
criteria set by the UN for clean water,

538
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:25,820
especially compared to a groundwater
and some of these more remote areas.

539
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,660
But yeah, there, there is a,

540
00:31:27,661 --> 00:31:32,590
there is an impact there and it's due
mainly to the wave action. That's what,

541
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:33,780
that's the point of exposure.

542
00:31:33,781 --> 00:31:37,530
That's where the fog changes
characteristics is right
when it crosses the beach.

543
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,213
So

544
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:44,110
how much water does a single
catcher get an on a good day? Yes.

545
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:49,130
Yup. Like a Sutro tower I think
is a good optimum location in the,

546
00:31:49,131 --> 00:31:52,880
in the bay area. And last summer
during our heavy fog period,

547
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:56,720
it averaged just over a gallon per day.
And that's one squared meter.

548
00:31:56,721 --> 00:31:57,500
Usually that's it.

549
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,430
Usually they're measured in gallons
or liters per day per square meter.

550
00:32:01,431 --> 00:32:03,890
So a little over four,
four liters per day.

551
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:04,810
Awesome.

552
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:08,080
We put up a standard fog collection
collector at the distillery in Alameda as

553
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:10,270
well. Um, mainly because
people want to see them,

554
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,580
but also we were kind of interested
how much water we would collect.

555
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,700
We get about a half a liter a day,
maybe a leader on a really good day.

556
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:17,530
So we use it to help water plants,

557
00:32:17,531 --> 00:32:19,870
but we're not in the optimal
area like Sutro tower.

558
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:25,360
Does it distillery doing even make any,
uh, naturally flavored vodkas. Yes.

559
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,010
All of our VOD because
they're naturally flavored.

560
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,630
So any of our flavored vodkas that you
will taste are made by mass rating,

561
00:32:31,631 --> 00:32:34,600
fruits and botanicals and
hundred 90 proof spirit. Um,

562
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,600
we then save that infusion
and take the fruit out.

563
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:39,410
And if you've ever made
infused vodka home,

564
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,140
you know that when you take the food out,
you have really bluesy fruit left,

565
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:44,900
right? We don't want to let
that alcohol go to waste.

566
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,200
So we take the fruit and we put it back
into our pot still with a little water

567
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:51,350
and then distill the alcohol out of
the fruit. And during that process,

568
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:54,680
whatever oils and compounds that were
in our botanicals that the alcohol

569
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:58,100
couldn't pull out the heat from the still
breaks down and pulls through and that

570
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:02,750
just lit that distillate and infusion
are then used to flavor the final vodka.

571
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,030
And so that's why our
vodkas tastes so fresh.

572
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:07,160
We work with our farmers
at the peak of freshness.

573
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,590
They deliver all of the fruit
for the year. So for example,

574
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:12,140
when we do Buddha's hands, they're
in season, December, January,

575
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,920
I'm in Buda hand land during that time
and then I don't touch Buddha's hands for

576
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:18,130
the rest of the year. So we do all
of our infusions and distillate,

577
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:21,800
it's more seasonally like a winery and
then blend and batch them throughout the

578
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,780
year so that we do have
that fresh flavored vodka.

579
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,830
That's the question. Um, so fog
point did sell very quickly.

580
00:33:30,831 --> 00:33:33,950
It was so popular.
It is sold out almost everywhere.

581
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,610
There's a shop located at the
distillery that as a few bottles left.

582
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:39,820
And as far as I know,
those are the last few. Um,

583
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,250
the good news is that with
Chris's help and our new fog farm,

584
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:46,550
we're working on another
expression of fog point.

585
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,040
It will be a little bit different
than the current one. We're, we're,

586
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,140
we're collecting fog
from a different area,

587
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,870
so there may be a slightly different
flavor profile there and we're exploring

588
00:33:53,871 --> 00:33:56,150
what other types of wine we
might be able to use as well.

589
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,090
Okay.

590
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,180
Any other questions guys?

591
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:04,160
How much does the standard
fog catcher costs? Oh,

592
00:34:04,161 --> 00:34:05,300
that's a great question.
Oh

593
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,020
yeah. Well, uh, like I said, the
materials using the fog quest design, uh,

594
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,670
like the one we had,
I showed up at Sutro tower,

595
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,870
they use an abs post system to hold
them up. So it's relatively inexpensive,

596
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,910
around $300. Uh, and the
academics, you steel posts,

597
00:34:21,911 --> 00:34:23,200
they're a little more expensive.

598
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,490
Now that's not including any measurement
equipment. Usually the accurate boot,

599
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:32,440
the SFC array that I showed that Alicia
had up here, it had a tipping bucket,

600
00:34:32,441 --> 00:34:34,540
rain gauges on there or they can,

601
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,210
they can monitor in real time how
much the water's being produced.

602
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:40,480
That adds another three or $400 per unit.

603
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,430
So it can get expensive.

604
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,270
But the idea is that
these can be assembled

605
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,320
by people who,
who have few resources.

606
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,900
So it should be relatively feasible.

607
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,580
As I understand it too,

608
00:34:54,581 --> 00:34:56,650
once we've determined the Neri
is good for fog collection,

609
00:34:56,651 --> 00:34:59,260
it's very easy to put it in an inexpensive
fog collector there cause they know

610
00:34:59,261 --> 00:35:00,580
they're going to get good
thought. Right. Yeah.

611
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,550
That's the really the, the, the first
step is to put a smaller one up, test it,

612
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,830
verify and then go larger.

613
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,240
So speaking about fog and you know,

614
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,930
I guess there's a certain
height of the farm,

615
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,840
like it won't go past a certain
altitude or whatever. Is that,

616
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:20,650
is that taken into consideration when
you're making the fog collectors?

617
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:24,370
Like is there an optimal height of
the fog collector that you've seen?

618
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,280
Like the ones that are produced,
um,

619
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,480
being that maybe if it's too tall it will
evaporate before it gets collected or

620
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:32,320
something like that?

621
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,810
Yeah,
well certainly the fog collectors,

622
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,310
both the standard fog collectors at
larger collection collection nets date,

623
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,190
it's important to have them a couple
meters off the ground because there's a

624
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:46,191
boundary layer right on the ground and
there's a lot of fluid dynamics involved

625
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:49,350
in fog collection and the fluid dynamics,

626
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:52,050
people say that the closer
to the ground you get,

627
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:54,870
the more poor the performances.

628
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:58,430
So there's that question
and generally the theirs,

629
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,960
so they're usually about two
meters up off the ground.

630
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:05,820
And this larger system we had it,
it went about three meters up after that.

631
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:10,860
And, uh, in order to, like I say, in
order to find the optimum elevation, uh,

632
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:15,510
generally you don't try and raise
the fog net up to the elevation.

633
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:18,600
You try and get the right height land
and then just put it two or three meters

634
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:22,920
up cause it's a lot easier to construct
a then trying to raise it really high up.

635
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:23,830
But,
um,

636
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,960
there are opportunities to install
fog collectors like on rooftops,

637
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,420
but then those are much higher.

638
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:34,290
But then you have another fluid dynamic
problem where the fog hits the building

639
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,640
and it kind of shoots over the top.

640
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,170
So we're involved with fluid dynamics
people to try and create a spoiler or

641
00:36:40,171 --> 00:36:44,220
something that will force the fog
into the net. But that's, that's a,

642
00:36:44,221 --> 00:36:47,270
that's a problem that's going to take
several decades probably to solve.

643
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,950
Okay.
How is the vodka affected,

644
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,940
if at all, by geographically
where the fog is collected?

645
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:01,400
That's a great question. So for the
fog point that we tasted today, um,

646
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:05,390
we collected fog from a couple locations
including Berkeley, Tilden Park,

647
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:09,470
Sutro tower, and we had a few collectors
for a while in the Presidio. Um,

648
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:14,750
because we were so new to collecting
fog and because we were collecting such

649
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:18,140
small amounts day by day, uh, we
added them all to the same tank.

650
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:23,030
So the flavor profile of the fog is how
I know the flavor profile of the fog to

651
00:37:23,031 --> 00:37:26,060
be. And I never had the opportunity to
taste the fog from different collectors

652
00:37:26,061 --> 00:37:29,870
separately until just recently.
I'm finding that the water's very similar,

653
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:32,570
but there definitely is a little
bit of shift from place to place.

654
00:37:32,571 --> 00:37:33,181
I had never thought of,

655
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:35,180
you're talking about fog terroir
at this point in my career,

656
00:37:35,181 --> 00:37:40,160
but you know what happens? Um, so yes at
the, the flavor differences is very minor,

657
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:41,240
I'm finding here in California,

658
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:44,210
but I'd be really interested to see
how fog water might taste different and

659
00:37:44,211 --> 00:37:47,390
Guatemala or Morocco than what we
can get here in northern California.

660
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,130
So I want to just know
if there's a way to, um,

661
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,740
for you to tell us how long does it
usually takes for a new flavor of vodka

662
00:37:57,841 --> 00:38:02,820
comes off or in this case when you develop
the foc one Bucca how long did this

663
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:05,390
whole planning process happened
from beginning to the end?

664
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,600
That's a great question. So, um,

665
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,840
when we do a lot of
experimentation at the distillery,

666
00:38:10,841 --> 00:38:14,410
I often find myself going to the farmer's
market and finding some really awesome

667
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,020
fruit or botanical we want
to play with. Um, so there's,

668
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,510
there's always a sort of research,

669
00:38:19,511 --> 00:38:24,110
new product development time involved
where we really want to dial in the vodka

670
00:38:24,111 --> 00:38:27,550
itself and how delicious it is going
to be. Um, once we get to that point,

671
00:38:27,551 --> 00:38:30,880
there's a lot of other things involved.
You know, things like package design,

672
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,850
the federal government has to approve
our labels, uh, things like that.

673
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:37,780
So it can take quite awhile to get all
those things together and to get the

674
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:41,350
bottling materials and, and whatnot. Um,
but it does vary from product to product.

675
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,810
Uh, some take a lot less time to
plan fog point. Unfortunately,

676
00:38:44,811 --> 00:38:47,830
it took quite a while because we had
the lead time to collect all this water.

677
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:48,191
So it was,

678
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:51,820
it was kind of an ongoing experiment
for us and a really exciting day when we

679
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:54,220
had the opportunity to actually
say, here's the vodka, here it is.

680
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,330
Go out and taste it guys.

681
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,083
Sorry.

682
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,180
Yup.
So the question is,

683
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:05,200
what is your advice for someone interested
in becoming a master distiller with

684
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:07,360
education avenues?
Would you recommend?

685
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:12,350
That's a really awesome question because
I got into distilling a little bit by

686
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:16,070
mistake, if you will. Um, I'm very
lucky that I found my passion this way.

687
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:18,120
I have an art degree and uh,

688
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:22,970
it was during a gap in employment that I
was looking for something fun to do and

689
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:27,800
stumbled upon a distilling. I was really
into craft beer. So it, it drove me there,

690
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:30,320
but I never knew how much I'd love to
stealing and how interested in the science

691
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:31,830
of distilling would be.
Um,

692
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:35,390
I'm hoping seeing more people
out doing things like throwing,

693
00:39:35,391 --> 00:39:39,980
distilling winemaking, um, drives
people towards stem a little bit more.

694
00:39:39,981 --> 00:39:44,180
Cause I think understanding science and
engineering is really helpful. Chemistry,

695
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,940
especially as a distiller.
But there is a lot of art involved.

696
00:39:46,941 --> 00:39:50,390
So people from all walks of life are
involved in this industry. And there's,

697
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,990
there's a lot that folks can
contribute from anywhere.

698
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:57,050
So I say if you're interested in
distilling or learning to distill on,

699
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,010
just to get out there and learn,
read as much as you can and,

700
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:01,970
and involve yourself in the industry.

701
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:04,790
Cause you never know when there's
going to be a job opportunity and an

702
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:05,690
opportunity to learn.

703
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:07,430
Okay.

704
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,680
Awesome. Thank you. Thank you
guys. A round of applause.

705
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:15,250
[inaudible].
