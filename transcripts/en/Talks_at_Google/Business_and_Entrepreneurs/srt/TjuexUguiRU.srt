1
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,630
Thanks for joining us at this talks at
Google event to everyone here and on the

2
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:14,790
live stream and watching
the video recording.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,210
We're lucky to be joined
today by Jordan Harbinger.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,700
I missed the cue
means a lot means a lot.

5
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,630
So Jordan and he's the host of the
successful podcast, the art of charm,

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,670
which focuses on psychology,
performance, life and success.

7
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,810
And he's brought up a wide range of
people onto the show from celebrities to

8
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:42,720
subject matter experts in
the sciences and the arts.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,200
He recently had Neil degrasse Tyson on,
which was pretty awesome episode,

10
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:48,450
I might say.
Definitely check that one out.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,680
And he's going to be talking to us today
about building relationships and social

12
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:54,900
capital.
So some very interesting stuff.

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,680
And if we have time we might hear a
little bit about a story of how he was

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,870
kidnapped in Serbia. So we'll just leave
that, leave that to be expanded further.

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,880
So without further ado,
here's Jordan.

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,380
Thank you very much.
Got The second round.

17
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:13,170
Everybody was like on point with the
applause. I appreciate that a lot.

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,810
It's great to be speaking here at Google.

19
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:19,770
It's great to be speaking in front of
a room of people at all because a few

20
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:24,120
short years ago I was extremely
shy and shy isn't actually,

21
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:26,340
she's not even the word
for it actually at all.

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,330
It was more like crippling anxiety,
especially as a kid.

23
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,470
I hated being in school. I hated being
around other people. I don't know,

24
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:35,940
something like they're all looking at me.

25
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:40,140
I'm sure one or two of you in the audience
have seen or felt like that at some

26
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,790
point in your life,
especially when you're younger.

27
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,480
And so I started skipping school a lot
and it went a little something like this,

28
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,450
get up, get dressed, get on the bus,

29
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,750
go to school and then immediately show
up for maybe one class or try to show up

30
00:01:57,241 --> 00:02:00,360
for a few classes or just
turn around and walk home.

31
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,990
And it wasn't the cool kind of skipping
school where you're going to fancy

32
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,630
restaurants and dancing on parade
floats like Ferris Bueller,

33
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,800
but the kind of skipping school where
your parents come home at 4:00 PM or 5:00

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,240
PM and finding playing video games
in your underwear. So that system,

35
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,560
the education thing,

36
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:19,980
the formal education thing really
wasn't working for me at all.

37
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,120
And I started to get my act together
a little bit when I was older in high

38
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:29,121
school slash college and I graduated
from the University of Michigan Undergrad

39
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,770
and my friends all had
bright futures ahead of them.

40
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,660
They were going to work at AOL,

41
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:38,310
which was a big deal at that point in
time and they were right heard of that and

42
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,600
other people were working in finance and
things like that and buying their newly

43
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:45,900
back in fashion, acid wash jeans
and heading off to New York.

44
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,750
And I wasn't really sure
what I wanted to do.

45
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,970
I needed a little bit more
time to figure it out.

46
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,540
I'm sure we've all heard that phrase
or use that phrase before as well.

47
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,770
And so one day I got a bright and
early because I needed a new disc man.

48
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,030
The one with anti-skid because when your
roller blading, that's what you need.

49
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,650
Otherwise it bumps around
all over the place.

50
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:08,410
And I think I just ripped space
time with that 98 reference there.

51
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,860
But you need to have the mega base,
you need to have the anti skip.

52
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,370
And frankly I eat at 2:00 PM was about
the time I rolled in because it was

53
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:17,200
college.
So Brighton early is a relative term,

54
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,280
but I started talking with the guy
that worked at best buy and he said,

55
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,830
you know a lot about this stuff. You
know, what are you doing after college?

56
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,870
And I thought,
well you're looking at it man,

57
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,110
this is what I'm doing right now and
maybe I should work here for the summer.

58
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,010
I know how to fix computers and how to
build computers. I can install software,

59
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:33,880
remove software.

60
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:37,510
This is the late nineties or early
two thousands at this point I think.

61
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,090
And this is a perfect job for me,
right?

62
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:44,560
I can easily fall into into this
field. And he said, soy, your role man,

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,150
you know you have to work selling music,
cds and things like that.

64
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:53,950
The remnants of the cassette section
at best buy before you can move up to

65
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,440
computer repair and customer service.

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,170
So all my friends with
their bright futures,

67
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:03,700
I saw my bright future go down the
toilet in front of a life size cutouts of

68
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:07,150
Brittany Spears,
so that system wasn't working for me,

69
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:11,260
still not working for me and
I did what a lot of guys do.

70
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,090
A lot of people do when they run out
of career options entirely and they're

71
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,330
backed against the wall and they feel
like they have no future and I became a

72
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:24,331
lawyer and so of course I'm
stuck in law school thinking,

73
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,700
okay this just bought me three more years.
Good plan.

74
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,700
Everybody says you can get a great
job once you get out of law school.

75
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:34,330
This is for sure going to be a winning
strategy for me and I really felt out of

76
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:39,070
place most of the time if not the
entire time I felt out of place the vast

77
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,920
majority of the time and that's called
imposter syndrome and pretty much

78
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:42,760
everybody has this.

79
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:46,300
I don't know how you felt when you got
hired here at Google and everywhere that

80
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:47,134
I go speak,

81
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,900
there's always some measure of people
and we won't even do a show of hands

82
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:51,760
because it's so predictable
every single time.

83
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,700
There's always some measure of people,
the majority in fact,

84
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,080
who think that they're the group or the
person that slipped through the cracks

85
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,810
and that at some point they're going
to get found out that they don't really

86
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:05,080
know what they're doing or they're not
really as talented as is everybody else

87
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:08,590
in the room and it's only a matter of
time until they get found out and possibly

88
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:09,730
or likely fired.

89
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,720
And that is what I had in my head
when I started working on Wall Street.

90
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,640
Now the guy who hired me,

91
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,890
his name was Dave and Dave was cool
and no lawyers were cruel really.

92
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,670
And that's kind of a general rule,
but especially at this particular firm,

93
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:27,910
there weren't a whole lot of guys that
were doing finance that were really well

94
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,020
respected by everybody.

95
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:32,530
And everybody thought Dave was just
the man and he was a guy from Brooklyn.

96
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,870
Andy had a 10 so obviously he knew
something that other people did not know.

97
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,510
When you're from Brooklyn, you
have a 10 take notes, right?

98
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,710
Everybody tends to take notes on that and
this guy was never in the office ever.

99
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,470
And if there's something that
you might know about lawyers,

100
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:50,470
it's that they bill in six
minute increments generally,

101
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,810
and this is what they're doing when
they're in every phase of their,

102
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,740
their workday, they're billing in
these little increments of time.

103
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,380
So they stay in the office all day,
oftentimes all night,

104
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,260
and everybody was working all the time,

105
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:08,290
especially on Wall Street in 2007 2008
one time I went up to my office on a

106
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,220
Saturday night, probably maybe even a
Friday night to show it off to my friends.

107
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:15,320
This is probably my first
month on the job and I thought,

108
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:18,650
I'm going to go up in this big Manhattan
skyscraper, open up a bottle of whiskey.

109
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,590
We're going to hang out in my office and
talk about how we all finally made it

110
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,180
to New York and we're doing really well.

111
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,530
And when I opened the elevator door on
the 42nd floor of world financial number

112
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:31,550
two, the place looked like Monday
morning. Everybody was in there.

113
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,510
I'm talking everybody except for our
summer class, which is what I was in.

114
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,830
All the partners were there. All of the
associates, junior and senior were there.

115
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,130
There were closing some deal and
it was kind of a normal situation.

116
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,220
I didn't know that at the time.
I actually went back in the elevator,

117
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:48,080
push the ground floor button
and get the hell out of there.

118
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:51,200
Obviously as fast as I could before
they gave me some paperwork or some

119
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:55,160
documents to review because I wanted to
continue my life and my evening and my

120
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,550
weekend.

121
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,030
But what ended up being really frightening
was when I went back to work on

122
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:01,880
Monday morning, I asked the
senior associate, what's the deal?

123
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,570
Why are there so many people in
the office on a weekend? You know,

124
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:09,500
are we closing a big deal or is there,
are we short staffed? What's the problem?

125
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,110
And he said, no man, we're
always here at this time.

126
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,960
There's not a weekend that
goes by that we're not here.

127
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,310
10:00 PM 11:00 PM one two in the
morning if there's any work to be had,

128
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:21,890
we're doing it.
I mean we bill in six minute increments.

129
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,210
There's one guy that wasn't there
besides me. Of course Dave was not there.

130
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,830
Dave was nowhere to be found.

131
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,630
Dave wasn't there at 2:00 AM on a Saturday
and he certainly wasn't there at 2:00

132
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,590
PM on a Tuesday.

133
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:38,591
And this was so confusing to me and
luckily Dave was assigned by HR to be my

134
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:43,760
mentor and not right. Not the
kind of mentor. It's like, oh,

135
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:47,090
we're on the top floor, do an oyster
shooters with Matthew mcconaughey,

136
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,790
like on Wolf of Wall Street.
Not that kind of mentor.

137
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,890
This is the kind of
mentor where HR is like,

138
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:54,140
you have to hang out with this guy twice.

139
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:59,360
Check the boxes when you do so that we
know you mentor this person during the

140
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,300
summer. And uh, he was thrilled
about it. As you might imagine.

141
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,950
Everybody else that was on this mentorship
program that was in the law firm was

142
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:10,580
going to see blue man group to put a
little bit of a timestamp on it too,

143
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,810
to go out for drinks and
have $190 seafood lunches.

144
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,460
And my mentor was being forced at this
point now that I ratted him out. Pro Tip,

145
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,020
never do that to HR.

146
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,520
He was being forced to take me out for
coffee in essentially the basement of our

147
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:28,400
building and mentor me by force.

148
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,170
And what that entailed was him banging
away on his blackberry with a full

149
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:37,580
keyboard and black and white screen
and probably playing Brickbreaker,

150
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:40,310
which is still one of the best games
of all time on any mobile platform.

151
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,350
He asked me or told me
rather to ask him anything.

152
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,030
And at this point I didn't have a
whole lot of questions lined up. Right.

153
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:52,340
I just figured mentorship
was kind of unidirectional.

154
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:54,650
I didn't know that I had to play a
part in this other than showing up,

155
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:59,190
which you know, shows my, my
understanding of Wall Street at that time.

156
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,990
But he didn't have a clue either.

157
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:04,320
So the first question that I asked them
was something that I was pretty sure it

158
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:07,080
was going to get me fired, but I didn't
care at this point because again,

159
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,450
I thought it's only a matter of
time until they find me out anyway.

160
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,570
I might as well get this one off my chest.
And I said,

161
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:16,800
how come everyone is always in the office?
Always billing hours,

162
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:20,130
always billing in six minute increments,
but you're never here.

163
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,480
What are you doing all day?
What do you do at our law firm?

164
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,100
And he put down his blackberry
and he leaned in and he said,

165
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,010
who's talking about what I do all day?
And at this point I'm just like,

166
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:36,570
this is how you get fired at Starbucks
for sure in front of all these people.

167
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:39,660
I'm going to get reamed out by a
partner and walk home and just,

168
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:42,840
I'm gonna leave my phone there. I'm not
even to go back and get it. This is it.

169
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,060
This is the end. It's going to be the
most embarrassing time in my life.

170
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,020
And of course I backtracked like
crazy and I said, well, you know,

171
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,810
some people here, maybe I've mentioned
that you're just not around a lot.

172
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:54,210
I don't know. You know, I'm busy
working so I didn't even notice.

173
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,650
But he goes, well look, let
me be honest with you man.

174
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,800
I bring in all of the deals
for our real estate department.

175
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,140
I go out and I meet potential clients,

176
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,490
which at that point were investment
bankers and I do things with them that

177
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,400
create relationships and
then they give us business.

178
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:15,060
That's why we have a new million dollar
deals every couple months or every

179
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,893
quarter here at the firm.

180
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,060
And I was super confused by this because
it didn't occur to me that going out

181
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:24,720
and getting relationships with
people would somehow bring benefit.

182
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:28,140
I thought people found law firms in the
yellow pages and hired them and that was

183
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:30,990
it. Or maybe they were
really good at something.

184
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,510
And so people noticed and they
hired them because of that reason.

185
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:36,000
And that turns out to be
only part of the equation.

186
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,550
So what Dave was actually doing was lead
Gen, business development, networking,

187
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:45,090
relationship development, whatever you
want to call it, but it was very informal.

188
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,890
The reason he had a tan was because he
was always outside golfing or running or

189
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:54,300
cycling with these bankers. He did
Jujitsu, which made him walk with a limp.

190
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,040
By the way,
I don't know why people still do that.

191
00:10:56,041 --> 00:11:00,840
Everybody I know who does
Jujitsu is injured, but he
would go on charity cruises.

192
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:03,600
He would go out to lunch
with people all the time.

193
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:05,100
He would go on charity dinners.

194
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:08,970
He was always gone for the weekend at
someone's house in the Hamptons and at

195
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:12,390
that time being 26 27 years old,
that sounded amazing.

196
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,890
Not just because it sounded relatively
easier than checking for Commas and 800

197
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:19,050
page documents, which is what
I was doing most of the time,

198
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:24,650
but because I actually had some inkling
that I would never get better at the

199
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:26,010
lawyer side of things.

200
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:30,900
I couldn't make myself smarter and my
competitive advantages have evaporated

201
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,010
because when I was a kid,
I got by a little bit on general smarts.

202
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm sure y'all are familiar with that.

203
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:39,870
You go to school and you just kind of
show up and it's not that hard, right.

204
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:40,830
All the way through high school.

205
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:43,800
But then you get to college and
even if everyone's as smart as you,

206
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,060
90% of the people there are drinking
their face off every single day and you

207
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:53,040
just kind of have to focus in even a minor
way to outdo those folks and now work

208
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,360
them.
And that worked in law school as well.

209
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,220
But by the time you get to Wall Street,

210
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,580
everybody's willing to work
and everybody is smart.

211
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:03,460
And I was sure as heck convinced
that they were smarter than me.

212
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,660
And that became a huge problem because
any competitive advantage that I had been

213
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:10,900
leaning on for my entire life
had essentially evaporated.

214
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:13,960
The moment I walked in the door of that
term and I started at the bottom of the

215
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:16,510
totem pole with no plan
on how to work my way up.

216
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,680
And so the way that the things that
Dave was talking about, this networking,

217
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:24,010
this relationship development,
this changed the way that
I look at work forever.

218
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:29,110
Because if he can learn this skillset
or if he can have this and I can maybe

219
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:31,330
figure out how to do part of that stuff,

220
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,320
if I can figure out some ways in which
I can increase my skills in that area,

221
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,740
by the time all these really smart people
that I'm working with me on the same

222
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:43,390
level, figure out they even need to do
this. I'll already have a four or five,

223
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,510
six year advantage.
I'll have a long leg up in this race.

224
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,170
This is kind of a tortoise and the hare
type thing, right? So if I start now,

225
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,190
maybe if I stick around long enough
and don't get fired before then I'll

226
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,990
actually have a fighting
chance at making partner.

227
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,950
That's my plan to get to the top of the
long game. You know how that turned out,

228
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:04,090
so I want to, I don't need to explain
that one, but this is just such a massive,

229
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:06,130
massive realization for me and it really,

230
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:09,820
really changed the way that I started
to think about relationships and then I

231
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:11,530
started to think about my work there.

232
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,360
It was sort of a secret third path to
get to the top that nobody else was aware

233
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:19,870
of. Now, Dave was not
the most skilled lawyer.

234
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,470
He was not the smartest lawyer.
He was just the best connected lawyer.

235
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,130
And that sounds a little bit troubling
because obviously you want people who are

236
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:28,300
competent to be on the top.

237
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,240
It wasn't that he was incompetent and
I just want to make that really clear.

238
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:33,970
He was,
it wasn't just that he got by on charm,

239
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,010
it wasn't just that he
got by in relationships.

240
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,720
He worked his way towards the top,

241
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,320
but his relationships are what pulled
him and propelled him, I should say,

242
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,543
over the top,

243
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,080
early in the game and kept him up there
because as somebody with very rare

244
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:51,010
people, skills and sales
skills essentially for client
development, networking,

245
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:52,030
whatever you want to call it,

246
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,070
those skills are so rare in technical
professions like being a lawyer, doctor,

247
00:13:57,071 --> 00:14:01,450
dentist, Google perhaps that they're
actually so rare that they demand higher

248
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:02,890
compensation and they,

249
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,730
they get you into doors that
would otherwise maybe be
close to you at least for

250
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:09,550
a few more years.
And since they were so rare,

251
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:11,620
they made him so valuable to the firm.

252
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,730
And this was a guy bear in
mind who when he hired me,

253
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:18,040
I saw him when they forced
him to mentor me, I saw him.

254
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,510
And the third time that I saw him,

255
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:24,010
he was in the elevator for an all hands
meeting with the managing partner,

256
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,190
essentially the CEO of
the firm and he jokes,

257
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,880
is there some kind of emergency meeting
going on? What are you doing here?

258
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,380
So it became almost a meme,

259
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:37,381
a joke inside the firm that
Dave was showing up at any
given time because it was

260
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:38,260
so rare.

261
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,410
It was an event that everybody started
talking about an actually made jokes

262
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:46,150
about. So this is how we
calculated his hourly value, right?

263
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,700
We looked at his time spent in the firm.

264
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:52,370
Every six minute increment was worth a
certain amount of with him billing out at

265
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:53,720
about 800 bucks an hour.

266
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,800
If he brings in a million dollar law
deal and he spends 40 102 hundred hours

267
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:05,600
working on that particular deal,
every single deal that he gets his worth,

268
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,090
I won't do the math for
you because I that's not,

269
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,300
that's why I became a lawyer first of all.
So they don't have a lot of math.

270
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,620
It's a hell of a lot more than 800 bucks
an hour and those deals stack onto each

271
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:17,600
other because you get
deals from the same people.

272
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,170
So his time was worth more than
any other partner in the firm,

273
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,880
probably worth more than most of the
other partner's time combined in the firm.

274
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:30,881
So he was able to write his own ticket
and that's why when I realize that you

275
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:35,090
needed to work outside the system in
order to succeed inside the system,

276
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,990
I started to get my notepad out and take
notes because I figured if I can master

277
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:43,580
this skill set, then the sky's the
limit in the professional spheres,

278
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:45,110
in any technical profession,

279
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,510
in any professional whatsoever
that I've ever encountered.

280
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,460
The strength of your relationships
translates directly to opportunity,

281
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:57,710
prosperity and flexibility. And
this is, these are all separate,

282
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:00,170
but they're all equally important in many,
many ways.

283
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,530
And that has to do with what you end
up doing now, five years from now,

284
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,430
10 years from now,

285
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,310
how you're compensated for doing
that and where you're doing that.

286
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,560
And it's a safe bet that a handful of
people in this room like networking.

287
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,740
I definitely don't even
like the word networking.

288
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:20,741
I think it's kind of got a dirty kind
of crusty feel to it these days because

289
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:22,010
it's smarmy,
right?

290
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:24,620
You think throwing business cards
in someone's face and being like,

291
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:28,510
call me when you need a financial manager
and that nobody likes those people.

292
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:31,200
So it makes you feel dirty thinking,
I don't want to do this. I don't if,

293
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,910
if I don't have to be that guy and I just
keep my head down and work, you know,

294
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:38,210
I'll get to the top of this.
And to a certain extent that may be true,

295
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:39,770
but the rest of us,

296
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:43,850
we hate networking for that reason and
that actually harms us because that's not

297
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:45,800
the only way to get relationships built.

298
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,370
It's not the only way to
build relationships with
other people and keep them and

299
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:50,930
maintain them and grow them over time.

300
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,280
And that's why there's that fundamental
difference that we have in our heads of

301
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,330
what networking is,

302
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:01,130
how it works and how we might learn it
or not learn it depending on how angsty

303
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:04,940
we get around that particular term.
At the art of charm,

304
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,620
we teach people how to leverage
opportunity, leverage relationships,

305
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,880
get deals that competitors can only dream
about due to those relationships and

306
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:18,080
turn something that most
of us dread secretly or not
so secretly into one of our

307
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:22,700
strongest competitive advantages.
And no surprise, the old trope,

308
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,230
it's all about who you know,

309
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,900
not what you know that that
gets thrown around a lot.

310
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,860
But when people say that there's usually
a little bit of stank on the end, right?

311
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:33,320
It's not like, oh, it's all about
who you know. It's usually like, oh,

312
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:34,310
it's all about who you know.

313
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,480
And we throw that out there when somebody
gets promoted over us or when we lose

314
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:42,140
a deal or when we don't get on the
project that we want to get on or when we

315
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:44,000
lose a job or worse,

316
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,470
lose a relationship or a partner because
of somebody else's relationship or

317
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:52,890
their skills inside those relationships
and even inside companies like Google,

318
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,430
the most brilliant idea that you have
can fail if you don't have the right

319
00:17:56,431 --> 00:17:58,320
people around you. If you don't
have the right team around you,

320
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,780
and I hope none of you have
experienced that firsthand,

321
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,040
something tells me that most all of
you have at this point in your career

322
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,750
experience,
something like that.

323
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:09,930
That might even be why you're
here and when I was young,

324
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:13,290
when I was in college and to a
certain extent in law school,

325
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,380
I thought that networking relationships,

326
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:20,880
networks in general were things that you
were born into. Your family had them.

327
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,970
You went to a fancy private school where
you wear a blue blazer with a little

328
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:28,971
insignia on it and you hung out and played
croquet or polo or something all day,

329
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,160
and everyone on everybody went
on to do something amazing.

330
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,570
And then you could call those,

331
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,280
those
guys
and
gals
together@theendofthedayandfigureoutworlddominationdot.dot,

332
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:40,530
profit, right? That's how
I imagine this would work.

333
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,210
And sometimes people marry into it,
which by the way, if you can do that,

334
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,930
highly recommended,
uh, for the rest of us,

335
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,110
we kind of have to figure out how to
generate these relationships on our own.

336
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,920
And if your parents didn't do
this for you, you have to do this.

337
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:58,860
If you want to reap the benefits yourself
and if you want your kids to reap the

338
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:02,340
benefits of relationships and networks
that you've grown over the course of your

339
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,580
life because these things don't
happen necessarily by themselves.

340
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:10,110
The good news is that with intentional
application of these topics,

341
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,300
you can actually surpass people that were
born into a good network because they

342
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,223
are coasting,

343
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,330
they're coasting on their
previous momentum and we
have our foot on the gas if

344
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:23,820
we're intentional about it.
Again, the tortoise and the hare

345
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,910
networking and relationship development
is a way of being. It is a set of habits.

346
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:32,850
This isn't something that
turns on and off over time.

347
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,510
It's something that's always on but not
in that always on used car salesman kind

348
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:37,110
of way.

349
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,470
Something that you do that you systemize
and I think I'm in the right place to

350
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:44,400
talk about systems. I hope something that
you systemize and have it work for you.

351
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,330
I moved to San Francisco from la about
three or four years ago now and after a

352
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,400
year or two in San Francisco,

353
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,070
a lot of my friends who had grown up
there or he'd been there for a decade and

354
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:59,850
change would remark things like,
how do you know so many people?

355
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:01,530
How are you getting
invited to so many things?

356
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,670
How can we have all these
different relationships? I
don't really understand it.

357
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,930
I work from home. Actually. I don't know
if y'all know that I work from my house.

358
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:13,710
I see no one except for
my wife all day long.

359
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:16,140
I hang out with my cats
more than most people.

360
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,720
How are these relationships
being developed?

361
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,970
It doesn't make any
sense from the outside,

362
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,700
but once you see the matrix
and see how these things work,

363
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,760
there's really no going back
because you can start to systemize.

364
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,160
Everyone has the capacity to do this. It's
another important key. A lot of people,

365
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,640
how many people think they're introverts
are kind of self proclaimed introverts

366
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:39,360
at some level. All right, cool. I was
like, oh no one's raising their hand,

367
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:41,250
but couldn't.
Classic introvert fashion.

368
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:45,660
Everyone waited for someone else to do
at first. Good. I'm in good company.

369
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,840
I am also technically speaking
an introvert and that's fine,

370
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,220
but what it's important for us to realize
is that we don't have a medical excuse

371
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:57,150
to not build relationships anymore.
Introversion is one of those things.

372
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,120
It's like, well, I would go and develop
relationships. I would go to this event,

373
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:05,890
but I'm an introvert so I'm off the hook
and then you go back to whatever you

374
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:09,700
like to do, which is me time. If you're
anything like me and I understand that,

375
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,430
but we can't lean on that anymore.

376
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:17,440
All of all that introversion means is
we prefer to not socialize with other

377
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:20,530
people or we prefer to recharge
by focusing on ourselves.

378
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:23,590
It has nothing to do with our
ability to learn these skills.

379
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:28,270
And in fact new research now shows
that introverts in large part are more

380
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:31,180
introspective and are better at
reading other people's behavior,

381
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,740
which coincidentally is great for
building and maintaining relationships.

382
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:44,080
So your homegrown network keeps
opportunity flowing into your life at an

383
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:46,510
unstoppable pace. And that's true
whether you're inside a company,

384
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:49,330
whether you're an entrepreneur, whether
you've got a good side hustle going.

385
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,770
And by the way, it's pure job
security inside an organization. Dave,

386
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,971
by the way,

387
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:59,530
left are sinking law firm cause we were
heavily leveraged in 2008 with the real

388
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:02,920
estate thing. I was in the real estate
department by the way. Not a good bet.

389
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,060
He walked out of that sinking ship and
walked right into a partner level job at

390
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:07,900
another firm.

391
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,980
And I know this because I saw him in the
elevator while I was working at Sirius

392
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,410
XM satellite radio doing the art of charm.
And he said,

393
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,910
don't I know you from somewhere? And
the answer was no, I don't think so. Uh,

394
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,730
he walked right in. Everybody else was
punished by the reception, a recession.

395
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,940
My other partners, my other
bosses there, they're retired now.

396
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:30,430
Some of them were in their forties I
don't think they had planned to do that

397
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:34,540
after slaving for a decade, decade and
a half to make partner on Wall Street.

398
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,870
And some of them are still unraveling
that mess from a decade ago.

399
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:41,680
The recession was a decade ago. There's
still retired. This is not good.

400
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:45,580
And it's not that they didn't do the
right thing. They build so many hours.

401
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:48,190
They worked so hard for their job,
their from their clients,

402
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,900
but they just didn't have the book of
business to save their bacon at the end of

403
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,650
the day. And the hitch here
really is that even if we were,

404
00:22:56,651 --> 00:23:01,090
you collectively decide to willfully
ignore this particular skillset,

405
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,070
you're just being willfully ignorant of
the secret game being played around you

406
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,110
and you're not immune to the consequences.

407
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,680
I'm sure plenty of the other partners
in that firm thought, you know,

408
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,690
look at Dave's the guy who
goes out and get the business.

409
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,990
There's always going to be room for
me here. We always need workhorses.

410
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,910
And that's just not necessarily true.

411
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:23,380
You have to diversify your skillset and
if you're going to skill stack and have

412
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:24,880
multiple skills that you are good at,

413
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,430
one of them better be
relationship development.

414
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,420
So I like to give homework and I know
how much everyone here loves homework,

415
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,200
but in the next month, and if you're
taking notes is a good time to do that.

416
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,640
And the next month, pick one person
in your network who is a weaker tie,

417
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,820
but with whom you'd like a stronger
alliance. So somebody who thought, well,

418
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:43,031
you know,

419
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:46,580
I should reach out to that person or I
haven't spoken to this person in a long

420
00:23:46,581 --> 00:23:51,581
time and just commit to
trying to proactively reignite
that relationship through

421
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:52,551
small favors.

422
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:55,340
And I'm talking about
finding out something they're
interested in sending them

423
00:23:55,341 --> 00:23:59,510
an article or two that you read
this recent on the subjects or uh,

424
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,020
helping them prepare for a presentation
is something that I always like to do.

425
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,360
If you're, if you've got skills
and the presentation department,

426
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,960
that's always a good one because most
people feel a lot of nerves and anxiety

427
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:12,080
around it if you're in their corner or
you can help them with their slides.

428
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:15,950
Anything really simple, especially on
a topic that you enjoy is a really,

429
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:18,710
really good gift or favor so to speak.

430
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:22,760
So invest in real time and energy into
that relationship over the next several

431
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,630
months and you will definitely see
dividends that much a promise you and also

432
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,730
create what I call an interesting people
fund and funnel a certain percentage of

433
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:36,320
your paycheck, certain very
small certainly, but use
this to pay for lunches,

434
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:37,700
drinks,
things like that.

435
00:24:37,701 --> 00:24:41,750
Even a plane ticket to visit someone
or visit an area and have lunch with

436
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:44,930
somebody or dinner with somebody with
whom you want a stronger connection.

437
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,340
And you guys have the super super hookup
here at Google because you can invite

438
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:54,200
people into the campus to have lunch,
do a tour that is built in for you.

439
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,440
So if you haven't done that or if you
haven't made good use of that over the

440
00:24:57,441 --> 00:25:01,940
past six, eight, 18 months
or ever start doing that,

441
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:06,110
maybe just once a month, time flies.
But these things stack up these,

442
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,610
this is compound interest.

443
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,290
The other reason is that opportunities
are often over the horizon.

444
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,150
And what I mean by that is we often
don't see the benefit that can come from

445
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:20,660
helping other people or from reigniting
relationships with other people.

446
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,730
So right now a lot of you
are thinking, well, okay,

447
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:26,540
I know a bunch of people but I don't
really know what I want from them or what

448
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,370
they would want from me,
so forget it.

449
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,340
It's there's nothing I really
need so I'm not going to do that.

450
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,260
And that is a huge mistake because since
opportunities are over the horizon,

451
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:41,120
what that means is that you have no
idea whether or not you can help them or

452
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:45,170
they can help you.
Neither of you know this case in point.

453
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,700
When I first moved to La, I had a too
thick and if you've ever had a toothache,

454
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,180
you probably know the pain is,
it's like it's in your brain.

455
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,350
This is some of the most intimate
destructive pain that you can feel.

456
00:25:57,351 --> 00:25:59,660
It's so distracting.
It's all consuming.

457
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,930
It seems like it's inside your head and
there's nothing you can do about it.

458
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:05,020
There's not enough Tylenol in the house,
there's not,

459
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,750
there's not of painkillers commercially
available without a prescription that

460
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:12,410
are going to help you without killing
you if you have a strong enough to think.

461
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,680
And the problem was this was pre Uber.
Okay, I didn't have a car at the point.

462
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,540
I moved straight from New York to La.

463
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,450
I had no dentist and my
insurance was garbage.

464
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,840
So of course I'm calling every dentist
I can find in the yellow pages and

465
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:27,020
they're saying like, oh, just
go to the Er. Just go to the ER,

466
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:30,200
they'll take care of you.
When you go to the Er with a tooth ache,

467
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,710
I have a feeling they tie a string to it
and slam the door and send you on your

468
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:35,900
way home because as we all know,

469
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:39,620
healthcare with no insurance or
crappy insurance, especially dental,

470
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:43,980
things like that, not the business,
so I posted in on Facebook,

471
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,800
does anybody have a
dentist that I can use?

472
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,850
I need to get this too thick handled so
I can continue with my life and a total

473
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:54,840
stranger because I have my
privacy settings completely
screwed up at this point,

474
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,000
replies to the thread and says, actually,
my aunt's a dentist in your area.

475
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,830
I don't really know you,
but it sounds like you're in pain.

476
00:27:01,831 --> 00:27:06,030
Do you want me to give her a call?
Absolutely, I do. Absolutely.

477
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:10,680
I walked down there bright and early
before she even opens up shop. They open,

478
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,230
they take care of me. I don't
get overcharged. I go home.

479
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,890
A much happier camper than I was before.
Now,

480
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:21,420
of course I go home and I'm infinitely
thankful to this particular stranger who

481
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:25,050
I still to this day, I've never met,
and I write back, thank you so much.

482
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,770
You're saved my bacon here. And he says,
great, I've really, I'm glad to do that.

483
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,790
By the way, I'm looking for
a job in graphic design. Of
course there's a rub. Look,

484
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,230
I'm not hiring a graphic designer.

485
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,350
It would be really convenient for purposes
of this story if I needed a graphic

486
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:40,290
designer, but alas, I'm not
gonna lie to you like that.

487
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,640
So I said I would keep my
ear to the ground for him,
which translates roughly to,

488
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:49,080
yeah, whatever, man. Thanks.
Anyway, however, four days later,

489
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:52,170
five days later, another
entrepreneur hit me up and said, hey,

490
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,140
your website looks really great.
I've had a lot of flaky designers.

491
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:59,010
What do you think? Do you know anyone?
Well, we do all of our design in house,

492
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,780
and I said, look, I don't know anyone,

493
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:04,680
but this random dude from Facebook
gave me his portfolio. Here it is.

494
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:05,514
It's attached.

495
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,490
All I know is that he helped me find a
dentist and he seems like a nice person.

496
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,450
Not exactly qualifications you would
want in somebody who you're going to hire

497
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:16,950
fulltime for a position. Right.
But it turns out that later on,

498
00:28:16,951 --> 00:28:19,800
after doing a series of discreet
jobs for this entrepreneur,

499
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:25,010
this particular individual ended up
getting a full time job at this particular

500
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:25,560
company.

501
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,560
So he went from essentially working at a
local cafe and posting about his job on

502
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:35,730
Facebook every five minutes to getting a
full time job in his industry of choice.

503
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:41,090
The reason that this story is important
and relevant is because I had no idea

504
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,190
that I could get a dentist from a person.
I never knew I.

505
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:46,380
That was obviously not
something I forced saw,

506
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:50,370
which was the reason I posted
there in the first place. However,

507
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:55,500
if he had literally asked every single
person that he knew and then he'd ever

508
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,780
met in his whole life for a job,

509
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,130
he still would not have found the job
that he got by helping me selflessly.

510
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,180
That is what I mean by opportunities
lying over the horizon.

511
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,780
You don't know who you can help and
you don't know who can help you.

512
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,100
You have no idea,

513
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:15,660
neither of you do and you won't find out
until you start being generous with it.

514
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,500
And that's why we have ABG,
which is always be giving.

515
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:22,620
Has anyone seen Glengarry Glen Ross?
ABC always be closing.

516
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,160
So I'll let you youtube that one later.

517
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:30,510
But essentially it's about going after
what you want and mercilessly getting it

518
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:35,280
and forget everyone else at art of charm
where rock and ABG always be generous

519
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:36,180
or always be giving.

520
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,810
And what this means is that since
you're helping other people with no

521
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,130
expectation of anything in return,

522
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,970
you can find those opportunities that
are lying over the horizon in many ways

523
00:29:46,971 --> 00:29:49,160
you can,
it's not always going to be like this.

524
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:54,170
Obviously this is a numbers game and a
you want to be the guy or gal that looks

525
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:57,170
like they're always just getting lucky
and hitting the lottery because of the

526
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:57,771
numbers.

527
00:29:57,771 --> 00:30:02,771
The way you increase your odds and a
numbers game is you keep playing the game.

528
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:04,460
You keep increasing the numbers.

529
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,160
So in the next week,

530
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,400
introduce two or more people that you
know already do not know each other and

531
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:18,250
the way that you do this is
not by surprise attacking
them with an email where

532
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:22,630
they're both cc to everyone hates
that. You hate that. I hate that.

533
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:24,760
Of course they hate that.
Some people don't know this but I,

534
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:28,810
that's why I always throw it out there.
This is called the double opt in intro.

535
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,680
Okay. You email one and you
say, Hey, I know this Guy Bob.

536
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:37,540
He works in graphic design like you and
he's got a lot of capacity for work and

537
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:40,990
he's really talented and then you reach
out to the other person and you say, Hey,

538
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:44,530
this guy James is really cool, super
interesting guy, got a lot of work,

539
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,710
always seems like he's got
deal flow coming through.
Are you open to meeting him?

540
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:51,910
Do you guys know each other already? If
they both say yes, you make the intro.

541
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:56,110
If one says no, you don't, and I know
what you're thinking, Ooh, that's awkward.

542
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:58,570
What do I tell the other person
who said yes when one says no,

543
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,590
the answer is you say the timing
isn't right right now. True. No lying,

544
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,940
and you leave it at that and if they ask
you again in a few months, no problem.

545
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,120
The only time that you would ever say
anything else is if there's a serious

546
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:12,850
issue with that, and that's sort
of beyond the scope of this,

547
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:15,790
but I would say that every
time you double optin,

548
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,220
you're most likely going to get a yes,

549
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:23,050
especially from people that don't have
a ton of incoming people that they call

550
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,960
the introductions coming from people that
they actually trust. Which by the way,

551
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:29,980
is you people who are doing the ABG thing.
We're networking well,

552
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:33,130
who are building a lot of relationships
will always say yes to an intro.

553
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,690
It doesn't mean they
have to hire that person.

554
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,160
It doesn't mean they have to have lunch.

555
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,410
It just means they have
to say yes to the email,

556
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:42,940
which usually leads to some sort of
call or even just a mutual connection so

557
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:46,300
that they're on each other's radar.
That alone is enough.

558
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:51,190
If you're thinking about the the utility
that each of these people have to the

559
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:52,810
other person in the interaction,

560
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:56,920
that alone is enough and if
you do this in the next week,

561
00:31:56,921 --> 00:31:58,330
and if you do this once a week,

562
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,040
you'll have made 52 give or take some
nos introductions every single year,

563
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,740
which is a ton,
and once you start ramping this up,

564
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:10,240
you realize this is actually really easy
because if I need help with something

565
00:32:10,241 --> 00:32:14,290
or if you need help with something, the
way that this becomes scalable. Again,

566
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:15,670
going back to graphic design,

567
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,450
let's say that I'm a graphic designer
and you need help with your website.

568
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,420
I don't have time to
do your graphic design.

569
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,910
I don't have time to do graphic
design for everyone in this room.

570
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:29,770
What I might have time to do is introduce
everyone in this room to different

571
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:33,700
capable designers.
So what I've done is provided value,

572
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,560
followed the ABG rule of
giving and helping and being
generous without actually

573
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:43,561
doing really more than connecting one
corner of my web to another part of my web

574
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,800
that makes it scalable.

575
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,790
That's important because otherwise you
will drive yourself freaking crazy and

576
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:51,350
you'll lose your job and
be homeless. Dot. A dot.

577
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,960
The end on the other side of the equation,

578
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:58,040
you've got to think about a challenge
that you yourself are dealing with and you

579
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:59,930
have to ask for help from
their network as well.

580
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:04,100
Where people get stuck with the
ABG stuff is they go, oh great,

581
00:33:04,101 --> 00:33:05,570
I'm going to help everyone,

582
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:10,430
and they start sending 58,000 email
introductions every single week and they

583
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:14,210
never ask for what they need and
that becomes almost a pathology.

584
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,990
If you're there, great. It's a good
sign that you're doing some stuff right.

585
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:23,150
Start asking for what you need.
People want to help you in return.

586
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,830
It's reciprocity, which is a human law,
psychology, and it closes the loop.

587
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,500
I like to say because I always feel
a little bit of, wow, I really want,

588
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,900
I want to do something for that person.
You know,

589
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:36,140
they've been so generous with me.
If you allow them to do that,

590
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,870
they feel good about helping you as well.

591
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,520
There's not really a better win than
there can be from those two particular

592
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:48,380
things hitting simultaneously or at
some point in the same three, six month,

593
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,630
even year time span.
So

594
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,260
yeah,

595
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,150
we've already talked about
why networking is valuable.

596
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,310
We've already talked about how to
introduce people to one another.

597
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,130
We've already talked about how to make
it scalable and we've talked about

598
00:33:59,131 --> 00:34:02,340
helping people and finding those
opportunities over the horizon.

599
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,530
The other reason to do this selfishly
or not so selfishly is that your network

600
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,970
is unique to you. You can have a
bank account with no money in it.

601
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:16,410
We've all been there and you have value
to offer somebody with $10 million,

602
00:34:16,411 --> 00:34:20,550
whatever, a bajillion dollars in their
bank account because you and your network,

603
00:34:20,551 --> 00:34:25,260
your network really is one of the only
things about you that is truly unique.

604
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,820
I know we're going to probably,

605
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:29,740
there's going to be some discussion about
how we're all special snowflakes and

606
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,260
usually that comes at the end of this,

607
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:36,120
but I will tell you that your network
is one of the only things that is unique

608
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:36,750
to you.

609
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:41,010
It's one of the only things you have
that nobody else or very few other people

610
00:34:41,011 --> 00:34:45,690
have, especially if you've been building
it up over time. So business of course,

611
00:34:45,691 --> 00:34:48,330
fundamentally is people selling
things to people that they already,

612
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,290
ideally no doing business with people
you know and like is one of the most

613
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,430
common ways to do this.

614
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,880
See the Dave example in the beginning
of this particular discussion,

615
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,590
and everyone's already heard,

616
00:34:58,591 --> 00:35:00,990
well you only go as high as
your five closest friends.

617
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,790
And I'm not saying ditch your friends.

618
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,270
That would be like the opposite of a
of a Tony Robbins seminar probably,

619
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,610
but we're not gonna.
We're not gonna do that here.

620
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,410
Networking and relationship development
is one of the single best ways to make

621
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,710
sure that you're surrounding yourself
with as many high quality people as

622
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:19,830
possible. You're doing a great job.
You're in this room here at Google,

623
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,960
not bad so far,
keep it up.

624
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,190
But many people in this company and
outside this company are running into the

625
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,890
problem where maybe professionally
they're surrounded with all stars,

626
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:33,390
maybe personally not so much or sometimes
the inverse depends on what department

627
00:35:33,391 --> 00:35:37,560
you're in here. I guess that's what
I've heard. So in the next day,

628
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,230
take a look at your appointment book,
your calendar,

629
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:44,100
your Google calendar hopefully and
over the past three to six months,

630
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,350
who have you surrounded yourself with?

631
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,870
Who have you been hanging out with
professionally and personally,

632
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:54,230
with whom have you spent the most time
and are you happy with the influence

633
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:55,890
those people have had on you?

634
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,650
Because a lot of people think
that they can resist that,

635
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:02,580
but you all know you do fall into the
same habits in the same traps is the

636
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:06,030
people that you're surrounding yourself
with voluntarily or not and that's why

637
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:09,650
it's so toxic to be around people who
don't have the same values as you who

638
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,290
don't have the same ways of
thinking and mindsets of success,

639
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,310
happiness and things like that.
Then you do now caveat,

640
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,160
this is not a game you play just
because you want the spoils.

641
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,640
It is important to me personally
to help people buy a whole company.

642
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:27,360
The Art of charm is founded on that
basis and I like helping people.

643
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,920
I like coming and speaking to people.

644
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:32,280
I love seeing people succeed and I love
interacting and if somebody does not

645
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:35,940
have integrity,
do not build your network around them.

646
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:40,470
It is so tempting to do this.
It is so tempting to go, well,

647
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,900
this person's high up on this totem pole.

648
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,730
They're really good at
this particular thing.

649
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:48,030
They have high visibility in this area,
but they're a total scumbag.

650
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,700
That will always, always, always
come back to bite you in the butt.

651
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,990
You just have to zoom out far enough on
the timeline to see how that's happened

652
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,100
with those people in other areas and you
will see yourself becoming a victim of

653
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:00,690
that same thing.
If you don't believe me,

654
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:04,260
look at what those people have been
around before and zoom out on the timeline

655
00:37:04,261 --> 00:37:08,460
and you will find an example of your
future if you associate with those people.

656
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,950
I mean it's also important,
this whole,

657
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:15,630
this entire process is important because
unless you've been intentional about

658
00:37:15,631 --> 00:37:18,690
the process of surrounding yourself with
better people and leveling up in that

659
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:21,720
area, your immediate
surroundings in social circle,

660
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,680
there's a pretty darn good chance that
it's loaded with people who are satisfied

661
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:30,681
being essentially mediocre in whatever
area that you're trying to level up in or

662
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:35,370
one or two areas that you're trying
to level up in health, fitness,

663
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,510
professional life.

664
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:39,810
We've all got those people that are have
kind of been around us for a long time

665
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:44,730
that maybe are no longer adding value
but subtracting it a little bit of an

666
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:46,500
energy vampire.
One might say,

667
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,650
and if you surround yourself with
high achievers at work and at home,

668
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,740
you will absolutely crush.
You will crush it.

669
00:37:51,741 --> 00:37:55,860
They will bring you up and you can bring
them up with you as well and people

670
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,150
like I said,
want to help you.

671
00:37:57,151 --> 00:37:59,910
If you're excited about helping
them get their goals accomplished,

672
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,490
they will get excited about
doing the same for you.

673
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,900
Always be giving and you will
get that as simple reciprocity.

674
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,050
And this is something that high
performers rely on all the time,

675
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,560
every single time. If you want
to look at charities for example,

676
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:15,870
they're loaded with the well to
do and there's a reason for that.

677
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:17,460
It's not just about being social,

678
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,570
it's a way for people in distinct silos
to be around other people that they

679
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:25,350
would normally never get to interact
with while working on a common goal.

680
00:38:25,351 --> 00:38:29,160
That is a very sort of tricky thing
to wrap your mind around sometimes,

681
00:38:29,161 --> 00:38:31,230
especially when you just
see it from the outside.

682
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,640
But when you get in the middle of that,

683
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:36,460
you realize that most of those people
are thinking like that. It's a strategy.

684
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,840
It's not coincidence.

685
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:39,630
Okay?

686
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:44,630
The number one rule of
relationship building is to
build it before you need it.

687
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:50,320
Dig the well before you're thirsty.
Networking.

688
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:54,190
Once you need something like a
job or a relationship for example,

689
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,340
that is not effective. And a lot
of people think they can do that.

690
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,960
How many people have
been like, oh, you know,

691
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,910
I'm totally gonna start this
relationship development thing,

692
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:02,530
but I've got to get this project done.

693
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,590
I've got to move up one rung
on the ladder at work. Um,

694
00:39:05,591 --> 00:39:08,920
I've got to get this website going.
I really need to, uh, you know,

695
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,460
get my move handled first and
get settled in my new place.

696
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:17,110
Some sort of excuse to false deadline is
often what keeps us from moving forward.

697
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,040
We have to ditch those because think
about this, who would you rather help?

698
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:25,000
Somebody who's helped you out with a few
things over the last few months in the

699
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,970
last few years or someone that calls you
out of the blue and is like, hey man,

700
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:29,710
yeah, what's up man? I want
to take you out for a beer.

701
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:33,070
It's been such a long time and then you
get there and they're like Herbalife or

702
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:35,050
whatever, right? You're
just like, ah, God,

703
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:37,060
I knew it or I knew
this is going to happen.

704
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,030
Waiting to form relationships
only once you need them.

705
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,510
It's like carrying a spare tire in the
trunk of your car after you're stranded

706
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:47,380
on the side of the highway. It's not good.
So here's a thought exercise for you.

707
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,073
Yeah.

708
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,120
Imagine that you got laid off from your
job today. Not going to happen. Hopefully.

709
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,890
Now you have my personal guarantee.
How's that?

710
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,720
You got laid off from your job today.

711
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,960
Who are the 10 people that you would
contact for help if that happened?

712
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,600
You get laid off today.

713
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:09,130
Who are you contacting 10 people for help
and figure out what you're going to do

714
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:11,800
next.
Make that list of 10 people.

715
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,370
Then reach out to them now
when you don't need anything,

716
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,370
if you've been laid off,
you know that's a good idea.

717
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,760
So networking, creating those
relationships only when you need it,

718
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:31,590
it's not effective. It is too late. 80%
of new jobs are found through networks,

719
00:40:31,591 --> 00:40:34,350
not through monster.com you don't
want to see the stats on that.

720
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,360
Nobody looks at their inbox even they're
using the new Gmail spam filters and

721
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:40,650
stuff like that.
It doesn't matter.

722
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,560
It's all via the network and
everyone who works at my company,

723
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:47,640
everyone who works at the art of charm
has gotten their job by networking and

724
00:40:47,641 --> 00:40:50,370
relationships. That obviously makes
sense because that's what we teach.

725
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:55,230
You will find that works in 80% of cases
and when you get to higher performing

726
00:40:55,231 --> 00:40:55,950
jobs,

727
00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:00,120
better jobs that are
higher paid compensation or
involve different or better

728
00:41:00,121 --> 00:41:05,010
projects, that number, that percentage
goes much, much higher because the job,

729
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:09,540
the stakes are too high to
rely on a simple recruiting
process that doesn't have

730
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:13,590
a little finger on the
scale from relationships and
previous vetting from people

731
00:41:13,591 --> 00:41:15,000
who've been there or know that person.

732
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:20,640
So this is about action.
It's not about collecting business cards,

733
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:23,400
it's not about your Rolodex
if those things still exist,

734
00:41:23,401 --> 00:41:28,170
which I doubt the best way to do this
is to create a platform to do this.

735
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,400
A lot of people of industry blogs, my
platform is my podcast, the art of charm.

736
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,920
It puts me in visible place.

737
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,480
It puts me in a position to interact
with interesting people that have other

738
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:40,820
connections and connect
with connect doors.

739
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,480
So if you don't have a podcast so you
don't have the big old blog or you can't

740
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:46,250
talk about what you're working on,
which was a lot of you,

741
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:51,251
I know that the greatest way I found to
do this is to organize little low key

742
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:56,261
low pressure dinner parties with people
in similar or different industries that

743
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:59,900
are relevant enough. We're one person
each time can teach the group something,

744
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,590
so you might have a dinner party at your
place and you might teach a little bit

745
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:06,640
of Seo. I don't know if you
guys are allowed to do that.
That's my go to example,

746
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,540
but whatever,
put something else in there instead.

747
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,660
Somebody might teach outsourcing
that might be a better one for you.

748
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:15,560
Social media is a good one. Uh, these
are things that are pretty default.

749
00:42:15,561 --> 00:42:17,090
These work really well with entrepreneurs.

750
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:20,300
They work really great for people in
general who are interested in business.

751
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,480
Y'All are pretty technical.
Some of you I would imagine,

752
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,760
and you can teach certain discreet skills
to the group in a way that doesn't set

753
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:31,040
you up for any sort of trouble at work,

754
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,940
but also sets you up on a platform and
if you're hosting these dinner parties,

755
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,500
you can invite different people.

756
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:41,060
You can insist they bring one other
person that you don't yet know and someone

757
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:44,630
who's been there the previous week
comes prepared that next week to teach a

758
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:48,260
subject doesn't have to be an hour long
lecture can be something really simple.

759
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,490
It doesn't have to be white boarded,

760
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,030
just has to be interesting and valuable
enough to keep people showing up and

761
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:56,330
keep the event fun enough that people
continue to come and continue to bring

762
00:42:56,331 --> 00:43:00,470
others into that.
This sets you up as the network hub.

763
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:04,550
It sets you up as the connector and if
you can connect with other connectors,

764
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,430
now you're cooking with gas. Of
course, my platform, like I said,

765
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:10,760
is a podcast and look,
networking is a muscle.

766
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:15,020
It grows with use. It is not a pie
that gets eaten up piece by piece.

767
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:19,880
If you call in help from somebody that
is not going to use up that contact.

768
00:43:19,881 --> 00:43:22,730
A lot of people operate like that.
They're afraid to call on somebody.

769
00:43:22,731 --> 00:43:25,340
Well I don't want to email them
about this because you know,

770
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:29,150
then I've used my one time that I can get
in touch. No, it's quite the opposite.

771
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,120
It's a muscle that grows with use.
The more you network,

772
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:34,850
the more you introduce people to
others and where you create that value,

773
00:43:34,851 --> 00:43:38,840
the more you ABG,
the more that muscle will grow.

774
00:43:38,841 --> 00:43:43,760
And if you hoard your network, it will
atrophy the same as a muscle as well.

775
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:48,740
So it all comes back to ABG and
doing so in a systemized way.

776
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:50,120
And uh,

777
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,720
one final sort of example here of asking
for help because I know a lot of people

778
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:57,470
are shy with that. I didn't get into
law school the first time I applied.

779
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:58,850
I didn't get in at all.
In fact,

780
00:43:58,851 --> 00:44:03,830
I got rejected and I remember sitting
in a house up north and just thinking,

781
00:44:03,831 --> 00:44:04,131
wow,

782
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:08,300
that was my hail Mary at figuring out
what I was going to do for the next three

783
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:12,800
years. I can't even get a job at freaking
best buy with a college degree from the

784
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:15,200
University of Michigan.
I'm so screwed.

785
00:44:15,201 --> 00:44:17,030
I don't even know what
I'm going to do right now.

786
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:20,930
I should just walk into the Great Lakes
that I'm looking at right now and just

787
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:23,600
keep walking and figure out,
figure it out from there.

788
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:26,030
I mean there was nothing happening.
So in desperation,

789
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,880
I reached out to a lot of my friends
who had already been admitted.

790
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:30,020
They were a year ahead of me,

791
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:33,090
a couple months ahead of a semester ahead
of me or just getting in at that same

792
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:36,960
level and I said, what would you
do? And they said, all right,

793
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,440
write a letter that explains why you
should be let in and send me a copy and I

794
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:45,144
will look at it.

795
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,070
Almost everybody said something similar
along those lines because I had them all

796
00:44:48,071 --> 00:44:50,550
on one thread and so I wrote this letter.

797
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,970
I figured this is just such
a waste of time. I don't,

798
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,010
I don't even know why I'm doing this,
but they kind of forced me to do it.

799
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:58,650
I was just going to say, great, thanks
for the suggestion and not do it.

800
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:01,890
My friend Greg, thank God he made
me do this. So I sent it back.

801
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,400
I got a bunch of corrections based on
the way that they've learned their legal

802
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:06,930
pros and argumentation.

803
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:10,020
Put it in a really interesting
format that I'd never seen before.

804
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:13,860
It looked like a legal brief of some kind
and I sent it to the admissions office

805
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:18,480
and a couple of those guys and gals
sent letters to the admissions office

806
00:45:18,481 --> 00:45:21,570
telling them why you think
it was a mistake that I
wasn't let in into the school

807
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,540
at some point. And I was
definitely Michigan material. Um,

808
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,910
cause I went for Undergrad and law
school just to avoid confusion.

809
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:32,540
And so after a few weeks I got a call
from the admissions office and they said,

810
00:45:33,361 --> 00:45:36,960
look, never seen anybody do this.
This is a really interesting idea.

811
00:45:36,961 --> 00:45:40,470
And the fact that you put this into
such a coherent argument in a letter,

812
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,530
you sent it back, you weren't expecting
anything. And my trade off was,

813
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:44,910
you don't have to let me in for this year.

814
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,760
Let me in for next year and
I will kill the rest of it.

815
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,260
I'll figure out what to do with my time.

816
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,230
And we all know how you can kill
a year in college pretty easily.

817
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,680
And so they said, fine, we'll, we'll
convene the admissions committee,

818
00:45:55,681 --> 00:45:57,540
we have another meeting
and I'll run it by them.

819
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,320
And they called a few days later and
they let me in, not for that year,

820
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,620
but for the next year just as I
had suggested. So think about this.

821
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,870
I got into one of the best
law schools in America where,

822
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,410
where an I'd previously been
rejected because I asked for help.

823
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,270
Those people were glad to do it.

824
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:19,380
We're still friends to this day and I'm
still getting a reminder every single

825
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,100
month about how valuable that
law degree was. So all right,

826
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,240
now I think we've got a little bit of
time left. Uh, you keeping time. You get,

827
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:30,420
we're good. Great. So let's
go to Serbia. So here's a,

828
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:32,790
here's a more fun example of the
law school in my humble opinion.

829
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:40,610
So in 2005 is 25 years old and I worked
for was actually coincidentally killing

830
00:46:43,621 --> 00:46:47,820
year before law school and
I had a fellowship from the
Department of Defense to

831
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:52,530
go and work in Serbia, which is in the
former Yugoslavia, not Siberia, Serbia,

832
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,030
different place, former Yugoslavia,
southern Balkans, Europe area.

833
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:58,590
And when you go to Serbia,

834
00:46:58,591 --> 00:47:01,650
you have to register with the government
and tell them where you're living.

835
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,890
And the police have to stamp this
little piece of paper that says you're a

836
00:47:04,891 --> 00:47:08,190
foreigner living in the country. And
now that's really foreign to Americans.

837
00:47:08,191 --> 00:47:11,070
But if you've ever been to the eastern
block, this is super commonplace.

838
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,000
They love to keep tabs on everybody and
everything and you have to live with a

839
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:17,040
Serbian person.
You can't live on your own.

840
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:20,660
You can't just stay in some
house that you rent on Airbnb,

841
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,850
which didn't exist at the time. You're
not allowed to do anything like that.

842
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:25,500
You have to have somebody
who is vouching for you.

843
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,740
And this got really annoying because
every time I left the country or left even

844
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:34,360
the county city area where I was,
I had to reregister so I had to,

845
00:47:34,361 --> 00:47:37,750
every single time I would take a drive
to a restaurant outside of Belgrade.

846
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:41,680
I had to reregister with the police
and that was never a smooth process,

847
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:46,710
often involved in an annoying fee and
also was salted in me having a couple of

848
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:50,590
incidences that really got old fast.
For example,

849
00:47:50,591 --> 00:47:52,300
I was coming back from a visit to Germany.

850
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,530
I came back at about 11 o'clock at night
or 10 ended up in the police station

851
00:47:56,531 --> 00:48:00,700
where the registration has done around
10 11 at night and the police officer who

852
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:04,390
was on duty there decided that since I
was in the police station at that hour,

853
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:08,380
I must've done something wrong even though
I walked in alone and he put me in a

854
00:48:08,381 --> 00:48:13,381
prison cell with three chain smoking
prostitutes who spoken aloud as foreign

855
00:48:13,781 --> 00:48:15,280
language for the entire night,

856
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:19,870
smoking unfiltered cigarettes and it
was one of the worst nights of my entire

857
00:48:19,871 --> 00:48:22,420
life and I decided this
is not happening again.

858
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:27,040
I am not doing this registration thing.
This is an offense to freedom everywhere.

859
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:31,420
I'm not doing this. And so I decided,
I'm just going to say to hell with this.

860
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,850
They're not, they're so disorganized,
they're never even gonna find me. Well,

861
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,800
I'll let you know how that goes.

862
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:40,900
So I could see the brilliant plants have
my friends say that I was staying with

863
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:43,520
them even though I wasn't.
And then you know,

864
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,450
what are the police gonna do come
in and specs and see where I live.

865
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:52,210
So the police came and inspected to
see where I live and I wasn't there.

866
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,580
And they said, Yo, yeah, he's
traveling. Did they said, okay, fine.

867
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:58,600
And so they came back about
two weeks later and they
said, where's his stuff? Oh,

868
00:48:58,601 --> 00:48:59,434
he's not here.

869
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,170
And so the police gave my friend
yelling at an ultimatum and they said,

870
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:06,670
if he's not here the next time that
we come, we're going to look for him.

871
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,730
But you're going to help us and you're
going to stay with us until we find them.

872
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,850
And that was pretty loud and
clear for guess what Jordan,

873
00:49:12,851 --> 00:49:16,470
you're moving tonight at 1:30
AM luckily moving was easy,

874
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,800
didn't have anything at our house.

875
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:21,160
But what it did mean is that I had to
go to the police station and register

876
00:49:21,161 --> 00:49:23,530
again and I decided fine,
I'm going to do that.

877
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:27,370
So I decided to pull the same thing
cause it worked for a few months with

878
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:31,420
another friend and that guy went
and moved to his weekend house,

879
00:49:31,421 --> 00:49:33,880
like a cottage for months.
So he wasn't home.

880
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,780
So what the police found when they went
to inspect again was not only was I not

881
00:49:37,781 --> 00:49:40,390
there,
nobody was there at all for a long,

882
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:44,350
long time and that raised a red flag
and when you live in the eastern block,

883
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,390
red flags mean trouble.

884
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:52,390
So this started to get
really scary for them, right?

885
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:56,290
That my friend was getting calls
because I was registered there and I was

886
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:59,800
hanging out and thinking, look, this is
fine. You know, I'll just go and fix this.

887
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:02,830
But Serbia is not exactly the kind of
place where you walk into the police

888
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:05,080
station. As I've learned
before. And say, Hey,

889
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:07,180
I heard you guys have been looking for me.
What can I do for you?

890
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:10,480
So I decided I'm going to handle this.
Just not right now.

891
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:13,870
So I had an appointment at the American
embassy to take care of everything.

892
00:50:13,871 --> 00:50:17,650
But before that I had tickets to a
music festival and this was going to be

893
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,340
awesome.
So I went into the music festival.

894
00:50:20,341 --> 00:50:23,170
It's three days long and it was
on this Turkish fortress island.

895
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:25,030
It looks like game of Thrones.
In fact,

896
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,740
I think they may have filmed some
game of Thrones stuff there. It's a,

897
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:32,720
it's an island that is an Ottoman Empire
fortress and there's 20 stages set up

898
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:37,670
here when they have this festival,
no cars allowed. Huge. I mean it is,

899
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:42,680
it is just mindblowingly enormous and
cool and everything was going so well.

900
00:50:42,681 --> 00:50:45,560
I'd been up for probably like
a day and a half partying,

901
00:50:45,561 --> 00:50:47,690
hanging out with my friends, drinking. Um,

902
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,170
we did some weird cameo on MTV Europe
where I didn't understand what they were

903
00:50:51,171 --> 00:50:54,050
saying to me,
but it didn't matter and I just,

904
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,340
I couldn't have been having more fun.

905
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:59,990
But there was a black jeep that started
rolling around the island towards when

906
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:03,860
everybody was getting done and they were
kind of inspecting people and looking

907
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:08,750
through the crowd and shining the light
on people as dawn broke and everyone has

908
00:51:08,751 --> 00:51:13,670
to leave on this bridge and walk on this
bridge. And so as we started to do that,

909
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:17,870
they stopped a friend of
mine and me and they said,

910
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:19,220
where are your passports?

911
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:23,120
Because in Serbia you have to carry your
passport with you everywhere you go.

912
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:23,960
If you're a foreigner,

913
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:27,500
you have to have your international
id with you no matter what.

914
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:30,080
I carried a copy because who's
going to carry their passport?

915
00:51:30,081 --> 00:51:33,500
You're going to lose it hold big thing.
So I carried a copy of my passport.

916
00:51:33,501 --> 00:51:35,870
That was not satisfactory.
So what did they do?

917
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:39,080
They called to make sure
that I was who I said I was.

918
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:42,440
But guess what happened when they called?
He's not registered.

919
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,020
We've been looking for him.
Whoops.

920
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:48,860
Also to add a little bit of something
else, something special to the pot.

921
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,630
My friend had a bit of a checkered past
where he was related to an organized

922
00:51:53,631 --> 00:51:57,880
crime figure from his family and they
had moved and then he came back to hang

923
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:01,640
out in Serbia. So these guys figure
we've hit the frigging jackpot. You know,

924
00:52:01,641 --> 00:52:06,140
we've got an American spy who's basically
a fugitive and some mafiosos kid.

925
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:11,300
So at this point I think, great,
you know, we're going to jail,

926
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,720
hopefully not worse and make
things a little bit worse.

927
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:17,870
These guys were not sober.
These guys were on drugs.

928
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:20,270
And to put this into a
little bit of perspective,

929
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,510
Serbian state security
officers at this point in time,

930
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:25,490
they're not like the American FBI.

931
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:28,610
These are guys who fly in
militias and Bosnia or whatever.

932
00:52:28,611 --> 00:52:31,850
Their village got eradicated by
Cro ads or Bosniaks or whatever.

933
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,320
Now they live in Serbia.

934
00:52:33,321 --> 00:52:37,190
And in order to not be prosecuted for
war crimes or things that they did back

935
00:52:37,191 --> 00:52:38,330
there that were illegal,

936
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,800
they became agents of the state that
are above regular prosecution laws.

937
00:52:42,801 --> 00:52:46,760
So they basically just run around, do
whatever they want, except for any,

938
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,960
obviously not getting any therapy for
their PTSD and all of the things that are

939
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:54,650
causing them to be hammered
at 7:38 AM in the morning.

940
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:59,720
So they're slurring, they're not rational,
they're aggressive. And I'm thinking,

941
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:04,640
great, I'm going to get pistol whipped in
front of like 20,000 people and there's

942
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:08,570
nothing I can do about it. And my friend
is all doing the, the the classic,

943
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:11,960
let me talk my way out of this type thing.
And that's not going too well.

944
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:15,560
And I'm replying. Look man, I don't,
I'm not a fugitive, I'm not a criminal.

945
00:53:15,561 --> 00:53:19,910
I just teach refugees English and
I'm not, look, here's my passport.

946
00:53:19,911 --> 00:53:21,020
We can go get the real one.

947
00:53:21,021 --> 00:53:25,260
We'll go to the embassy and it'll make a
not a big deal out of it. And they were,

948
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:28,080
they thought that was an okay idea.
But first they had other ideas,

949
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:29,760
so they said get in the jeep.

950
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,940
And the problem is when you
speak a foreign language,

951
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:38,520
often those little connector words
like get in or get over are kind of

952
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:41,070
confusing. So when they said get
in the jeep, I thought, great,

953
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:42,030
I'm going to get in the jeep.

954
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,980
And it turned out that they meant get
on the jeep and what they meant I get on

955
00:53:46,981 --> 00:53:50,940
the jeep was that they didn't want me to
be inside because the back had a bunch

956
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:53,640
of rifles in it and a bag of Doritos,
which is kind of weird.

957
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,660
They didn't want me to sit there.

958
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:58,790
So me and my friend had to hang onto the
running boards and we're hanging onto

959
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,070
the side of the running boards and our
hand through the open sunroof of the jeep

960
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:05,040
and they're going pretty slowly at this
point to drive off this island where

961
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:08,280
there's no roads, no cars.
After we get over the bridge,

962
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,750
we start cruising a little bit and they
start throwing popcorn out through the

963
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:15,300
sunroof because I forgot to tell you this,

964
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,790
they robbed a popcorn vendor
before we left the venue.

965
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,940
So these guys are throwing the popcorn
up through the roof and they're trying to

966
00:54:20,941 --> 00:54:25,080
get us to catch it in our mouths
while we're driving on the highway.

967
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:27,720
We're going 40 miles an hour and
I'm thinking, oh, this is great.

968
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,940
I should just like a tuck
and roll or something. Right?

969
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,150
Except when you're going 40 miles an hour,
you're just kind of thinking,

970
00:54:33,151 --> 00:54:36,600
what part of me is going to fly off if
I do that? So no talking, no rolling.

971
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:41,730
Then I saw the flashing lights, flashing
lights. Thank God the police are here.

972
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,390
They're going to pull us over. They're
going to find out how ridiculous this is.

973
00:54:45,391 --> 00:54:47,910
They're going to cut us loose or they're
going to send it straight back to the

974
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:51,630
embassy. Worst case, I get deported.
I can live with that. Okay.

975
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:55,770
The problem is these guys unrolled their
window and did one of these and the

976
00:54:55,771 --> 00:54:58,980
cops turned their lights off and pulled
over to the side of the road because

977
00:54:58,981 --> 00:55:00,900
again,
black jeep government plates,

978
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,510
it doesn't matter if we're on the side
trying to catch popcorn like a couple of

979
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:07,950
clowns so that this point, I'm
starting to get really scared, right?

980
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:11,310
Because 15 minutes later we
pull up into this neighborhood,

981
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:15,630
small boarded up houses and little
things with like those, those shutters,

982
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:18,660
those metal grates are down over the
front. And I'm thinking, oh my God,

983
00:55:18,661 --> 00:55:20,820
this is serious.
This is not harmless fun.

984
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:24,540
This isn't just people having fun with
some tourists. This is the real deal.

985
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,530
And I'm cut off from the world and I
haven't been this scared since prom,

986
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:32,890
98 different story. And I'm like,
freaking out here. You know,

987
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:34,860
don't want to get out of
the jeep or off the jeep.

988
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,060
I don't want to get into the house.

989
00:55:36,061 --> 00:55:39,660
I don't want to go down to the basement
of the house. And the guy says, look,

990
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,920
get in there and everything's gonna be
okay. Pardon me if I don't believe you.

991
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:46,080
Okay.
But that was the message.

992
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,870
And at this point I'm scared. I don't
know what to do. Can't run anywhere.

993
00:55:51,871 --> 00:55:55,710
I've got nowhere to go.
So we go in, we sit down,

994
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:59,350
they're bashing my friend. And because
now he decided to play the Dune.

995
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,440
Do you know who my father is?
Game works every time. And, uh,

996
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,670
so I'm explaining, look,
I'm an English teacher man.

997
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:08,970
I teach 11 year old kids in refugees,
how to speak English. That is it.

998
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:13,530
They're calling bs on that. You're
a spy. You're a unregistered.

999
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,000
You're an unregistered foreign agent.

1000
00:56:15,001 --> 00:56:17,040
Nobody had heard of that until
Michael Flynn. Thanks Flynn.

1001
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:20,820
Not Don't have to explain that one
every time. So it's a no, you know,

1002
00:56:20,821 --> 00:56:22,980
we're on our way to Lipa.
It's got the best food in town.

1003
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,990
I heard they got the best food anywhere
in the city and he gets heated.

1004
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:29,530
This agent, it's heated and
incredulous and a little tense.

1005
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:31,390
A little too close to my face and says,

1006
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:35,320
obviously you don't know anything about
Serbian food if you think Lipa has the

1007
00:56:35,321 --> 00:56:38,680
best food in the city.
And I thought, all right,

1008
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:40,120
now we're on to something better here.

1009
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:42,910
What about his knocked Pete's
on Yon Belgrade, man, look,

1010
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:46,480
if you haven't tried stepping via to
you don't know anything about this and

1011
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:48,400
you're not qualified to
talk about Serbian foods.

1012
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:51,310
So I ask him what he
orders when he goes there.

1013
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:55,030
This is something that changes the energy
of the conversation. At Art of charm,

1014
00:56:55,031 --> 00:56:58,030
we call this changing the
frame of the conversation.

1015
00:56:58,031 --> 00:56:59,830
It goes from me being
interrogated by a crazy,

1016
00:56:59,831 --> 00:57:04,831
deranged drunk state state security
agent to a somewhat equal footing

1017
00:57:05,741 --> 00:57:08,170
discussion, if you will, on
Serbian food and culture,

1018
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,850
and the key is that I kept behaving like
I wasn't in trouble and that everything,

1019
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:16,600
even though he was enraged at certain
points, even totally irrationally,

1020
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,210
I'm remaining as completely
calm on the outside anyways,

1021
00:57:19,211 --> 00:57:22,810
I can obviously inside and freaking
out without any regard whatsoever,

1022
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,600
and I ask him, look man, what
are you order when you go there?

1023
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,340
I'm going to go there tonight. Wink, wink,

1024
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:31,300
right when I got out of here
and I'm setting that anchor,
man, let me Outta here.

1025
00:57:31,301 --> 00:57:33,910
I even invited him to go with us.
Seriously.

1026
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:38,740
Now this type of thing is called
the Benjamin Franklin effect.

1027
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,990
When you ask somebody for advice,
when you ask somebody for recommendations,

1028
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,000
they feel an affinity for you.

1029
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:49,510
They feel an affinity for
what you are representing.

1030
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:53,170
They feel an affinity for helping you
and it's a backwards rationalization that

1031
00:57:53,171 --> 00:57:56,680
they create in the brain. Benjamin
Franklin used this really, really well.

1032
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:59,350
He would borrow books from people that
hated him and they would become friends.

1033
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:01,960
That's why this is called
the Benjamin Franklin effect.

1034
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:06,730
So we started talking about a homebrew
liqueur called Rakia. And of course,

1035
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:10,060
the only thing that's Serbian people,
like more than talking about drinking,

1036
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:14,740
is drinking. So I said, I think
I could use a drink right now.

1037
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:17,560
It's about eight o'clock in the morning.
Don't judge me. Desperate times,

1038
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:18,394
desperate measures.

1039
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,070
So he gets up and you suddenly walks
out of the room and I'm thinking, okay,

1040
00:58:21,071 --> 00:58:25,690
great. This is my time. Activate
eighth grade taekwondo skills, uh,

1041
00:58:25,691 --> 00:58:29,260
wrestling, middle school wrestling.
Sure. Leg catch something, right?

1042
00:58:29,261 --> 00:58:32,560
And then Dee come out and run.
That's the plan. Sounds good, right?

1043
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,430
What could go wrong? And sometimes
the unknown is scarier than the known.

1044
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,890
You know, you don't know what's
going to happen. This guy's gone.

1045
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:40,690
I can hear my friend
and his butt kicked in.

1046
00:58:40,691 --> 00:58:43,810
The next room is getting punched in
the ever. I mean, it's just awful.

1047
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,090
I'm sitting there like to things saw,

1048
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:49,090
hadn't come out at this point or it
would have been losing it, right.

1049
00:58:49,091 --> 00:58:52,510
There's like sharp objects in there and
pipes coming out of the wall and these

1050
00:58:52,511 --> 00:58:53,620
little rusty things and I'm like,

1051
00:58:53,621 --> 00:58:56,410
that could get attached to a part
of my body if I'm not careful.

1052
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:59,530
So I could see him coming back and he's
got a club in his hand and I'm like,

1053
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,800
oh my God, this is how it ends,
you know? And I thought, all right,

1054
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:07,830
I've got about a whatever percent chance
of just getting away from this guy and

1055
00:59:07,901 --> 00:59:11,020
figuring out how to dodge it or
tackle him or something like that.

1056
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,930
And about 10 feet away from me,

1057
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,320
I realize it's not a club but a bottle
and it's a bottle of rocky up and he

1058
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:23,210
slams it down the table. He pours a couple
of glasses of his stuff and he says,

1059
00:59:23,211 --> 00:59:24,140
well,
you know,

1060
00:59:24,141 --> 00:59:26,690
we're just going to wait for your friend
and my friend to get done talking.

1061
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:30,200
And I thought, okay, well
look, I mean this is not nice,

1062
00:59:30,201 --> 00:59:31,880
but this is an airplane mask.

1063
00:59:31,881 --> 00:59:35,300
Situations like help yourself before
you help the other people next to you.

1064
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:39,410
So I'm wondering how I can get myself out
of this and get my friend out of this.

1065
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:41,390
But so far I'm pretty much out of ideas.

1066
00:59:41,391 --> 00:59:45,320
The first idea I have is drink that shot
and then regroup and then come up with

1067
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:49,160
a new plan. So I realize this
could still go sideways, right?

1068
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:52,070
This is still happening. We're, this
is a heated conversation, right?

1069
00:59:52,071 --> 00:59:56,690
We're going back and forth. And finally
I hear from the next room, hey, you know,

1070
00:59:56,691 --> 01:00:00,410
your friend has a big mouth. I'm shutting
it for him. How's it going over there?

1071
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,860
Right? And these guys don't really
know that I can understand Serbian.

1072
01:00:03,861 --> 01:00:05,570
So I figured this could really,

1073
01:00:05,571 --> 01:00:09,170
really be bad for my friend and it
could just as easily be bad for me.

1074
01:00:09,171 --> 01:00:12,680
This just right now I feel okay with it.
Right? And your brain wants to do that.

1075
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,440
It wants to think everything's gonna be
fine. Everything's gonna be all right.

1076
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:20,030
It doesn't necessarily mean it has any
basis in reality. So I said, look man,

1077
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:23,330
I feel really sick. You know,
I've been awake for a long time.

1078
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:28,220
You're feeding me this stuff. I'm stressed
out, I'm dehydrated. I just need water.

1079
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,490
And I know there's no water in there.
I know those rusty pipes have no water.

1080
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,660
I know they don't have any water.

1081
01:00:32,661 --> 01:00:35,630
I know the jeep doesn't probably have
any water because they finished the beers

1082
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:40,280
they were drinking as they drove
us to this place. So he goes,

1083
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:44,180
all right, stay here. And I said,
of course, where? Where would I go?

1084
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:48,200
So he gets up and he goes in the
other room and after a long time,

1085
01:00:48,201 --> 01:00:49,340
it feels like an eternity.

1086
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,090
I hear the jeep doors close
and I've realized they're gone.

1087
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,860
They left and I don't know
if they're coming back.

1088
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:58,820
So I grow and grabbed my friend, dude,
get up, we got to go. He's half limping,

1089
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,140
half being carried out of this place.

1090
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,860
And we go to a restaurant a few
hundred meters away, a few blocks away.

1091
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:08,330
And I know what we must have looked like
because we're covered in dirt and blood

1092
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:12,230
and popcorn and the waitress is coming
up and she goes, hi, how can I interest?

1093
01:01:12,231 --> 01:01:15,470
Immediately doesn't even
finish. The sentence starts
walking away and I thought,

1094
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:17,180
wow,
we look like zombies.

1095
01:01:17,181 --> 01:01:21,770
We look like zombies that were junkies
when they were alive and now are zombies.

1096
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:25,790
And so the police come, the regular
police, thank God who take us,

1097
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:27,140
get arrest us again,

1098
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:30,320
take us to a police station instead
of an underground torture chamber.

1099
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,780
So I'm still on, I'm still
ahead here. This is good. Right?

1100
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:36,380
And then at this point I
am getting interrogated by
the police captain and he's

1101
01:01:36,381 --> 01:01:39,620
just like, what is going,
where did you even come from?

1102
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:43,970
And this town looking like
this at this hour, what are,

1103
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,390
what is going on here? And my Serbians,
not that my smoking, Serbians,

1104
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,730
not that great.
Especially with a couple of booze,

1105
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:53,390
a bits of booze in me that
hour, no sleep. And I'm new.

1106
01:01:53,391 --> 01:01:54,860
I can understand more than I can speak.

1107
01:01:54,861 --> 01:01:58,040
That's how it goes with foreign languages.
So I asked him if he spoke German.

1108
01:01:58,041 --> 01:02:00,230
He spoke German and he said,
no, I don't speak German,

1109
01:02:00,231 --> 01:02:03,770
but my girlfriend is a German teacher.
Thank God. So I get on the phone with her,

1110
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:09,010
I'm on the phone in the police station
in Serbia telling a police captains

1111
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:10,460
girlfriend in German.

1112
01:02:10,461 --> 01:02:14,180
What happened to me when I got arrested
by their secret service telling her this

1113
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:18,230
ridiculous story left out the part
about robbing a popcorn vendor.

1114
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:23,010
And at first she's like,
okay, I'm not sure I believe
anything that you're saying,

1115
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,220
but she's a language teacher
and I'm a language teacher.

1116
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:29,880
I'm there to teach English. So I start
asking her, look, do you know my boss?

1117
01:02:29,881 --> 01:02:31,650
Do you know the person
who ran this convention?

1118
01:02:31,651 --> 01:02:35,250
Do you know the person who
wrote the textbook where I
did the English voiceover?

1119
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,240
Do you know the other teachers that I
met at these various mixers for teachers

1120
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,730
when I was teaching language in Belgrade?
And that is one,

1121
01:02:41,731 --> 01:02:45,590
her attitude changed since we had
these mutual connections. See,

1122
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:49,020
actually believe what was going on
here because she didn't know me,

1123
01:02:49,021 --> 01:02:50,250
but she knew people that knew me.

1124
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:51,263
Okay.

1125
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:56,540
Again, it's all about relationship.
She's not buying who I was.

1126
01:02:56,541 --> 01:03:00,810
He's not buying the story until she
buys who I was. So she's embarrassed.

1127
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:03,480
She's embarrassed on behalf
of the country. She tells
the police captain, look,

1128
01:03:03,481 --> 01:03:06,030
let us go. They cut us
loose, and they did,

1129
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:10,590
and were obviously look like we're up to
something covered. Drunk, covered a dirt,

1130
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,830
blood and popcorn.
And so as you can see,

1131
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:17,790
the advanced social skills that are taught
this rapport, this networking concept,

1132
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:20,490
the ABG big concepts that
we talked about today,

1133
01:03:20,491 --> 01:03:23,790
and the concepts that we teach at the
art of charm can not only help you keep

1134
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:27,030
your job, get a new job, start your
business, keep your side also going,

1135
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:28,980
or just help you advance
in your personal life.

1136
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:32,790
But they're actually the reason I'm still
kicking and talking to you here today,

1137
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,530
and that is my time.
Thank you so much.

1138
01:03:34,531 --> 01:03:37,440
This has been a real honor and
I appreciate your attention.
