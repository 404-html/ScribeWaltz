1
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,160
Hello, first thing to say
is thank you all for coming.

2
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:20,170
I should probably say that the turnout
today perhaps either reflects how amazing

3
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,740
my book is or the time of year and the
fact that everyone's starting to think

4
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:26,310
about productivity at
the start of January. So,

5
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,950
so welcome for the last,
uh,

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,510
just coming up to 10 years.

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,920
My life has been about obsessing
and thinking about the,

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,040
the subject of productivity.
I mean,

9
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:41,980
it started out because I myself had some
big holes in my own productivity and I

10
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:46,450
didn't do things particularly well and
I started to really go on a journey of

11
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:49,780
conquering that for myself and then
starting to falling into teaching other

12
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:50,880
people about what I learned and,

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,860
and teaching other people on how
they could start to develop their own

14
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:54,641
productivity as well.

15
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:58,360
So I'm going to talk to you about
some of the key ideas from my book,

16
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,450
how to be a productivity Ninja and
hopefully give you a few ideas and spark a

17
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:06,220
few thoughts that you can then take away
news practically to make some changes

18
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:07,150
to the way that you work.

19
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,760
So the first thing I want to talk about
is the fact that often there's a bit of

20
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:16,180
a fatigue around this whole subject
apart from obviously at the very start of

21
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:17,014
January.
Um,

22
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,950
and the reason for that is that I think
a lot of people have been familiar with

23
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:25,240
some of the key ideas and
techniques of time management.

24
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:28,150
You've probably been on some kind of time
management cause before just by a show

25
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:32,160
of hands who's been on some kind of
time management thing. Um, and uh,

26
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,130
keep your hand up if everything is now
fixed and it's all sorted and you're 100%

27
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:38,800
wonderful in the way that you
work. So I think, um, for me,

28
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:43,310
time management is broken, time
management is dead. And I think, um,

29
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,930
the flip side of that is to start to think
much more about the idea of attention

30
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:50,590
management. So rather than thinking about
how we manage our, our tie, our time,

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,770
when you think about attention as being
the most precious resource that we have,

32
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:56,920
and how can we get the best out of those
times that we have the best attention.

33
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:57,550
Um,

34
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,340
so I'm going to talk to you about nine
things that you can do that really help

35
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:05,290
you to make the best of your attention.
Have nine different mindsets,

36
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,920
nine ways of thinking that will really
help you to become a productivity Ninja

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,330
and really help you to move forward in
terms of some of those turning some of

38
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:16,420
those older time management ideas into
something a bit more modern and a bit

39
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:19,300
more based in the world
that we live in today. Um,

40
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,760
so the first one of
those is zen like calm.

41
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,810
So often when I'm asked to
talk about productivity,

42
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,070
one of the questions that I ask back
is when was the time that you were most

43
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:30,611
productive?

44
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:33,850
So just if you think for a few moments
about when was the last time that you

45
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:37,450
really felt yes, I'm really
on top of this. This is a
moment of key productivity.

46
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,880
Often when people think
about that question,

47
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,210
the one of the answers that comes up
a lot is when I was on a deadline.

48
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,690
So you're on this deadline, you've
got this thing to do, it's five,

49
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:47,770
it's got to be in at five o'clock.

50
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:51,040
You've got this deadline and everything
else in your life and everything else in

51
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,240
your brain seems to fall away.

52
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:55,090
And you get into what
psychologists refer to as flow.

53
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,710
This kind of state of being totally
in the moment focused one thing.

54
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,810
You're not thinking about what you're
going to have for dinner that evening.

55
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,040
You're not thinking about emails,

56
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,400
you're just totally you in that zone
working on whatever that thing is,

57
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:08,410
whether it's a document,
whether it's ideas,

58
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:10,000
whether it's a thing that
you're doing as a team,

59
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,570
but everybody's just kind of focused or
you're just really focused on getting

60
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:14,710
this thing delivered and,

61
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,180
and that becomes the only thing in your
world at that point. Um, now for me,

62
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:22,270
the problem with that is that
deadlines are really expensive.

63
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,160
They cost us in terms of stress.

64
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,430
We start to love the people kind of
getting out of the way of the camera that

65
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,420
love it. Um, so at deadline
we'll really, uh, you know,

66
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,340
it will cost you a lot in terms of stress.

67
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,820
If you're constantly in deadlines and
you're constantly using deadlines is the

68
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:42,880
thing that gets you over the line with
stuff and you're leaving everything to

69
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:44,770
the last minute and letting
the deadline push you forward.

70
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,400
Then after a while you're going
to burn out. Whereas really, what,

71
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,890
what is the deadline doing anyway?
So what a deadline does is it,

72
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,640
it brings you into this state of Zen,
like calm.

73
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,540
It forces you to say this
is the most important thing.

74
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,400
I know that nothing else matters.

75
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,430
And my contention is you can get to
that place of saying this is the most

76
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:02,860
important thing.
Nothing else matters without a deadline.

77
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,460
And what you need to do to get to there
is much clearer thinking in terms of

78
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:09,220
what's on my plate so that you're really
much clearer about your priorities.

79
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:11,410
So I'm gonna talk to you a
bit about how to get there,

80
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:14,380
but the idea is to spend as much time
as possible in this state of Zen,

81
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:18,940
like calm state of flow. And this
state of I'm working on one thing.

82
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:22,300
I really know what I'm doing. I'm really
clear and focused on that one thing.

83
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,210
This is how a lot of us do spend a
lot of time in work, which is that we,

84
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:32,260
our brains are just full of different
ideas. Um, does this image look familiar?

85
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:37,261
So we have this whole sense of feeling
overloaded and overwhelmed and we have

86
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:40,060
the sense of there's a hundred
things we could be doing.

87
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,170
We're not quite sure where to start.
Um,

88
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,320
David Allen who wrote the book getting
things done has this lovely line,

89
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:46,960
which is the mind is for having
ideas not for holding them.

90
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,410
So the problem is if you've got all these
different things going on in your head,

91
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,930
then it becomes very difficult to get
to this state of zen like calm cause you

92
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:55,480
just totally thinking, oh that email,
that thing. You know, your, your,

93
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,400
your brain is constantly moving
from one thing to another,

94
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:01,260
trying to work out where were the
biggest priority might be. Um,

95
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,890
in any given moment. Um, it never
used to be this complicated. So,

96
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,150
um, Peter Drucker talked
about this idea of um, uh,

97
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,050
knowledge work in the information age.
So moving from the industrial agents,

98
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,140
the information age and what Peter Drucker
was very concerned with was defining

99
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:18,070
knowledge work.
Um,

100
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,330
you all in this room are knowledge workers
and what that means is you add value

101
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:25,990
and you create value out of information.
That wasn't always how we worked.

102
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:27,370
So back in the industrial age,

103
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:28,750
you might have had a job that
looks something like this.

104
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:30,100
So there's a cake factory,

105
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:33,030
there's a big conveyor belt and there's
cakes coming down the conveyor belt.

106
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,490
You've got a big box of cherries and your
job is to put one cherry on each cake.

107
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,150
So you do that nine to five, you
put cherries on cakes, nine to five,

108
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:42,100
you have your break at lunchtime,
you have a break in the morning,

109
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:43,660
break in the afternoon,
you go home at five o'clock.

110
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,440
How many people in that job putting
cherries on cakes? Nine to five.

111
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:51,160
We'd be going home of an evening and
Thinking, Oh, the cherries today.

112
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:56,080
It just went crazy.
All sat there on a Sunday evening.

113
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,720
And you're thinking to, I have no
idea how it's going to go next week,

114
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:04,310
it's going to be mental. So
it's very easy in, you know,

115
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,400
that kind of a job to know
exactly what does done look like,

116
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,920
what does the end look like,
what does success look like?

117
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,470
Whereas in knowledge work jobs, it's
much more difficult and not as many jobs.

118
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:15,350
It's much more about
how we define success,

119
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,070
how we define those particular
things that that make the difference.

120
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,731
And you know,

121
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:22,310
maybe your viewpoint is slightly
different from your bosses viewpoint and

122
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,010
there's all these competing
priorities at the same time.

123
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,520
So really one of the hardest things
to really acknowledge and to, and,

124
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,520
and one of the things we really got to
take into account when we're trying to

125
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:34,690
get into this state of zen like calm is
this idea that we're similar Tennessee,

126
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,090
the boss and the worker all at
the same time. So by the way,

127
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:41,390
all of you have to put cherries on cakes.
That is part of what you do. Those,

128
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,930
those cherries on cakes are
the emails that you send,

129
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,980
the meetings that you set up.
The things that you deliver,

130
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,720
you are all putting shows on cakes.

131
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,500
And the trouble is you're also having to
decide what time should the shift start

132
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:54,800
today and how fast should the conveyor
belt pick be going and all these other

133
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:57,170
questions. And having to think
strategically about, you know,

134
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:57,751
what's going on in the,

135
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,260
in the wider world is that everyone's
thinking about healthy eating.

136
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:02,960
So maybe we should take these cherries
and make fruit cocktails with them

137
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:03,651
instead.
You know,

138
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:07,250
so we're having to make all these
intuitive judgments at the same time as

139
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:08,150
delivering on work.

140
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:11,210
So it was similar tendency of the boss
and the workers all at the same time.

141
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,830
And really getting into that,

142
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,490
that state of sunlight car I'm getting
to a state of being able to deliver in a

143
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:19,370
really focused way involves
doing that boss thinking first.

144
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,480
Like really getting to grips with and
defining what's on my plate so that I can

145
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:26,480
then make the best decisions in
that moment and do the best work

146
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,880
so slightly,
um,

147
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,380
sort of different energy to follow
ruthlessness to follow on that time.

148
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,880
It would be Ruth. So almost like the
opposite energy from sunlight car. Um,

149
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,430
so the second of my nine coaches, six his
ruthlessness and, um, a lot of people,

150
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:44,270
when I put this slide up,

151
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:48,320
they start to conjure up images of like
Gordon Gekko in Wall Street or, um,

152
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,140
Leonardo Dicaprio in the wolf of
Wall Street, kind of, you know,

153
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:53,360
bowling with dwarves and all this
kind of stuff. And it's like,

154
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,460
so I'm not talking about stuff
that is, um, you know, uh,

155
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,450
you know, sort of very unkind
or, or really aggressive.

156
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,860
But we have to really think
about ruthlessness in terms
of how we define tasks,

157
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,450
how we defined what we're working on,

158
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,660
and just our own mindsets
around all this stuff. Um,

159
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:14,960
so the first thing is to be
really ruthless with yourself.

160
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,940
Really start to really think about
how many things do I have on my plate?

161
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,730
What are the things that really are going
to make the most difference and what

162
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:25,880
are the really good things that I should
be doing that I'm going to say no to?

163
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,300
So, you know, most people are, um,

164
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,010
very well able to say no to the
stuff that doesn't really matter.

165
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,010
It doesn't mean that we don't sometimes
spend time doing things that doesn't

166
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:35,760
really matter, but it's, you know,

167
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:39,740
it's sometimes really the trick is saying
no to really good stuff as well. Um,

168
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,260
so Warren Buffett has a lovely quote,

169
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:45,950
which is the difference between successful
people and very successful people is

170
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:49,970
that very successful people say no to
almost everything. And for me, you know,

171
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:54,800
this sense of being really tight and
defined around your role and what you're

172
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:59,280
working on and saying no to stuff that
perhaps sounds like a really good idea.

173
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,880
Um, you know, learning the art
is, is really, really important.

174
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,570
Um, also just being ruthless with
ourselves. So recognizing when we are, um,

175
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,900
in that sense of procrastinating.
I'm so, you know,

176
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:17,901
who turns on Facebook or
whatsapp or Instagram on your
phone or on your computer

177
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:21,780
like you do. So getting ruthless
with how you manage yourself on that.

178
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:25,120
And I'll talk a little bit more about
how to manage, manage attention and,

179
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:27,120
and some of the stuff that we can
do and that I'm in a few minutes,

180
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:30,540
but really getting Rufus to put
ourselves in that right frame of mind,

181
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,840
that right zone for productivity
and really starting to,

182
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,490
to be strict with ourselves sometimes
to get the right kind of work done. Um,

183
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,420
and then this one is really key.
So I think for me,

184
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:45,480
I mentioned the beginning that time
is not your most precious resource.

185
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,310
Attention is your most precious resource.

186
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,220
So in the book I talk about these
three different modes of attention.

187
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,450
So I think we have three
modes of attention. The
first is proactive attention.

188
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,820
This is the two to three hours a day
where we have the best energy and the best

189
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:03,210
ability to do our best work. And so when
you really start to think about it and,

190
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:07,170
and, and track this stuff and
just reflect on your own work, um,

191
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,760
every period of time,
let's say a couple of weeks,

192
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:12,120
you'll start to notice real kind of trends
and sort of peaks and troughs in your

193
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:12,721
energy levels.

194
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:15,690
So there's a time when you're sat at
your desk and you feel totally able,

195
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,750
totally focused, able to do the
really most difficult stuff.

196
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,590
So that's proactive attention on
the other end of the scale. Um,

197
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,280
who's had a time in your day where perhaps
you're sort of looking at the screen,

198
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:29,610
you're scrolling up and down on the
email inbox or whatever, and you know,

199
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:31,230
it's like the lights are on,
but no one's home.

200
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,750
It's like four o'clock in
the afternoon and you know,

201
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,850
so that's managing time really,
while you're in the right place,

202
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:36,361
doing the right thing.

203
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:39,810
But actually you don't have the
right level of attention to do really

204
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:41,480
sophisticated work at that point.
Um,

205
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,530
and there's loads of science
behind this too, right?

206
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:46,350
So there's loser science around willpower
and willpower is a dwindling resource

207
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:47,490
each day.
Um,

208
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:50,280
so it stands to reason that there will
be a point in your day where you have the

209
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:51,114
best energy,

210
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,480
that proactive attention and also pointing
the day we have inactive attention

211
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,280
and the bit in the middle
is called active attention.

212
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,340
So that's just kind of the bit in the
middle of where you can do some stuff that

213
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:02,130
you can't do everything. There's certain
things that you can do during that time.

214
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,900
Another problem is that proactive
attention often comes at points in the day

215
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,840
where other people want to
take our attention away.

216
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,640
Other people want to
scramble our attention.

217
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,990
And so we have to get really ruthless
with how we protect that proactive

218
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:20,160
attention. Um, so if you think about it
as being two to three hours a day, um,

219
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,160
most of the studies that have been done
on this say that that's generally for

220
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,020
most people in the morning
rather than the afternoon.

221
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:26,780
There are of course exceptions to that.
Um,

222
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,960
but that morning time where people tend
to have that practice of attention is

223
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:32,100
also the time where it's like,
okay,

224
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:35,850
so I'm just going to spend this just
warming up for the day or like I'm in

225
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:38,040
someone else's meeting or like
something else is going on.

226
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:42,090
And so often there are so many forces
that can just take the attention away from

227
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:43,590
us from basically scramble our attention.

228
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,460
So getting ruthless with protecting those
times and knowing when those times are

229
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,590
key for you. Uh, so for example,

230
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:53,560
like personally I have a bit of a policy
which is I don't do meetings in the

231
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:54,790
morning and phone calls in the morning.

232
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,780
So like my morning is like the heads down,

233
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,950
proactive attention time and the afternoon
is the more kind of collaborative

234
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:00,784
time.

235
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,900
And that's kind of easy for me to say
because I control my own diary and I get

236
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:07,090
that there are lots of
other factors at play there.

237
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:09,970
But even if it's just looking at
one or two hours a day and saying,

238
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:13,280
I'm going to Ruth as you try and protect
that time. And that can make a big,

239
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:16,060
big difference. Because in my
experience, most of Sydney,

240
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:17,850
most of my best work
and what I observe in,

241
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:19,310
in everyone else that
they work with is that,

242
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,420
that proactive attention that the
stuff that you do in those one, two,

243
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:25,120
three hours of the day,
that that really makes a difference.

244
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,190
Like that's the stuff that
you'll get judged for.

245
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:29,950
All the other stuff really is kind of
filling in all the kind of emails and

246
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,420
conversations and everything else.

247
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:33,310
The stuff that really makes
you famous in your job,

248
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,810
the stuff that really makes it impacts,

249
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,850
tends to happen in those
two to three hours a day.

250
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,650
So the third one comes
about his weapons savvy.

251
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:45,030
So obviously a Ninja has to
have weapons and tools. Um,

252
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,950
it's fun to geek out and have,
um, uh, you know, lots of, uh,

253
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,860
interesting kind of conversations with
other productivity geeks about like

254
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:55,390
different apps and all this kind of stuff.

255
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:58,360
But like really we have to be
savvy about how we use tools,

256
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,240
how we make the best of
all the tools that we have.

257
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,340
So on the little iPad there,
you've got like a few different tools.

258
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,070
The tool I use most
regularly is called nausea.

259
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,150
Nausea is basically a to do list APP,
very sophisticated to do list APP. Um,

260
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,260
that really allows me to manipulate
the data within my to do list. Um,

261
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,400
really well. I can look at it by
the project view project by project,

262
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,060
what am I working on?

263
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,670
I can look at it by where am I
going to be to do certain things.

264
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,560
I can categorize stuff, I can put date
reminders and all that sort of thing. Um,

265
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,630
so just like slightly more functionality
than a lot of them were basic to do

266
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:35,440
list apps. Um, other ones you'll find that
things like to do is remember the milk.

267
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,980
Um, really good apps. Most of them
have a kind of freemium model as well,

268
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:42,670
so you can get most of what you need from
the kind of free version and then you

269
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:44,980
pay a bit more if you want the
kind of subscription version. Um,

270
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,370
but one of the things I'd recommend is
really thinking about having some kind of

271
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:51,910
APP, um, that you're going
to use for your to do list.

272
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,660
And that then synchronizes with your
computer, with your phone, with an Ipad,

273
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,690
whatever you're using, um, across
those different devices and platforms,

274
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:01,060
but gives you that ability to,

275
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,030
to really kind of prioritize and think
clearly around the work that you're doing.

276
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,900
Um, so thinking about if you're
going to use any apps at all,

277
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,870
think about what you're gonna use
for what I called the second brain.

278
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,220
So your own brain is not particularly
great at holding onto and remembering all

279
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:19,180
that different data. So having a second
brain where you put all that stuff out,

280
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,430
you know, out on the page as
it were, like inside the APP,

281
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:24,550
and you start to see projects and actions
and start to be able to kind of move

282
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:26,260
those things around and
prioritize these things.

283
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,410
And that's really the kind of best
use of technology that you can have.

284
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:33,250
There's loads of other really
useful apps that I use, but for me,

285
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:35,980
like getting really honed around
a really good second brain,

286
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,220
a kind of app for me, makes
the biggest difference. Um,

287
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,570
I want to just like for a few
minutes just about email. Um, so, um,

288
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,330
who loves their email inbox?
Just suppose show of hands.

289
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,250
So a couple of hands. Uh, so for me email,

290
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,400
it's one of those things that has just
sort of pervaded work over the last few

291
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:55,850
years.
Um,

292
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,670
I don't need to tell you that you get a
lot of emails and the email is annoying.

293
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,710
That's kind of a given.
Um,

294
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:04,620
so I've over the last few years
been a big proponent of a,

295
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:08,540
a thing called inbox zero. The idea of
getting your inbox down to zero. Um,

296
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,180
and I think that's often
misunderstood thing. I think, um,

297
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,720
the idea of inbox zero,
um,

298
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,650
is not that you have your inbox at zero
all the time and that like you spend

299
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,180
every minute of the day
when one email comes in,

300
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:23,270
you have to kind of bat it away
and like leave it a zero. For me,

301
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:27,020
it's more of a mindset that says email
is just the medium that we communicate

302
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:30,320
through. Maybe it's not actually
where most of the best work gets done.

303
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:34,250
So inbox zero is really a way of kind of
hacking that problem in order that you

304
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:36,170
can get outside of the
inbox as much as possible.

305
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,320
The real work for me happens
outside of the email inbox. Um,

306
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,140
even when you're communicating via email,
you know,

307
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,420
really what's the stuff that's
really making a difference.

308
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:46,700
It's the impact of those two
people having conversations.

309
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:50,360
And if you had that same conversation
face to face or had that constant,

310
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:52,460
the same conversation over the phone,
you'd still get to the same results.

311
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:54,390
So email is always just the medium.
Um,

312
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,730
some people get very bogged down in
the idea of like email is their job and

313
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:02,180
email is the one thing they need to be
doing. And for me actually like, you know,

314
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:05,570
amazing things happen when you start
to get outside of your email inbox. Um,

315
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,400
just a very quick overview.

316
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:10,790
There's a whole chapter in the book that
talks about how to get your email inbox

317
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:14,600
to zero. My company, you think productive
runs, um, three hour workshops.

318
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,230
And what I've tried to do is take that
three hour workshop and put it into that

319
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:22,430
chapter of the book. So if you
spend about 45 minutes to an hour,

320
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:25,010
just kind of reading that chapter
with your email in front of you,

321
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:28,310
and then about an hour going through the
stuff that it says your inbox will be

322
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:31,280
at zero. Like we did a, we did some, uh,

323
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,150
like stats over our three hour workshop
and we found that 96% of people in that

324
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:37,490
three hours left the room
with their inbox at zero.

325
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:41,210
So it doesn't take you anywhere near
as long as you think what it does mean.

326
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,800
Like for the most part, people have
their email inbox open in front of them,

327
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:48,020
but they're also working on lots
of other things at the same, right.

328
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,210
It's the same time, right? So like for me,

329
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,470
when you get really focused around
just email, you can actually start to,

330
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,380
you know, hack some of that stuff away,
delete anything that's older than,

331
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,110
you know, a few days or whatever. And
you really start to get to zero very,

332
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:01,860
very quickly.
Um,

333
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,540
next one I'll talk about is I'm a
thing called stealth and camouflage.

334
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:10,400
A Ninja has to be, uh, able to get
slightly off the grid at different times.

335
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:14,510
So the main part of this song, it's
about his tactical hiding. Okay.

336
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,240
So, um, you guys are very used to
working in a very kind of open plan,

337
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:21,890
open kind of culture.
Um,

338
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,210
I think there's some really nice
benefits to that for sure. Um,

339
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:30,530
it also has some limitations and one of
those limitations probably as you're sat

340
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:32,900
here listening to me, one of the
things you're thinking is, well,

341
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:35,390
it's all very well for him. He probably
like works Lowe's at the time on his own.

342
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:38,780
He doesn't have less people interrupting
him at his desk all the time. Um,

343
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,350
and you know, I get this complaint a lot
from people saying, you know, I just,

344
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,900
I really want to get my head down. I
really want to get into that kind of Zen,

345
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:46,400
like calm kind of modes.

346
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,410
But actually the thing that's really
stopping me is someone comes and me a

347
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:52,140
question and then I get loads, more emails
and loads of other stuff's going on.

348
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,880
Um, so really thinking about how we can
avoid that. And I often say to people,

349
00:17:56,881 --> 00:17:57,451
you know,
if you're,

350
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,400
if you're feeling like you're
being interrupted the whole time,

351
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,510
make yourself just deliberately less
available for some people that's going to

352
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:04,980
work from a coffee shop around the corner,

353
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,580
finding little cupboard somewhere where
no one's going to find you a, you know,

354
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:11,070
whatever that looks like.
But just trying to again,

355
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,920
protect those two to three hours of time,
proactive attention,

356
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:17,010
time to really kind of get down and get
your head down and get really kind of

357
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:21,890
focused on things. And it doesn't have to
just be a physical thing as well. So, um,

358
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,920
stuff that camouflage in a more kind of
digital sense and both outlook and Gmail

359
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:27,630
both have a function of work offline,

360
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,900
which I think it's just a
criminally underused thing.

361
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,850
The amount of times I'll say to people,
do you use work offline?

362
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:34,230
And people don't tend to use it.

363
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:37,410
But just the idea of that is that you
can work on the stuff that's in front of

364
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:40,140
you. You can see the emails, you can
see the calendar, whatever it is,

365
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,860
but actually what you,
uh,

366
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,900
don't have is the kind of
new notifications coming in
and the new emails coming

367
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:47,910
in.
So just using that work offline thing,

368
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,720
really nice way to just kind of slightly
make yourself less available and

369
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:55,830
slightly kind of, you know, get into
more of a kind of focus mood. Uh,

370
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,710
this one here is an app called
forest, um, who's come across forest.

371
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,820
Any forest fans in a
few. Good, good. So, um,

372
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,390
Forrest is a really nice
little app for, for focus. Um,

373
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,760
so the idea is that you set a period of
time, says, let's say it's 20 minutes,

374
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:09,341
half an hour,
and you say,

375
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:11,280
I'm going to really get my head
down and focus on this one thing.

376
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,580
Often the thing that gets in the way it's
like is just, Oh, what's on my phone,

377
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,920
right? Let me pick up my phone and have
a look and see what's going on there.

378
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,970
And so what does is it starts to build
a tree. So you've got this 20 minutes,

379
00:19:20,971 --> 00:19:24,870
half an hour, it's, it's building
this tree. If during that 20 minutes,

380
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:25,431
half an hour it,

381
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:28,400
you attempted to pick up your phone and
go and look at Twitter or Facebook or

382
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:32,580
whatever the tree dies, right? So,

383
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:41,310
so really kind of smaller. I think
all it's doing is putting one tiny,

384
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:44,250
tiny little kind of positive
reason to not look at your phone.

385
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,970
I'm in competition with all those kinds
of other things that are going on in

386
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:50,280
your head and it's remarkably effective.

387
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:54,650
The other thing about forest is that as
a company, they invest some of their,

388
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,820
their profits in planting real trees.

389
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,480
So you can actually get a real guilt
right from like the tree dying.

390
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:04,080
It's a real tree. You have to think about
it in that way. Um, but really nice app,

391
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,520
there's a whole new chapter.

392
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,120
The updated version of the book has a
whole chapter called stop messing about on

393
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:09,630
your phone.

394
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,630
And one of the things that it talks about
is basically treating yourself like a

395
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:15,570
kid. Um, for those two to three
hours of practice of attention.

396
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:20,040
So I have an APP on my android
phone, it's called quality time. Uh,

397
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,500
there's some other iPhone
equivalent to that of it as well.

398
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,600
But basically what quality time does is
it allows me to set scheduled breaks.

399
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,390
So in that schedule break, it's
like in, in that two to three hours,

400
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,790
these are the things that I
can now access on my phone.

401
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,860
Everything else on my phone
is locked for that time.

402
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,210
So this kind of two to three hours of the
day, I have no access to Google chrome.

403
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,180
I have no access to Instagram,
I have no access to Twitter.

404
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,940
All those things are locked down.
They are unavailable.

405
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,530
If I want to get them back,

406
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,530
then what I have to do is I have to
cancel the scheduled break and the clock

407
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:53,770
starts ticking. Five minutes, four
minutes, 59, four minutes, 58.

408
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,960
Usually as you watch
that clock ticking down,

409
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:59,020
it's got to get all the way to zero before
you're allowed to turn the thing off.

410
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,510
I'm usually, that's long enough
years ago. Ah, screw this.

411
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,030
I'm not going to sit around for
five minutes waiting for the thing.

412
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,830
So it just tends to be,
again,

413
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:09,640
just a nice piece of psychology that keeps
you locked away from those things for

414
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:12,170
those times and just gives you
that kind of extra focus. Um,

415
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,500
and obviously the more you
know basic version of that,

416
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:15,750
it's just using the airplane mode,

417
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,580
just using the do not disturb
kind of features of the phone. Um,

418
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,790
just to keep some of that stuff in a
more kind of stuff and camouflage kind of

419
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,870
mode the same. I think it can
be applied to people as well.

420
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:28,850
So actually just having conversations
in your team, you know, um,

421
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,540
like what's the time where I really
need to get my head down and focus?

422
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,980
What are the times when
you need to do that?

423
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,740
How can we kind of share
those responsibilities and
make that happen for each

424
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:38,530
other? How can we do that within
the teams? So just for me,

425
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:41,440
I feel like when I go into
organizations often it's,

426
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,500
it's really amazing to me how many of
those conversations are just left unsaid.

427
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,620
And it sort of builds up in
bubbles up intentional ever.

428
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:49,060
But really it never gets put on the table.

429
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:51,910
Like what's the expectation around email?

430
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,440
What's the expectation
around my attention?

431
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:57,190
Like people don't have those conversations
is as often as perhaps we need to do

432
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,260
that.
Um,

433
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:03,400
next one gets about is unorthodoxy I'm
just doing things differently thinking in

434
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:04,850
a very different way.
Um,

435
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,010
I think that's probably fairly self
evident coming into Google to talk about

436
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:12,130
that. But you know, just I, I
go into so many companies were,

437
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,760
what really happens a lot is that people
spend a lot of time looking at their

438
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:19,480
direct competitors, looking at the,
the direct market that they're there,

439
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:23,170
they're in or around and trying to get
inspiration from what everybody else in

440
00:22:23,171 --> 00:22:24,040
their sector is doing.

441
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:27,160
And I'm a huge fan of just looking way
beyond that and just kind of thinking,

442
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,930
how would someone else solve this problem?

443
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,180
How would someone else do that
piece of thinking? How so,

444
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:33,310
how would someone else to
communicate those kind of ideas.

445
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,990
So thinking about it from them,
you know,

446
00:22:34,991 --> 00:22:38,710
the point of view of someone very
principled like Malala or how would you

447
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:41,970
explain this problem to a really
curious intelligence six year olds?

448
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,640
So just thinking about those kinds of
different ways to approach that same idea

449
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:48,400
or that same piece of thinking
and coming up with a solution.

450
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,880
The other thing around, um, an
orthodoxy is experimentation. So, um,

451
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,680
I'm a big believer that all of us are
very stuck in ruts with our own habits and

452
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:01,960
the way that we work.
So a couple of years ago I did this thing,

453
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,250
I did 12 extreme productivity
experiments and one for each month.

454
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,570
And the idea was to just challenge
all of my initial assumptions around

455
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:12,070
productivity and the way I worked.

456
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,310
So I did things like one was
called flipping the nine to five.

457
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:20,080
So I worked five til 9:00 AM and then
clocked off for the day at 9:00 AM I did

458
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:21,550
the same five to 9:00 PM.

459
00:23:21,551 --> 00:23:23,440
So I had the whole day and then
have my four hours of work.

460
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,290
And what was incredible
about that was, um, you know,

461
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:29,890
I only had four hours a day and I thought
I was like super focused and super

462
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:31,900
productive already.
But having these,

463
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,920
there's this limitation of four hours
really maybe think twice about some of the

464
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:36,520
things I was doing.

465
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,520
I think constraints is always a really
beautiful thing to really get us to a

466
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,180
much stronger sense of focus.

467
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,970
I still use some of the kind of lessons
from that one. Um, I also tried one a,

468
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,820
which was a working an hour a day,
seven days a week.

469
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,710
So literally like one hour bursts,

470
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,390
but seven days a week just to
see how that would feel. Um,

471
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,660
it turns out I was really
stressed for like post, uh,

472
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,780
you do need more than an
hour a day. Generally. It
depends on what you're doing.

473
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,741
I did one,

474
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:05,660
which was whenever I feel clear about
decision or I'm slightly procrastinating

475
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:08,720
about a decision,
I made that decision by the throw of dice.

476
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,090
So what that meant is I
had to come up with one.

477
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,860
I had to come up with basically like
a two or three or six. Uh, different,

478
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,820
uh, like answers to the question and
then, you know, so sometimes, you know,

479
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:21,620
if you're really stuck with something,

480
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,380
being forced to come up with six different
ways of thinking about it just helps

481
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:27,110
you to open up your brain and kind of
think about things in a different way.

482
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,840
The other thing about that one was it
was really amazing to be able to detach

483
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,970
ego from decisions. It's like, well, I
didn't decide that the dice did, you know,

484
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,250
three different thing. Um,
but just I think, you know,

485
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,550
I say that because not
necessarily expecting you to
go back to your bosses and

486
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:44,360
say, I just want to work an hour
a day. Um, but I think for me,

487
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:49,540
doing those kind of experiments from
extremity is a really nice way to then get

488
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:53,240
back to some kind of sense of normality.
But with new learning,

489
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,480
I think often learning comes from these
extreme things that comes when you're

490
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:58,550
outside of your comfort zone. Um, and I,

491
00:24:58,551 --> 00:25:01,820
I learned so much by doing that and I
think we can do those things really simply

492
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:04,940
in our day to day, you know. So just
getting off the bus or the tube,

493
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:08,000
like a stop early and just kind of
exploring the area for 10 minutes before

494
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:09,680
where it just puts your brain
in a really different thing.

495
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,850
It gets you out of this sense of everyday
starts the same way and every day he

496
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:15,350
has this like certain rhythm to it.

497
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,560
So if you're someone that always gets
into the office and the first thing you're

498
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:20,180
doing is on your phone,
on your email,

499
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:23,330
like try having the first two hours with
no phone and no email and just see what

500
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:24,170
that's like.
Um,

501
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,440
if you're someone who usually solves the
thing by getting up a document on the

502
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:29,360
screen and try and doing it,
just pen and paper.

503
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:33,530
So sometimes just those really tiny
little changes in habitually how we work

504
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,900
could just make a huge difference to
the way we think about certain things it

505
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,830
takes when you talk about is agility.
So this idea of um,

506
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,890
a zen like calm and,

507
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:47,240
and a lot of the ideas around a second
brain and having autonomy around our work,

508
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,600
they can be really compromised
where suddenly there's a
big fire that we have to

509
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:53,000
fight. There's some big thing going
on and we have to react to that.

510
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,980
So I'd say around that is,
you know,

511
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,890
we have to be really aware of where
those things might be coming from,

512
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,400
but also having a really good
starting point. If you're not in,

513
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:02,810
if you don't feel right now,

514
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,260
like you're in some kind of big
firefighting emergency kind of modes,

515
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,170
one of the best things you can be
doing is really taking stock in,

516
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:12,440
like getting clear on what you are working
on because you know that some other

517
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:14,870
emergency will come along,
there will be another fire.

518
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:18,650
So like getting to a place where you
really know what you're working on and

519
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:20,210
getting real clarity around that stuff,

520
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,370
it makes it much easier
to drop those things.

521
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,500
It makes it much easier when your
boss comes in and says, right,

522
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,840
can you work on this for
three days? It's like, well,

523
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:29,180
I can drop all that because this
is what I was working on before.

524
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,340
We all agree that this is
the more important thing.

525
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,730
So getting that kind of sense of,
um,

526
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,140
sort of clarity and being
organized around your work, um,

527
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,240
is just the most useful thing at the
point where a crisis hits because it's the

528
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:42,920
time when you really
need to know what you're,

529
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,920
and being able to do that in a more,
in a way that kind of feels more, um,

530
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,320
you know, just more comfortable and,
and you're, you're more able to,

531
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:53,250
to know what you're going to leave behind.
Um,

532
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,390
it can often be a sort of point of crisis
that really where we really start to,

533
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,630
uh, just look at the small things and
kind of sweat the small stuff rather than

534
00:27:00,631 --> 00:27:01,830
really kind of thinking much bigger.

535
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,700
So the other thing is just habitually to
really be thinking what could be on the

536
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:09,430
radar. Like really thinking about that
kind of future. Uh, you know, like, uh,

537
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,270
what might be coming up and anticipating
problems before they happen.

538
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Usually just the best
way to solve problems is,

539
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:17,760
is to try and nip them in the bud and
not let these things become big things.

540
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,150
And the other thing about agility is
just to dispel the myth of multitasking.

541
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:27,060
I was talking about, uh, talking about
this with somebody just before we started.

542
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:27,510
Um,

543
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:30,210
a lot of the old time management books
you said talking about the holy grail is

544
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:30,841
multitasking.

545
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:34,290
Like do two things at the same time and
then you'll be much more productive. Um,

546
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:37,800
actually like all the science points to
the fact that it's really hard for your

547
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:40,500
brain to do to,
to thinking tasks at the same time.

548
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,590
So multitasking really
doesn't exist in that way.

549
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,090
And in the kind of stuff we're doing,

550
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:48,780
we need to focus much more on the idea
of mono-tasking like doing one thing at a

551
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:50,280
time,
doing one thing with focus.

552
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:54,060
And that can be as applicable to
the desk space in front of you.

553
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:57,360
So not having five different bits of
paper that relates to five different

554
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:58,950
projects when you're
trying to focus on one,

555
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:01,140
just like putting those things
in a drawer or to one side,

556
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,490
same with your desktop,

557
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:06,120
like who's got hundreds of different
open windows on your computer and like

558
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:10,410
hundreds of different, uh,
you know, like unfiled, uh,

559
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,850
things that kind of get in the way.

560
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:16,320
So really kind of getting
that focus around mono-tasking
not multitasking really,

561
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:21,000
really helps. A couple more
before we finish. Uh, mindfulness.

562
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:25,680
Um, so when I first read the book,
um, about five years ago, um,

563
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,230
I was really struggling to
find the time and the space to,

564
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,100
to do that cause I had a business to
run and all the rest of it. So like,

565
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,830
it was this thing that kept coming up
every week. I looked at my to do list,

566
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:38,220
it was like write book. I
was like, oh, I'm not really,
that's not really happening.

567
00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:41,760
What do I need to do? So what I did
was something quite extreme. I, um,

568
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,720
I booked a plane ticket to Sri Lanka.
I found a beach shot that have no Wifi,

569
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,280
no phone signal.

570
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:50,310
I was totally kind of off the grid and
I went away to Sri Lanka and I wrote the

571
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:54,360
book and I didn't really have
very many conversations a while.

572
00:28:54,361 --> 00:28:57,460
I was there with different people, um,
because I was just kind of on my own. Um,

573
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,710
but I did meet a Buddhist monk at the
bus stop and basically the Buddhist monk,

574
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,220
uh,

575
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,030
asked me to come to the monastery and
taught me meditation and it was a really

576
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:06,451
beautiful thing.

577
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:10,770
Like a meditation wasn't supposed to be
one of the characteristics in the book,

578
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,740
but I was there and I was writing the
book and suddenly I was having this

579
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:16,010
experience around meditation.
It's like this has to be in the book,

580
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,853
it has to be a thing.

581
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,970
And I thought it was risky in at that
point to put meditation and mindfulness in

582
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:21,750
the book.

583
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,850
And I was going to go into my corporate
clients and they're going to be like,

584
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:25,680
this is all a bit hippy.
We were, what's going on?

585
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,460
And what's happened in the last few years
is that the opposite is becoming true,

586
00:29:29,461 --> 00:29:31,980
which is that mindfulness has
become such a saturation thing.

587
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,760
And you get all these really annoying
things on Twitter that say the one thing

588
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:38,520
you need to do to be a better leader,
meditate for five minutes a day. Oh, well,

589
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:42,040
if only it was that easy. Great.
You know? So I think, you know,

590
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:44,650
meditation is an amazing tool.
It's not for everybody.

591
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:49,710
And I think there are lots of different
ways in my mind that we can get to a

592
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:51,730
place of mindfulness.
Really. You know, for me,

593
00:29:51,731 --> 00:29:53,560
my phone's has kind of
noticing your thoughts,

594
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,100
noticing the things that you might
be stressed about in that moment,

595
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,940
and starting to really understand
where your brain might be going in,

596
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:01,631
in certain things.

597
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:05,020
So you can get that just to be walking
lots and lots and lots of different ways

598
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:08,530
that you can start to really
understand your brain. Um, and for me,

599
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:13,270
the benefit of that is thinking about
this idea of the lizard brain. Um,

600
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:15,340
so, uh, the lizard brain is the Amygdala.

601
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,280
It's the part of your brain that gives
you this, this fight or flight response,

602
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,840
and often the things that become really
tricky for us to do or we start to

603
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:27,040
procrastinate over or we're scared about
because the lizard brain is having some

604
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:29,980
big response to it. So for example,
when I put a book out into the world,

605
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,470
my lizard brain is kind of saying to me,
don't do this.

606
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,140
And the reason for that is that
books are going to be judged, right?

607
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:38,260
People are going to write Amazon reviews
about them and you know people are

608
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:40,930
going to make judgments about what you do.
And that's a scary thing.

609
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,620
It's the same reason if you're going
to stand up and give a presentation in

610
00:30:44,621 --> 00:30:48,340
front of a bunch of your colleagues
or even worse, a bunch of your bosses,

611
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:51,850
it's like, I'm going to be judged here.
This is just becomes a scary thing.

612
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:56,851
So recognizing that that Lizard brain
is Austin going to try and sabotage it.

613
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,030
It's going to try and get in the way.

614
00:30:58,031 --> 00:31:01,330
It's going to try and give you a period
of procrastination rather than a period

615
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:02,920
of really useful work.
Um,

616
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:06,130
so when we start to recognize
that that's lizard brain thinking,

617
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,020
we can start to override it
and do something differently.

618
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,920
And for me mindfulness is one of the
best ways that we can start to get into

619
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:12,790
that,
that kind of place.

620
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:19,410
I think also mindfulness is just a really
useful thing to help us just take a

621
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:23,140
step back and realize how we've,
how far we've come. Um, so, uh,

622
00:31:23,141 --> 00:31:25,030
this is always quite
good point in the year.

623
00:31:25,031 --> 00:31:28,660
I think when people start to kind of take
stock of where they were last year and

624
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:30,090
what they want to do this year.
Um,

625
00:31:30,091 --> 00:31:32,800
so just kind of taking that step back
sometimes and kind of thinking how far we

626
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:36,640
have Commonwealth, what we have
achieved. Um, a really nice, uh,

627
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:39,760
productivity tip that doesn't
feel like one is, you know,

628
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:43,030
once a week or on a kind of regular
basis. Right. Have done list.

629
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,460
So as well as your to do
list, right. A half done list.

630
00:31:45,461 --> 00:31:47,560
It's a really nice empowering thing.
Um,

631
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,620
also just kind of overrides that
lizard brain thinking of like, oh,

632
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:53,530
I'm not capable. I'm feel guilty that
I've not achieved this, you know,

633
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,630
just gives you that kind
of sense of momentum,

634
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,510
which again fuels the next kind
of round of productivity. Um,

635
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,780
preparedness. Um, one of the things
I talk about in the book is, um,

636
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,640
an idea called the weekly checklist.

637
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,030
So this is a thing that you do once a
week where you just kind of take a step

638
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:14,590
back from all of the work that you're
doing and you prioritize just really clear

639
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:16,780
thinking. Um, and sometimes it,

640
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,770
one of the things I come across quite
a lot in businesses is people feel like

641
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:24,250
they don't have the time for clear
thinking. Um, it just feels like a luxury.

642
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:26,650
It feels like something that I'll
do when everything dies down or when

643
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:29,620
everything changes. Um, Henry
Ford has this amazing quote,

644
00:32:29,621 --> 00:32:32,380
which is thinking is the
hardest work there is,

645
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,900
which is the probable
reason so few engage in it.

646
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,860
And I really love that quote
because I think for me, you know,

647
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,070
when in a knowledge work job,

648
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:42,800
our job is to add value and
create value attic information,

649
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,150
the way we think and really
quality thinking is the
biggest asset that we have.

650
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,520
Our brains are our biggest tool.
Um,

651
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:52,970
so taking some time to step back
and really look at your projects,

652
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,700
look at your second brain, makes sure
all that kind of stuff feels fresh.

653
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,720
I think sometimes,
um,

654
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:02,090
to do lists kind of fall apart and the
apps fall apart because we lose trust in

655
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,890
what the data is within those apps.

656
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:06,860
So we start to look at what's in
the APP and we start to go, oh,

657
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:10,310
I know there's more stuff in my head so
I don't quite trust the APP has being

658
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,610
the full record of everything that
I've got. And then we lose trust in it.

659
00:33:13,611 --> 00:33:15,200
We stopped using it
and it kind of changes.

660
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,810
So really having that weekly checklist,

661
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:21,950
having that regular time where your only
job really is to interact with those

662
00:33:21,951 --> 00:33:24,660
lists and really get clear
on what's on your plate, um,

663
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,800
is a really nice way of keeping those
things fresh and ultimately gives you more

664
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:30,890
focus. But there is a cost to that, which
is a little bit of maintenance time.

665
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,220
So just coming back and
using those checklists to,

666
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:36,080
to really make those
good decisions happen.

667
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:42,470
The other thing about preparedness
is, um, uh, the idea of, uh, our,

668
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,790
our biggest tool being our
brain, um, is basically sleep.

669
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,780
And this slide is just to indicate the
sleep is a good thing and it's really

670
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:54,320
good to get enough sleep. So I think,
um, when you think about your tool,

671
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,850
your biggest tool being your brain,

672
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,910
I'm getting good sleep and all's a
whole lot of other stuff. You know,

673
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:02,630
hydration's a really important thing
and stuff that we kind of know. Um,

674
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,230
I've just actually just finished
writing a book and called work fuel,

675
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:09,860
which is all about nutrition and
how to eat to have better energy.

676
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:13,800
Looking at the things on your plate
Scougal as you're doing a good job. Uh,

677
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,690
it's good. Um, but I think, uh, it's just
one of those really underrated things.

678
00:34:17,691 --> 00:34:18,350
You know,
they're there.

679
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,410
I really couldn't find any books out
there that looked at nutrition and

680
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:24,740
productivity and kind of marry those
two things in a really specific way.

681
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:26,810
So I've been working with a
nutritionist called Collette Hennigan,

682
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:30,620
who is my nutritionist for a couple of
years to really put that into practice.

683
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:33,590
So that comes out in March.
And, um, I think, you know,

684
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:36,680
for me all of those things
that help us to fuel our brain,

685
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:40,610
whether it be nutrition, whether it be
sleep, whether it be hydration, exercise,

686
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,680
you know, mindfulness to
extent can do the same thing,

687
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,780
but just all those things
that are really important to,

688
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:49,480
to give us as much of that energy and
proactive attention as possible. Um,

689
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,690
and finally, just to say that, um,

690
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:55,850
acumen and Ninja is a
human but not a superhero.

691
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,340
So when you do a lot of the
stuff that's in the book,

692
00:34:58,341 --> 00:35:02,420
when you really start to have a really
good second brain are really good, uh,

693
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,430
like loads of apps and
tools that you're using.

694
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,910
When you've really got the best kind
of productivity up that you have,

695
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,610
people will look at you across
the office and they'll say, oh,

696
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:12,080
this person just feels like a superhero.

697
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:14,000
Like they're doing all this amazing stuff.

698
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,030
You'll start to be really
valued because of that.

699
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,880
And often people will start to come,
you know,

700
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:23,060
how do they do like have they got
some kind of special super power? Um,

701
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,950
and really none of us have super powers.

702
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:28,560
We're all just humans but with good tools
and good ways of thinking and all of

703
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,630
that stuff.
Um,

704
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:33,920
and I think that's a really useful thing
to come back and remind ourselves of

705
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:37,560
regularly. Just this idea of being human,
not Superhero, um, cause well that,

706
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:39,270
that doesn't mean is
that we have limitations.

707
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,560
It doesn't mean that we need
to acknowledge that humanist
sometimes and not work

708
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:45,120
ourselves too hard,

709
00:35:45,121 --> 00:35:48,710
too often because ultimately we're
going to risk burnout by doing that. Um,

710
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:52,200
and we also need to kind of recognize
that humans do need that time to kind of

711
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:55,980
refresh the Mojo a little bit and kind
of come back to who we are outside of

712
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:59,880
work and be a human being,
not just a human doing. I'm,

713
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:03,120
so for me that's a
really, uh, important, uh,

714
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,780
part of the whole productivity
Ninja philosophy really
is this idea of human not

715
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,703
superhero.

716
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:11,670
And I think productivity is one of those
topics that it would be really boring

717
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:15,540
if you could just systematize everything
and everything could just be done by

718
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:19,320
robots. And then it's all
kind of done. Um, you know,
there's no challenge in that.

719
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:19,621
For me.

720
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:24,090
I think the interesting part
of productivity for me is
that we all come to this

721
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:27,580
with all those kinds of weird thoughts
that we have in our brain. Um,

722
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,440
so I've done, um, with my podcast,
I have a podcast called beyond busy.

723
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:35,160
I've done about a hundred interviews
now with I'm often very high achieving

724
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:38,700
people and people often sort
of say to me like, what's the,

725
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,910
having done all that work and some of
these really long in depth conversations

726
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:44,850
with high achieving people.
Like what's the kind of commonality,

727
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,190
one of the things that these people
have in common? And I would say, well,

728
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,580
the only thing I can find that once
people have in common is that humans are

729
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:52,830
weird.
Humans are weird.

730
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:57,270
And we all come at all of our
work with a lot of, um, you know,

731
00:36:57,271 --> 00:37:02,260
kind of mental baggage if you like. We
have a lot of thoughts and I had that, uh,

732
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,250
derail us,
try and stop what we're doing,

733
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,670
try and get in the way
of what we're doing.

734
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,090
And actually by coming back and
reconnecting with the humanness,

735
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,000
I think that's where we start
to recognize some those things,

736
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:15,420
overcome some of those things.
Um, and also, um, you know,

737
00:37:15,421 --> 00:37:18,540
by doing that we start to realize that
productivity is a really amazing thing.

738
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:21,430
Like humans are amazing. Like
we do so much amazing stuff. Um,

739
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,570
and despite all those limitations,
despite all these things,

740
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,000
we can just do amazing work.

741
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,600
[inaudible].
