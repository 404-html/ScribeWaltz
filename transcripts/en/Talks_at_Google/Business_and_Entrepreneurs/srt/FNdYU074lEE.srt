1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,910
Hi Guys, is this, is this working?
Yeah, that's good. Ah, look,

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,820
delight to be here.

3
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:19,080
It's great to see doctor draw off some
free whiskey on a Friday afternoon.

4
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:22,200
It's still gets people interested.
So, so delighted to be here.

5
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:26,010
I'm here just to tell you a little bit
about who we are, what we're trying to do.

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:26,790
Um,

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,790
and at the same time maybe in part some
nuggets of information linkedin to the

8
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:36,200
rich providence and heritage
of Dublin and Ireland in, uh,

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,550
the evolution of,

10
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:42,551
of global whiskey because there's lots
of hidden stories and messages that have

11
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:45,440
been lost along the way.
And um, we're lucky myself,

12
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,060
my brother would just the latest
generations of tailings involved in the

13
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:51,260
industry and we're trying to put our
own mark on it and we like to say we're

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,680
respectful to the past,

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,340
but we're confident that forge
in your future boss to do that,

16
00:00:56,341 --> 00:01:00,360
you need to know where you've come
from. So, uh, just very, very quickly,

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,220
people don't know that actually whiskey
distillation comes from Ireland's a,

18
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:09,540
it was actually the Irish monks who
traveled around the world and they saw in

19
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,860
the Middle East and the Mediterranean,
uh,

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,770
the curious process of distillation using
a lambic steels, making essential oils,

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,250
uh,

22
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,660
making older v and they
took that technology back to
Ireland and we didn't have

23
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:23,070
the same crops,
but what there was,

24
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:26,060
there was lots of barley and
they soon figured out dot.

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,960
The resulting spirits are
illiquid HUD, medicinal values.
And, uh, that technology,

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,650
uh,
moved all around the world.

27
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:34,260
And so I went to Scotland
and went to everywhere else,

28
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,840
but it was very much a mom and pop
is very, very small production.

29
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:41,370
So when Larry was, was on farms, um, and
really catering for the local community,

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,990
um, but a couple of different
things changed, uh, from
the 18th and 19th century.

31
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,450
Our family first started in 1782.

32
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,090
I didn't small cross distillery in the
city center of Dublin and one of he go to

33
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:55,170
ones and I, an owner, the small
distilleries came to giants.

34
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:59,520
I really drove the last golden era for
Irish whiskey in the 19th century when

35
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,380
Irish whiskey and Dominique is much
bigger and Scotch and much bigger than

36
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:05,260
American whiskey.
We,

37
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,360
dominator in 70% of all global experts
came out of the islands of our islands.

38
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:14,280
Um, and there was a reason for that
because we had, uh, even back in the 17th,

39
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,600
18th century, a quality reputation
was always seen as smooth and very,

40
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:23,340
very drinkable. Um, and uh, one thing
happened at the start of the 19th century.

41
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:25,920
It was the act of union
with the British empire,

42
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:30,600
which was not so good for the country,
but great for Irish whiskey sales. Uh,

43
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:34,640
because all of a sudden it opened up all
the markets around the world, uh, to, uh,

44
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,280
Irish whiskey and, um, and also led
to a lot of foreign direct investment.

45
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,360
So a lot of money came into Ireland.
Um,

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,830
and at that time Dublin was the second
richest city in the whole of the British

47
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:48,630
empire. Um, and a lot of money went into
whiskey distillation in particular. Um,

48
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,250
and because of the industrial revolution,

49
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:54,170
the smaller distilleries could
become calm, much bigger. Um,

50
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,690
and it was quite interesting in that,
and when you think of distillation,

51
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:00,250
you think of rolling hills,
you're thinking of locks and all that.

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,110
In Ireland it was urban,

53
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,760
it was in city centers because it was
linked to the ports and it could export

54
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:08,200
around the world.
So there was very,

55
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:10,690
very different than what
was happening in Scotland's.

56
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,750
But unfortunately we lost our way. Um, um,

57
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:18,751
I think a success breeds arrogance and
we didn't adopt to modern technology.

58
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,600
Um, uh, on one or two other things
happened in the 20th century,

59
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:27,010
won the war of independence. Um, uh,
which was great again for the country,

60
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,390
but dread full of for Irish whiskey
sales cause it's so a stowed away all the

61
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:35,950
routes to market that we hods. Um,
I'm from the 1930s to the 1990s.

62
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,461
Uh,

63
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:40,240
it was a dark day for Irish whiskey cause
the last big export market was the u s

64
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,160
and they prohibition. So it was like a
car crash and we fell off a cliff. Um,

65
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:45,550
um,

66
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:50,320
and a lot of the old brands and a lot of
the olds at distilleries slowly slipped

67
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:51,154
away.
Uh,

68
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,720
and what's interesting and what's unique,
uh,

69
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,480
really about our city and the
city that you guys find yourself.

70
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:02,950
This is the cradle of urban whiskey
distillation. Uh, it was here in the city,

71
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,590
um, because as I said, it wasn't,

72
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:07,920
these rural distilleries
are driving that golden era.

73
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,220
It was distilleries in the city center
of Dublin and really in the area called

74
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:14,560
the liberties,
which was outside of the city wall.

75
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,930
And the reason why it was called the
liberties because you're at liberty to do

76
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:20,560
whatever the hell you wanted and was
famous for manufacturing. It was a,

77
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,790
for breweries,

78
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:26,590
it was for a distilleries was for linen
and for four bottles and all so forth.

79
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:27,890
But, uh, uh,

80
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,690
the one that stood the test of time was
a distilleries and breweries and there

81
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:35,680
was so much production in one
square kilometer in the liberties.

82
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:37,300
It was called the Golden Triangle.

83
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,080
And it was where majority of the
whiskey sold in the last golden era, uh,

84
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,300
of Irish whiskey came from.
Um,

85
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,350
but it was a very dark day in 1976 from
the last Dublin distilleries showed the

86
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:52,630
stores, uh, when powers a show,

87
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:57,490
the stores and all the production was
consolidated down into worn distillery in

88
00:04:57,491 --> 00:05:01,030
cork, in the Middleton distillery.
So from the 1976 onwards,

89
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,930
all that rich heritage and provenance
and all the stories and characters that

90
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:09,540
we're linkedin to making whiskey in
our city. So he slipped away, uh,

91
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,300
until recently of, uh,
so where are we now?

92
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,700
We are in a new golden
era for Irish whiskey.

93
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:19,270
I'm Irish whiskey since in 1990s has
been the fastest growing spirits category

94
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:20,740
in the world.
Um,

95
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:25,600
as a new generation that people discover
the joys of Irish whiskey and Irish

96
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,570
whiskey because of our climate and the
way we make it, it's a little bit lighter,

97
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:32,290
it's a little bit more accessible
and it's, it's a perfect gateway,

98
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,430
a spirit into whiskey in general.
And it's, uh, everything is cyclical.

99
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,030
So they say you don't drink
what your parents drink,

100
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,000
but you might drink what
your grandparents drink. Uh,

101
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:47,770
and it's really ours whiskeys,
chance to shine. Um, and, uh,

102
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,130
it's still only at the early
stages of segmentation. For years,

103
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,250
there's only been a handful of
distilleries. So in 2012, when I set up,

104
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:55,450
there was only four distilleries.

105
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,270
Now there's 20 plus and more
coming very quickly behind.

106
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,760
So it's going to change.
It's going to evolve.

107
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,820
It's going to be a proper category with
lots of different styles and expression

108
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:08,600
for people to discover
it. Um, and, uh, it's, uh,

109
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,140
hopefully going to double from where
we are now, uh, over the next 10 years.

110
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,300
And why is it happening? It's really
down to consumer behavior. Consumer,

111
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:21,550
younger people like all your
good selves here. Um, um,

112
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,110
much more progressive.
They don't stick with bronze.

113
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,070
They like to discover something new. They
want to find something that's relevant,

114
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,170
that can connect, um, um, to himself. Um,

115
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,510
and they're enjoying whiskey, um,
of every kind in different ways. Um,

116
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,780
before our Irish whiskey was very
much, um, Irish coffees, you know,

117
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:42,770
around the holidays for, you know, uh,
Irish American foundries and so forth.

118
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:44,720
But it's changing.
It's part of a cocktail.

119
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,400
It's being used and drunk and many
different ways. Um, and straight, uh, uh,

120
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:54,290
of course. Um, and, uh, the Asian
for like growth is the u s market.

121
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:54,861
Um,

122
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:59,861
so it was a market that put the final
nail in the coffin of Irish whiskey a at

123
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:03,700
the start of the 20th century.
But it's driving, um, uh,

124
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,110
let's say the evolution and the
revolution of the category now, um,

125
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,900
it's grown by over 600% the last
10 years. Uh, but it's for us,

126
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,270
the premiumization at the higher end
of the market is the one that's growing

127
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:17,780
very, very fast. But why are people
drinking? And I told, said, um,

128
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,420
sense of discovery, it's become
part of popular culture. Um,

129
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,170
but at the core is the taste.

130
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,270
People enjoy the taste of Irish
whiskey are lonely, miserable,

131
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,080
temperate climates is good for one thing.
And that's producing, you know, as I say,

132
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:37,520
a soft climate producers are soft
whiskey. But it's true. It's true.

133
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:39,020
Because if you go view,

134
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,140
took a distillery that's in our
islands and you made the spirit,

135
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:45,320
but you mature that in
the highlands of Scotland,

136
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,700
or in Kentucky or in Taiwan or in Japan,
anywhere else,

137
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,050
it will be totally different.

138
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,070
The cask and the maturation
deliver 60 to 70% of the flavor.

139
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,130
And what's distinctive about
Irish whiskey is the temperate,

140
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,060
soft climate that
producers, um, limited, uh,

141
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,760
let's say movement of the ward because Oh,

142
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:08,900
costs are porous and they
deliver majority of it.

143
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:12,350
So it's environmental influence. So,
so when you take of Irish whiskey,

144
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:13,790
it's because of,
you know,

145
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,100
we don't get to go to the beach
too often and we have to, you know,

146
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:18,210
always carry a,
a raincoat witness,

147
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,470
but it delivers exceptional
quality whiskey. Um,

148
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:26,930
and when I set up a,
in 2012, um, you know,

149
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,690
I had worked in a company
called Cudi distillery.

150
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,630
It'd been set up on my father in 1987.
Uh,

151
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:36,710
it was the first new distillery in
arms over a hundred years. Um, and, uh,

152
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,850
we tried to revive a lot
of old, famous brands. Um,

153
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,670
and I went around the u s and all around
the world trying to promote them on ice

154
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:48,680
off myself, the emergence of
crafts, spirits, craft beer,

155
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,420
people going back into urban centers to
try and make things and create brands

156
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:56,340
that were relevant to the
people that around there. Um,

157
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,470
on the planting the seed in my head.
Um,

158
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,820
and when my father decided to sell
the company he was in in 2011,

159
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:06,540
2012 and it's beam Suntory to
kill beg and Brian went to dam.

160
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,350
But it allowed me a chance to take all
these little nuggets of information and

161
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:14,820
the things that I really wanted to do
and really attack the category in my own

162
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:19,140
way. And my vision was to
bring a more contemporary,

163
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,080
more modern, uh, representation
of what Dublin and Ireland is, uh,

164
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,430
rather than the traditional rolling hills,

165
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:31,340
red setters and all that kind of
still for me as a modern owner,

166
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,040
didn't really connect me and just kind of
like, you know, it's like going to, oh,

167
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,460
Carol's gift shop and you see all
up how do you stuff it's not real.

168
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,570
It's not really what's going on.

169
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:44,571
So I thought that was an opportunity
to rep present Arland and Dublin in a

170
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,920
modern way and put my own mark on it,

171
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:49,770
but do it in a way that
was very relevant to me.

172
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:52,140
And to go right back to where I found
the first started, the studying,

173
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:55,440
which just in the city with Dublin,
um, and these are the other players.

174
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:58,440
So Pernod Ricard, um, the
biggest player by long way,

175
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:03,470
Jameson is a phenomenally success
story. Uh, obviously amazing. Um,

176
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,230
but we won't go into that because
like you're talking about, uh,

177
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,910
William grinds and Sonia
they own totem or Jew,

178
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,030
they bought out a good few years ago now,

179
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:16,530
but they're the largest privately owned
as Scotch whiskey company and the Igo

180
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:18,120
biggest drinks company in the world.

181
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:21,860
You used to own a and was at the
time they subsequently flipped it a,

182
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,160
I bought a premium Tequila, but they're
coming back into it as well. Um, so,

183
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,870
so the concept was to do something
different and to do something very unique.

184
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:35,390
And that was to, to come back to the
city center of Dublin and do it. So, um,

185
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,100
as I said, all of that being
contemporary, urban, innovative,

186
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,210
celebrating my own unique providence and
doing something a little bit different.

187
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,710
Um, but at the core of it was to get back
into production as soon as possible. Um,

188
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,280
but also as we said,
whiskey is a very traditional category.

189
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,400
You can't treat whiskey like a white
spirits like vodka or gin because of all

190
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:56,430
the history and so forth.

191
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:59,070
If you look at all the old bronze or
there'd be around for hundreds of years.

192
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,990
So you're competing against that and a
certain consumer expectations of what it

193
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:08,580
should look like. So, so we see ourselves
as the disrupter of Irish whiskey,

194
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,290
but at the same time, we're
quite, you probably go, yeah,

195
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,070
you're quite traditional because
that's what people expect.

196
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,450
And if you go too far,

197
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,650
people actually lose credibility and
they think you're overcompensating for

198
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:24,010
something crop in the wall. Um, so,
so what we have done is, uh, we are,

199
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:28,790
let's say a celebrating the past. We've
gone with the old style dark bottle. Um,

200
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,920
it's the way that they would have been
able to make last back in the 19th

201
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:34,950
century, early 20th century. They
can't make clear white Flint.

202
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:38,690
They just didn't have the capability to
do it. So if you see old bottles, uh,

203
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,840
you'll see they're all like this.

204
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:42,540
So I have to go to Italy to
find someone that made it, um,

205
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,860
but then have a standard label that has,
you know,

206
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,680
modern cues that people would expect.
And our symbolism is fees.

207
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,890
A Phoenix rising from the potstill to
symbolize the revival of distilling in the

208
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:57,910
city, but also a revival of our
family's involvement in the category.

209
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,860
And our tagline is the spirit of Dublin.

210
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,110
And the reason why we say
that the spirit of Dublin,

211
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:04,030
it's not about making alcohol in it.

212
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,360
It's trying to capture that unique DNA
that makes Dublin the city that it is.

213
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:12,740
It's a bit gritty. He's got his own
sense of humor. He's got a school,

214
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:16,020
just got its bad points, but it's
very resilient. Uh, you know,

215
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:21,080
there's a reason why you guys are here is
the reason why, um, uh, Google have, uh,

216
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,470
the European Middle
Eastern headquarters here,

217
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,580
it's because of the people and you know,
the environment that it creates.

218
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,100
And I want to capture that and try
and put that into a bottle of whiskey.

219
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:33,070
So that's what the spirit
of Dublin means to us. Um,

220
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,270
and uh, as you said, we're
urban centers through the ages.

221
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:41,190
So a Dava is not what our family does.
It really looked like a,

222
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,240
what actually happened
was our family distillery.

223
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:44,890
We went through a couple
of different generations.

224
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:50,130
It got assumed into much larger
distillery that was set setup by William

225
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,500
Jemison, who was John Jameson song and
became the Marble Lane, this theory.

226
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:58,700
So it was the Saudis put a lot smaller.
And this is our new distillery today, um,

227
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,210
first new distillery in
Dublin for over 125 years. Um,

228
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,690
it took me nearly three years to get a
bill just for planning reasons and so

229
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:10,920
forth, even though it has all
that history and all that,

230
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,180
the kind of an old
distilleries based around it.

231
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:16,060
And one of the biggest breweries
in the world. And Guinness,

232
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,310
it's still was exceedingly difficult to
get Dublin city council to back me to be

233
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:23,680
able to build a distillery cause
they want to move industry.

234
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:27,370
Like manufacturing is dirty manufacturing
as they see it out of the city.

235
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,720
So it was a fight in her hands,

236
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:32,470
but lucky enough it was worth the effort
to get us because it's our brand tone

237
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,990
and as you can see is we like
to say we fit into the, the,

238
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:39,070
the Palette of materials that
are famous around the liberties,

239
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:42,220
but it's a modern or disturbing. You
didn't want to create a pastiche kind of,

240
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,820
you can't recreate history.
Let's create a new history.

241
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,130
And that's more interesting to me and I
think that's more interesting for people.

242
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,640
And if you come and see us,
and that's where we are. Again,

243
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:54,850
new market square where we are is a
part of the old parts of the city.

244
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:59,090
It has so much heritage and stories
I won't go into today. But, uh, um,

245
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:04,470
our previous family distillery, uh, was
up around there, so not too far away. Um,

246
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,350
but we're urban prophetess dinners.
And when you come to see our distillery,

247
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,110
the hero is manufacturing. You actually
see a real manufacturing, uh, um,

248
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,380
a location. It's not a vis center where
the distillery is a distillery would,

249
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:18,071
a visitor center.

250
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:22,570
So it's a medium sized distillery with
real people making real whiskey seven

251
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,820
days a week, uh, bringing
back that smells,

252
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:27,940
the sounds and the environmental
experience. And once you see it,

253
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,800
it's a very simple process. It's, we
made the same way for hundreds of years,

254
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,330
if not thousands of years. Um, um,

255
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,350
it's literally makeup hair and then
you distill your actually extract

256
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,450
impurities, extract water, and
you're left with your spirits,

257
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,440
which then you have to mature
for three years in the day. Um,

258
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,550
and what we focus on is being
different. So we're small. We're, we're,

259
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,940
we're tiny. We're like a, I
wouldn't like to say a pimple on a,

260
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:58,850
on the arse of an elephant.
We're quite small.

261
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,910
Maybe our competitors see
us like that bullet. Uh, um,

262
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,010
well we want to do was we
didn't want to take away,

263
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,340
we're not trying to rob
volume from the marketing.

264
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,750
We're trying to create choice for people.

265
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,420
When they want to discover something
interesting with it in the category,

266
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,850
they can come to us and
hopefully we're different.

267
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:18,170
Our liquid is different and we take a
lot of pride in the liquid that goes into

268
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:22,850
it because the one thing I learned at
an early age was you call it a case of

269
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,600
worldclass whiskey. To get
in the game, to win the game,

270
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:30,940
you have to create a world class brand.
And we're, we're working on that. We're,

271
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,040
we're not there yet,
but we wanted to create very,

272
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:39,041
very different tasting whiskeys so that
you can have any other brands out there

273
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:42,950
and ours that will stand out and hopefully
sign up for the right reasons. Um,

274
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,530
what you have to have everything
else that goes with it. So,

275
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:50,300
so we have a premium price. Um,
um, versus let's say we're in 25,

276
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,700
30% higher than the market leader.

277
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:57,080
We have differentiated packaging and
hopefully our story is different as well

278
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,560
and bringing it all together.
Hopefully we can create something that's,

279
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,200
as you say, a little, a little off
center. So this is our, our small batch,

280
00:16:04,201 --> 00:16:07,310
just as our kind of our flagship product.
And the reason why we went with this,

281
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:10,880
because 90% of Irish whiskey
sales are blended whisky.

282
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,370
It's a blend of grain and malt whiskey.

283
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:18,210
Grain whiskey is made from corn
or maize. It's very light. Um,

284
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:23,420
and blending it with heavier style
potstill or single malt makes it more

285
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,900
accessible, easier to drink,
and it's cheaper as well. Um,

286
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,770
so 90% of all our ish whiskey sold is
that type and that's what people expect

287
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:33,950
and that's what they get used to it.
But we came out a little bit different.

288
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,700
We said,
well look,

289
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,210
let's treat that blended whiskey respect
and put an interesting barrels and

290
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:42,050
treat it like it was a single
malt and our small batch was born.

291
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,790
So we take a grain,

292
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,060
a malt whiskey that's been aged four
and six years in Bourbon barrels.

293
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,450
We blend it together and then we let him
marry in Rome barrels for an extra year

294
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,191
or so and the parts,

295
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:58,050
this extra layer of flavor and we
bottled at 46% or 92 proof. Um,

296
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,490
um,

297
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,570
which captures all the natural flavors
and so does up that it takes experience,

298
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:07,340
but it tastes like what people
expect and they joy already. So,

299
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,040
so creating a ladder of different
things to get people, um, um,

300
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,320
discovering something new and we created
a whole range of different expressions

301
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,240
and for people. So ranging
from our spirits of dove
and poaching, which is new,

302
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:25,040
make spirits straight off the still. So,
uh, um, it's traditionally very strong.

303
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:28,040
We only bought that 55%,
but it's still puts hair on your chest.

304
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,500
It doesn't put it on your head.
Unfortunately.

305
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,890
I've tried many times to
our Teeling trinity range,

306
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:35,990
which is a,
our small batch.

307
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:40,991
And then we break the individual
components into a bottling of single grain

308
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,890
whiskey and single malts,
again,

309
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:46,220
using very innovative casks
to impart a unique flavor.

310
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,210
And then we're lucky we have some of the
oldest are single malts available and

311
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:53,890
we've created an arrange of
different expressions, um,

312
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,500
all the way up to a 33 year old,

313
00:17:55,501 --> 00:18:00,501
which to me is a piece of arch whiskey
history that we're just very lucky to be

314
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:03,540
able to celebrate.
And ties into celebrating the past,

315
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:08,130
but at the same time doing something
different. Um, what have you achieved?

316
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,710
You know, it's a six years now, so it's a,
uh, better than something where now, uh,

317
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,190
though we're the fastest growing Irish
whiskey domestically, which I think,

318
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:19,860
I think a lot of pride in.
So to be a real brand,

319
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,630
you've got to be relevant
to people on your,

320
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:24,660
in your backyard and put a
lot of time and effort in.

321
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:28,020
And Irish whiskey 10 years ago,
no one gave it down.

322
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,870
It was very much focused on bigger brands.

323
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:33,690
They didn't really want to discover
anything else, but it's totally evolved.

324
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:36,390
It's totally changed now.
Every bar, every restaurant,

325
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:41,340
it takes pride in their back bar and
particularly Irish whiskey are our SGN and

326
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:43,680
everything else that's going
on. So, so it's changed a lot,

327
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:48,060
but we're delighted to be part of that
evolution and we're exporting to over 60

328
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:52,560
international markets, but it's
like the 80 20 rule, the u s uh,

329
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,960
global travel retail,
some bigger markets like that,

330
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:58,110
that drives most of our volume. Um, um,

331
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,120
and we'll continue to do so we're seeding
in Asia and, um, some emerging markets,

332
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:06,950
but we're in probably a little bit
more for when people already know Irish

333
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:08,310
whiskey,
getting the one to discover something new.

334
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:12,030
That's where we come in and we've
won over 175 international awards,

335
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:15,960
which definitely you take a lot
of pride in. Um, um, and, uh,

336
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:20,510
we'll continue to focus on a one bottle
at a time and we'd like to say, uh,

337
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,730
we put our bottling date on it,
uh,

338
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,140
and I get to put my signature on
it cause I actually have the, the,

339
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,610
the rice to joy, the obligation to
sign off every batch before we do it.

340
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,520
So it sounds great,
but you had a,

341
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,310
let's say a busy weekend and you come in
on a Monday morning and we're like, oh,

342
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:37,810
we have to bottle taste this
and you're drinking costume.

343
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,230
Whiskey can sense a lot more
romantic than it actually is. Um,

344
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,320
but it's still, it's still, it's still not
a bad job, so I can't complain, but I do,

345
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:49,710
I could play it all the time. Um, and, uh,

346
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,040
we've had over 300,000 visitors.
True. Um, which is amazing,

347
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,810
which is great because we don't have
money for global advertising budgets.

348
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,150
What we want is that
experiential marketing,

349
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,660
so people to call them and experience
us, meet the people, young,

350
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,000
passionate people we have working for us,
um,

351
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,420
understand what we're all about and
then take that home with them no matter

352
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:10,770
where they are in the world. So, uh,

353
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,980
it's a key thing and that was part of
the reason we have to fight together

354
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:17,400
distillery because we wanted
that experience side of, of, of,

355
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:21,690
of the business as well. Um, and
you'll be delighted to know, um,

356
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:23,460
I'm talking a lot about
the small batch and,

357
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:24,930
and I'll talk a little bit the Ciliary,

358
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,620
we have some free passes and some whiskeys
there for you guys to take with you

359
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,750
so you can really experience
what we're all about as well. Um,

360
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,940
and where are we now? In 2018, um,

361
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,390
since I started coming to the category
is doubled. Well if nearly doubled,

362
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,510
um, segmentations accelerating, um,

363
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,560
and what we had before and we were limited
by supply going forward from where we

364
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:48,400
are now,
it's going to be limited by demand.

365
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:53,610
So it puts a lot more onus on us to to
let's say a perfect our digital marketing

366
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:58,210
and odor to is that we can leverage
to connect and tell our story in a

367
00:20:58,211 --> 00:21:02,260
meaningful way to our target
demographic. Uh, on our glue.

368
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:07,261
Our goal for the next three to four years
is to really be that global discovery,

369
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:11,470
Irish whiskey driving the
premiumization of Irish whiskey.

370
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:15,550
Not trying to be the next
Jansen or [inaudible] or
anything like that is really

371
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:18,640
helped the category evolve and to
give that choice so that when you go,

372
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:21,790
no matter where you go in the world,
rather it one bottle of Irish whisky,

373
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,550
you'll see a range of Irish whiskey.
And that's the opportunity.

374
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,830
That's the challenge.
At the same time, um,

375
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,640
and it's getting more challenging because
this is what's happening and there's

376
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:32,200
definitely a revolution going on.

377
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,540
There's no shortage of
entrepreneurship in our own.

378
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,810
That's the one thing I can definitely say
is that everyone sees the opportunity.

379
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,210
I'm not sure if they're all going
to be able to grasp it or not.

380
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:44,640
So the ones in the red where the
regional distilleries, when I settle,

381
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,180
when I set up with that were there,

382
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,500
the ones in the green are the ones
that are there. Um, um, um, now,

383
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,690
and the ones in the black
are some of the ones,

384
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:56,140
there's even more that are going to
come up. So it's always very exciting.

385
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,180
It's very noisy.
Um,

386
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,120
hopefully if everyone focused on doing
something a little bit different,

387
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:04,870
a little bit more interesting and
embrace their own story and location,

388
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,340
the future looks very,
very bright. So Shinay

389
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,940
[inaudible]

390
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,430
am I on track? Got Y'all on the
head. Is Roxhill loads. Question. So,

391
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,890
so Jack,
thank you so much for coming.

392
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,030
This has been like a very interesting
talk that I've witnessed the spite of the

393
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:31,840
talks at Google team. Um, and we're
talking about whiskey. But my,

394
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,060
my first question,
my very serious first question is,

395
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,130
have you ever been drunk
on Teeling whiskey?

396
00:22:37,131 --> 00:22:38,410
I would you recommend the experience?

397
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,250
Oh my gosh.
Well,

398
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:47,080
I can tell you my first
experience with whiskey was
not the best. Um, uh, you know,

399
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,870
was it because he wasn't dealing with

400
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,450
the problem with people who don't maybe
know whiskey and how they drink it is

401
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:59,650
that if you try and drink it like wine
or beer, you'll drink it too fast.

402
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,940
Um, um, you have to drink in a different
way. So you sip it, you appreciate it.

403
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,610
So if you're doing it too fast, it will
hit you like a steam train unforeseen.

404
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:12,520
When I was growing up, no one
told me that. Uh, and uh, yeah,

405
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:14,410
I can really knock your socks off.

406
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:19,990
I know we're all about drinking less and
drinking better. So, um, it's a, it's,

407
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,180
it's about more flavor,

408
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,470
more character and enjoying
and appreciating the whiskey
rahter than drinking it

409
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:31,390
just to get drunk. But the medicinal
benefits of it are a very relaxing,

410
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:35,320
it's good to have, especially after
a hard week and work like, you know,

411
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:38,980
let's go wait to, to unwind. Yeah.
Yeah. So it's about drinking less,

412
00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:43,350
but drinking better. Yeah. Yeah. You know,
so that's very philosophical for whiskey.

413
00:23:43,351 --> 00:23:47,300
Now. Uh, well it's, it's not, it's, it's
happened a lot in different categories.

414
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:51,960
It's happened, but it's a
tequila. It's good. It used
to be always just a shot. Um,

415
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,090
part of the experience of,
you know, I wouldn't say
college experience for people.

416
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,010
Um, now it's, you know, you're
look at Petroleum Tequila, it's,

417
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,370
it's all about understanding
the current effort.

418
00:24:02,371 --> 00:24:07,250
It goes into creating the products and
if you understand that you'll appreciate

419
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:09,500
it a little bit more in your
drinking in a different way as well.

420
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:14,720
Thank you. So you definitely recommend,
um, I just wanted to know, so

421
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:19,170
I definitely recommend drinking tea
rescue, but not too much that, uh,

422
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,850
you make per life decisions.
Okay.

423
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,360
Um, I'm really curious. I have
a question for you as a CEO. Um,

424
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:32,100
if you could describe for us your worst
or your best day in business while

425
00:24:32,101 --> 00:24:32,934
without being,

426
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,210
she's tough. Question.
Uh, yeah. Well, uh, um,

427
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,680
I'm lucky that we've had
some key landmark, um,

428
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,320
days along the journey. Um,
um, um, we're going this year,

429
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:50,040
2018 is a key landmark a year for,
for,

430
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:53,910
for us as a whiskey distillery
because it's three years in a day. Um,

431
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,710
and before you can legally sell it.
So,

432
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:00,390
so we're actually bottling up our very
first release of our Teeling single

433
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,960
potstill, which will be coming
available later in the year or so.

434
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,180
So it's amazing to have just a concept
that you've had floating around in your

435
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:09,570
head to actually, you
know, build this, um,

436
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:13,620
lay it down and let it mature over that
period of time and then see it come to

437
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:17,250
life. Um, so, uh, this year is
a, is a, is a big year for us,

438
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:22,050
but also it's like the original five year
business plan has, has, has, let's say,

439
00:25:22,051 --> 00:25:25,500
happened and now we have to
reinvigorate yourself and go again.

440
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,740
So all of the things you want to do and
it's again, you know, just sitting back,

441
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,890
you know, how have a range of
all of our whiskeys win awards,

442
00:25:31,891 --> 00:25:33,780
do all that kind of stuff like that.
We've done that.

443
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,060
So how would you refire the organization
to aspire to something bigger? Again,

444
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,720
a uneven myself. Um, um,
um, that's, this was a,

445
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:46,860
a key challenge in terms
of bonds, um, and days. Um,

446
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,490
I always find that the worst thing is
around people and sometimes, you know,

447
00:25:50,491 --> 00:25:54,510
the challenge that's human resources
can happen. So, um, you know,

448
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,730
some bad decisions or how
did hiring and you know,

449
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,540
to be negative for the company and
so forth and creating, you know,

450
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:04,380
not the type of environment
for staff that you want. Um,

451
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,930
and there were some of the,
the the worst times for us,

452
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:10,000
but that's just normal in an organization.
Um,

453
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,380
but still I'm lucky is by far like,
you know,

454
00:26:13,381 --> 00:26:15,390
it's like I struggle
sometimes to say like,

455
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:18,420
what was your worst decision or
what's the worst day hike for you?

456
00:26:18,421 --> 00:26:23,130
I don't think of how to yet. Um, um,
uh, but it's been a real positive ions,

457
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,170
a enjoyable experience for me so far.

458
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,880
Um, my, my next question
is around legacy. Um,

459
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:33,000
so you're running a company
that has had a lot of history,

460
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,530
a lot of family history,

461
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,580
but at the same time you're running it
in the 21st century where things are

462
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:42,750
changing very rapidly. Um, so how
have you been able to marry the,

463
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,640
with the contemporary, so
retaining your, your core identity,

464
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,750
but then also adapting it for the, you
know, for, for the young games like us,

465
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,800
I'm not that old.

466
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:04,390
I used to say our target demographic was
21 to 35 now is it has to be 21 to 45,

467
00:27:05,361 --> 00:27:08,570
like, you know, so, um, but, um, um,

468
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:12,920
I suppose in any kind of business where
your, your name is on the ball, hello are,

469
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:15,890
you know, it's gone through
lots of different generations.

470
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:20,080
There's a lot of pressure on ownership
on you to represent him the right way,

471
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:24,050
not screw up. Um, ours is a little
bit different in that, you know,

472
00:27:24,051 --> 00:27:28,940
it's really a kind of revival of the
trademark and the history. Um, um,

473
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:33,720
so we're a little bit more,
that's a, uh, not as, uh,

474
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,780
hampered by some of the legacy issues.

475
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:40,850
But water we're trying to do is when
people think of Teeling or they hear the

476
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:44,630
name, think the old, like the whiskey,
you know, so that's where we want to go.

477
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,450
And uh, you know, I think, uh,
our, our, our wider family,

478
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:49,670
which is quite a small
achieving is unusual.

479
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,240
Arash name actually came from a vikings.

480
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,520
Norman's Sooni came to
Ireland's many years ago.

481
00:27:55,521 --> 00:27:57,770
There's more teamings in
Hollins than anywhere else,

482
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,160
which I only found out once I set up
the company and they all kept phoning up

483
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:06,020
asking for a free bottles of
whiskey. So, uh, um, but, uh, no,

484
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:10,810
I think a, it's a, it's an amazing
opportunity that I've been given, um,

485
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:15,170
to, to quote our mark
back on dope. It was, um,

486
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,251
you know,

487
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:20,150
hopefully it can go through a couple of
different generations and carry on that

488
00:28:20,151 --> 00:28:21,580
legacy too to make sense.

489
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:27,410
And my final question, so if you
have a question, just get ready. Um,

490
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,940
my final question is, when you were
speaking, you said that, um, two dates,

491
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:36,600
you've had about 300,000 visits us at the
distillery. That's a lot of people. Um,

492
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,080
and you also said something around
digital marketing and trying to, you know,

493
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,450
adapt for the digital age.
So really quick question.

494
00:28:44,451 --> 00:28:47,960
Do you have an ad words
account? Yes. Okay.

495
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,940
Oh yeah. Yeah. It's a,
it's a, it's a key. Um, um,

496
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,563
I'm just joking,

497
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,650
but it is because the hardest thing is,
is in our industry,

498
00:29:01,651 --> 00:29:05,490
there's so many. We don't have our
own distributors, so, you know,

499
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:08,580
we have distributors, independent
servers around the world. Um,

500
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,400
it's sometimes like Chinese whispers
about you're telling your story,

501
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,810
you say it to them and they
kind of go, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, you, I understand. They,

502
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,900
they've no idea what you're talking about.

503
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:19,610
And then they tell their sales guys who
didn't tell us the Barmah new tells then

504
00:29:19,611 --> 00:29:22,710
to consumer and they kind of
lose that impact. So, you know,

505
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,710
modern digital communication,
cultural, all the noise.

506
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:27,820
So someone on their phone and find you on,

507
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,070
hopefully you understand what your
product is on that and what your brands,

508
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,830
thanks for pitching adwords,

509
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:36,570
but I'm going to use that in
my next client meetings. Um,

510
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,860
so are there questions
from the, Oh, perfect.

511
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,690
I'm the best question. Got
a big one. So no pressure.

512
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,100
Um, since we're here at
Google, I want to know like,

513
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:55,240
which is your favorite youtube channel
talking about whiskey. And one last thing,

514
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:57,330
what do you think about Conor McGregor?
Snoop

515
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,380
proper tall,

516
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,010
probably the first one is a guy called
Ralphy. Uh, I don't know if you know Rafi.

517
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:08,790
He's a, he's a serious
character, um, on, um,

518
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,070
he's been doing it for a long time. He
always, you must be out of for, you know,

519
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:16,470
way before, you know, the, the modern
and interesting in online reviews.

520
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:20,610
And he's very independent as well. He's
Scottish, which is a bit of an issue. Um,

521
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,010
so he is this a war few Irish
whiskey, but you know, I, I enjoy,

522
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:30,000
uh, the way he does his tasting.
Do you remember your score?

523
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:33,110
Uh, um, we've got a couple. Um,

524
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,450
I think we did reasonably
okay on the small batch.

525
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:38,070
I think he likes the older expressions.

526
00:30:38,071 --> 00:30:41,550
They are seeing the multiple baker
he gives good Switzerland. So, um,

527
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:45,180
then Conor McGregor, it's kind of very,
it was interesting when they was, uh, uh,

528
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,510
because he sent in his negotiator
to us, a couple of, uh,

529
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,110
I would say maybe two years ago
ago, I thought our Tam and, Oh Beth,

530
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:56,280
who is the Russian Hower, he's a
MMA fighter as well, but he is, uh,

531
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,360
a friend of, of Connor on day. He was
looking at getting supply whiskey,

532
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:02,160
real negotiator,
you'll really go share.

533
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,310
I was 40 years cause he had no clothes
on his hand. And then he was like, oh,

534
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,760
he's starting small. Like, Yo, you're
like, oh they kill, maybe I can take them.

535
00:31:08,761 --> 00:31:12,120
And I said, not a challenge. And uh,

536
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,940
he just finished a business degree
so he was going around and do,

537
00:31:14,941 --> 00:31:17,040
so Connor has had an interest for awhile.

538
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,610
We pitched and idea of doing a very
limited high end kind of boring for him,

539
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:24,230
but he wanted something that was a little
bit more entry level, um, to kind of, uh,

540
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:27,840
you know, gosh or wider opportunity.
And it was something we couldn't do. Um,

541
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,930
and his launch just being for the
home, like, you know, it's a, it's,

542
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:34,470
it's the definitely generated
a lot of interest. Um, I, I,

543
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,550
I'd be interested to see how that interest
in teens over the weekends, you know,

544
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:42,530
but, uh, I was in a taxi and he's
an MMA fighter, the taxi driver,

545
00:31:42,531 --> 00:31:45,400
and he said guaranteed going to knock
it out in the first round. And so, uh,

546
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,100
he's putting his own money on it, so, uh,

547
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,050
it could be an extra kick
for her first Muskie,

548
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:54,030
but I think more people talking about
Irish whiskey. It's good. Um, um, on,

549
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,030
you know, cause it's still at
the early stages I'll definition,

550
00:31:57,031 --> 00:31:59,700
but we do something that's
quite different. And Connor,

551
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,590
hi. Thanks. First for your presentation,

552
00:32:02,591 --> 00:32:07,120
really engaging or question around this
distillery on what you're producing in

553
00:32:07,121 --> 00:32:10,750
there. So I've been to this distillery in
new market. It's very impressive. Setup.

554
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:15,580
The merchandise store, not like the
party like, or Carlos you mentioned. Um,

555
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:19,270
but you mentioned that you showed us an
Irish family of whiskeys and one of them,

556
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,330
my soul was the poaching.
Um,

557
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,640
so actually went to the launch of
this and it was paired with poachers,

558
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:28,390
an Irish gin to thought it
was really great that you're
supporting iris business.

559
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,120
Where do you see this in
terms of your target, Marcus,

560
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:33,760
and how can this become like a,
a drink,

561
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:37,480
like a cocktail or we're poaching or
just whiskey in Jerry w with poaching.

562
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,970
Yeah, we'll put, Geez,

563
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,260
I've been interested in pushing
for a long time because it is,

564
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,580
everyone in our islands
has some story about new,

565
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:51,620
mostly not code. We're poaching a, it
always comes out on special occasions,

566
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:54,980
weeks or you know, a stags or
all this kind of stuff like that.

567
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:58,240
Or someone has a bottle
somewhere underneath the ad.

568
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:02,570
The cadre are under the counter in the
seven up or whatever sort of bottle. Uh,

569
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,690
and I always thought it
was great opportunity to
represent it in a more modular,

570
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,210
um,
but it's hard because people don't,

571
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:15,040
I have to drink and it's a bit of a
novelty because it's so strong and the,

572
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:17,900
you're competing as odor,
you know, a white spirits.

573
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:22,050
We had vodka or anything
else. Um, um, so it's,

574
00:33:22,051 --> 00:33:23,660
it's a difficult one. And, uh, you know,

575
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:25,970
we've tried it and it's
part of what the portfolio,

576
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,360
but it's so much money would go into
changing consumer behaviors and education

577
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,560
that for us it's nice to have for
our real opportunity is on whiskey,

578
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:38,870
which people already understand
that the already, you know,

579
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:43,110
it's a global opportunity and there's
one or two guys like Mikell, um, uh,

580
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,170
which is a Golway, which is, that's
what he does. He's a pushy maker. Um,

581
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,200
and uh, you know, I think he's trying
to do some good things as well,

582
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:55,200
but I think it will be in cocktails,
um, and understanding, you know,

583
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:59,150
maybe a signature drink that poaching
can live in to really give it so,

584
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:03,800
but it's up against, you know,
gene, uh, which is, you know, again,

585
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,030
it's gone crazy. Um,
but, uh, um, I, you know,

586
00:34:08,031 --> 00:34:10,490
I'd like to see a future
because we have a GI who,

587
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:13,850
so it's a geographically protected
terminology that's solely from our own,

588
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,530
so it's there to be exploited.

589
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:19,040
But I would like to see and figure
company probably do a lot of the heavy

590
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:20,600
lifting to get it to where it needs to be.

591
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,940
Thank you. Um, my question
is about how do you start to,

592
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:27,920
how do you revive the a distillery?

593
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,970
Presume presuming that you need to have
a whiskey has been aged for 12 years or

594
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:36,410
15, maybe even 25 and I know
you're selling some 25 year
old whiskeys and then in

595
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:38,330
the same way,
how do you deal with competition?

596
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,930
How do you anticipate that people who
are kids today are going to love your

597
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:46,931
whiskey in 10 or 15 years and that some
other distillery is not going to come

598
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:50,570
up, come out to, it's something
revolutionary that you couldn't, you know,

599
00:34:50,571 --> 00:34:52,640
deal with later.
For example,

600
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:57,410
I was thinking how Japan entered the
whiskey market in 2010 or 2014 out of the

601
00:34:57,411 --> 00:34:59,960
blue and now they're kind of leading it,
getting the rewards.

602
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,100
How do you deal with that?

603
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,560
Yeah,
I said no tough questions.

604
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:13,490
Like how, how would you have whiskeys
and you're only a new distillery?

605
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,980
Um, um, that's a very good question.

606
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,210
And I was the managing director in
Cooney, uh, uh, when it was old.

607
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,560
I wasn't happy with it as being sold.

608
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:24,620
So I was a little bit problematic and
like demanded supply contract to be able

609
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:28,400
to stay within the industry, which
they gave. Uh, which was great.

610
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:32,900
So there's no noncompete, um, allowed me
to get back into the category. Um, and uh,

611
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:36,320
in 2012 and 13, when opportunity
came to buy, you know,

612
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:40,140
a big chunk of imagery which we
acted on. Um, so we knew quite well,

613
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:44,490
but what we focused on is changing
and making a difference on by using

614
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:47,940
innovative cost maturation to
bring that extra flavor onto,

615
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:51,720
I suppose where we're coming now.
It was full circle where, where, uh,

616
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:56,230
replacing that source whiskey
would our own whiskey now, uh,

617
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,800
now allows us to be truly innovative
and doing things differently. Um,

618
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:04,220
in terms of, you know, when we settle,
where were you producing whiskeys?

619
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:08,850
I mean like people would like, uh, I
suppose we were our target demographic.

620
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,190
Oh, you like it was an eerie, the group
that was involved with opening the city.

621
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:16,050
We sat around and said, well, what
did we find it interesting? You know,

622
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:18,240
what we like if we like and we
hope whether people like it.

623
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:21,090
So we're the toughest critics,
but we make whiskeys,

624
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,260
we like to drink and hope for the older
people like to drink it as well. Uh,

625
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,460
I go forward. How can we keep it
relevant? How we keep it exciting,

626
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:33,730
but innovating if you're asking me.
And uh, so we're laying down whiskeys,

627
00:36:33,731 --> 00:36:36,960
you know, peated whiskey,
smoky whiskies, a rye whiskeys,

628
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:41,961
lots of different styles so that hopefully
we can respond to consumer interests

629
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:44,990
for different things. Um,
but it's good. It's global.

630
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,410
People make whiskey everywhere.
Japanese whiskeys is amazing. Uh,

631
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,590
Taiwanese whiskies are amazing.
Australian whiskies, you know, everywhere.

632
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:55,860
So I think it's, people are more
interested what's in the fall, you know,

633
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:59,880
rather than necessarily a, to be from a
certain country. So it puts more pressure,

634
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:02,970
but also opens up a lot of opportunities
because Irish whiskey is still quite

635
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:07,520
small. It used to be only scotch, Scotch,
Scotch, Scotch. Now it's, everyone is,

636
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,030
is open to trying different things.

637
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:14,150
So a lot of Whiskey,
uh, ends up getting, um,

638
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,850
around 45% proof.
Um,

639
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,190
there have been some really
interesting products that, uh,

640
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,340
typically higher improves. So
50, 60% cost drinks. Yep. Um,

641
00:37:25,341 --> 00:37:29,450
can you talk a little bit about how that
might be in a potential direction for

642
00:37:29,451 --> 00:37:33,110
you or uh, as, uh, just
industry in general?

643
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,170
Yeah, yeah. I think, um, um,

644
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,190
a lot of American whiskeys will be quite
high in alcohol. Um, and that's again,

645
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:44,600
because of the maturation. So because
they mature in very hot climates,

646
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:49,100
the actually rather than in Ireland's
where you lose alcohol into the

647
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:53,420
atmosphere, um, uh, use alcohol,
it's called the angel share.

648
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,890
It's our profit going up in the
air. So the smell you guys, uh,

649
00:37:57,891 --> 00:38:01,840
at a whiskey warehouse is actually
alcohol disappearing into, into Asia.

650
00:38:01,841 --> 00:38:05,120
What does that environmental influence
them, you know, makes whiskey what it is.

651
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,020
Um, so in hotter climates it
goes up rather than it goes down.

652
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:10,370
And so the longer you have it in,

653
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:14,420
wouldn't our owns the lower the alcohol
strands in America and Taiwan? It goes,

654
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,010
it goes off. Uh, but I think also
people want to have a four or flavor,

655
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,620
a stronger flavor.
And I think people's pile is gonna evolve.

656
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,760
And we do a lot of single cast bottling's.
Um, you can come to our distillery,

657
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,460
fill a single cost record from the casket,
and uh,

658
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:33,450
it could be anywhere from 62%
all the way down to, you know,

659
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:38,120
we bottled a 34 year old on was at 43.1%.
That was the actual cost rent.

660
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,740
We agile itself.
So it just depends if,

661
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,060
and what we'd like to do is cater
for a full range of tastes. Um,

662
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,700
and when you have a costume, you can add
water to it to get into it. You know?

663
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,500
So what all are whiskeys
are signature is 46%.

664
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:54,340
And the reason why we do it on
is because if you bottle it 40%,

665
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:58,060
which is the legal limits, that's the
lowest. It's obviously cheaper too. So,

666
00:38:58,061 --> 00:38:59,710
but you also have to do a process.

667
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,430
It's called chill filtration
because if you don't do that, uh,

668
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,890
if you get it from hot to cold,
you get this clouding.

669
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:10,490
And little bits of a asters and fatty
acids. Coagulating and so you go, Geez,

670
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,410
what's floating in my whiskey?
Um,

671
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,120
but if you bought it at a higher
alcohol strand, you can keep them in.

672
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:16,060
So we're trying to keep,

673
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:20,020
bring more flavor in our view is why
would you take those naturally occurring

674
00:39:20,021 --> 00:39:23,410
flavors? I was cause they give it
a lovely [inaudible] so, so we're,

675
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:28,400
we're all over the US and uh, uh, one
of our uh, um, our Bravo's involving,

676
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,950
which is a single mall boffing again,

677
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:33,340
we picked 49 and a half percent alcohol
because it delivered the best tape off I

678
00:39:33,341 --> 00:39:34,174
floss.

679
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,940
Hi. Thank you. Um,

680
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:43,650
my question is actually related to
m trans in new product development.

681
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,311
So,
uh,

682
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:49,720
you've touched upon the competition
and that the big brand I tried to steal

683
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:54,820
within the category, but what's also
happening is cross category, um,

684
00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:00,130
major manufacturers and small brands
competing in coming up with great ideas.

685
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:04,270
Like in the UK they've invented
the Collagen based gym,

686
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,750
which is as it was indeed. Yes.

687
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:14,140
I'm wondering what is happening in the
whiskey do because it's quite traditional

688
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:18,820
in terms of taste. Are there any crazy
or interesting ideas coming around?

689
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,300
Well,

690
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,240
because it's such an old industry and
there's lots of rules and regulations,

691
00:40:23,241 --> 00:40:27,650
so you have to operate within.
What's interesting in Ireland,
um, is, uh, the rules,

692
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:28,760
the regulations say a hostile,

693
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:33,761
you matured in wooden barrels for three
years in a day to be legally called

694
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:38,120
Irish whiskey. Um, what if you
go to Scotland? It's old crowns.

695
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,080
So what you're seeing now is people
that are using different types of woods,

696
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:46,010
do you try and impart extra favor?
So chess, most acacia, cherry wood,

697
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,900
we even have experimented with Brazilian
hardwood sustain and be far as,

698
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,580
um, and it's, you know, it's weird.
It's just a weird thing cause it's like,

699
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,030
it just tastes like you have a grand
piano when you put your nose into it.

700
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,870
It's like a pace like that.
Don't ask me how,

701
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:06,770
but I was really weird. Boy. Yo, you
can do dot. Well it's, or you can,

702
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,950
what? We are doing a lot of collaboration
with other spirits producers,

703
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,360
be proper Reese, uh, order,
uh, spirit producers.

704
00:41:13,361 --> 00:41:17,980
So we've used at Casa would have
been used for a Aquavit, uh,

705
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:22,490
for Jim, for, uh, vamoose,
um, for a craft beer,

706
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,870
um, for anything you can imagine. Um,

707
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,440
and you can do it because
that imparts a certain flavor,

708
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:30,170
incent borrow that you can
then extract it into whiskey.

709
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:35,060
You kind odd any flavorings and take
on nothing like natural feelings or

710
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:37,100
anything like that otherwise
can't be classified as whiskey,

711
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,150
but you can basically use a wooden vessel.
Dot.

712
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:43,660
Has been used to age and
mature or something else.

713
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,420
And we do a lot with different types
of wines and stuff like that. So,

714
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:52,380
so we're innovating where we can't
and also you can innovate how you are,

715
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:55,910
um, what raw materials you use
and even the stranger users.

716
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,120
So we're using a combination of
white wine, yeast and traditions,

717
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:03,480
the synergies to produce a very
flavorsome, um, um, these, um,

718
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,870
that you make your spirit form.

719
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,080
Um, okay. So you mentioned, um,

720
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:14,090
how your challenges so far have
been supply base like challenges,

721
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:18,950
but then now moving more to the
demand side. So I'm guessing that, um,

722
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:24,190
you are thinking about how to am increased
demand and one way to do that is by

723
00:42:24,631 --> 00:42:27,600
scaling globally. So how
do you, I'm just curious,

724
00:42:27,601 --> 00:42:32,580
how do you maintain a local
brand and make that good global?

725
00:42:32,581 --> 00:42:37,581
Like how do you stay Quinn's essentially
Irish and chew to your heritage?

726
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:41,250
Like, cause this is a business
that has been inherited, right?

727
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,780
So how do you stay true to that
while I'm having a global appeal?

728
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:50,560
Yeah, it's a, it's a very good question.
Uh, uh, we'd probably be like here,

729
00:42:50,561 --> 00:42:54,440
you guys know local type of
approach in terms of, uh,

730
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,420
what we do here in Dublin.
Uh,

731
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,050
the different things we do to try to
engage your local communities and we try

732
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:05,051
and foster cymbre type of behavior from
our importers around the world to bring

733
00:43:06,831 --> 00:43:10,550
the brand to life. Um,
um, so, uh, you know,

734
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,300
at the core we are definitely
Arash I'm worth Dublin.

735
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,580
And sometimes when you go around
the world, they don't understand.

736
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:21,450
[inaudible] you know, was
dumb. I'm like, you know, they,
you know, you go to, uh, um,

737
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,930
New York and they still think there's
like donkeys going through the reading.

738
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,650
So it's a challenge. It
is a challenge, um, on,

739
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,920
you know what, it's easy if you live
here until understand, you know,

740
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:35,330
what the city is like,
um,

741
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:40,310
to try and capture that in an emotive
way and to bring that internationally.

742
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,870
It's, it's, it's a challenge. And I
wouldn't say we practice what we're,

743
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:44,960
we're working on this.

744
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:49,640
What we do is we have ours people that
we send around the world to represent the

745
00:43:49,641 --> 00:43:50,990
bronze to bring it to life.

746
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:54,740
Brian Fosters a whiskey warriors is and
be like to call them because they're at

747
00:43:54,741 --> 00:43:59,270
the coalface fighting to go
bottle to spread the gospel
of all team meetings, TV.

748
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,360
And that's going into probably
the right type of accounts, uh,

749
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,230
where people take pride in what they sell,
they want to,

750
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:10,190
to learn and then they can tell your
story for you. So, so, um, it's, it's,

751
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,053
it's an ongoing battle,

752
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,300
intriguingly,

753
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,510
purchasing whiskey to being driven by
investment decision rather than for

754
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,344
consumption.

755
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,580
And like couple of days ago
there was an article going viral,

756
00:44:21,581 --> 00:44:25,360
but the Macklin selling for
nearly a million euro. Yeah.

757
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,640
I was wondering for people like us
who can hold whiskey for Niger for 30,

758
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,770
40 years at least,
uh,

759
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,410
what sort of recommendation would you
have in terms of what type of risk we

760
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:36,244
should be purchased?

761
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,980
You also disclosures

762
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,410
just to relate back to your companies.

763
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:47,050
Are there any specific type of a
Teeling whiskey though? Maybe we should,

764
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,770
or you would envisage like
surging and praise going forward?

765
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,610
Uh,
I,

766
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:56,840
I always encourage people to at least
buy two bottles so they can drink one

767
00:44:56,841 --> 00:45:01,820
o'clock. The other one. But the core of
our range, we make risky used to be drunk.

768
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,420
Whiskey is for me, you know,
it's, it's, it's, it's joy.

769
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,330
It's social boy open and drink it.

770
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:13,020
And we positioned our core range so that
it wouldn't got her dose than people's,

771
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:17,090
uh, drinks cabinet. It was, you know,
it's, it's an affordable option.

772
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:22,350
So at the core, that's what we're all
about. Uh, what as a category, um,

773
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:27,290
uh, Irish whiskey is, is, is booming. It's
growing ahead of everyone's expectation.

774
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:32,270
So the ability to, to sell
older expressions is going
to become more limited.

775
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,530
You know, as more and more
collectors come in, then the, the,

776
00:45:36,531 --> 00:45:38,000
there's going to be a high appreciation.

777
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:41,210
And what we're seeing is a lot of interest
in the newer distilleries like tingle

778
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,140
in order,
things like that.

779
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,680
People are just buying to sell
on and it seems to be working.

780
00:45:45,681 --> 00:45:47,600
But is it a house of cards?
Any sentence,

781
00:45:47,601 --> 00:45:50,830
three children and he's going to
implode. I don't know. Um, but, uh,

782
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:55,360
I think anything that has, it's like
a bit of liquid history. Um, um,

783
00:45:55,390 --> 00:46:00,390
on some of the older expressions I would
expect and I can't guarantee that they

784
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:04,610
should appreciate and value as more and
more collectors come into the category

785
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,200
as the, as, as it gets bigger.
So it's still at the early
stages. I remember five,

786
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:11,370
10 years ago,
no one really collected Irish whiskey.

787
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,260
Now you go online and there's massive
communities that are all talking about it,

788
00:46:15,261 --> 00:46:19,680
but it's still small rounds at the Scotch
or jumping knees. Um, and I was, uh,

789
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:24,240
we auctioned off our very first release
from the distillery on whiskey option

790
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:25,330
here,
like Hamas Scottish one.

791
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:29,120
And we did it because he wants me to
achieve the highest price so we can give

792
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:33,650
all the proceeds back to local charities
and so it gives something back.

793
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:36,320
Um,
and our bottom number one,

794
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:39,410
which is a tree year old whiskey
sold for 10,000 pounds starting,

795
00:46:39,411 --> 00:46:42,650
which I thought was great,
but um, on average the,

796
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,090
they went for six and her parents as well.

797
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:48,590
But that's a once off never to were faces
are commercial release of our single

798
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:53,250
potstill will be coming out in October,
November of Botswana. Uh, will be price,

799
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:58,010
hopefully reasonably in offering a 50,
55 year olds. So again, drinkable. Um,

800
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,100
but uh, if you were to put away a
bottle, I did recommend that one.

801
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:04,320
Yeah.

802
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,460
Thank you so much Jack.

803
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:08,790
I never knew like coming to whiskey
Sakata Kuwait and nuggets for life.

804
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:13,530
Drink less, drink better. How have your
yeah, I'm so do less. Do Better. Yeah,

805
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,890
just anything less do it better.

806
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:20,540
I cannot choose. You asked the best
question. You don't have to be.

807
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:28,370
Thank you.
