1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,360
This is fun guy. These are some
of the 1.5 million types of fungi.

2
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,730
There's, here's the humongous
world of fungus fungi,

3
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,950
but one of the first organisms on earth,
billions of years ago,

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,570
fun guy or their own kingdom. They're
not animals, plants or bacteria.

5
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,130
Fungi live everywhere. Space
stations, deserts, deserts,

6
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,810
Antarctica, nuclear reactors. There's
plenty of shrew for all fungi.

7
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,820
Every day you walk on mushroom Mycelium,
not just mushrooms, root system,

8
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,330
mycelium communicates
information, transfers, nutrients.

9
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,930
It also builds soil that gives
life to all plants on earth.

10
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,540
Here is fun guy saving the world.

11
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,810
This is fun guys saving you.
There's fun guy for relaxation,

12
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,940
concentration,
energy and immune support.

13
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,190
This is you on shrooms tapping into
the humongous world. The fungus.

14
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,790
When I say to someone that I'm interested
in mushrooms or that I had a mushroom

15
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:16,370
company,
you get often few kinds of reactions.

16
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:21,080
Some are like I talking magic
mushrooms or and some are like gross.

17
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,940
I don't like the flavor of mushrooms and,

18
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,980
and some are really excited
for various reasons and but,

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,280
but they are a kingdom as you saw on the
video. And when something is a kingdom,

20
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,410
that means that there's a lot
of different kinds of things.

21
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:37,490
So if you think of all the
animals to live on earth,

22
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,870
there's quite a few kinds just in mammals
compare a Chihuahua and a blue whale

23
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,310
and they're drastically different,
right? And if you compare even plants,

24
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:47,600
not all plants are good for you.

25
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:50,030
I know obviously plant based
diet is right now a big thing,

26
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:50,811
a lot of people on it,

27
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:54,100
but a lot of plans will kill you
and mushrooms are no different.

28
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,300
Some of them will hurt you,
some of them will heal you.

29
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,080
And just to kind of get the
mushroom lingo out of the way,

30
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,260
mushroom is actually what
is called the fruiting body.

31
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,210
And fungi is a kingdom, right?
Fun guys like the umbrella.

32
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,940
But often people,
when they talk about the fungi kingdom,

33
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:14,030
they talk about mushrooms. But mushroom
is actually like the fruiting body.

34
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:18,890
So let's think of an apple
tree, for example, that fruit,

35
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:21,200
the actual apple would be
the fruiting body here.

36
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:23,110
That's the part that is
visible and you will eat.

37
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,810
It usually gets reproduced annually.
What some exceptions.

38
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,640
And then the rooting system,
which is often referred to as mycelium,

39
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,760
was also like high fade,
like an early Beta version of it.

40
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,890
But my psyllium is like the, the actual
apple tree itself, the bark and the roots,

41
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:43,280
right?
And there's a lot of mycelium underground.

42
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,150
So wherever you will go around the world,
they will be mycelium underground.

43
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,240
And then sometimes you'll see
these fruiting bodies popping up.

44
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,160
And the mycelium is really
important for environment.

45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,610
And then my sale, the fruiting
body can be really helpful for us.

46
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,800
So since there's mycelium everywhere,
it serves a big purpose.

47
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,500
So about 2.4 billion years ago.

48
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,330
So if the earth is 4.24
point 5 billion years old,

49
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:13,030
2.4 billion years ago,
um,

50
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,320
my mushrooms or fungi came
from the seed to the dry land.

51
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,490
And what's actually fascinating about
mushrooms to me is that they're actually

52
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:23,140
very similar to animals.

53
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,210
So we're way closer as humans
to mushrooms than we are to,

54
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:31,700
for example, plants for example. Um,

55
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,940
mushrooms cannot produce their own food
through photosynthesis like plants can

56
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,030
they have to eat something.
By the way,

57
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:45,031
they also breathe oxygen and expel
CO2 just like just like animals.

58
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,520
But they need to eat something.
And since nothing else grew on dry land,

59
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:51,820
mushrooms decided to for a little
over a billion years eat rocks.

60
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,980
So they're survivors, you know. And then
later as plans were entered into the,

61
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:58,150
into to Earth,

62
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,140
the mushrooms help the plants to collect
water and nutrients from the soil.

63
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,460
And that happens still today.

64
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:08,461
So almost all plans that you will eat
have used fungi to collect water and

65
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:11,350
nutrients.
But this is not a biology lesson.

66
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,380
I'm not here to talk to you for
hours and hours about fun guy.

67
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,200
Some of you might find it fascinating,
some of you might not,

68
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:20,860
but just wanted to give you kind of
a quick overview. And the spores are,

69
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,330
by the way,
those are the seeds.

70
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,650
So you go from the rooting
system to the fruiting body.

71
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,270
The fruiting body will produce spores.

72
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:31,240
Boards are like the seeds and then the
sports will fly away and produce more.

73
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,310
Hi Faye and mycelium. So that's kind
of the lifecycle of a mushroom. Um,

74
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,760
my company four sigmatic is focused
on these functional mushrooms.

75
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:43,420
Those are like healthy mushrooms, often
sometimes known as medicinal mushrooms.

76
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:46,590
But since medicinal marijuana,
that's often a bad labeled.

77
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:49,840
These are completely legal safe,
nothing to do with psychedelics.

78
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,420
So that's why I prefer the
word functional mushrooms.

79
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,620
And these functional mushrooms are
all often also called adaptogens.

80
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,880
How many have heard the word
adaptogen? Could good bunch. Okay.

81
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,770
So this is right now really trendy.
It's actually not that a new of a concept.

82
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:07,000
It's just become very popular.

83
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:11,500
So adaptogen research started in
the Soviet Union for the army.

84
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,510
Um, what the army figured out, and this
is by the way, not just the Soviet army.

85
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:17,870
I had to go to,
I'm from originally,

86
00:05:17,871 --> 00:05:19,930
if I'm thin then and I had
to go to the Finnish army.

87
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,920
At the same thing is in certain situations
the soldiers that given stimulants

88
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,070
amphetamine. For example, if
you're, I was in the air force,

89
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:29,920
you fly in a fighter jet,
you crash on an enemy territory,

90
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,430
pump you up a little effort to me in
and try to run as far as you can in the

91
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:35,710
next 24 hours. They'll hopefully
you'll be saved after that.

92
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,380
But what happens is that you
have a little bit of a let down,

93
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,660
a lighter version of a stimulant might
be like Adderall con lighter compared to

94
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:48,310
amphetamine or caffeine that
we often consume all the
time, right? So the Russian,

95
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,960
uh, with the Soviets were like, Hey,

96
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:54,280
is there anything else that we could
take which would perform performance,

97
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:55,091
maybe not as much,

98
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:59,420
but will improve performance that wouldn't
give you the let down the next day.

99
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,470
And they send this doctor,
Doctor Zirov, the research,

100
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:08,180
few things and loss of studied the best
things that he could find in the world

101
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:11,600
and came up with five things
that he thought were adaptogens.

102
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,560
And the word adaptogen comes from the
fact that it's helps you to adapt to

103
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:16,460
stressors.

104
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,310
So it helps you to adapt to stressors
and hopefully it will not give you a let

105
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:26,660
down. So I know something to be an
adaptogen, it needs three things.

106
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,500
It's non habit forming
means it's not addictive.

107
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,630
If something is addictive,
it cannot be an adaptogen,

108
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:37,970
didn't have to be something you could
take every day safely and you don't get

109
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:42,710
used to it. Secondly,
it is restores balance.

110
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,960
So erosion restores balance in your body.
And then finally it's nonspecific,

111
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:51,380
which is often, sometimes hard if you
have a scientific mind to figure out.

112
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,040
Cause scientific studies are usually
done on one single variable, one marker.

113
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,750
And when something is nonspecific,

114
00:06:56,751 --> 00:07:00,350
it can help with the brain and the immune
function. And that can be complicated.

115
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,190
And that's where it's often in health,
like hormones for example,

116
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:05,560
or even though you have a
marker like testosterone,

117
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,200
it's sometimes complicated because
hormones go up and down, you pull a lever,

118
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,180
another one goes up or a doubt, right?
But that's what an adapted in Zuora.

119
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,610
That's what some of these best mushrooms
are as well. And these are, um,

120
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,070
kind of my passion. I would say. I'm,

121
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,010
I love fun guy and I love
the biology of fun guy,

122
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:26,750
but I'm mostly interested in is
what can the fun guy do for you?

123
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,000
How can it improve your cognitive
function, your immune system,

124
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,090
your skin?
Um,

125
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,290
I've been running my business
now for about seven years.

126
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,910
Normally I'd been traveling 40 to 60
times a year and during that time I've

127
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:44,780
lived in,

128
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,790
in the last 10 years I've lived in 10
countries and I've not been sick in 11

129
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,430
years. And one of the reasons
why I have to thank is,

130
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,460
is the use of adaptogens and
mushrooms for immune system.

131
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,870
But back to my story,
so I was brought up in Finland.

132
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,020
I'm a 13th generation farmer and
mushroom enthusiast and I was brought,

133
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,550
brought up to learn about
mushrooms through my mom,

134
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:11,840
my mom when I was like Yay high with my
brother. We went foraging for mushrooms.

135
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,140
And one of the first things that people
get wrong about mushrooms that they're

136
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:17,870
always grow in the ground.
They actually also grow on trees.

137
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,900
This is the Chaga mushroom
that we also use an uh,

138
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:24,560
the mushroom coffee that is outside.
And a lot of them are hard.

139
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:27,200
You can't eat them.
Actually you should not eat mushrooms raw.

140
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,410
Does the General Fund,

141
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,790
whatever mushroom we're talking about
don't have them rock cause they have this

142
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:35,900
structure called team that is
we humans are not really good at

143
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,260
absorbing. And there we lack
this enzyme. Um, think of a,

144
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:46,040
the shell of a lobster is made out of
Chitin so try eating a lobster shelf.

145
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,350
Not Good.
So you kind of have to process it.

146
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,120
But they are these beautiful creatures.

147
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:52,910
Most people just think of that
classic mushroom shape with the,

148
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,400
with which I showed you with the stem
and the cap and there's so many different

149
00:08:56,401 --> 00:09:00,840
shapes and sizes,
different types of mushrooms and,

150
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,990
and some of the best ones growing trees.

151
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,000
Cause like I mentioned mushrooms like
animals, they need something to eat.

152
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,780
And often when people ask me like what
should you eat? What's a healthy diet?

153
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,750
I joked to them is that you
should eat dirt and trees.

154
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,140
The healthiest thing you can eat is
dirt and trees. Unfortunately not,

155
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,110
we're not equipped to
assimilate either of them.

156
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,690
So we need to eat something
that has eaten them.

157
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:29,691
So things that grow in the soil that had
minerals and then can get the good gut

158
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:35,040
biome from the soil into our body.
And also trees are incredibly healthy.

159
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,430
So obviously from maple
syrup to pine pollen,

160
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,600
but also these tree mushrooms that
serves so many different functions.

161
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,540
Um,
this is called Turkey tail.

162
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,960
This was called Rishi and a lot of
the mushroom names are a little exotic

163
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:55,320
cordyceps, which is used for
performance. That is the lion's mane.

164
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,610
This is right now one of the most popular
mushrooms in the U S it's a Toyota to

165
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:02,310
help with focus and cognitive function.

166
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,170
And it's funny how they look as well
is like lion's mane. Um, looks like a,

167
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,140
I guess like a main of alliance.
So that's how it's named that way.

168
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,600
But um,

169
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,590
my fascination with these is
mostly through the health benefits.

170
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,950
Like you saw in the beginning, video
mushrooms are used in almost have of,

171
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:25,050
of the pharmaceuticals out there.
Penicillin is the one you would know.

172
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:30,051
But out of the 20 best selling drugs and
and about 10 utilize fungi and they can

173
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:34,530
be used to clean oil spills. They can, uh,

174
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,460
help remove diesel from the
soil. Um, they can eat plastic.

175
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,680
Few years ago we found a
mushroom that eats plastic.

176
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,990
Plastic has been around a hundred,
hundred and 20 years.

177
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:47,940
And so far we haven't figured out what
kind of Wa wa does it a composed or not,

178
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,020
we don't know yet,

179
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:51,810
but we found a mushroom that likes to
eat it and then we can eat the mushroom

180
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:56,610
and it has health benefits.
But I think the environmental change is,

181
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,640
it's hard to change the world
through the environmental impact.

182
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,290
It's hard to change the
world to sometimes, um,

183
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,140
a lot of like very esoteric topics.

184
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,530
But what often people are first
interested in, hey, what can I do today?

185
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:13,560
The field good today, right. And
mushrooms can help with that.

186
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,560
Here's a little chart that
shows a mushroom Chaga,

187
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:21,630
which is this one girl was on a birch
tree. It grows for a 10 to 25 years.

188
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,620
So very slowly. And Birch has these
healthy compounds like Betalin and beds,

189
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,580
folinic acid. That's why if you
go to Finland or Russia, you get,

190
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:31,560
he hit yourself with birch leaves because
they have these healthy oils and the

191
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:35,820
bark and that kind of the mushroom kind
of eats them and then gets them in a

192
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,560
form that then we can utilize.

193
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,630
And the amount of antioxidants as
quite incredible. So antioxidants are,

194
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,980
are one of the things that are most
proven for general health and wellness in

195
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:50,460
the world. It's kind of a buzzy word.
People don't really know what it means,

196
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:54,260
but there are color pigments.
Not all color pigments are antioxidants,

197
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,590
but all antioxidants are color pigments.

198
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,450
It's like the champagne thing with the
sparkling wine and all sparkling wine,

199
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,470
champagne bottle, champagne
and sparkling wine, right?

200
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,830
And these color pigments can
help with cardiovascular health.

201
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,750
They can help protect our immune system.

202
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:11,650
A lot of the most common ways how people
die today and they can really help with,

203
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,160
um,
longevity and um,

204
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,050
and people off the internet
loves to debate Wah Wah.

205
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,090
Antioxidants are good and what they're on,
what has the highest amount,

206
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:25,420
but just for the sake, the two big
bubbles are how two different ways,

207
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:28,240
how you can press it,
process a wild Siberian Chaga,

208
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,050
and then you have some of the other
more antioxidant rich foods from dark

209
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,730
chocolate too aside Barry.

210
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,900
And this gives you an idea how abundant
these mushrooms are in these nutrients

211
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,320
and how potentially you
could benefit from them.

212
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,900
And that's chart on how to use them.

213
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,620
So mushrooms are often
used for most people.

214
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:51,700
They're used in like pizza or pasta or
something like the very narrow focus.

215
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:56,140
People mostly focus on Porta Bella and
like crimeny type mushrooms may be she

216
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:58,810
talkie and she talk is a good mushroom,

217
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,180
but a lot of these culinary
mushrooms are not that good.

218
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,310
They grow in the ground and
they're not that nutrient dense.

219
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:07,300
They're kind of like mass produced. Think
of like your normal culinary mushrooms,

220
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:11,530
almost like, like iceberg
lettuce versus a Rugala, right?

221
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,330
There's nothing wrong
with iceberg lettuce,

222
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,310
but the clearly nettle or dandelion
or Rugala has a lot more, you know,

223
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,270
punch and the same with
mushrooms. And, um,

224
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,170
when we talk about, um,
generally about mushrooms,

225
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,720
it's like anything is
like you have really good,

226
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:31,450
really average and then really bad things.

227
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,750
And that's where actually my company and
four sigmatic also stems from is just

228
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:38,290
geeky out of math.
So if you take all the worlds foods,

229
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,930
there's roughly like let's say 1.8 million
things you can eat and you put it on

230
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:44,740
a bell curve,
get and compared their nutrient density,

231
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,240
it will form a normal distribution.

232
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:48,490
And this is normally a science
including natural sciences.

233
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:51,290
If you take a large enough sample size,
you look at single variable.

234
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,990
I see how tall are people or,
or how,

235
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:57,280
what is their Iq tends to
form an Olam and distribution,

236
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,550
the food side of the same. And if you
look at their nutrient dense city,

237
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,250
most foods are just normal good.
Some,

238
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,200
some are like solid health foods
and then some foods are kind of bad,

239
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,980
right?
And if you go for a standard deviations,

240
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:14,470
which I know sigmas they go
four standard deviations,

241
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:19,030
you get to the top 50 foods in the world,
right? And out of those top 50 foods,

242
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,440
there are things like lemon, black
pepper, cinnamon, coconut, green tea,

243
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,570
a Cacau, things that, you know,

244
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:29,590
then there's foods that you might know
like turmeric or gin sang or Makkah.

245
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,020
And then there's really foods
that very few people know,

246
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:35,110
like the Reishi mushroom
more stragglers route. And I,

247
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,470
I'm just passionate about the things that
are the most currently scientifically

248
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,210
studied foods.
And funny enough,

249
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:43,810
those tend to be also the foods that
have been used the longest throughout

250
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,740
different cultures.

251
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:48,940
So every part of the world tends to
have their own like foods that they've

252
00:14:48,941 --> 00:14:51,030
elevated to kind of,
um,

253
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,990
a sacred status over multiple generations.

254
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:58,340
And every generation after that has
thought that that food is special for some

255
00:14:58,341 --> 00:14:58,880
reason.

256
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,620
So if you go to Bali or Costa Rica or
you go to Finland and Russia or you go to

257
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,000
Africa, you will find certain
foods are elevated over others.

258
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,630
And that's what I'm most passionate
about. And out of those 50, about 10,

259
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:16,580
our mushrooms, that's our farm
where I grew up. And I think the,

260
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,710
besides the health benefits of mushrooms,

261
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,160
the one thing that I really want to
kind of leave you today with is just

262
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:26,030
generally about how what it
takes to do something new.

263
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,320
I feel like the talk,

264
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,910
the topic was like how to dirt moved
from dirt to gold and I think that's the

265
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:36,140
lesson that I've learned over the years
of coming from a small farm in Finland

266
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:37,250
to Venice Beach,

267
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:41,450
California and building a business and
creating companies like understanding

268
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:45,440
that in order to create
value or capture value,

269
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,250
you have to see on devalued things.

270
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,111
Okay,

271
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:56,111
so any form of business beat
investing or something else,

272
00:15:56,601 --> 00:16:01,601
you're trying to find an acid or a thing
that has more value than other people

273
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:05,870
think. Like you think the stock is
worth $10 but the market things,

274
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:09,890
it's $5 if you buy it at five you think
eventually the market will know it's

275
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:14,810
worth 10 right? The same with if you
start a business or you have an idea,

276
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,740
you try to find something that
others don't yet see or they see it,

277
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:21,350
but they don't understand the
true value and power of it.

278
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,370
So probably let's say Google in the early
days there were people who thought, oh,

279
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:28,070
search engine, it has value,
right? It's some value.

280
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,930
But then people didn't see what's the
implications of having that value and how

281
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:34,910
you can transport it to other factors.

282
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,730
And then investors are Google
probably made, you know,

283
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,470
good profit by seeing that it
was an undervalued asset. Right?

284
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,880
So I'm from,
uh,

285
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,530
I'm from a town of maybe like 150
people and I'm there, you know,

286
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:50,480
like I didn't travel growing up and I,

287
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:54,200
my dream is to get Americans to drinking
mushrooms. That's a pretty radical idea,

288
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:58,460
right? So it's like I came here, I
had started the business and I'm like,

289
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,540
I told everyone is like,
hey,

290
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,210
I want to get the whole of
America drinking mushrooms.

291
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:05,030
Cause that's the most ancient way of
actually consuming these tree mushrooms.

292
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:07,760
And I know their benefits
and people like you're crazy.

293
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,670
Nobody drinks mushrooms
around here. Right? So,

294
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:13,160
but I believed in it,

295
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,550
which is kind of one of the three tips
I want to leave you guys today with from

296
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:20,180
the business side is if,
if if you want to achieve anything,

297
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,900
you have to be super passionate
about it and believe in it.

298
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,680
And the second thing is that hopefully
whatever you do is based on some first

299
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:29,360
principles with me it was science,

300
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:31,490
understanding the research
amount of mushrooms,

301
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,280
understanding their history and
their culture implications and also

302
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:39,110
understanding how to prepare them. And
so you, you can't just make up stuff.

303
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,310
It needs to be based on some sort
of like first principle or a logic.

304
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:48,050
And then finally is like as you
start building the business,

305
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,710
um,
you know,

306
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:53,650
forget remembering why you started this
is I was a couple of weeks ago in lap

307
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,770
plan with bunch of friends.
Um,

308
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,780
it was minus 39 degrees and went to
frozen water. It's actually below,

309
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,690
it's like 25 degrees. There's a
stream that keeps the water open.

310
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,370
Like this is the culture.

311
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:08,520
Why I started the business is the
Finnish culture and the culture of like a

312
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:13,110
natural living. And then I moved to
California to build the business.

313
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:16,440
And sometimes the life here is not
as natural as it was at a farm,

314
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,790
but it's like really important for me as
I go to remind myself why I started the

315
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,810
business. So, um, uh,
this is the he culture.

316
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,220
This is the only indigenous
culture in Europe. Um, uh,

317
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,450
partly partly in Finland as well.

318
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,660
And how they use mushrooms is one of
the sources of inspiration for me.

319
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:37,350
And here's examples of products that
we do like mushroom coffee and mushroom

320
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:41,670
chocolate lattes won this tonics.
And,

321
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,700
and one of the reasons why
we do this is that mushrooms,

322
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:47,070
the healthy mushrooms don't
taste anything like Portabella.

323
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:50,730
They actually tastes very bitter and
most Americans don't like bitter.

324
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:53,910
So when I came here and I
made like mushroom tea, people
are like, this is gross.

325
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,300
I first of all, I don't like tea.
Second meat, I don't like this flavor.

326
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,540
So I had to kind of reverse engineer
and figure out what are the bitters that

327
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,360
Americans like or most angle
section culture is like.

328
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:06,750
And I figured out there's only a
couple coffee and chocolate, um,

329
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,050
black coffee and dark chocolate with some
of the only bidders that were commonly

330
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:11,520
available to people.

331
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,870
So using those pallets and those delivery
systems as incorporating into people's

332
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:20,660
lives. But um, to kind of recap, um,

333
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,800
just some of the books I've written,

334
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,790
one about the history of the
Samei people want cook book,

335
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:31,350
how to use mushrooms and, and about
the top 10 mushrooms. But to recap,

336
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,460
kind of my talk is, um, I believe in the
power of mushrooms. I think they're, uh,

337
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,600
uh,
an organism much smarter than we realize.

338
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,980
I think they're an undervalued and
that's why I'm also excited to build a

339
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:47,100
business around them.
I believe a lot in their power for myself,

340
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:50,460
but also I believe that you should focus
on doing something that is undervalued

341
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:55,560
and getting people to understand the
value. Then that's also smart business.

342
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,430
Um, I think if you want to
learn more about mushrooms,

343
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,680
there's a lot of resource
that you can go to. I can rip,

344
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,410
highlight too few books and um,

345
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,710
and learning methods how are
you can learn about them.

346
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,540
And I think in the next 10 years we'll
see multiple different research coming

347
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:16,410
out from mushrooms for health benefits,
for cognitive function, for immune system.

348
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,680
That I think will shock a lot of people.
And uh,

349
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,650
that gets me excited every day to
just start building four. Sigmatic.

350
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,140
But with that,
um,

351
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:30,170
if you have any questions about the
health benefits on forcing Madec or the

352
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,940
mushrooms in general,
if you have questions on,

353
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,450
on anything mushroom related,
happy to take it.

354
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,410
Yeah. This isn't about mushrooms, but, um,

355
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:48,400
seals eat mushrooms. Does that
mean snails are healthy too? Um,

356
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,940
yes and no. So not big as they eat
mushrooms. That's not the reason.

357
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,650
So there's sort of mammals that eat
mushrooms, bears, deer, rabbits,

358
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,170
they're sort of insects
that eat mushrooms.

359
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,190
That doesn't mean that that's
why that species is good for you.

360
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,480
But I would say generally, uh, we
are very focused as a culture on,

361
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,700
on large mammals that have flesh.

362
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,650
This is like a complete
separate topics from health.

363
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,040
We're really obsessed about just
eating few types of animals.

364
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,180
So that classic debate is
[inaudible] animals with,

365
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:25,190
shoot I not I'd animals but often it's
coming from a lens of eating mostly large

366
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:28,870
mammals that are very domesticated,
that are almost always female.

367
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,340
We almost own the EAD women.
So, uh, we don't eat bull,

368
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:36,550
we eat the cow,
we don't eat like a boar.

369
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:39,070
We the female a chicken the same.

370
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:43,330
We don't eat the rooster and we very
highly processed animals and we don't even

371
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:45,070
eat the whole piece of that animal.

372
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,730
We mostly focused on the flesh
part versus like the liver and the,

373
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,740
the eyeballs and all
the things that people,

374
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:54,520
most people think it's gross is actually
like really nutrient dense and a lot of

375
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,780
insects and smaller animals tend to be
healthier actually cause they're lower in

376
00:21:58,781 --> 00:21:59,411
the food chain.

377
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:03,940
So you tend to be like the Lord you're
in the food chain and early you are the

378
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:04,780
cleaner it is.

379
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:08,200
Or if you go further in the food chain
and you go to bigger animals or even

380
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,930
bigger fish, you have to be
more careful about the quality.

381
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:13,540
So it's usually safer to eat
a small fish than a big fish,

382
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,640
but you really have to know
what the big fish is coming. So,

383
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,910
but it's not because they eat mushrooms.
That's why snails a healthy,

384
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:19,960
they just are.

385
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,463
Yeah.

386
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,770
Can you pass the mic to,
you can throw it.

387
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:32,700
I uh, thanks for the talk. Yeah. Uh,
you raised the point about bitterness.

388
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:37,460
Uh, I was just wondering like,
have you found yourself, uh,

389
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,960
compromising and the healthiness of the
mushrooms by like adding sugar at any

390
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,750
point or,
yeah,

391
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:49,650
most of our products don't have sugar and
I don't really believe in adding sugar,

392
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:50,760
especially processed sugar.

393
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,250
We have a couple products
that have coconut palm sugar,

394
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:57,540
about two grams per serving. Awesome. And
coconut palm sugar is a lot healthier,

395
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:58,470
has more minerals.

396
00:22:58,471 --> 00:23:02,610
And is it more kind of diabetic friendly
but don't believe in adding sugar?

397
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,240
We use things like monk fruit and
Stevia and certain products and certain

398
00:23:06,241 --> 00:23:07,620
products or just unsweetened,

399
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,520
it's kind of this healthy balance of
like knowing where the market is and

400
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:15,120
knowing where you want to get to. Right.
And kind of like bridging the gap.

401
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,150
So let's assume you want really
technology. I'm from Finn than we are.

402
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:22,860
We love like, like my SQL and
leanings and all this stuff.

403
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:26,360
Lean never really got big
accepting servers just because
partly because they use

404
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:30,730
are in the phase was it was not
the easiest to use. Right. And um,

405
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,660
and,
or even know Kia where our farm is,

406
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,740
is like think of Nokia leading the mobile
technology and then apple taking over.

407
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:38,880
And it's partly because apple is just,

408
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,210
iPhone was just so much easier
to use for most people. Right.

409
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,800
And Nokia's weren't always not.
And the same here is like,

410
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:49,010
if my dream is to get here,
but consumers are here,

411
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,480
how do I meet them in the middle?

412
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:53,330
How do I make a product that is a little
more bitter than what they're used to?

413
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:57,130
A little less sweet, a little less
artificial. Still healthy. Yeah.

414
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,500
But I kind of meet them because
without compliance there's no change.

415
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,700
There's no like you can buy a pass
to the gym but you feed never go.

416
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:09,560
It doesn't help you. So rather do
a shitty workout than no workout.

417
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,610
So in this case the same thing.
But yeah, I wouldn't add, um,

418
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I wouldn't add much sugar or any sugar
to these products because I think it

419
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,810
jeopardizes the main function,

420
00:24:20,811 --> 00:24:24,290
which is kind of being more like anti
inflammatory and protecting the immune

421
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:27,170
system. And when you add
the sugars and sweeteners,

422
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,850
it can kind of do the opposite.

423
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,760
Mushrooms can also balanced
blood sugar and support, um, um,

424
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,240
blood sugar management.
So when you kind of do that,

425
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:38,540
it kind of counterbalances the benefit.
So. Yeah. That's great. Thanks. Yeah,

426
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,260
so I've heard a formulating new products
and bring them to market is like a

427
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:50,261
multi year process and it takes
a lot of r and D and energy for.

428
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,260
Um,
I'm curious,

429
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,720
you have a lot of different products
that keep seeing new stuff that you

430
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,400
introduce quite regularly.

431
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,870
How long is your design process,

432
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,640
by the way? Thank you for
asking that. The, you're the
first person to ever ask it.

433
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:10,090
I'm very passionate about this topic.
So I'm the, like the product founders.

434
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:14,200
If we will be a tech company, I would
be like loving to make the code myself.

435
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:17,200
And I'm like, this is a really a
topic that I could talk for days.

436
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:21,110
So you're right, most of the people take
multiple years to build a product. Uh,

437
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,970
for us,

438
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,260
my goal is two months realistically
where three but it's still drastically

439
00:25:26,261 --> 00:25:27,490
shorter than for most people.

440
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,930
And that requires a few fundamental things
to be in place to innovate so quickly.

441
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,670
So obviously like sourcing ingredients,
any ingredients that are going to use,

442
00:25:36,671 --> 00:25:37,960
you have to be really good at that.

443
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,980
So you have to have a baseline
infrastructure of like, hey dude,

444
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,070
why do you get products?

445
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,150
But that's still like somewhat easy to
solve where most even large companies

446
00:25:46,151 --> 00:25:49,360
take years to develop a product
and they don't succeed with it.

447
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,510
And I think one of the
key things why we've been
successful in a short while, um,

448
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:58,480
building products is a couple
of fundamental things that
I think is transferable

449
00:25:58,481 --> 00:26:02,200
to any industry, any product,
any situation. First of all,

450
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,580
being close to the end consumer,
right? Lot of people who,

451
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:10,060
especially large companies try to
create products from an ivory tower.

452
00:26:10,061 --> 00:26:13,380
They send out surveys and
focus groups and whatever,

453
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,600
try to figure out what's the trend.

454
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,580
They read reports and I think
they're already from them.

455
00:26:18,581 --> 00:26:23,581
They're behind the curve versus every day
engaging with the consumer and knowing

456
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:27,220
what's out on the market and
listening to their needs and wishes.

457
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:31,150
So we do tons of community work
in person, uh, to meet people,

458
00:26:31,151 --> 00:26:33,040
to talk with them and
being in that interface.

459
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,540
So whatever you're trying to build,

460
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:39,750
the more time you can spend or actually
even be the consumer who I think ims as

461
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:44,310
well as everyday using these products
myself is easier. The R and D is,

462
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,220
and the more removed you
are from the end consumer,

463
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:51,390
target consumer or that lifestyle or
the industry, whatever the harder days,

464
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:55,140
right? Sometimes you can get too
close to it. Yes. But nevertheless,

465
00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:56,760
like the closer you are to interface.

466
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:01,910
So I could come out with 20 to 30 product
ideas in an hour just by looking my

467
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:07,350
own lifestyle in different parts
of my day, a week, a month,

468
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:11,430
a year, and figure out where the gaps,
where I need optimal performance.

469
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:16,431
So where do I need a boost and enhance
a support and it would be so easy.

470
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,130
And then you kind of pick your
battles like what is easy to execute,

471
00:27:20,131 --> 00:27:21,300
why has big upside?

472
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,600
And then the other thing that is very few
people have is it besides the customer

473
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:31,380
proximity or the customer interface with
with products is that they think they

474
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:32,310
have to be right.

475
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,870
And I think even our best products
are currently best selling products.

476
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:41,220
I've gone through multiple iterations and
I think if you remove your ego and you

477
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:45,840
just have like, Hey, I have a thesis.
This is what I hope to get eye health,

478
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,400
gut health. Okay. I think most people
that gut is messed up because a, B,

479
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:54,270
and c and this time of the day they
need support. Hey, this is my idea.

480
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,360
Let's bring this light to make
healthy lemonade, whatever it is,

481
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,400
and then you're trying to innovate for it.

482
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,970
And then he'd come with the concept
of the market. You let people try it,

483
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,810
they give you feedback and then you
iterate. Most large companies especially,

484
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:10,710
they want to get the product be so
good from the get go and probably,

485
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:15,270
I mean Gmail or something like that has
gone through seemingly so similar calm

486
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:18,750
through, you know, hundreds of thousands
of iterations over the years. Right?

487
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,580
And that's us how it is.

488
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:23,190
And I think most people try to
get a perfect product from the,

489
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,900
from the beginning.
And that's a big failure.

490
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:29,240
So we have a big direct to
consumer business besides
the retail business with um,

491
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:34,370
whole foods and Erewhon and Sephora
and whoever we work with. Um,

492
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:38,130
but with that online kind of like
email list and our community,

493
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,900
we can test products really
quickly and within like 30 days,

494
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:45,750
we saw how many people bought it.
We can send them a survey,

495
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:48,090
ask them what they think
in 45 days to 60 days.

496
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:51,270
We know how many people have those repeat
purchases and then we already have a

497
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,160
good baseline understanding
of how to make it better.

498
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,370
So being really close to the customer
and not being scared to fail or be ready

499
00:28:58,531 --> 00:28:59,220
to iterate,

500
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:04,220
like we assume that we will not get it
right and we assume that we need to tweak

501
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,450
it and amended over the ghost.

502
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:10,170
And we also assume that some of them like
have the products will be discontinued

503
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:11,004
at some point.

504
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,580
You're more likely to create
more innovation versus if
you're always scared to

505
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:18,150
fail, then you're kind of be
frozen and you try to perfect it.

506
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,390
So I don't know if that helped with that.
Yeah.

507
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:26,100
Yeah. Hey, uh,

508
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,110
I got here a little late so I don't
know if he covered the salary,

509
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,420
but that's like, um, what was, uh,

510
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,340
some of your biggest challenges to
like growth in the early stages?

511
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:37,890
Like getting your first customer.
Like what did that look like?

512
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:42,010
What did you switch? Should have you
spent more time, which should have you

513
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,510
de prioritized, I guess getting
through that initial hurdle where you,

514
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,060
no one knows who four sigmatic
is suddenly, you know,

515
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,820
you have your first customer,
what does that look like? Sure.

516
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,360
So I started the company in Europe and
then when I brought it to us, so I have,

517
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,410
I have to go twice through the process
when I was like first getting the first

518
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:02,380
customer in Europe and then came to the
u s and nobody cares about what you did

519
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:06,220
in Europe that Americans just don't care
at all. So he kind of had to restart.

520
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,750
So when I started in Europe,

521
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,470
it was actually really easy for me to
get the first customers because I was in

522
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:14,770
that industry and I had tons of friends.
So the first 50 to a hundred people,

523
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,960
I was just like friends
that people I knew,

524
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,080
which is really valuable because you
get really get feedback really quickly.

525
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,850
But he was a lot harder to scale.

526
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:24,070
So in Europe it was easy
to get initial traction,

527
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:25,480
but then harder to scale for us.

528
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,650
And some of the things I spend a lot of
time focusing in on is the ingredient

529
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:32,200
and sourcing,
which is like the geeking out part.

530
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,960
And unfortunately in most
consumers don't care.

531
00:30:34,961 --> 00:30:39,070
But it was important for me to know
that I had like the best raw materials.

532
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,890
I don't regret it,
but it definitely took a lot longer.

533
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,350
The second thing is that I didn't raise
venture funding, I didn't have capital.

534
00:30:45,351 --> 00:30:49,060
So even if you had success just
by not having a lot of cash,

535
00:30:49,061 --> 00:30:51,250
you have to kind of
really slowly chip away.

536
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,610
And that was a big hurdle having patients
because as an entrepreneur you want

537
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:57,760
everything to happen overnight
and just crush it and kill it.

538
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,080
And when you didn't have cash and you had
a big dream of getting people to drink

539
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:04,780
mushrooms and nobody drank mushrooms,
it was like really hard.

540
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,460
So having patients and,

541
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,890
and then figuring out how to scale,
I had initial traction,

542
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:15,040
but how to scale was really
difficult in the beginning. Um,

543
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,820
and then if I say something other than
that is like the flavor was as something

544
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:22,030
that we focused a lot on. And if you
don't have a food or beverage product,

545
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:27,210
just the user ease of user experience is
kind of maybe the touch point is like I

546
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:32,080
as I was so obsessed with the technology
and the ingredients versus not enough

547
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:35,260
with the flavor and the ease of
use straight out of the gates.

548
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,110
And then when I came to the u s the
challenge was being an immigrant.

549
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,940
I've lived in multiple countries,

550
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:42,610
but this is the only country where it
really felt like it was hard to open a

551
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:47,290
bank account. You know, everything
was so difficult and um,

552
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,000
that took a lot of time and it was
harder here to get the initial traction.

553
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,060
But then when it's scaled and scaled more
beautifully, there's just one language.

554
00:31:55,061 --> 00:31:58,470
One currency versus Europe is multiple
languages, multiple, you know,

555
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,650
Lee legally just the hassle,
the u s it was just easier to scale.

556
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:06,190
And I had already thought about that
scaling and what I've would have hoped I

557
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:09,730
focus even more on is sound.
The thing that we,

558
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,320
people think we did really well,

559
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:15,700
but I just think you can never do it well
enough is storytelling and community.

560
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,620
And if you ask people in the industry,

561
00:32:17,621 --> 00:32:19,750
they often know that we
build an awesome community,

562
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:23,320
but I've wished I would have even doubled
down on that and maybe focus a little

563
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:27,430
less on kind of the minutia of,
of,

564
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:32,590
of just like retailers and caring about
the industry stuff, the B2b folk stuff.

565
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:36,430
I should have focused even less on an
even more double down on community and

566
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:41,010
storytelling and, and get those,
those made it even better. So I got,

567
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,520
so I want to sort of silo in on,
on one point there. Yeah. Um,

568
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:49,630
so what would you say was your best
growth channel in that early stage?

569
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:54,560
Was it content? Was it, you know,
building a community? Was it Instagram?

570
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:58,290
Was it purely growth marketing wise?
Um,

571
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,610
our success because we didn't have
money and I couldn't do any, so there,

572
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:06,370
if there's t three types of media, there's
paid, owned and earned. We mostly eat,

573
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,430
killed it with the,

574
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,730
with the earned and through influencers
is because your favorite health

575
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:16,300
influencers, favorite influencer
probably used our products.

576
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,580
It's still today if you think of the
person you go to in health advice,

577
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,480
whoever they go to for health advice,
use our products.

578
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:28,660
And through that we had this constant
and I credibility and like support from

579
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:32,450
people that it really mattered and
that helped us grow into the one phase.

580
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:37,250
And then soon after that, um, we
started winning with like podcasts.

581
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,510
Like that was a big thing for us is
because podcast allowed long form content.

582
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,180
Our topic is not easy.
It's not bullet sizable.

583
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:47,770
You can sell it on as easily on um,
uh,

584
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,140
22nd 15 second Instagram
story or something like that.

585
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:55,220
He requires deeper explaining
and trust. I was like, hey,

586
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:58,190
mushroom coffee sounds gross.
I definitely don't want to try that.

587
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,360
But if somebody you trust says is actually
doesn't taste like mushrooms and it

588
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:05,300
makes me feel awesome, you should
try it, you're more likely to try it.

589
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:09,320
So on the kind of second
wave long forms content,

590
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:12,940
really worked for wealth for
us predominantly podcast,

591
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:17,120
but also long email marketing, blog
post, other educational forums.

592
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,620
But the Spi podcast was,

593
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,270
I think still podcast is so
undervalued as a form of, uh, as a,

594
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:27,070
as a growth way for any, any
product or service. Thank you.

595
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:32,130
Yeah, yeah, I found out
through Tim Ferriss,

596
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:33,860
so now. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

597
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,490
so I'm curious how you were talking about
sourcing and then you also mentioned

598
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:40,950
how,
uh,

599
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,950
large scale mushroom production
kind of lost its nutrition. Um,

600
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,920
and then I was also thinking about,

601
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:51,921
I've read that truffle production is down
about 99% over the last hundred years

602
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,300
due to like too much harvesting of wild
truffles and they're hard to grow in

603
00:34:57,301 --> 00:34:59,400
microrisal and whatnot.
Um,

604
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:04,670
so how do you view a sourcing and
maintaining quality and the sustainability

605
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,433
thereof?

606
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,450
Yeah, definitely. Again, a
topic, thanks for asking. Like,

607
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:12,040
I don't think a lot of
people focus on that.

608
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,850
There's a lot of foods that have become
popular at Saint Chia seeds or Makkah

609
00:35:15,851 --> 00:35:18,550
and then suddenly people like
we can't actually produce that.

610
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:21,760
That would be like Internet kind of
made few things really popular really

611
00:35:21,761 --> 00:35:24,820
quickly.
And agriculture is a slow moving thing.

612
00:35:24,821 --> 00:35:26,260
It's like it doesn't change overnight.

613
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:30,700
You can't just physical
agriculture doesn't, you can't
just, it takes a long time.

614
00:35:30,701 --> 00:35:34,030
And farmers are usually are risk adverse
and a little bit is like they're not

615
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:39,031
going to change their plans
because Instagram influencers
to sell Chia seeds or

616
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:40,080
something like that.

617
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,190
So with mushrooms we were about one
third of our mushrooms are wild crafted,

618
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:49,191
two thirds are grown on
logs and if wildcrafting is
the hardest part and the La

619
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:52,900
growing is the easier part
because it's Super um,

620
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,360
good yield. So dollar per
square feet is a really high,

621
00:35:57,361 --> 00:36:01,530
so you take trees that are already dead
because that's their natural habitat.

622
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,590
A lot of these mushrooms grow on debt
or decaying trees. You drill a hole,

623
00:36:05,591 --> 00:36:09,840
it would a spore and they
will grow a mushroom that
you can for that square food.

624
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:13,800
You can get a lot of money.
So there is that part is a little easier,

625
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,070
especially when you talk to people
who understand what mushrooms to grow.

626
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:20,160
So and mushrooms or extra fields.
So they grow really easily,

627
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,930
is it you just give them
the right environment.

628
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:25,370
So that to third part is the easy that
wildcrafting crafting was the hardest

629
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:27,060
part, right? Because you have to actually,

630
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:30,870
somebody needs to go to the forest and
pick up a piece of Chaga to get this.

631
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,360
And I could talk for this for hours.
Um,

632
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:36,900
the one benefit we had is Finland is
a small country, but it's bordering.

633
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,801
I used to have the,

634
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:41,160
one of the biggest economic borders in
the world between Finland and Russia and

635
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:44,610
Russia starting from thin than they have
just happens to have the largest force

636
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:46,830
in the world called Taiga,
ta Iga.

637
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:51,990
And that's a forest size of United States.
So one forest size of United States,

638
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:52,680
right.

639
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,680
And that forest is predominantly perfect
for a birch tree that happens to grow

640
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,470
Chaga and he happens to
grow pretty much everywhere.

641
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,820
And you just need to kind of know
where it grows and how to collect it.

642
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,510
But it's more like
education on harvesters and,

643
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,250
and telling them where to
get in and how to get it.

644
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:15,780
That was like operational and it a
little bit more difficult. Um, but yeah,

645
00:37:15,781 --> 00:37:19,050
it takes a lot of thinking and
most people don't focus on it.

646
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:22,260
They just read on our block that
outside berries, good for you.

647
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,480
And then let's say a loss Iberia.

648
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:27,150
And they don't never think about the
supply chain until they're much later in

649
00:37:27,151 --> 00:37:27,984
the process.

650
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,400
And this is even with college and right
now there's like most college and brands

651
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:32,760
are,

652
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,910
they don't have enough college and to
sell because college has become popular.

653
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,640
And I don't know if you know
how you may collagen basically,

654
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:43,641
usually a boy like the hides and the bones
and you kind of skim the cream on the

655
00:37:44,521 --> 00:37:46,530
top and it's like a quite the process and,

656
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,970
and it was just the waste product before
Kiner and now it's become like every

657
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,800
um,
yeah,

658
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:55,650
beauty person is trying to use college
and every athlete's trying to use college

659
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:59,280
and as the p the demand just went sky
high and few years and people are like,

660
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:00,750
hey,
we don't have enough of this.

661
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:05,160
So now they have trying to figure out how
else can we produce Collagen. So yeah,

662
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,600
most entrepreneurs don't think about that.
So thanks for asking that. Thank you.

663
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,880
I love this by the way,
you can throw it.

664
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,580
Thanks for your talk has
been really interesting. Um,

665
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,590
how do you go about picking which
mushrooms are going to end up in,

666
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,740
in the te products or
the coffee products and,

667
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,980
and how do you figure out what the
benefits are that you can advertise

668
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,470
associated with the
mushrooms that you've picked?

669
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:37,840
Sure. So that's actually easier than
with most food products with mushrooms.

670
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:40,800
Because you have to cook them
cause they're not bioavailable raw.

671
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,990
It's like a rock. There's few
outside if you want to try them.

672
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,630
So you have to cook them kind
of like you would do bone broth.

673
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,890
So you do this like decoction so you cook
it for a long time and because you can

674
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:55,360
control the temperature and the amount
of mushrooms you can standardize your

675
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:56,350
certain strength.

676
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,580
So it's almost like cooking it for
days to a standardize it to a certain

677
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:04,780
strength of coffee and it's a very easy
lab test just to make you have a strong

678
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:05,350
enough team.

679
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:09,170
So some years you have to
use more mushrooms than
other times and sometimes you

680
00:39:09,171 --> 00:39:09,940
can use less.

681
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,840
Sometimes we have to cook it longer or
shorter so you can just control the,

682
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,980
the process to get standardized output.
So yeah,

683
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,090
it's actually that part is quite easy
to engineer but you just need to,

684
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:25,750
sometimes you have more mushrooms so
sometimes we're more profitable than other

685
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:26,051
times.

686
00:39:26,051 --> 00:39:28,990
I guess that's the other way to say it
is sometimes it costs more to make that

687
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,190
cup and sometimes less.

688
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,150
And then for figuring out like
what the health benefits are,

689
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,830
is that like historically based
like yeah, traditions. Yeah.

690
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:40,500
And if I may comment on that,
that's a,

691
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,260
that's a common theme that I hope us as
a consumers will be more educated on is

692
00:39:44,261 --> 00:39:46,060
we want everything standardized.

693
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,450
And I don't think nature works like
that our product is standardized,

694
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:54,070
but I would hope that we as consumers
can accept the fact that sometimes that

695
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,490
the nutrient density of the food we
buys higher or lower depending on

696
00:39:57,491 --> 00:39:58,840
seasonality and what you eat.

697
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,620
And I think us expecting always to
get the same flavor, same result,

698
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,090
is forcing us to eat actually worst
food because then the producers have to

699
00:40:07,091 --> 00:40:08,860
produce a product like that.

700
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,700
The apple to always taste the same and
it's just nature doesn't work like that.

701
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:17,701
So if we can accept some variability
in flavor and nutrient density,

702
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,080
as long as we know the baseline,

703
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:24,040
a sourcing that will be actually better
for the world than always expecting the

704
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:27,550
chocolate to taste the exactly the same
because even chocolate has seasonal

705
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:31,990
variety. But to your second question
about nutrient density. So, um,

706
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,730
the benefit of mushrooms is that about
40% of pharmaceuticals use mushrooms.

707
00:40:36,731 --> 00:40:40,510
So there's, there's a lot of research
funding for fungal research. Um,

708
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,050
this is unfortunately, there's not a
lot of research funding for whole foods.

709
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:48,790
So of all foods, even let's say
blueberry, which is people generally,

710
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:52,000
everybody knows it's healthy
and it's very, it's been a
long time. It's research.

711
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:55,150
There isn't that much research on
blueberries, you know, cause it,

712
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:59,770
who would fund that? There's no economic
interest on blueberry research. A,

713
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:03,910
if somebody research booberry they want
to isolate a compound and I'm the CNN in

714
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:06,280
the blueberry that is good for eyesight.

715
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:10,090
And then we'll brand it us the Laskin
on the CNN and they will put it in

716
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:11,590
supplements and sell it.
But,

717
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:16,180
so that whole food research by at large
is so limited versus something that you

718
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:18,250
can patent because you
can't pass in whole foods.

719
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,190
But lucky enough because mushrooms,
there is a lot more of them.

720
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:25,240
I would recommend if you want to look
at any food product pup met is kind of a

721
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:27,070
database for various just research.

722
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:29,710
You can put the Latin name
of any food you can get.

723
00:41:29,711 --> 00:41:33,890
Roughly the amount of research than
fact that there's 5,000 research papers

724
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:37,100
doesn't mean it's healthy. You know,
the most research fruits in the world,

725
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:40,550
our tobacco number one and
marijuana and number two. Um,

726
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:43,940
soon after that you get to things like
lemon and Ginseng and other things like

727
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:47,060
that. So it doesn't guarantee if something
is well researched that it's healthy,

728
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:50,600
but it gives you a pretty good oversight
or what it is good for. And Mushrooms,

729
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:55,040
she talky Rishi, things like
that are very well studied. Um,

730
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:58,010
so you look at their general research
and you figure out that they're good for

731
00:41:58,011 --> 00:42:02,510
like maintaining a blood glucose levels.
They're good for gut health.

732
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:07,610
You kind of like give oversight and
then we make first just to be safe side,

733
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:08,750
we make buffery claims.

734
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:12,740
So instead of saying is that you will be
smarter when you consume our products,

735
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,580
we say, hey, this is like
a hug from your grandma.

736
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,060
And then you can do
the rest. But um, yeah,

737
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:23,510
it's baseline on just heart science on uh,
um,

738
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,620
a genus of anything. And then looking
at what is it generally good for,

739
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:30,890
how well is it's research who
researched it, how they researched it,

740
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:35,660
and then you kind of try to apply it
into a food product. Um, but yeah,

741
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:40,690
I mean just unfortunately there just
isn't a lot of whole food research since

742
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,300
you can't own that research, you can't
patent it. So, right. So challenge

743
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,430
one if you want to,

744
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm just curious to know
about your mushroom diet,

745
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:59,900
like how you use these products and what
kind of mushrooms they use and how do

746
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:01,790
you cook them and all that kind of stuff.

747
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,880
So I don't answer that question partly
ever including I don't answer how I eat

748
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:10,520
because people want a shortcut and how
I eat is not necessarily how you should

749
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:14,210
eat or how I use mushrooms
is not necessarily how you
should use mushrooms. Also,

750
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:17,870
how I use mushrooms in February,
2019 is not hot necessarily.

751
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:22,040
I'll use them in March. March is a
busier month for me than February.

752
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,910
So maybe when I'm busy I have to use
different things to support my busy

753
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:30,200
lifestyle. Right. Um, I had
that one slide somewhere here.

754
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:34,290
Give you a rough idea of timeframes.

755
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:35,900
So generally speaking,

756
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:40,100
like you don't necessarily want caffeine
in the morning because your cortisol

757
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:42,800
already spikes.
A lot of people love it as a method,

758
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,490
but you're naturally should be energetic.
You should probably go outside,

759
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:48,380
get some fresh air,
maybe move a little bit,

760
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,120
but you want to hydrate and you probably
want antioxidants like a shield,

761
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,690
a bodyguard for the day.

762
00:43:53,691 --> 00:43:58,691
So mushrooms like Chaga and
she to that have a lot of sod.

763
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:01,820
Super Oxide dismutase is
this super antioxidant.

764
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,050
Using things like that might be really
good for the day to kind of get started.

765
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:10,190
And then in the afternoon when you need
a little pick me up using something like

766
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:14,360
lion's mane that boost cognitive function
or using something like core to steps

767
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:17,960
that gives you energy without caffeine
or sugar might be a good idea.

768
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,350
When you naturally get that
little dip in the afternoon,

769
00:44:21,351 --> 00:44:23,930
the best scenario is you
taking a nap or a Siesta.

770
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,440
But if that's not possible because of
work, maybe try something like that.

771
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,930
And then the evening time
you one things that um,

772
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:33,330
support somehow kind of
calming down process.

773
00:44:33,331 --> 00:44:38,150
So Rishi is used for kind of like kind
of the endocrine system, the HPA axis,

774
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,240
kind of calming your body.

775
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:42,810
It's known as the Queen of Mushrooms
maybe will help you reach deeper sleep.

776
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:46,770
And then she talked a good help with
phase one and two liver detox that often

777
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:47,670
happens over night.

778
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:50,460
So that might be a good strategy
if you want to cleanse your liver.

779
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:53,130
Liver is a kind of a mirror
to skin health as well.

780
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:55,620
So there are different
times how you can use it.

781
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,920
I just never answered how I use it.
You just have to figure out yourself.

782
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,490
I know it's not the answer people want
because they want to formula do a,

783
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:07,050
B and c, but uh, maybe that
gives you some framework. Yeah.

784
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:08,430
I wasn't looking for a formula.

785
00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:13,431
I was just curious how you apply
this a lot different ways and uh,

786
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,340
yeah, and high quality. That's my three,

787
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:23,470
four thanks varieties,
huge bubble.

788
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:28,050
Even if you can have an adaptogen, you
can use everyday varieties. Awesome.

789
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:29,610
So even with dark leafy Greens,

790
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,220
even if it Rugal is awesome
or dandelion is awesome,

791
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,700
try all kinds of Greens and just
kind of mixed them, match them.

792
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:38,730
And same with mushrooms.
It's beneficial to mix and match them.

793
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,660
And so even though I'm not a fan of
Portabella, you can still have it, uh,

794
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:45,900
just get different varieties into a
system. And the more variety you have,

795
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:49,470
the more intelligence you're
getting from food into your, uh,

796
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:53,790
into your cells and into
your DNA. Yeah. Sorry,

797
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,810
I might've missed this when you
were talking about scaling, but, uh,

798
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,580
in terms of a timeline, uh,
I was wondering what was the,

799
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:06,780
how long did it take for you
to go from zero or not zero,

800
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:11,781
but like a product idea to get like a
package product ready for the market?

801
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:16,560
Um, it took about two years on the
first time because you have to solve the

802
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:21,510
operational challenges, which
is, is harder for me than
the, the product concept.

803
00:46:21,511 --> 00:46:23,520
So the first time sourcing ingredients,

804
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,160
getting a partner who
can make the packaging.

805
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:31,050
That took a lot longer than coming out
with the wisdom and the vision and the

806
00:46:31,051 --> 00:46:34,950
use case. So that was easier for me. But
maybe for another founder it's different.

807
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:37,710
But if you've never done food
or beverage manufacturing,

808
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:42,060
I highly recommend having patients that
he might take a lot longer to actually

809
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:45,540
get the product produced than you think.
If you have a donut that everybody,

810
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:48,540
all your neighbors love your donut and
your friends and family and saying,

811
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:51,420
you should make this donut. It's
a hit, it's a great doughnut.

812
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,390
And then you figure out that you've been
making at home and now you need an FDA

813
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:57,840
approved commercial kitchen or
contract manufacturer to make it.

814
00:46:57,841 --> 00:46:59,760
It could take a lot longer than you think.

815
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:04,530
So it took about two years
to get the first version out.

816
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:06,870
Partly was my incompetent,
like not just me,

817
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:09,600
just not knowing enough of the details.

818
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:14,130
It probably takes about a
year and normally just to
cut every paperwork in order.

819
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,310
And for me it took two years just because
I didn't know all the details too.

820
00:47:17,311 --> 00:47:19,860
Like did you have to
do most of it yourself?

821
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:23,640
Or they're like contractors that do it.
Like a bunch of different,

822
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:28,170
I had to do most with myself and my
founding team because nobody had done what

823
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:31,090
we did. Nobody had done a dual
extracted Warcraft and mushroom.

824
00:47:31,091 --> 00:47:33,220
Nobody had done it so they
have to figure that out.

825
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:35,680
Nobody had done these
packaged mushroom beverages.

826
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,470
They were sold in capsules
or in big ground bag.

827
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:41,920
So I have to figure out how to book these
mushroom powders in packets that look

828
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:46,360
like almost like emergency or a tea back
that you can just pour in a cup and add

829
00:47:46,361 --> 00:47:49,690
hot water. I got to figure out that
kind of stuff and there wasn't,

830
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,510
but if you ever think of
doing a dietary supplement,

831
00:47:52,511 --> 00:47:55,000
there's like hundreds of
companies that can help do it.

832
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:58,300
If you want to make a beverage yourself,
there's hundreds of companies making it.

833
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:03,340
I would just highly recommend is that
don't outsource r and d and IP fully to

834
00:48:03,341 --> 00:48:06,940
someone ever. Like, even if you use
their resources for certain things,

835
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:11,941
always have really engage you or someone
else in the team really engaged in that

836
00:48:12,281 --> 00:48:14,230
process. So you know, a how it's done.

837
00:48:14,231 --> 00:48:16,990
So it's easier for you to
sell on marketing because
you know, it was like, Hey,

838
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:21,220
is it you?
How has this natural orange flavor made?

839
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:24,570
Is it from a squeeze from an orange or
how do we get this orange flavor into

840
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:27,400
your product? That's like a
question somebody might ask you.

841
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:29,770
So you know the answer. But
second, the as well as like,

842
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:33,160
then you own the technology because in
food and beverage there really isn't the

843
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:36,460
same way quarter technology
and that you have and in it,

844
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,510
so be really engaged. And there's
definitely a lot of resources for beauty,

845
00:48:40,511 --> 00:48:43,600
skincare, protein, food
and beverage. Just for me,

846
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:47,030
there wasn't because nobody
had done what we did. Yeah.

847
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,390
Okay.
Last one.

848
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,820
Just when it comes at you catch it.

849
00:48:55,120 --> 00:49:00,070
So you've talked about mushrooms,
you know, breathing and uh,

850
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:03,520
and the eating and being a smarter food.
Um,

851
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,480
are you saying that mushrooms have like a,

852
00:49:06,481 --> 00:49:09,400
a type of consciousness
that is measurable?

853
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,590
Yes,
that's what I'm exactly saying.

854
00:49:12,591 --> 00:49:15,140
And you can measure it and they've
measured it multiple times.

855
00:49:15,141 --> 00:49:19,190
They put mushrooms in a maze and funny
enough the mushroom finds its way out of

856
00:49:19,191 --> 00:49:19,940
the maze.

857
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:24,140
They put mushrooms to figure out how
to build that their subway system in in

858
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:29,141
Tokyo or actually the railway system in
the UK and the mushroom figured out how

859
00:49:29,151 --> 00:49:33,980
to build a railway system more efficient
than what humans had built. So yes,

860
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:34,820
it is measurable.

861
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,820
I also think that the most interesting
intelligence that mushroom have of global

862
00:49:40,131 --> 00:49:43,070
consciousness is not measurable
and we have no clue of it.

863
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:46,400
And I think we will not have a
cool of it for a long, long time.

864
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:51,350
And that will be a whole nother talk
about the consciousness of mushrooms.

865
00:49:51,351 --> 00:49:54,800
But yes, I think they're higher beanie.
I'm just leaving you with a nugget.

866
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:59,830
Planting a seed is that mushrooms almost
always live with bacteria and bacteria

867
00:50:01,341 --> 00:50:03,110
almost always lives with mushrooms.

868
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,830
So right now in your body there's about
10 times more bacteria than you have

869
00:50:06,831 --> 00:50:07,850
cells in your body.

870
00:50:07,851 --> 00:50:12,851
And there's a lot of cells and almost
always this bacteria lives with mushrooms.

871
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,460
If you take Kombucha,
it's a symbiotic organism,

872
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:19,760
basically brewed black tea with a
little bit of sugar that interacts with

873
00:50:19,761 --> 00:50:24,230
bacteria and fungi. If you
think of fermented foods,
Sauerkraut, Kimchi, whatever,

874
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:28,940
and right now we've talked about how your
gut is your second brain or your first

875
00:50:28,941 --> 00:50:33,140
brain, how we talk about your
gut instinct, your spider sense,

876
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,340
how you just know something, you can't
explain it in words, but you feel it,

877
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:41,450
you know it.
And it's often related to your gut biome,

878
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,790
which is now a big research topic.

879
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:48,050
And how that got biome is actually tied
into probiotics and prebiotics and how

880
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:52,220
those prebiotics live with the bacterial
kingdom and the fungal kingdom.

881
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,400
And they have knowledge that
we've yet to figure out.

882
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:57,380
And I think that knowledge
is much greater than us.

883
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:02,390
And they found mushrooms growing
at every level of the atmosphere.

884
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,490
Mushrooms can survive in space.

885
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,690
So they've traveled a long
ways and different places.

886
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,660
And I think I'll probably,

887
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,570
I don't think during my lifetime
we'll figure out that intelligence,

888
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,390
but I do believe that one of the things
that will happen during my lifetime is

889
00:51:17,391 --> 00:51:20,150
we'll find the seventh kingdom in biology.

890
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:24,110
I think there'll be a new kingdom that
is not named yet and that kingdom will be

891
00:51:24,111 --> 00:51:25,640
somehow related to the,

892
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,380
to the yeast or the collaboration
between bacteria and fungi.

893
00:51:30,381 --> 00:51:34,340
And we'll figure out a new kingdom lives
on this planet because back in the day

894
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,420
there was not six kingdoms,

895
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:38,810
there was two and then there
was three and there's four,

896
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,130
there's five now there's six.

897
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:43,310
And we think biology's come to its end
and there's six kingdoms. And I think I,

898
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:46,700
my believe is that we'll find
a seventh one. And with that,

899
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:49,010
thanks for coming and

900
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,010
I appreciate you sharing my knowledge.

901
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:54,510
Tara,
really quickly,

902
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:59,580
where can people find you and more
about your product and yeah, I,

903
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,310
we have a easiest is
actually if you're here,

904
00:52:02,311 --> 00:52:06,090
we have a shop on Abbot Kinney called the
shrimp room that serves free beverages.

905
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:08,520
I know to here at Google is free as well,

906
00:52:08,521 --> 00:52:10,350
but if you want to walk on Abbot Kinney,

907
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:13,510
you didn't get a free
mushroom tonic anytime. Um,

908
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:18,540
we are also an all social channels,
uh, at four sigmatic, f. O, u.

909
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:22,380
R. S. I. G. M. A. T. I see.
I'm a little bit hard to find,

910
00:52:22,381 --> 00:52:26,250
but I have a really bad Instagram called
I am Taro that you're going to follow

911
00:52:26,251 --> 00:52:31,140
my adventures. I post rarely and
randomly, sometimes good stuff,

912
00:52:31,141 --> 00:52:34,590
sometimes not so good stuff.
So that's kind of where you can find us.

913
00:52:34,591 --> 00:52:35,940
But a stop by the Abbot Kinney,

914
00:52:35,941 --> 00:52:39,000
you can find us on whole foods Erewhon
different places here in as well.

915
00:52:39,001 --> 00:52:43,320
If you want to buy it, Amazon
foursigmatic.com we'll figure it out.

916
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,090
Anyway,
thank you.

917
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:48,040
Sorry.
